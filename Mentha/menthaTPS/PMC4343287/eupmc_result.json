Biosynthesis of functionally diverse sesquiterpenes is dependent on the availability of a pool of the precursor farnesyldiphosphate (FDP). In Arabidopsis thaliana, FPS2, encoding cytosolic farnesyldiphosphate synthase, is implicated in the synthesis of cytosolic FDP, but it is not known whether enhanced levels of FDP have a commensurate effect on sesquiterpene-mediated defence responses. This study examined transgenic arabidopsis plants generated to over-express FPS2 in order to determine if any effects could be observed in the response of aphids, Myzus persicae.<h4>Methods</h4>Transgenic arabidopsis plants were generated to over-express FPS2 to produce FPS2 in either the cytosol or the chloroplasts. Morphochemical analyses of the transgenic plants were carried out to detremine growth responses of roots and shoots, and for GC-MS profiling of sesquiterpenes. Aphid response to hyrdo-distillate extracts and head-space volatiles from transgenic plants was assessed using a bioassay.<h4>Key results</h4>Either over-expression of FPS2 in the cytosol or targetting of its translated product to chlorplasts resulted in stimulatory growth responses of transgenic arabidopsis at early and late developmental stages. GC-MS analysis of hydro-distillate extracts from aerial parts of the plants revealed biosynthesis of several novel sesquiterpenes, including E-\u03b2-farnesene, an alarm pheromone of aphids. Both entrapped volatiles and hydro-distillate extracts of the transgenic leaves triggered agitation in aphids, which was related to both time and dose of exposure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Over-expression of FPS2 in the cytosol and targeting of its translated product to chloroplasts in arabidopsis led to synthesis of several novel sesquiterpenes, including E-\u03b2-farnesene, and induced alarm responses in M. persicae.
