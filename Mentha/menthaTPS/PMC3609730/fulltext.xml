Several enzymes of the chloroplastic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway are hypothesised to act as bottlenecks to the production of monoterpenes. We investigated, whether transcript abundance of genes encoding for enzymes of the MEP pathway were correlated with foliar terpenes in <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> using a population of 48 individuals that ranged in their oil concentration from 39 -122 mg.g DM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Our study shows that most genes in the MEP pathway are co-regulated and that the expression of multiple genes within the MEP pathway is correlated with oil yield. Using multiple regression analysis, variation in expression of MEP pathway genes explained 87% of variation in foliar monoterpene concentrations.

Many of the species grown for essential oils occur as different chemotypes (discontinuous variations in the oil profile: <xref rid="pone.0060631-Keszei1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>), but selection of the desirable chemotype can be readily monitored by gas chromatography and is rarely a major factor detracting from profitability. In contrast, improving the oil yield of essential oil crops relies on a long process of traditional breeding and in the case of tree crops, this can require many years before production. Recent advances in genomics offer the possibility of identifying the genes and gene variants that are responsible for high yields of essential oils, so significantly shortening the breeding process.</p><p>Medicinal tea tree (<italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> Cheel) is a small Myrtaceous tree with sub-dermal foliar oil glands <xref rid="pone.0060631-List1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> containing a valuable essential oil dominated by monoterpenes <xref rid="pone.0060631-Keszei2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Tea tree oil has wide-ranging antifungal and antibacterial actions and is incorporated into many cosmetic products <xref rid="pone.0060631-Hart1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060631-Carson1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Six essential oil chemotypes have been identified in medicinal tea tree <xref rid="pone.0060631-Keszei2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060631-Butcher1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, but the only one sought by the tea tree industry is that dominated by the monoterpene terpinen-4-ol, which is derived from the spontaneous rearrangement of sabinene hydrate, which in turn is produced by a single terpene synthase <xref rid="pone.0060631-Keszei2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although the terpinen-4-ol chemotype shows a four-fold variation in oil yield <xref rid="pone.0060631-Homer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> other chemotypes have a higher overall oil concentration. In <italic>M. alternifolia</italic>, the narrow-sense heritability of foliar oil concentration is high (&#x0223c;0.7) suggesting that genetic control of oil yield is significant <xref rid="pone.0060631-Butcher2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>The production of terpenes in plants involves several distinct metabolic pathways and the genes in these pathways have been well studied in model species. The two main pathways, the Mevalonic acid pathway (MVA) in the cytosol and the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway (MEP) in the plastid are spatially separated within the cell. A recent review <xref rid="pone.0060631-Hemmerlin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>suggests that both pathways generally operate independently. While independence is the &#x0201c;rule&#x0201d; cross-talk and transport of MEP derived isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP) to the cytosol has been demonstrated on a number of occasions <xref rid="pone.0060631-Dudareva1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060631-Kasahara1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060631-Kasahara2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060631-SkorupinskaTudek1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060631-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Monoterpenes, the major constituents of <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> leaf essential oil are synthesised via IPP derived from the MEP pathway, which is likely to have the largest effect on essential oil yield. Potential bottlenecks to flux through the pathway have been identified. In particular, the early steps of the MEPpathway have been identified as constraints to yield of terpene-rich essential oils. Over-expression of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) in peppermint (<italic>Mentha piperita</italic>) led to plants accumulating 40% more oils in their glandular trichomes relative to the wild-type <xref rid="pone.0060631-Wildung1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Over-expression of DXR and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> expressing Taxadiene synthase (35S:TXS) led to a several fold increased accumulation of taxadiene (a diterpene) over plants just expressing Taxadiene synthase, <xref rid="pone.0060631-CarreteroPaulet1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and over-expression of DXS in tomato, resulted in a 60% increase in isoprenoids <xref rid="pone.0060631-Enfissi1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In grape (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>), <italic>dxs</italic> co-localizes with a major QTL for the accumulation of three monoterpenes (linalool, nerol and geraniol) <xref rid="pone.0060631-Battilana1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In glandular trichomes of basil (<italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>) transcript and protein abundance as well as enzyme activity of DXS and DXR correlate with oil yield <xref rid="pone.0060631-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. While DXS and DXR are the most likely bottlenecks in the MEP pathway, the over-expression of 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase (HDR) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> results in a large increase in carotenoids <xref rid="pone.0060631-BotellaPavia1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Other genes may also be important; in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, all MEP pathway transcripts are up-regulated upon exposure to light <xref rid="pone.0060631-Cordoba1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and in Norway spruce (<italic>Picea abies</italic>), four genes that were investigated, <italic>dxs, dxr,</italic> 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate synthase (<italic>hds</italic>) and <italic>hdr</italic> were all up-regulated upon induction by a range of treatments <xref rid="pone.0060631-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Furthermore, in <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> we discovered several allelic variants in <italic>hds</italic> and <italic>hdr</italic> that associated with foliar concentrations of the monoterpene 1,8-cineole <xref rid="pone.0060631-Klheim1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Based on these results, it is likely that the control of flux through the terpene biosynthesis pathway is controlled at many different levels. Previous work in model plants has provided some clues as to how this may be controlled between individuals in controlled environments, but to date there has been no work into how this variation is controlled in wild populations.</p><p>This study investigated the control of quantitative variation in the yield of essential oils in a wild plant population. We have quantified transcript abundance from genes leading to the synthesis of both mono- and sesquiterpenes in leaves from 48 individuals of <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> that vary widely in their concentration of oils.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plant Material</title><p>Samples from <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> plants for this study were collected from a New South Wales Department of Primary Industry (NSW DPI) experimental site at Ballina in Northern NSW (28.52.00 S; 153.34.00 E).

In this study we investigated the genetic control of terpene yield from the Australian Myrtaceae species <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>.</p><p>The first step of the MEP pathway, which catalyses the conversion of pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1-deoxyxylylose 5-phosphate (DXS), has been the focus of most studies to date <xref rid="pone.0060631-Cordoba1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and was the first step of the pathway that was discovered <xref rid="pone.0060631-Sprenger1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Much evidence has accumulated to show that this enzyme is the rate-limiting step of the pathway (reviewed in Introduction). Some reports have focused on the gene expression of all genes in the MEP pathway upon abiotic stimulus, finding for example that light induces all seven steps of the pathway and that each gene is under the control of a circadian signal <xref rid="pone.0060631-Cordoba1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> or that sucrose induced gene expression in the pathway <xref rid="pone.0060631-Hsieh1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. We focused on the expression of these genes in a natural population of plants with a large sink (foliar terpenes that accumulate in the glands) for the MEP pathway. Our results indicate that a general signal exists that regulates the expression of each pathway gene with the exception of <italic>mct</italic>. Either <italic>mct</italic> is not regulated through this signal or our assay was non-functional.</p><p>The first aim of this study was to identify correlations between the transcript abundance of candidate genes and terpene traits. Our analysis revealed strong co-expression of genes within the MEP pathway of the chloroplast. Five out of seven transcripts from this pathway (plus geranyl pyrophosphate synthase, <italic>gpps</italic>) had similar relative transcript abundances. The expression of one gene, <italic>mct</italic>, did not correlate with any other genes and <italic>dxs3</italic>, one of the three copies of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase did not cluster with other MEP pathway genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0060631-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests <italic>dxs3</italic>, which is likely in a different clade, is not directly involved in foliar monoterpene biosynthesis and is performing a different function within the plant. The pattern of expression suggests that there is a common factor that regulates transcription within the MEP pathway and extends the list of genes that have a significant impact on yield of terpenes (<italic>dxs, dxr, hdr, gpps</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0060631-Wildung1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060631-CarreteroPaulet1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060631-BotellaPavia1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0060631-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Within the cytosolic MVA pathway, co-expression was less striking, but still significant and in addition, we observed correlations in the expression of genes between the MEP and MVA pathways albeit to a lesser extent than within each pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0060631.s004">Table S3</xref>).</p><p>Several studies (reviewed in the Introduction) have shown that the expression of <italic>dxr</italic> and <italic>dxs</italic> have a strong influence on terpenoid oil yield.

Given the correlation of the genes within the MEP pathway, we cannot say which genes may or may not be more important in controlling flux through the pathway. It also means that individual gene to trait correlations are of limited predictive utility. This raises the question as to whether <italic>dxs</italic> and <italic>dxr</italic> are such significant &#x0201c;bottlenecks&#x0201d; in the MEP pathway as has previously been supposed. Although it is clear from other studies that both <italic>dxs</italic> and <italic>dxr</italic> are significantly correlated with terpene yield, ours is the first analysis of the whole pathway and it is possible that the more extensive patterns of co-expression might be found with a similar broader analysis of other systems. It is possible that <italic>dxs</italic> and <italic>dxr</italic> could act either as bottlenecks or their over-expression could initiate regulatory cascades that result in the up-regulation of other transcripts within the pathway. Drawing strong conclusions about the mechanisms that control flux in <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> from our data are further complicated by the fact <italic>dxs</italic> is post transcriptionally regulated in other species <xref rid="pone.0060631-Wildung1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and that protein levels don't always relate to transcript abundance. While the data makes it clear that transcript levels of the genes within the MEP pathway have an effect on yield in <italic>M. alternifolia</italic>, the exact mechanisms that lead to this result are not obvious at this stage.</p><p>The multiple regression approach employed here gives a much more realistic picture than single gene regressions of the importance of interactions between multiple genes in both the MEP and MVA pathways and the variations in the yield of mono- and sesquiterpenes. The results show that transcript abundance of MEP pathway transcripts explains a large amount of the variation in foliar oil yield we observed. Given that the oil profile of <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> is dominated by monoterpenes, the variations in MEP pathway genes are the most important determinant of overall oil yield and in particular the yield of components (&#x0201c;terpinen-4-ol +&#x0201d;) that are sought by industry. This indicates that expression differences between individuals are likely to be an important determinant in differing oil yields.</p><p>Our results also provide strong evidence that sesquiterpenes in <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> are, at least in part, synthesized from IPP derived from the MEP pathway. Unidirectional transport of IPP from the plastid to the cytosol has been demonstrated using labeled precursors in a number of other species such as spinach, kale and Indian mustard <xref rid="pone.0060631-Bick1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, snapdragon <xref rid="pone.0060631-Dudareva1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0060631-Laule1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, but not in tomato trichomes <xref rid="pone.0060631-Besser1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The amount of IPP that is transported differs widely in those species that have been examined. For example in snapdragon, IPP from the plastid is used for the biosynthesis of 100% of sesquiterpenes, while in <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> only small amounts of plastid derived IPP are used in sesquiterpene synthesis <xref rid="pone.0060631-Arigoni1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In order to show what proportion of IPP from the chloroplast is incorporated into sesquiterpenes, experiments with labeled intermediates for both the MVA and MEP pathway need to be undertaken <xref rid="pone.0060631-Dudareva1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Our data does suggest that a significant amount of IPP originates from the chloroplast with explanatory values for correlation of MVA genes being about three times lower than for MEP pathway genes and there was no evidence of any IPP transport from the cytosol to the chloroplast.</p><p>These results pave the way for further improving essential oil yield in medicinal tea tree. Because of the low linkage disequilibrium in forest trees, a candidate gene approach in association mapping to detect alleles in genes of the MEP and MVA pathway will be an important first step. However, the extent of co-regulation of MEP pathway genes means that selection made on only one or two alleles might be insufficient to drive sustained increases in oil yield. Identifying the putative transcriptional regulators that control the whole pathway will be necessary to understand how to select for increased flux through the whole MEP pathway and how this translates into greater yield for the benefit of the tea tree industry.</p><p>The Australian Myrtaceae <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> is an ideal study object for the control of terpene yield. Our collection of 200 individuals showed a three-fold variation in total terpene yield and more than four-fold variation of the major constituent terpinen-4-ol. In order to identify the regulatory mechanisms of this variation, we quantified transcripts abundance in 48 individuals from the MEP and MVA pathways as well as genes that act downstream towards the biosynthesis of terpenes. Our data show that the expression of genes from the MEP pathway, as well as <italic>gpps</italic> is positively correlated to monoterpene yield and that the expression of these genes is strongly inter-correlated. Both MEP and MVA pathway genes are predictors of sesquiterpene concentration, providing evidence for export of isopentyl diphosphate from the chloroplast to the cytosol in this species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0060631.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Agarose gel images showing separation of RNA from 48 samples of <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> used in this study.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0060631.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0060631.s002"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>List of diagnostic primers for quantitative real-time PCR.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0060631.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0060631.s003"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>C<sub>T</sub> values for each sample and diagnostic primer pair with standard deviation.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0060631.s003.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0060631.s004"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>Simple linear regression analysis between terpene traits.
