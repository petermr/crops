Essential oils such as oregano and cinnamon are known for their effect against bacteria, fungi, and even viruses. The mechanism of action is proposed to be related to membrane and external cell structures, including cell walls. This study aimed to evaluate the biological activity of seven essential oils and eight of their major components against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, filamentous fungi, and protozoans. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by determination of the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration for <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium, <i>Shigella sonnei</i>, <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, <i>Aspergillus ochraceus</i>, <i>Alternaria alternata,</i> and <i>Fusarium oxysporium</i>, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) for <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> and <i>Leishmania mexicana</i>, and the median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) for <i>Giardia lamblia</i>. Results showed that oregano essential oil showed the best antibacterial activity (66-100 \u00b5g/mL), while cinnamon essential oil had the best fungicidal activity (66-116 \u00b5g/mL), and both showed excellent antiprotozoal activity (22-108 \u00b5g/mL). Regarding the major components, thymol and carvacrol were also good antimicrobials (23-200 \u00b5g/mL), and cinnamaldehyde was an antifungal compound (41-75 \u00b5g/mL). The major components were grouped according to their chemical structure as phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, and terpinenes. The statistical analysis of the grouped data demonstrated that protozoans were more susceptible to the essential oils, followed by fungi, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The analysis for the major components showed that the most resistant microbial group was fungi, which was followed by bacteria, and protozoans were also more susceptible. Principal Component Analysis for the essential oils demonstrated the relationship between the biological activity and the microbial group tested, with the first three components explaining 94.3% of the data variability. The chemical structure of the major components was also related to the biological activity presented against the microbial groups tested, where the three first principal components accounted for 91.9% of the variability. The external structures and the characteristics of the cell membranes in the different microbial groups are determinant for their susceptibility to essential oils and their major components.", "affiliation": "Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Chihuahua, Circuito Universitario S/N, 31125 Chihuahua, Mexico.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": {"grantId": "S.A.O.
