Volatility and instability are problems for deployment in agriculture but could be solved by expressing genes for the biosynthesis of pheromones in the crop plants. This has now been achieved by genetically engineering a hexaploid variety of wheat to release (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-farnesene (<italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f), the alarm pheromone for many pest aphids, using a synthetic gene based on a sequence from peppermint with a plastid targeting amino acid sequence, with or without a gene for biosynthesis of the precursor farnesyl diphosphate. Pure <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f was produced in stably transformed wheat lines with no other detectable phenotype but requiring targeting of the gene produced to the plastid. In laboratory behavioural assays, three species of cereal aphids were repelled and foraging was increased for a parasitic natural enemy. Although these studies show considerable potential for aphid control, field trials employing the single and double constructs showed no reduction in aphids or increase in parasitism. Insect numbers were low and climatic conditions erratic suggesting the need for further trials or a closer imitation, in the plant, of alarm pheromone release.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Insect pheromones, such as the aphid alarm pheromone and other types of behaviour modifying semiochemicals, have long been considered as potential alternatives to current use of broad spectrum eradicant pesticides having toxic modes of action. Although formulations have been designed to accommodate intrinsic high volatility and instability, use in broad-acre agriculture remains limited and costly, aggravated by problems of chemical synthesis and purity. However, production and release from crop plants could solve these problems and create a sustainable pest management approach not requiring seasonal application and its associated carbon footprint. Biotechnological production of moth pheromones by transient expression of synthetic genes in plants has recently been demonstrated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p><p>For many species of pest aphids (Homoptera: Aphididae), the alarm pheromone comprises the sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-farnesene (<italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, which causes dispersal and repellency, and also increases foraging by natural enemies of aphids such as parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), and predators<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>.

Modification of a gene related to an <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f synthase from the peppermint, <italic>Mentha piperita</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> (Lamiaceae), enabled the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Brassicaceae) to be genetically engineered to produce <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f sufficiently pure to effect high activity in laboratory studies against the pest aphid <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> and increase foraging behaviour by the parasitoid <italic>Diaeretiella rapae,</italic> both of these species being able to exploit brassicaceous ecosystems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The scene was thereby set to explore this approach in a crop plant, to enable testing both in the laboratory and in the field.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><p>The hexaploid wheat, <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> cv.

A total of 62 transgenic events with E&#x003b2;<italic>fS</italic> or E&#x003b2;<italic>fS</italic> plus <italic>FPPS</italic> were analysed. Expression of the genes was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, but no <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f could be detected by high resolution gas chromatography (GC) analysis or coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) even with single ion monitoring for the diagnostic ion m/z 204 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Furthermore, no behavioural activity to entrainment volatiles, different from those of untransformed Cadenza, was detected. These data are in contrast to those previously observed by us in Arabidopsis, and represent an interesting but unexpected divergence of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in Angiosperms.</p><p>There is evidence that targeting terpene synthases to plastids (via additional <italic>N</italic>-terminal subcellular targeting determinants) can increase levels of terpene biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.

Wheat plants expressing plastidially-targeted forms of the two constructs, both <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;fS alone (47 events) and <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;fS plus FPPS (34 events), were found to generate <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). From these, we chose two lead events with which to conduct lab- and field-based insect behaviour studies. One (B2803 R6P1) possessed both E&#x003b2;<italic>fS</italic> and <italic>FPPS</italic> and displayed a high level of <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f emission and one (B2812 R9P1) that possesses E&#x003b2;<italic>fS</italic> alone and displayed <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f emission in the mid-range of our observations. All the plants that emitted <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f had an otherwise normal phenotype, were fully fertile and did <bold><underline>not</underline></bold> display any obvious evidence of somaclonal mutations.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Copy number and zygosity analysis</title><p>A combination of <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f emission levels, transgene copy number and inheritance ratios was used to screen the 81 events possessing plastidially targeted <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;fS or <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;fS plus FPPS and two lead events were selected (B2803 R6P1 and B2812 R9P1), (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S1</xref>). TaqMan PCR on genomic DNA revealed that event B2803 R6P1 possessed one copy of the E&#x003b2;<italic>fS</italic> gene and <italic>FPPS</italic> gene per haploid genome and event B2812 R9P1 possessed four copies of the E&#x003b2;<italic>fS</italic> gene per haploid genome. TaqMan analysis supported other PCR data, showing that the transgene insertions were stably inherited via simple 3:1 Mendelian ratios in the chromosomal DNA. The two genes in event B2803 R6P1 were always inherited together and the plants used in the field trial were all homozygous.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Analysis of <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f and other volatile compounds from transformed wheat plants</title><p>The emission levels of <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f from transformed plants in CE conditions varied with plant growth stage, rising until ~70 days post germination and subsequently declining. The same trend was observed in the field environment. A marked difference was observed between plants with the E&#x003b2;<italic>fS</italic> gene plastidially-targeted, which produced lower levels of <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f compared to plants with both the E&#x003b2;<italic>fS</italic> gene and <italic>FPPS</italic> gene plastidially-targeted, emission levels rising to a maximum of 3.8 and 30.7&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/plant/h at 71 days post germination respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>). No deleterious effects of the transformation on growth or development of plants were observed. The isoprenoid phytol, which relates biosynthetically to chlorophyll, and plant colour showed no difference between lines B2803 R6PI, B2812 R9PI and untransformed Cadenza. In addition to <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f, the monoterpene hydrocarbon myrcene, a compound with greater volatility than <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f, was detected at relatively higher ratios specifically in plants with only the gene encoding the plastidially-targeted E&#x003b2;f synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>).

Aphids were strongly repelled when exposed to volatiles collected from transformed plants grown under CE and field conditions. In an olfactometer bioassay, time spent in the area containing volatiles from transformed plants was compared with time spent in control areas. Aphids spent significantly less time in the treated area, indicating a repellent effect. Both the single (B2812 R9P1) and double construct (B2803 R6P1) lines were significantly repellent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>). The very high level of repellency for both lines did not allow for discrimination between the two at a behavioural level. Bioassays with myrcene indicated that it did not inhibit or otherwise influence the repellent response to <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f.</p><p>Specific alarm responses of aphids to the transformed plants were also characterised using an alarm pheromone bioassay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, which measures disturbance of an aphid colony when exposed to sources of alarm pheromone. A strong alarm response was observed when aphid colonies on wheat leaves were exposed to volatiles from the transformed plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). However, when aphids were reared on <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f emitting plants for five generations prior to testing, their responses in both the olfactometer and alarm pheromone bioassays were much reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>). <italic>R. padi</italic> still exhibited an alarm pheromone response, but there was no significant response by <italic>S. avenae</italic>.</p><p>Aphid settlement on plants over a longer period was investigated in a field simulator trial.

This was intentionally terminated prior to flowering at the end of 2013 because it was designed to investigate effects on aphids specifically during the developmental stages of wheat when they transmit Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus. Two GM wheat lines, the single construct line (B2812 R9P1) and the double construct line (B2803 R6P1), were selected for field testing alongside the isogenic untransformed Cadenza variety used for transformation. Although the scope of these small-scale trials never included making commercially-relevant wheat yield measurements, we took samples and measured grain yields from each of the plots in the 2013 spring sowing. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatments. Aphid infestation levels in field plot trials were recorded on a weekly basis throughout the growing season in spring 2012, and in spring and autumn 2013. In both years, there was no significant difference in aphid populations between the plots with untransformed and transformed wheat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). The number of parasitized aphids was not different between treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The release of an insect pheromone, the aphid alarm pheromone (<italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f), has been successfully achieved by genetic engineering of a crop plant, the hexaploid wheat cv. Cadenza. The pheromone released showed intrinsic activity against aphid pests and increased foraging by a natural enemy of aphids, the parasitic wasp <italic>A. ervi,</italic> in laboratory experiments. Habituation was observed in aphids reared on transformed plants. In field trials, the two levels of release of <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f achieved did not give rise to control of aphids or exploitation of natural enemies. Importantly, none of the experimental lines releasing E&#x003b2;f showed any other noticeable phenotypic differences from the control lines.</p><p>Both aphid and parasitoid populations were low in the summer trials due to cold, wet weather, peaking at a mean of 0.76 aphids per tiller, with 20.33% of tillers infested, at the onset of anthesis on 4 July 2012 and 0.63 aphids per tiller, with 21.59% of tillers infested, at the end of anthesis on 18 July 2013. These are well below the recommended spray thresholds for summer aphids in the UK (50% of tillers infested before anthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The plot size was small (6&#x02009;m&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;6&#x02009;m), but has been successfully used in previous experiments showing efficacy of chemically derived alarm pheromone in the field<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Perhaps of relevance is the observation that, when aphids emit <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f after attack by a predator, this is via a sudden burst release from their siphunculi, followed by a rapid decline as the volatile compound dissipates and is oxidized. In contrast, our plants emitted <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f continuously and it is likely that this difference in the temporal release pattern meant that aphid settlement was not reduced in the field. Nonetheless, there should be an increase in parasitoid foraging behaviour, but perhaps only detectable at much higher populations, as can occur in some agroecological regions.</p><p>The demonstration that plastidial targeting is necessary for satisfactory production of isoprenoids confirms, in a cereal crop, previous studies on the production of non-pheromonal isoprenoids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Although sesquiterpenes can be naturally produced in the plastid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (or via retargeting of biosynthetic enzymes), sesquiterpene synthases are normally localised in the cytosol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In that respect, the failure to generate <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f as a result of the expression of cytosolic forms of <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;fS and FPPS was unexpected and remains to be elucidated. In the case of plastidially-targeted <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;fS in the absence of co-located FPPS, we suggest that, as a consequence of a high flux of the isoprenoid pathway in the plastid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and because higher isoprenoids are produced, e.g. the carotenoids, there is a substantial, but transient, production of the precursor of sesquiterpenes, FPP. However, the access, by the sesquiterpene synthase enzyme in the transformed wheat, to this transient presence of FPP is limiting and so, for overexpression of the synthase <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;fS without FPPS, the sesquiterpene synthase uses all natural FPP and then scavenges the homologous geranyl diphosphate, and thereby makes myrcene, the homologue of <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f, and at a relatively higher ratio than when the <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f precursor is more available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). This hypothesis also offers insights as to why, in <italic>A. thaliana,</italic> ubiquitous expression of <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;fS without plastidial targeting could produce <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f and without myrcene, thus indicating greater access to FPP. Myrcene is often found in aphid host plants, but although associated with electrophysiological activity, as here, no role as a host plant cue is observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>This study is an important development in demonstrating, for the first time, stable genetic engineering of pheromone biosynthesis into crop plants. The work clearly shows that the concept needs to be tested further, with refinements as discussed above and more reliable natural populations of aphids and parasitoids. However, volatile semiochemicals produced on stress caused by herbivory, which repel herbivores and also attract beneficial insects, may also need to be considered as targets for genetic engineering.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Constructs and plant transformation.&#x02003;</title><p>Chemically synthesised gene sequences, codon-optimised for wheat encoding enzymes [(<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-farnesene synthase (<italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;fS) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS)], were produced by GenScript Inc.

Quantification was carried out by calculating and comparing peak areas with known amounts of authentic external standards. Two transformed lines, B2812 R9P1 (single construct) and B2803 R6P1 (double construct), were chosen for air entrainment on the basis of <italic>E</italic>&#x003b2;f emission and low copy number. Volatiles were collected from 5 week old seedlings to provide the headspace samples used in bioassays. These lines were also used to bulk up seed for field trials. In additional entrainments, volatiles were sampled from transformed plants in the T2 and T3 generations at different time points to investigate emission at different ages and fresh weight was recorded (see data for T3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Electroantennogram (EAG) recordings were made using Ag-AgCl glass electrodes filled with saline solution (composition as in Maddrell, 1969<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, but without glucose). The head of an alate aphid was excised and placed within the indifferent electrode, with the tips of the antennae being inserted into the recording electrode. The signals were passed through a high impedance amplifier (UN-06, Syntech, The Netherlands) and analysed using a customized software package (Syntech). The coupled GC-electrophysiology system, in which the effluent from the GC column is simultaneously directed to the antennal preparation and the GC detector, has been described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Separation of the volatiles was achieved on a GC (Agilent Technologies, 6890N) equipped with a cold on-column injector and an FID. For the HP-1 column, the oven temperature was maintained at 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;minutes and then programmed at 15&#x000b0;&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 250&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The carrier gas was helium. The outputs from the EAG amplifier and the FID were monitored simultaneously and analysed using the Syntech software package. GC peaks were judged to be active if EAG responses were observed in three or more coupled runs.
