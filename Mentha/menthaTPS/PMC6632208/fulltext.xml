The multi-flower spiciform thyrse of lavender not only determines the output of EOs but also reflects an environmental adaption strategy. With the flower development and blossom in turn, the fluctuation of the volatile terpenoids displayed a regular change at each axis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of volatile terpenoids during the process of flowering is poorly understood in lavender. Here, we combine metabolite and RNA-Seq analyses of flowers of five developmental stages at first- and second-axis (FFDSFSA) and initial flower bud (FB0) to discover the active terpenoid biosynthesis as well as flowering-related genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">A total of 56 mono- and sesquiterpenoids were identified in the EOs of <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> &#x02018;JX-2&#x02019;. FB0&#x02019; EO consists of 55 compounds and the two highest compounds, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-trans-ocimene (20.57%) and (+)-R-limonene (17.00%), can get rid of 74.71 and 78.41% aphids in Y-tube olfactometer experiments, respectively. With sequential and successive blossoms, temporally regulated volatiles were linked to pollinator attraction in field and olfaction bioassays. In three characteristic compounds of FFDSFSA&#x02019; EOs, linalyl acetate (72.73%) and lavandulyl acetate (72.09%) attracted more bees than linalool (45.35%). Many transcripts related to flowering time and volatile terpenoid metabolism expressed differently during the flower development. Similar metabolic and transcriptomic profiles were observed when florets from the two axes were maintained at the same maturity grade. Besides both compounds and differentially expressed genes were rich in FB0, most volatile compounds were significantly correlated with FB0-specific gene module. Most key regulators related to flowering and terpenoid metabolism were interconnected in the subnetwork of FB0-specific module, suggesting the cross-talk between the two biological processes to some degree.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Characteristic compounds and gene expression profile of FB0 exhibit ecological value in pest control.

This family is known for its fine ornamental or culinary herbs such as basil, lavender, mint, oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme, and is an abundance source of essential oils (EOs). Plants of the <italic>Lavandula</italic> genus, especially <italic>L. angustifolia</italic>, <italic>L. latifolia</italic> and their natural sterile hybrid <italic>L</italic>. &#x000d7; <italic>intermedia,</italic> are now cultivated worldwide for their EOs, which are widely used in perfumes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and, more recently, in aromatherapy products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> subsp. angustifolia, distributed in southern France and extending into the Italian Alps to the east and to Calabria in southern Italy, occurs naturally in very arid habitats from (250-) 500 to 1800 (&#x02212;&#x02009;2000) m on calcareous soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Inflorescence architecture is among the most important characteristics of adaption and provides the very basic structural foundation that determines the maximum number of sites available for seed production and even the genetic diversity of the progenies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> is a cincinnus (containing 3~9 florets) with bisymmetric cymes divaricating 2~3 times, resulting in spiral or scorpoid forms. This inflorescence architecture is an efficient way to pack more flowers into a dense spike and, more importantly, can produce new flowers continuously over a period of at least several weeks. Although many florets of various developmental stages (from immature to fade) are scattered on one rachis, the blooming order of these florets is finely tuned: the two symmetric terminal florets open first from the base to the top whorl, followed by the four florets on the second axis that developed from each first axis (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM19" ref-type="media">19</xref>: Video S1). This blooming sequence helps to maximize out-crossing by increasing the potential number of different male parents, filling up for the less outputs of four one-seeded nutlets in each flower and the resulting heterogeneous patterns enhance the capacity to adapt to changes in the environment. Previous studies paid attention to the individual floret at a random position of the inflorescences or to whole inflorescences with different bloom ratios during the flowering period, but chemical and molecular analyses of different-axis florets at the same whorl were neglected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], as was the ecological significance behind this blooming sequence.</p><p id="Par34">The chemical components of lavender and lavandin EOs are characterized by the presence of monoterpenoids (e.g. linalool and linalyl acetate) and sesquiterpenoids (e.g. caryophyllene and bergamotene) and other irregular types. The lineage-specific terpenoids, which have arisen throughout the evolution of green plants, have generally been postulated to play an important role in mediating ecological interactions between plants with a diverse array of visitors, including pollinators, herbivores, natural enemies and pathogens, ensuring the plants&#x02019; reproductive and evolutionary success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Extensive evidence has indicated that the spatiotemporal expression of terpene synthase (TPS) is correlated with the biosynthesis and emission of volatile terpenoids, such as the <italic>linalool synthase</italic> (<italic>LINS</italic>) and <italic>limonene synthase</italic> (<italic>LIMS</italic>) reported in lavender, indicating that this regulation may occur, at least in part, at the transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Lavender inflorescence is a typical model for studying the regulation of terpenoid synthesis at the molecular, cellular and ecological levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; however, there is still almost no comprehensive understanding of terpenoid metabolism via network-focused rather than individual gene/protein-focused strategies in lavender. A nucleotide search of GenBank revealed only 15 lavender-derived sequences related to terpenoid biosynthesis (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Table S1), which is quite insufficient compared to the pace of identification of volatile compounds in lavender. Moreover, previous studies have described the expression patterns of only a few TPSs with flower development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, the orchestrated formation of various terpenoids is not only a function of biosynthetic enzymes, but also requires the involvement of the poorly understood terpenoid modification enzymes [e.g., cytochrome P450 monooxidase (CYP450s)], transcription factors (TFs) and terpenoid transporters.</p><p id="Par36">As a powerful modern genetic research tool, next-generation sequencing techniques have been widely used to analyse many non-model organisms due to their low cost and high output. Many computational methodologies, such as weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), are designed to provide insight at the system level and have been applied to high-throughput RNA-Seq datasets to detect molecular communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The clustering of genes in a co-expressed group indicate close regulatory associations between them, thus enabling inference of the biological function of unknown genes by &#x02018;guilt by association&#x02019; with well-characterized ones. It is particularly noteworthy that co-expressed gene groups can be combined with metabolite datasets, and this strategy can detect genes (including both transcription factor and enzyme genes) that are highly correlated with specific chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A number of studies have successfully applied WGCNA to microarray and metabolite data to develop metabolite-specific gene atlases, for plants such as <italic>Thesium chinense</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and <italic>Anthurium amnicola</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par37"><italic>L. angustifolia</italic> occupies a top-tier position in the aromatic plant list from both economic and ecological perspectives and is regarded as a genomic model for studying terpenoid metabolism. However, to our knowledge, there are no global transcriptomic and metabolic analyses related to its flower development. A main objective of the present work was to examine the ecological implications of sequential and successive blossoms of lavender inflorescences and explore how lavenders orchestrate flowering time and the emissions of diverse terpenoids. Our results pave the way for a detailed understanding of the regulation of mono- and sesquiterpenoid synthesis in lavender and shed new light on the ecological and genetic flexibility of lavender inflorescences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Volatile terpenoid profiles of individual florets at different developmental stages</title><p id="Par38">We selected the remote-whorl florets of the first and second axes at five developmental stages and the initial flower buds (a total of 11 types of flower samples, see Methods) for EO extraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A total of 34 monoterpenoids and 22 sesquiterpenoids were detected in at least one of the 11 lavender samples by GC-MS analysis. The content of each terpenoid was presented as a percentage of the total volatiles, and the 56 compounds added up to 99.99% of the total volatiles (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>: Table S2). The results showed that florets at different developmental stages had distinct volatile profiles, especially the EO composition of FB0 compared to the flowers of the five developmental stages of the first and second axes (FFDSFSA) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). A higher proportion of (+)-(R)-limonene (17.00%), <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-trans-ocimene (20.57%), o-cymene (3.72%) and 3-carene (3.83%) and a lower proportion of linalool (2.18%), linalyl acetate (0.73%) and &#x003b1;-terpineol (0.62%) were characteristic of volatile extracted from FB0. With the expansion of the initial bud into five-whorl purple flowers, the main components of the florets became linalool (17.06~43.72%, indicated by blue blocks), linalyl acetate (19.35~32.24%, indicated by magenta blocks) and lavandulyl acetate (11.60~24.46%, indicated by purple blocks) with fluctuations at FFDSFSA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>: Table S2). We also normalized the contents of volatiles using the z-score, and 56 compounds detected during different stages of flower development were clustered into four groups (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). In groups I and II, 31 compounds exhibited the highest accumulation at FB0. Meanwhile, the average contents of 10 compounds in group II showed a peak at anthesis.

Moreover, the volatile composition of individual floret from the first or second axis was significantly influenced by morphological maturity. Obviously, the contents of linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate elevated, but the content of linalool decreased when the florets were blooming regardless of whether they were on the first or second axis (F3_1 and F4_2). During the flower fading stages (F4_1, F5_1 and F5_2), the content of linalool increased. As confirmed by PCA of the profiling data for these 56 volatiles from the 11 flower samples, the unopened flower buds, blooming flowers and fading flowers of the two axes were well clustered and the area of distribution of FB0 differed more significantly from FFDSFSA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). In summary, oscillations in volatile accumulation were closely linked to the developmental stage of the individual floret.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Observation of floral visitors and olfaction bioassays</title><p id="Par40">Our preliminary field investigation found that few pollinators showed up before blossoming, while lavender was often attacked heavily by aphids (herbivore) at FB0 during spring in Beijing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, w). Then the number of aphids is diminishing with flower development and bare of them was left when lavender blooms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>w).

The increased contents of linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate at the blooming stage and the greater attraction of bees implied that the linalyl acetate and lavandulyl acetate may contribute more to the attraction of pollinators, than linalool in lavender.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>RNA sequencing and different expression genes (DEGs) analysis</title><p id="Par42">RNA sequencing was performed to obtain the global transcriptomic dynamics in FFDSFSA and FB0.

In Arabidopsis, <italic>CYP71B31</italic> and <italic>CYP76C3</italic>, together with <italic>TPS10</italic> [form (2)-(R)-linalool] and TPS14 [form (+)-(S)-linalool], are co-expressed in flowers at anthesis and catalyse the oxidation of the two enantiomers of linalool to produce a sets of hydroxylated or epoxidized products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. <italic>CYP76C1</italic>, which was co-expressed with <italic>TPS10</italic> and <italic>TPS14</italic>, was also identified as a major linalool metabolizing oxygenase in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These subsequent oxidative steps are catalysed by members of the CYP450 superfamily, indicating the coordination of TPS and CYP450s in producing impressively diverse terpenoids that play important roles in the ecological interaction of plants with biotic and abiotic stress.</p><p id="Par54">Numerous reports have illustrated that delayed flowering can increase the accumulation of primary metabolism products in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], while few effects of alteration in the flowering time on secondary metabolism are known. Lv et al. (2018) demonstrated that inhibition of <italic>AaFT2</italic> may delay the flowering time and increase the accumulation of artemisinin in transgenic <italic>A. annua</italic>, but it is not clear that how flowering time impacted the contents of terpenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In <italic>Petunia hybrida</italic> and <italic>N. attenuate</italic>, reducing the expression of the clock gene, <italic>LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL</italic> (<italic>LHY</italic>), advanced the phase of scent emission as well as expression of genes in the floral volatile benzenoid/phenylpropanoid pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The oscillation of monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid emission is a consequence of the regulation of the gene encoding key enzymes in MEP and MVA pathway, which is also possibly controlled by the circadian clock. However, the interaction mechanism between flowering time-related genes and terpenoid metabolism-related genes in aromatic plants remained elusive. Our findings suggest a regulatory network involved in both in flowering time and volatile terpenoid and the potential link between them. As our current understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the flowering time and MEP/MVA pathway is still incomplete, a further investigation into the explicit and specific relationship is pending.</p><p id="Par55">The members of the <italic>WRKY</italic>, <italic>MYB</italic> and <italic>bHLH</italic> families and the well-known <italic>MADS</italic>, which showed co-expression with terpenoid metabolism-related genes, have been reported to orchestrate flower development in many plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Evidence from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has demonstrated that <italic>WRKY75</italic> positively regulates flowering in an FLT-dependent manner, but <italic>RGL1</italic> and <italic>GAI</italic> can repress the activation ability of <italic>WRKY75</italic>, thereby partially rescuing the early flowering phenotype of <italic>WRKY75</italic>-overexpressing plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Several TFs appeared to be extensively correlated with most terpenoid metabolism-related genes in the subnetwork, implying that they may regulate an upstream step in plant secondary metabolism. It has already been proven that <italic>MsMYB</italic> is a negative regulator of monoterpene biosynthesis in spearmint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; <italic>MsYABBY5</italic> RNAi lines exhibit a 20%~&#x02009;77% increase in monoterpene production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]; <italic>SlWRKY73</italic> can transactivate the <italic>SlTPS5</italic> promoter in tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]; and <italic>AaWRKY1</italic> regulates the amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene, which catalyses a committed step of artemisinin biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In conclusion, the above candidates opened the door for trailblazing discoveries of the molecular underpinnings of terpenoid regulation. The expression or modulation of those functional homologs in lavender might thus be considered for applications in improving EO quality and biological control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">This study provides, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive view of changes in gene expression and volatiles during the flower developmental reprogramming of lavender.
