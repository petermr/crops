Most of the TPs showed a similar expression pattern: downregulation after darkness treatment and upregulation after the return of light. In addition, the genes involved in the light signal transduction pathway were analyzed.

molecule used for the hemisynthesis of the perfume ingredient ambroxide. Sclareol is mainly produced in clary sage flower calyces; however, the cellular localization of the sclareol biosynthesis remains unknown.

For example, linalool synthases are indispensable for the biosynthesis of linalool, an important fragrance used in 60-80% cosmetic and personal care products. However, plant linalool synthases have low activities while expressed in microbes. Aided by bioinformatics analysis, four linalool/nerolidol synthases (LNSs) from various Agaricomycetes were accurately predicted and validated experimentally. Furthermore, we discovered a linalool synthase (Ap.LS) with exceptionally high levels of selectivity and activity from Agrocybe pediades, ideal for linalool bioproduction.

pharmaceuticals, flavourings, fragrances, pesticides, and biofuels. Recent advances in synthetic biology offer new routes to this chemical diversity through the introduction of heterologous isoprenoid production pathways into engineered microorganisms. Due to the nature of the branched reaction mechanism, monoterpene synthases often produce multiple products when expressed in monoterpenoid production platforms. Rational engineering of terpene synthases is challenging due to\u00a0a lack of correlation between protein sequence and cyclisation reaction catalysed. Directed evolution offers an attractive alternative protein engineering strategy as limited prior sequence-function knowledge is required. However, directed evolution of terpene synthases is hampered by the lack of a convenient high-throughput screening assay for the detection of multiple volatile terpene products. Here we applied an automated pipeline for the screening of diverse monoterpene synthase libraries, employing robotic liquid handling platforms coupled to GC-MS, and automated data extraction. We used the pipeline to screen pinene synthase variant libraries, with mutations in three areas of plasticity, capable of producing multiple monoterpene products. We successfully identified variants with altered product profiles and demonstrated good agreement between the results of the automated screen and traditional shake-flask cultures. In addition, useful insights into the cyclisation reaction catalysed by pinene synthase were obtained, including the identification of positions with the highest level of plasticity, and the significance of region 2 in carbocation cyclisation.

The statistical analysis of the grouped data demonstrated that protozoans were more susceptible to the essential oils, followed by fungi, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The analysis for the major components showed that the most resistant microbial group was fungi, which was followed by bacteria, and protozoans were also more susceptible. Principal Component Analysis for the essential oils demonstrated the relationship between the biological activity and the microbial group tested, with the first three components explaining 94.3% of the data variability. The chemical structure of the major components was also related to the biological activity presented against the microbial groups tested, where the three first principal components accounted for 91.9% of the variability.

The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by determination of the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration for <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium, <i>Shigella sonnei</i>, <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, <i>Aspergillus ochraceus</i>, <i>Alternaria alternata,</i> and <i>Fusarium oxysporium</i>, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) for <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> and <i>Leishmania mexicana</i>, and the median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) for <i>Giardia lamblia</i>. Results showed that oregano essential oil showed the best antibacterial activity (66-100 \u00b5g/mL), while cinnamon essential oil had the best fungicidal activity (66-116 \u00b5g/mL), and both showed excellent antiprotozoal activity (22-108 \u00b5g/mL). Regarding the major components, thymol and carvacrol were also good antimicrobials (23-200 \u00b5g/mL), and cinnamaldehyde was an antifungal compound (41-75 \u00b5g/mL). The major components were grouped according to their chemical structure as phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, and terpinenes. The statistical analysis of the grouped data demonstrated that protozoans were more susceptible to the essential oils, followed by fungi, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The analysis for the major components showed that the most resistant microbial group was fungi, which was followed by bacteria, and protozoans were also more susceptible. Principal Component Analysis for the essential oils demonstrated the relationship between the biological activity and the microbial group tested, with the first three components explaining 94.3% of the data variability. The chemical structure of the major components was also related to the biological activity presented against the microbial groups tested, where the three first principal components accounted for 91.9% of the variability. The external structures and the characteristics of the cell membranes in the different microbial groups are determinant for their susceptibility to essential oils and their major components.", "Keywords": ["Cell membranes", "Essential oils", "Antimicrobial", "Terpenoids", "Mechanism of action", "Phenylpropanoids"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8227281?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Membranes", "authorinfo": ["Andrade-Ochoa S", "Chac\u00f3n-Vargas KF", "S\u00e1nchez-Torres LE", "Rivera-Chavira BE", "Nogueda-Torres B", "Nev\u00e1rez-Moorill\u00f3n GV"], "title": "Differential Antimicrobial Effect of Essential Oils and Their Main Components: Insights Based on the Cell Membrane and External Structure."}, "PMC6723042": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31426352", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31426352", "pmcid": "PMC6723042", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6723042"}, "doi": "10.3390/genes10080620", "title": "Transcriptome Landscape Variation in the Genus <i>Thymus</i>.", "authorString": "Soorni A, Borna T, Alemardan A, Chakrabarti M, Hunt AG, Bombarely A.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Soorni A", "firstName": "Aboozar", "lastName": "Soorni", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, College of Agriculture, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan 84156-83111, Iran. soorni@cc.iut.ac.ir."}}}, {"fullName": "Borna T", "firstName": "Tahereh", "lastName": "Borna", "initials": "T", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj 31587-11167, Iran."}}}, {"fullName": "Alemardan A", "firstName": "Ali", "lastName": "Alemardan", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj 31587-11167, Iran."}}}, {"fullName": "Chakrabarti M", "firstName": "Manohar", "lastName": "Chakrabarti", "initials": "M", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-9637-9005"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40546-0312, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Hunt AG", "firstName": "Arthur G", "lastName": "Hunt", "initials": "AG", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40546-0312, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Bombarely A", "firstName": "Aureliano", "lastName": "Bombarely", "initials": "A", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-6257-8914"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "School of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24060, USA. aureliano.bombarely@unimi.it."}, {"affiliation": "Department of Bioscience, University of Milano, 20133 Milan, Italy. aureliano.bombarely@unimi.it."}]}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-6257-8914"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-9637-9005"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "8", "volume": "10", "journalIssueId": "2844576", "dateOfPublication": "2019 Aug", "monthOfPublication": "8", "yearOfPublication": "2019", "printPublicationDate": "2019-08-01", "journal": {"title": "Genes", "ISOAbbreviation": "Genes (Basel)", "medlineAbbreviation": "Genes (Basel)", "NLMid": "101551097", "ISSN": "2073-4425", "ESSN": "2073-4425"}}, "pubYear": "2019", "abstractText": "Among the <i>Lamiaceae</i> family, the genus <i>Thymus</i> is an economically important genera due to its medicinal and aromatic properties.

Monoterpenes are produced from a single linear substrate, geranyl diphosphate, by a group of enzymes called the monoterpene cyclases/synthases (mTC/Ss) that catalyse high-energy cyclisation reactions involving unstable carbocation intermediates. Efforts towards producing monoterpenes via biocatalysis or metabolic engineering often result in the formation of multiple products due to the nature of the highly branched reaction mechanism of mTC/Ss. Rational engineering of mTC/Ss is hampered by the lack of correlation between the active site sequence and cyclisation type. We used available mutagenesis data to show that amino acids involved in product outcome are clustered and spatially conserved within the mTC/S family. Consensus sequences for three such plasticity regions were introduced in different mTC/S with increasingly complex cyclisation cascades, including the model enzyme limonene synthase (LimS). In all three mTC/S studied, mutations in the first two regions mostly give rise to products that result from premature quenching of the linalyl or \u03b1-terpinyl cations, suggesting that both plasticity regions are involved in the formation and stabilisation of cations early in the reaction cascade.

Monoterpenes are produced from a single linear substrate, geranyl diphosphate, by a group of enzymes called the monoterpene cyclases/synthases (mTC/Ss) that catalyse high-energy cyclisation reactions involving unstable carbocation intermediates. Efforts towards producing monoterpenes via biocatalysis or metabolic engineering often result in the formation of multiple products due to the nature of the highly branched reaction mechanism of mTC/Ss. Rational engineering of mTC/Ss is hampered by the lack of correlation between the active site sequence and cyclisation type. We used available mutagenesis data to show that amino acids involved in product outcome are clustered and spatially conserved within the mTC/S family. Consensus sequences for three such plasticity regions were introduced in different mTC/S with increasingly complex cyclisation cascades, including the model enzyme limonene synthase (LimS). In all three mTC/S studied, mutations in the first two regions mostly give rise to products that result from premature quenching of the linalyl or \u03b1-terpinyl cations, suggesting that both plasticity regions are involved in the formation and stabilisation of cations early in the reaction cascade. A LimS variant with mutations in the second region (S454G, C457V, M458I), produced mainly more complex bicyclic products. QM/MM MD simulations reveal that the second cyclisation is not due to compression of the C2-C7 distance in the \u03b1-terpinyl cation, but is the result of an increased distance between C8 of the \u03b1-terpinyl cation and two putative bases (W324, H579) located on the other side of the active site, preventing early termination by deprotonation.

by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, is the most devastating disease of rice. In our ongoing characterization of the defence mechanisms of rice plants against M.\u00a0oryzae, a terpene synthase gene OsTPS19 was identified as a candidate defence gene. Here, we report the functional characterization of OsTPS19, which is up-regulated by M.\u00a0oryzae infection. Overexpression of OsTPS19 in rice plants enhanced resistance against M.\u00a0oryzae, while OsTPS19 RNAi lines were more susceptible to the pathogen. Metabolic analysis revealed that the production of a monoterpene (S)-limonene was increased and decreased in OsTPS19 overexpression and RNAi lines, respectively, suggesting that OsTPS19 functions as a limonene synthase in planta. This notion was further supported by in\u00a0vitro enzyme assays with recombinant OsTPS19, in which OsTPS19 had both sesquiterpene activity and monoterpene synthase activity, with limonene as a major product. Furthermore, in a subcellular localization experiment, OsTPS19 was localized in plastids. OsTPS19 has a highly homologous paralog, OsTPS20, which likely resulted from a recent gene duplication event. We found that the variation in OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 enzyme activities was determined by a single amino acid in the active site cavity.

In our ongoing characterization of the defence mechanisms of rice plants against M.\u00a0oryzae, a terpene synthase gene OsTPS19 was identified as a candidate defence gene. Here, we report the functional characterization of OsTPS19, which is up-regulated by M.\u00a0oryzae infection. Overexpression of OsTPS19 in rice plants enhanced resistance against M.\u00a0oryzae, while OsTPS19 RNAi lines were more susceptible to the pathogen. Metabolic analysis revealed that the production of a monoterpene (S)-limonene was increased and decreased in OsTPS19 overexpression and RNAi lines, respectively, suggesting that OsTPS19 functions as a limonene synthase in planta. This notion was further supported by in\u00a0vitro enzyme assays with recombinant OsTPS19, in which OsTPS19 had both sesquiterpene activity and monoterpene synthase activity, with limonene as a major product. Furthermore, in a subcellular localization experiment, OsTPS19 was localized in plastids. OsTPS19 has a highly homologous paralog, OsTPS20, which likely resulted from a recent gene duplication event. We found that the variation in OsTPS19 and OsTPS20 enzyme activities was determined by a single amino acid in the active site cavity. The expression of OsTPS20 was not affected by M.\u00a0oryzae infection. This indicates functional divergence of OsTPS19 and OsTPS20. Lastly, (S)-limonene inhibited the germination of M.\u00a0oryzae spores in\u00a0vitro.

Previous study demonstrated that VviGT14 was functioned as a critical monoterpene glucosyltransferase in grape berry, while the transcriptional regulation mechanism of <i>VviGT14</i> was still unknown. Here we identified VviWRKY40 as a binding factor of <i>VviGT14</i> promoter by both DNA pull-down and yeast one-hybrid screening, followed by a series of in vitro verification. <i>VviWRKY40</i> expression pattern negatively correlated with that of <i>VviGT14</i> in grape berries.

Here, M. koenigii leaf transcriptome was generated to gain insight into terpenoid and alkaloid biosynthesis. Analysis of de novo assembled contigs yielded genes for terpene backbone biosynthesis and terpene synthases. Also, gene families possibly involved in carbazole alkaloid formation were identified that included polyketide synthases, prenyltransferases, methyltransferases and cytochrome P450s. Further, two genes encoding terpene synthases (MkTPS1 and MkTPS2) with highest in silico transcript abundance were cloned and functionally characterized to determine their involvement in leaf volatile formation. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions revealed the plastidial and cytosolic localization of MkTPS1 and MkTPS2, respectively. Enzymatic characterization demonstrated the monoterpene synthase activity of recombinant MkTPS1, which produced primarily (-)-sabinene from geranyl diphosphate (GPP).

Analysis of de novo assembled contigs yielded genes for terpene backbone biosynthesis and terpene synthases. Also, gene families possibly involved in carbazole alkaloid formation were identified that included polyketide synthases, prenyltransferases, methyltransferases and cytochrome P450s. Further, two genes encoding terpene synthases (MkTPS1 and MkTPS2) with highest in silico transcript abundance were cloned and functionally characterized to determine their involvement in leaf volatile formation. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions revealed the plastidial and cytosolic localization of MkTPS1 and MkTPS2, respectively. Enzymatic characterization demonstrated the monoterpene synthase activity of recombinant MkTPS1, which produced primarily (-)-sabinene from geranyl diphosphate (GPP).

Lack of photosynthetic transcripts in PGT transcriptome indicated the high levels of purity of isolated PGT, as mint PGT are non-photosynthetic. A significant number of these unigenes remained unannotated or encoded hypothetical proteins. We found 16 terpene synthases (TPS), 18 cytochrome P450s, 5 lipid transfer proteins and several transcription factors that were preferentially expressed in PGT. Among the 16 TPSs, two were characterized biochemically and found to be sesquiterpene synthases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The extensive transcriptome data set renders a complete description of genes differentially expressed in spearmint PGT. This will facilitate the metabolic engineering of mint terpene pathway to increase yield and also enable the development of strategies for sustainable production of novel or altered valuable compounds in mint.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4232691?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "BMC plant biology", "authorinfo": ["Jin J", "Panicker D", "Wang Q", "Kim MJ", "Liu J", "Yin JL", "Wong L", "Jang IC", "Chua NH", "Sarojam R"], "title": "Next generation sequencing unravels the biosynthetic ability of spearmint (Mentha spicata) peltate glandular trichomes through comparative transcriptomics."}, "PMC4364678": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "25786135", "source": "MED", "pmid": "25786135", "pmcid": "PMC4364678", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC4364678"}, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0119302", "title": "Biosynthesis of the diterpenoid lycosantalonol via nerylneryl diphosphate in Solanum lycopersicum.", "authorString": "Matsuba Y, Zi J, Jones AD, Peters RJ, Pichersky E.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Matsuba Y", "firstName": "Yuki", "lastName": "Matsuba", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America."}}}, {"fullName": "Zi J", "firstName": "Jiachen", "lastName": "Zi", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics & Molecular Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, United States of America."}}}, {"fullName": "Jones AD", "firstName": "A Daniel", "lastName": "Jones", "initials": "AD", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7408-6690"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, United States of America."}}}, {"fullName": "Peters RJ", "firstName": "Reuben J", "lastName": "Peters", "initials": "RJ", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-4691-8477"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics & Molecular Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, United States of America."}}}, {"fullName": "Pichersky E", "firstName": "Eran", "lastName": "Pichersky", "initials": "E", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7408-6690"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-4691-8477"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["related_data", "supporting_data"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "3", "volume": "10", "journalIssueId": "2258653", "dateOfPublication": "2015", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2015", "printPublicationDate": "2015-01-01", "journal": {"title": "PloS one", "ISOAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "medlineAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "NLMid": "101285081", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "ESSN": "1932-6203"}}, "pubYear": "2015", "pageInfo": "e0119302", "abstractText": "We recently reported that three genes involved in the biosynthesis of monoterpenes in trichomes, a cis-prenyltransferase named neryl diphosphate synthase 1 (NDPS1) and two terpene synthases (TPS19 and TPS20), are present in close proximity to each other at the tip of chromosome 8 in the genome of the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum).

purified enzymes, and by metabolic engineering. The monoterpenes are an important class of terpenes and are industrially important as flavors and fragrances. We report here structures for the recently discovered <i>Streptomyces clavuligerus</i> monoterpene synthases linalool synthase (bLinS) and 1,8-cineole synthase (bCinS), and we show that these are active biocatalysts for monoterpene production using biocatalysis and metabolic engineering platforms. In metabolically engineered monoterpene-producing <i>E. coli</i> strains, use of bLinS leads to 300-fold higher linalool production compared with the corresponding plant monoterpene synthase. With bCinS, 1,8-cineole is produced with 96% purity compared to 67% from plant species. Structures of bLinS and bCinS, and their complexes with fluorinated substrate analogues, show that these bacterial monoterpene synthases are similar to previously characterized sesquiterpene synthases. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that these monoterpene synthases do not undergo large-scale conformational changes during the reaction cycle, making them attractive targets for structured-based protein engineering to expand the catalytic scope of these enzymes toward alternative monoterpene scaffolds. Comparison of the bLinS and bCinS structures indicates how their active sites steer reactive carbocation intermediates to the desired acyclic linalool (bLinS) or bicyclic 1,8-cineole (bCinS) products. The work reported here provides the analysis of structures for this important class of monoterpene synthase.

Plants and their dazzling diversity of specialized metabolites have emerged as rich repository for functional P450s with the advances of deep transcriptomics and genome wide discovery. P450s are of outstanding interest for understanding chemical diversification throughout evolution, for gaining mechanistic insights through the study of their structure-function relationship, and for exploitation in Synthetic Biology. In this review, we highlight recent developments and examples in the discovery of plant P450s involved in the biosynthesis of industrially relevant monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids and triterpenoids, throughout 2016 and early 2017.

Plants and their dazzling diversity of specialized metabolites have emerged as rich repository for functional P450s with the advances of deep transcriptomics and genome wide discovery. P450s are of outstanding interest for understanding chemical diversification throughout evolution, for gaining mechanistic insights through the study of their structure-function relationship, and for exploitation in Synthetic Biology. In this review, we highlight recent developments and examples in the discovery of plant P450s involved in the biosynthesis of industrially relevant monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids and triterpenoids, throughout 2016 and early 2017.

Map-based cloning was initiated using a set of isogenic lines (ILs) harboring the major Bph3 locus on chromosome 6. IL genomes were scanned with a 57 K Affymetrix Rice GeneChip to identify the gene responsible for Bph3.<h4>Findings</h4>Single-feature polymorphism (SFP) mapping was used to localize 84 candidate genes. An expression analysis of 15 selected candidate genes in the aromatic rice cultivar KDML105 (KD) and the ILs under normal conditions revealed two differentially expressed sequences. Following hopper feeding, only one candidate gene, Os04g27430, was differentially expressed. Os04g27430 encodes a putative sesquiterpene synthase (STPS) gene that was induced by BPH feeding in ILs.

Map-based cloning was initiated using a set of isogenic lines (ILs) harboring the major Bph3 locus on chromosome 6. IL genomes were scanned with a 57 K Affymetrix Rice GeneChip to identify the gene responsible for Bph3.<h4>Findings</h4>Single-feature polymorphism (SFP) mapping was used to localize 84 candidate genes. An expression analysis of 15 selected candidate genes in the aromatic rice cultivar KDML105 (KD) and the ILs under normal conditions revealed two differentially expressed sequences. Following hopper feeding, only one candidate gene, Os04g27430, was differentially expressed. Os04g27430 encodes a putative sesquiterpene synthase (STPS) gene that was induced by BPH feeding in ILs.

Biosynthesis of functionally diverse sesquiterpenes is dependent on the availability of a pool of the precursor farnesyldiphosphate (FDP). In Arabidopsis thaliana, FPS2, encoding cytosolic farnesyldiphosphate synthase, is implicated in the synthesis of cytosolic FDP, but it is not known whether enhanced levels of FDP have a commensurate effect on sesquiterpene-mediated defence responses. This study examined transgenic arabidopsis plants generated to over-express FPS2 in order to determine if any effects could be observed in the response of aphids, Myzus persicae.<h4>Methods</h4>Transgenic arabidopsis plants were generated to over-express FPS2 to produce FPS2 in either the cytosol or the chloroplasts. Morphochemical analyses of the transgenic plants were carried out to detremine growth responses of roots and shoots, and for GC-MS profiling of sesquiterpenes. Aphid response to hyrdo-distillate extracts and head-space volatiles from transgenic plants was assessed using a bioassay.<h4>Key results</h4>Either over-expression of FPS2 in the cytosol or targetting of its translated product to chlorplasts resulted in stimulatory growth responses of transgenic arabidopsis at early and late developmental stages.

Biosynthesis of functionally diverse sesquiterpenes is dependent on the availability of a pool of the precursor farnesyldiphosphate (FDP). In Arabidopsis thaliana, FPS2, encoding cytosolic farnesyldiphosphate synthase, is implicated in the synthesis of cytosolic FDP, but it is not known whether enhanced levels of FDP have a commensurate effect on sesquiterpene-mediated defence responses. This study examined transgenic arabidopsis plants generated to over-express FPS2 in order to determine if any effects could be observed in the response of aphids, Myzus persicae.<h4>Methods</h4>Transgenic arabidopsis plants were generated to over-express FPS2 to produce FPS2 in either the cytosol or the chloroplasts. Morphochemical analyses of the transgenic plants were carried out to detremine growth responses of roots and shoots, and for GC-MS profiling of sesquiterpenes. Aphid response to hyrdo-distillate extracts and head-space volatiles from transgenic plants was assessed using a bioassay.<h4>Key results</h4>Either over-expression of FPS2 in the cytosol or targetting of its translated product to chlorplasts resulted in stimulatory growth responses of transgenic arabidopsis at early and late developmental stages. GC-MS analysis of hydro-distillate extracts from aerial parts of the plants revealed biosynthesis of several novel sesquiterpenes, including E-\u03b2-farnesene, an alarm pheromone of aphids. Both entrapped volatiles and hydro-distillate extracts of the transgenic leaves triggered agitation in aphids, which was related to both time and dose of exposure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Over-expression of FPS2 in the cytosol and targeting of its translated product to chloroplasts in arabidopsis led to synthesis of several novel sesquiterpenes, including E-\u03b2-farnesene, and induced alarm responses in M. persicae.

In contrast, recombinant CYP79D63 from E. coca exclusively accepted L-tryptophan as substrate. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that CYP79D60, CYP79D61, and CYP79D62 were significantly upregulated in jasmonic acid-treated Erythroxylum leaves.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The kinetic parameters of the enzymes expressed in vitro coupled with the expression patterns of the corresponding genes and the accumulation and emission of (E/Z)-phenylacetaldoxime, (E/Z)-indole-3-acetaldoxime, (E/Z)-3-methylbutyraldoxime, and (E/Z)-2-methylbutyraldoxime in jasmonic acid-treated leaves suggest that CYP79D60, CYP79D61, and CYP79D62 accept L-phenylalanine, L-leucine, L-isoleucine, and L-tryptophan as substrates in vivo and contribute to the production of volatile and semi-volatile nitrogenous defence compounds in E. coca and E. fischeri.", "Keywords": ["Volatiles", "Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase", "Cyp79", "Aldoxime", "Erythroxylum"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5050915?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "BMC plant biology", "authorinfo": ["Luck K", "Jirschitzka J", "Irmisch S", "Huber M", "Gershenzon J", "K\u00f6llner TG"], "title": "CYP79D enzymes contribute to jasmonic acid-induced formation of aldoximes and other nitrogenous volatiles in two Erythroxylum species."}, "PMC3525583": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "23272109", "source": "MED", "pmid": "23272109", "pmcid": "PMC3525583", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC3525583"}, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0051481", "title": "Suites of terpene synthases explain differential terpenoid production in ginger and turmeric tissues.", "authorString": "Koo HJ, Gang DR.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Koo HJ", "firstName": "Hyun Jo", "lastName": "Koo", "initials": "HJ", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences and Bio5 Institute, The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, United States of America."}}}, {"fullName": "Gang DR", "firstName": "David R", "lastName": "Gang", "initials": "DR"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["related_data", "supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "12", "volume": "7", "journalIssueId": "1988969", "dateOfPublication": "2012", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2012", "printPublicationDate": "2012-01-01", "journal": {"title": "PloS one", "ISOAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "medlineAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "NLMid": "101285081", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "ESSN": "1932-6203"}}, "pubYear": "2012", "pageInfo": "e51481", "abstractText": "The essential oils of ginger (Zingiber officinale) and turmeric (Curcuma longa) contain a large variety of terpenoids, some of which possess anticancer, antiulcer, and antioxidant properties.

The UV spectrum of solar radiation is by convention divided into three parts: UV-A: 310\u2013400 nm, UV-B: 280\u2013310 nm and UV-C: less than 280 nm. UV-B is the most energetic component reaching Earth surface because the stratospheric ozone layer effectively absorbs completely wavelengths below 290 nm. UV-B is an increasing threat due to increasing UV-B levels on Earth surface as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric O3. In general, the effects of atmospheric UV-B radiation are negative for biological life. Enhanced levels of UV-B radiation can indeed negatively change plant physiological processes, growth and productivity. However, while studying UV-B effects on medicinal plants, some interesting phenomena have been discovered. For example, basil plants respond positively to UV-B radiation by increasing oil yield (Chang et al. J Horticult For 1:27\u201331, 2009). In other studies medicinal plants show beneficial aspects in term of increase in volatile oil yield and secondary metabolite production (Kumari et al. Ecotoxicol Environ Safety 72:2013\u20132019, 2009c, 2010). Medicinal herbs have great market value in India and worldwide. The medicinal value of plants depends upon phenolics, antioxidants and volatile yield. Therefore further UV-B experiments increasing the levels of these compounds are needed. Here we review the effect of UV-B exposure on metabolites, volatiles, and antioxidants potential in medicinal plants. This chapter reports: (1) aspects of the global market for medicinal and aromatic plants in India in order to assist the medicinal plant industry to make informed decisions. (2) The biodiversity loss due to wild harvesting of plants, and as an alternative the cultivation strategy of medicinal plants. (3) Main medicinal plant species having rich antioxidant potential. (4) Main secondary metabolites of plant origin such as phenylpropanoids, terpenes, alkaloids, and volatile oil, and other important metabolites containing high antioxidant level used in human diet and health.

The UV spectrum of solar radiation is by convention divided into three parts: UV-A: 310\u2013400 nm, UV-B: 280\u2013310 nm and UV-C: less than 280 nm. UV-B is the most energetic component reaching Earth surface because the stratospheric ozone layer effectively absorbs completely wavelengths below 290 nm. UV-B is an increasing threat due to increasing UV-B levels on Earth surface as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric O3. In general, the effects of atmospheric UV-B radiation are negative for biological life. Enhanced levels of UV-B radiation can indeed negatively change plant physiological processes, growth and productivity. However, while studying UV-B effects on medicinal plants, some interesting phenomena have been discovered. For example, basil plants respond positively to UV-B radiation by increasing oil yield (Chang et al. J Horticult For 1:27\u201331, 2009). In other studies medicinal plants show beneficial aspects in term of increase in volatile oil yield and secondary metabolite production (Kumari et al. Ecotoxicol Environ Safety 72:2013\u20132019, 2009c, 2010). Medicinal herbs have great market value in India and worldwide. The medicinal value of plants depends upon phenolics, antioxidants and volatile yield. Therefore further UV-B experiments increasing the levels of these compounds are needed. Here we review the effect of UV-B exposure on metabolites, volatiles, and antioxidants potential in medicinal plants. This chapter reports: (1) aspects of the global market for medicinal and aromatic plants in India in order to assist the medicinal plant industry to make informed decisions. (2) The biodiversity loss due to wild harvesting of plants, and as an alternative the cultivation strategy of medicinal plants. (3) Main medicinal plant species having rich antioxidant potential. (4) Main secondary metabolites of plant origin such as phenylpropanoids, terpenes, alkaloids, and volatile oil, and other important metabolites containing high antioxidant level used in human diet and health. (5) UV-B factors that enhance the quality of medicinal plant by increasing the content of secondary bioactive products. (6) Secondary metabolic pathways involving regulation of key enzymes, chalcone synthase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase.

Using multiple regression analysis, variation in expression of MEP pathway genes explained 87% of variation in foliar monoterpene concentrations. The data also suggest that sesquiterpenes in M. alternifolia are synthesised, at least in part, from isopentenyl pyrophosphate originating from the plastid via the MEP pathway.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3609730?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "PloS one", "authorinfo": ["Webb H", "Lanfear R", "Hamill J", "Foley WJ", "K\u00fclheim C"], "title": "The yield of essential oils in Melaleuca alternifolia (Myrtaceae) is regulated through transcript abundance of genes in the MEP pathway."}, "PMC6273672": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "27689986", "source": "MED", "pmid": "27689986", "pmcid": "PMC6273672", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6273672"}, "doi": "10.3390/molecules21101302", "title": "Traceability of Satsuma Mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.)

Upon herbivory or wounding, the emission of several terpenes increases. We have identified and characterized the first two tomato monoterpene synthases, LeMTS1 and LeMTS2. Although these proteins were highly homologous, recombinant LeMTS1 protein produced (R)-linalool from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and (E)-nerolidol from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), while recombinant LeMTS2 produced beta-phellandrene, beta-myrcene, and sabinene from GPP. In addition, these genes were expressed in different tissues: LeMTS1 was expressed in flowers, young leaves, stems, and petioles, while LeMTS2 was strongest expressed in stems and roots. LeMTS1 expression in leaves was induced by spider mite-infestation, wounding and jasmonic acid (JA)-treatment, while LeMTS2 did not respond to these stimuli.

Although these proteins were highly homologous, recombinant LeMTS1 protein produced (R)-linalool from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and (E)-nerolidol from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), while recombinant LeMTS2 produced beta-phellandrene, beta-myrcene, and sabinene from GPP. In addition, these genes were expressed in different tissues: LeMTS1 was expressed in flowers, young leaves, stems, and petioles, while LeMTS2 was strongest expressed in stems and roots. LeMTS1 expression in leaves was induced by spider mite-infestation, wounding and jasmonic acid (JA)-treatment, while LeMTS2 did not respond to these stimuli. The expression of LeMTS1 in stems and petioles was predominantly detected in trichomes and could be induced by JA.

This number is comparable to the number of TPSs found in any of the sequenced and well-annotated angiosperm genomes. We functionally characterized a total of 21 spruce TPSs: 12 from Sitka spruce (P. sitchensis), 5 from white spruce (P. glauca), and 4 from hybrid white spruce (P. glauca \u00d7 P. engelmannii), which included 15 monoterpene synthases, 4 sesquiterpene synthases, and 2 diterpene synthases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The functional diversity of these characterized TPSs parallels the diversity of terpenoids found in the oleoresin and volatile emissions of Sitka spruce and provides a context for understanding this chemical diversity at the molecular and mechanistic levels.

In addition, two novel loci controlling lactones and esters in linkage groups 5 and 6 were discovered.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results presented here give light on the mode of inheritance of the peach volatilome confirming previously loci controlling the aroma of peach but also identifying novel ones.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4067740?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "BMC plant biology", "authorinfo": ["S\u00e1nchez G", "Mart\u00ednez J", "Romeu J", "Garc\u00eda J", "Monforte AJ", "Badenes ML", "Granell A"], "title": "The peach volatilome modularity is reflected at the genetic and environmental response levels in a QTL mapping population."}, "PMC4283982": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "23845065", "source": "MED", "pmid": "23845065", "pmcid": "PMC4283982", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC4283982"}, "doi": "10.1111/nph.12407", "title": "Canopy light cues affect emission of constitutive and methyl jasmonate-induced volatile organic compounds in Arabidopsis thaliana.", "authorString": "Kegge W, Weldegergis BT, Soler R, Eijk MV, Dicke M, Voesenek LACJ, Pierik R.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Kegge W", "firstName": "Wouter", "lastName": "Kegge", "initials": "W", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3027-9562"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Plant Ecophysiology, Institute of Environmental Biology, Utrecht University, 3584 CH, Utrecht, the Netherlands."}}}, {"fullName": "Weldegergis BT", "firstName": "Berhane T", "lastName": "Weldegergis", "initials": "BT", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8838-7876"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Laboratory of Entomology, Wageningen University, PO Box 8031, 6700 EH, Wageningen, the Netherlands."}}}, {"fullName": "Soler R", "firstName": "Roxina", "lastName": "Soler", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Laboratory of Entomology, Wageningen University, PO Box 8031, 6700 EH, Wageningen, the Netherlands."}}}, {"fullName": "Eijk MV", "firstName": "Marleen Vergeer-Van", "lastName": "Eijk", "initials": "MV", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Plant Ecophysiology, Institute of Environmental Biology, Utrecht University, 3584 CH, Utrecht, the Netherlands."}}}, {"fullName": "Dicke M", "firstName": "Marcel", "lastName": "Dicke", "initials": "M", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8565-8896"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Laboratory of Entomology, Wageningen University, PO Box 8031, 6700 EH, Wageningen, the Netherlands."}}}, {"fullName": "Voesenek LACJ", "firstName": "Laurentius A C J", "lastName": "Voesenek", "initials": "LACJ", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3361-3837"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Plant Ecophysiology, Institute of Environmental Biology, Utrecht University, 3584 CH, Utrecht, the Netherlands."}}}, {"fullName": "Pierik R", "firstName": "Ronald", "lastName": "Pierik", "initials": "R", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5320-6817"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Plant Ecophysiology, Institute of Environmental Biology, Utrecht University, 3584 CH, Utrecht, the Netherlands."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8565-8896"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8838-7876"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3027-9562"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3361-3837"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5320-6817"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["related_data", "supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "3", "volume": "200", "journalIssueId": "2083896", "dateOfPublication": "2013 Nov", "monthOfPublication": "11", "yearOfPublication": "2013", "printPublicationDate": "2013-11-01", "journal": {"title": "The New phytologist", "ISOAbbreviation": "New Phytol", "medlineAbbreviation": "New Phytol", "NLMid": "9882884", "ISSN": "0028-646X", "ESSN": "1469-8137"}}, "pubYear": "2013", "pageInfo": "861-874", "abstractText": "The effects of plant competition for light on the emission of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were studied by investigating how different light qualities that occur in dense vegetation affect the emission of constitutive and methyl-jasmonate-induced VOCs.

G. biloba has a broad spectrum of resistance or tolerance to many pathogens and herbivores because of the presence of toxic leaf compounds. Little is known about early and late events occurring in G. biloba upon herbivory. The aim of this study was to assess whether herbivory by the generalist Spodoptera littoralis was able to induce early signaling and direct defense in G. biloba by evaluating early and late responses.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>Early and late responses in mechanically wounded leaves and in leaves damaged by S. littoralis included plasma transmembrane potential (Vm) variations, time-course changes in both cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) and H(2)O(2) production, the regulation of genes correlated to terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, the induction of direct defense compounds, and the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The results show that G. biloba responded to hebivory with a significant Vm depolarization which was associated to significant increases in both [Ca(2+)](cyt) and H(2)O(2). Several defense genes were regulated by herbivory, including those coding for ROS scavenging enzymes and the synthesis of terpenoids and flavonoids. Metabolomic analyses revealed the herbivore-induced production of several flavonoids and VOCs. Surprisingly, no significant induction by herbivory was found for two of the most characteristic G. biloba classes of bioactive compounds; ginkgolides and bilobalides.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>By studying early and late responses of G. biloba to herbivory, we provided the first evidence that this \"living fossil\" plant responds to herbivory with

is one of the most ancient living seed plants and is regarded as a living fossil. G. biloba has a broad spectrum of resistance or tolerance to many pathogens and herbivores because of the presence of toxic leaf compounds. Little is known about early and late events occurring in G. biloba upon herbivory. The aim of this study was to assess whether herbivory by the generalist Spodoptera littoralis was able to induce early signaling and direct defense in G. biloba by evaluating early and late responses.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>Early and late responses in mechanically wounded leaves and in leaves damaged by S. littoralis included plasma transmembrane potential (Vm) variations, time-course changes in both cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) and H(2)O(2) production, the regulation of genes correlated to terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, the induction of direct defense compounds, and the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The results show that G. biloba responded to hebivory with a significant Vm depolarization which was associated to significant increases in both [Ca(2+)](cyt) and H(2)O(2). Several defense genes were regulated by herbivory, including those coding for ROS scavenging enzymes and the synthesis of terpenoids and flavonoids. Metabolomic analyses revealed the herbivore-induced production of several flavonoids and VOCs. Surprisingly, no significant induction by herbivory was found for two of the most characteristic G. biloba classes of bioactive compounds; ginkgolides and bilobalides.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>By studying early and late responses of G. biloba to herbivory, we provided the first evidence that this \"living fossil\" plant responds to herbivory with the same defense mechanisms adopted by the most recent angiosperms.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3308967?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "PloS one", "authorinfo": ["Mohanta TK", "Occhipinti A", "Atsbaha Zebelo S", "Foti M", "Fliegmann J", "Bossi S", "Maffei ME", "Bertea CM"], "title": "Ginkgo biloba responds to herbivory by activating early signaling and direct defenses."}, "PMC3042375": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "21276210", "source": "MED", "pmid": "21276210", "pmcid": "PMC3042375", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC3042375"}, "doi": "10.1186/1475-2859-10-4", "title": "Improving yeast strains using recyclable integration cassettes, for the production of plant terpenoids.", "authorString": "Ignea C, Cvetkovic I, Loupassaki S, Kefalas P, Johnson CB, Kampranis SC, Makris AM.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Ignea C", "firstName": "Codruta", "lastName": "Ignea", "initials": "C", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6304-9413"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Natural Products and Biotechnology, Centre International de Hautes Etudes Agronomiques M\u00e9diterran\u00e9ennes, Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Chania, PO Box 85, Chania 73100, Greece."}}}, {"fullName": "Cvetkovic I", "firstName": "Ivana", "lastName": "Cvetkovic", "initials": "I"}, {"fullName": "Loupassaki S", "firstName": "Sofia", "lastName": "Loupassaki", "initials": "S"}, {"fullName": "Kefalas P", "firstName": "Panagiotis", "lastName": "Kefalas", "initials": "P"}, {"fullName": "Johnson CB", "firstName": "Christopher B", "lastName": "Johnson", "initials": "CB"}, {"fullName": "Kampranis SC", "firstName": "Sotirios C", "lastName": "Kampranis", "initials": "SC", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-6208-1684"}}, {"fullName": "Makris AM", "firstName": "Antonios M", "lastName": "Makris", "initials": "AM"}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-6208-1684"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6304-9413"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "related_data"}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "10", "journalIssueId": "3071347", "dateOfPublication": "2011 Jan", "monthOfPublication": "1", "yearOfPublication": "2011", "printPublicationDate": "2011-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Microbial cell factories", "ISOAbbreviation": "Microb Cell Fact", "medlineAbbreviation": "Microb Cell Fact", "NLMid": "101139812", "ISSN": "1475-2859", "ESSN": "1475-2859"}}, "pubYear": "2011", "pageInfo": "4", "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Terpenoids constitute a large family of natural products, attracting commercial interest for a variety of uses as flavours, fragrances, drugs and alternative fuels.

Muscat flavor determination in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) has up to now been studied by evaluating monoterpenoid levels through QTL analysis. These studies have revealed co-localization of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (VvDXS) with the major QTL positioned on chromosome 5.<h4>Results</h4>We resequenced VvDXS in an ad hoc association population of 148 grape varieties, which included muscat-flavored, aromatic and neutral accessions as well as muscat-like aromatic mutants and non-aromatic offsprings of Muscats. Gene nucleotide diversity and intragenic linkage disequilibrium (LD) were evaluated. Structured association analysis revealed three SNPs in moderate LD to be significantly associated with muscat-flavored varieties. We identified a putative causal SNP responsible for a predicted non-neutral substitution and we discuss its possible implications for flavor metabolism. Network analysis revealed a major star-shaped cluster of reconstructed haplotypes unique to muscat-flavored varieties. Moreover, muscat-like aromatic mutants displayed unique non-synonymous mutations near the mutated site of Muscat genotypes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study is a crucial step forward in understanding the genetic regulation of muscat flavor in grapevine and it also sheds light on the domestication history of Muscats. VvDXS appears to be a possible human-selected locus in grapevine domestication and post-domestication. The putative causal SNP identified in Muscat varieties as well as the unique mutations identifying the muscat-like aromatic mutants under study may be immediately applied in marker-assisted breeding programs aimed at enhancing fragrance and aroma complexity respectively in table grape and wine cultivars.", "affiliation": "Research and Innovation Center, Fondazione Edmund Mach-Istituto Agrario di

"abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The sweet, floral flavor typical of Muscat varieties (Muscats), due to high levels of monoterpenoids (geraniol, linalool and nerol), is highly distinct and has been greatly appreciated both in table grapes and in wine since ancient times. Muscat flavor determination in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) has up to now been studied by evaluating monoterpenoid levels through QTL analysis. These studies have revealed co-localization of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (VvDXS) with the major QTL positioned on chromosome 5.<h4>Results</h4>We resequenced VvDXS in an ad hoc association population of 148 grape varieties, which included muscat-flavored, aromatic and neutral accessions as well as muscat-like aromatic mutants and non-aromatic offsprings of Muscats. Gene nucleotide diversity and intragenic linkage disequilibrium (LD) were evaluated. Structured association analysis revealed three SNPs in moderate LD to be significantly associated with muscat-flavored varieties. We identified a putative causal SNP responsible for a predicted non-neutral substitution and we discuss its possible implications for flavor metabolism. Network analysis revealed a major star-shaped cluster of reconstructed haplotypes unique to muscat-flavored varieties. Moreover, muscat-like aromatic mutants displayed unique non-synonymous mutations near the mutated site of Muscat genotypes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study is a crucial step forward in understanding the genetic regulation of muscat flavor in grapevine and it also sheds light on the domestication history of Muscats. VvDXS appears to be a possible human-selected locus in grapevine domestication and post-domestication. The putative causal SNP identified in Muscat varieties as well as the unique mutations identifying the muscat-like aromatic mutants under study may be immediately applied in marker-assisted breeding programs aimed at enhancing fragrance and aroma complexity respectively in table grape and wine cultivars.", "pdflinks": "http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2229-10-241.pdf", "journaltitle": "BMC plant biology", "authorinfo": ["Emanuelli F", "Battilana J", "Costantini L", "Le Cunff L", "Boursiquot JM", "This P", "Grando MS"], "title": "A candidate gene association study on muscat flavor in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.)."}, "PMC41904": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "7753778", "source": "MED", "pmid": "7753778", "pmcid": "PMC41904", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC41904"}, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.92.10.4164", "title": "Induced oleoresin biosynthesis in grand fir as a defense against bark beetles.", "authorString": "Steele CL, Lewinsohn E, Croteau R.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Steele CL", "firstName": "C L", "lastName": "Steele", "initials": "CL", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Biological Chemistry, Washington State University, Pullman 99164-6340, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Lewinsohn E", "firstName": "E", "lastName": "Lewinsohn", "initials": "E"}, {"fullName": "Croteau R", "firstName": "R", "lastName": "Croteau", "initials": "R"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "10", "volume": "92", "journalIssueId": "755400", "dateOfPublication": "1995 May", "monthOfPublication": "5", "yearOfPublication": "1995", "printPublicationDate": "1995-05-01", "journal": {"title": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "ISOAbbreviation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "medlineAbbreviation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "NLMid": "7505876", "ISSN": "0027-8424", "ESSN": "1091-6490"}}, "pubYear": "1995", "pageInfo": "4164-4168", "abstractText": "Grand fir (Abies grandis) saplings and derived cell cultures are useful systems for studying the regulation of defensive oleoresinosis in conifers, a process involving both the constitutive accumulation of resin (pitch) in specialized secretory structures and the induced production of monoterpene olefins (turpentine) and diterpene resin acids (rosin) by nonspecialized cells at the site of injury.

Cheese was produced every month over a year using nonstandardized milk consisting of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% Jersey milk in Holstein-Friesian milk in a 100-L vat. Actual, theoretical, and moisture-adjusted yield increased linearly with percentage of Jersey milk. This was also associated with increased fat and protein recoveries and lower yield of whey. The composition of whey was also affected by the percentage of Jersey milk, with lower whey protein and higher whey lactose and solids. Cutting time was lower when Jersey milk was used, but the cutting to milling time was higher because of slower acidity development. Hence, overall cheesemaking time was not affected by the use of Jersey milk. Using Jersey milk increased cheese fat content in autumn, winter, and spring and decreased cheese moisture in spring and summer. Cheese protein, salt, and pH levels were not affected. Cheese was analyzed for texture and color, and it was professionally graded at 3 and 8mo.

Cheese was produced every month over a year using nonstandardized milk consisting of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% Jersey milk in Holstein-Friesian milk in a 100-L vat. Actual, theoretical, and moisture-adjusted yield increased linearly with percentage of Jersey milk. This was also associated with increased fat and protein recoveries and lower yield of whey. The composition of whey was also affected by the percentage of Jersey milk, with lower whey protein and higher whey lactose and solids. Cutting time was lower when Jersey milk was used, but the cutting to milling time was higher because of slower acidity development. Hence, overall cheesemaking time was not affected by the use of Jersey milk. Using Jersey milk increased cheese fat content in autumn, winter, and spring and decreased cheese moisture in spring and summer. Cheese protein, salt, and pH levels were not affected. Cheese was analyzed for texture and color, and it was professionally graded at 3 and 8mo. The effect of Jersey on cheese sensory quality was an increase in cheese yellowness during summer and a higher total grading score at 3mo in winter; no other difference in cheese quality was found. The study indicates that using Jersey milk is a valid method of improving Cheddar cheese yield.", "Keywords": ["Jersey", "Cheese Yield", "Cheddar", "Cheese Quality"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7522615?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Journal of dairy science", "authorinfo": ["Bland JH", "Grandison AS", "Fagan CC"], "title": "Effect of blending Jersey and Holstein-Friesian milk on Cheddar cheese processing, composition, and quality."}}
