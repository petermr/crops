ancestors of the plant chloroplast and the purveyors of the oxygen and biomass that shaped the biosphere. Nowadays, cyanobacteria are attracting a growing interest in being able to use solar energy, H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub> and minerals to produce biotechnologically interesting chemicals. This often requires the introduction and expression of heterologous genes encoding the enzymes that are not present in natural cyanobacteria. However, only a handful of model strains with a well-established genetic system are being studied so far, leaving the vast biodiversity of cyanobacteria poorly understood and exploited. In this study, we focused on the robust unicellular cyanobacterium <i>Cyanothece</i> PCC 7425 that has many interesting attributes, such as large cell size; capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen (under anaerobiosis) and to grow not only on nitrate but also on urea (a frequent pollutant) as the sole nitrogen source; capacity to form CO<sub>2</sub>-sequestrating intracellular calcium carbonate granules and to produce various biotechnologically interesting products. We demonstrate for the first time that RSF1010-derived plasmid vectors can be used for promoter analysis, as well as constitutive or temperature-controlled overproduction of proteins and analysis of their sub-cellular localization in <i>Cyanothece</i> PCC 7425. These findings are important because no gene manipulation system had been developed for <i>Cyanothece</i> PCC 7425, yet, handicapping its potential to serve as a model host. Furthermore, using this toolbox, we engineered <i>Cyanothece</i> PCC 7425 to produce the high-value terpene, limonene which has applications in biofuels, bioplastics, cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical industries.
