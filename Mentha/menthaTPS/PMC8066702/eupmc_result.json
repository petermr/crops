However, there is a lack of systematic identification and study of TPS in <i>Mentha</i> plants. In this work, we genome-widely identified and analyzed the <i>TPS</i> gene family in <i>Mentha longifolia</i>, a model plant for functional genomic research in the genus <i>Mentha</i>. A total of 63 <i>TPS</i> genes were identified in the <i>M. longifolia</i> genome sequence assembly, which could be divided into six subfamilies. The <i>TPS-b</i> subfamily had the largest number of genes, which might be related to the abundant monoterpenoids in <i>Mentha</i> plants.

The 63 <i>TPS</i> genes could be mapped to nine scaffolds of the <i>M. longifolia</i> genome sequence assembly and the distribution of these genes is uneven.
