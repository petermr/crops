Research on plant scents has hampered mainly by the invisibility of this character, its dynamic nature, and complex mixtures of components that are present in very small quantities. Most progress in scent research, as in other areas of plant biology, has come from the use of molecular and biochemical techniques. Although volatile components have been identified in several orchid species, the biosynthetic pathways of orchid flower fragrance are far from understood. We investigated how flower fragrance was generated in certain <italic>Phalaenopsis </italic>orchids by determining the chemical components of the floral scent, identifying floral expressed-sequence-tags (ESTs), and deducing the pathways of floral scent biosynthesis in <italic>Phalaneopsis bellina </italic>by bioinformatics analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The main chemical components in the <italic>P. bellina </italic>flower were shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to be monoterpenoids, benzenoids and phenylpropanoids. The set of floral scent producing enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) to geraniol and linalool were recognized through data mining of the <italic>P. bellina </italic>floral EST database (dbEST). Transcripts preferentially expressed in <italic>P. bellina </italic>were distinguished by comparing the scent floral dbEST to that of a scentless species, <italic>P. equestris</italic>, and included those encoding lipoxygenase, epimerase, diacylglycerol kinase and geranyl diphosphate synthase. In addition, EST filtering results showed that transcripts encoding signal transduction and Myb transcription factors and methyltransferase, in addition to those for scent biosynthesis, were detected by <italic>in silico </italic>hybridization of the <italic>P. bellina </italic>unigene database against those of the scentless species, rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Altogether, we pinpointed 66% of the biosynthetic steps from G3P to geraniol, linalool and their derivatives.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This systems biology program combined chemical analysis, genomics and bioinformatics to elucidate the scent biosynthesis pathway and identify the relevant genes. It integrates the forward and reverse genetic approaches to knowledge discovery by which researchers can study non-model plants.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Floral scent is a key modulating factor in plant-insect interactions and thus plays a central role in successful pollination. Closely related plant species that rely on different insects for pollination produce different odors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The floral scent is of paramount importance to plant reproduction and evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>Orchidaceae </italic>is one of the largest monocotyledon families, containing more than 25,000 species. In orchids, large quantities of pollen are formed in masses spread by animals (bees, moths, flies and birds) and the floral scents serve as attractants for species-specific pollinators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These pollinators have played a major role in orchid evolution. The range of odors produced by orchids is enormous, providing an inexhaustible basis for specificity. Such diversity is advantageous in the evolution of an obviously successful family.</p><p>The floral scent is determined by a specific complex mixture of volatile low-molecular-mass molecules dominated by monoterpenoid, sesquiterpenoid, phenylpropanoid and benzenoid compounds and fatty acid derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although the complete pathways leading to the final products have not been characterized, common modifications such as hydroxylation, acetylation and methylation have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These terpenes are synthesized from isopentenyl diphosphate by different mono and sesquiterpene synthases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and via two alternative pathways: the mevalonate pathway from acetyl-CoA, and the methylerythritol phosphate pathway from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, G3P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recently, the chemical structures of many floral scent compounds have been determined and several investigations into their biosynthesis have been described, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The genes encoding enzymes such as linalool synthase, benzylalcohol acetyltransferase and 2 methyltransferases, involved in the biosynthesis of <italic>Clarkia breweri </italic>scent volatiles, have been isolated and characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Similar results were obtained on a methyltransferase that catalyzes methyl benzoate formation in the petals of the snapdragon, <italic>Antirrhinum majus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and sesquiterpene synthase in rose petals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In general, expression of these genes is highest in petals and is restricted to the epidermal cell layers of floral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Recently, expressed sequence tag (EST) has appeared as a powerful tool for genomics research. ESTs have developed into a useful way of discovering the genes for metabolic pathway enzymes in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These high-throughput technologies have therefore helped in identifying new fragrance genes in vegetative tissues and flowers, including three new genes from the deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis in peppermint, <italic>Mentha &#x000d7; Piperita </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], phenylpropene metabolism in sweet basil, <italic>Ocimum basilicum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], diterpene synthesis in <italic>Stevia rivaudiana of Asteraceae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], terpene synthase in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and rose scent-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, the metabolic pathways of volatiles in monocotyledons have not been studied exhaustively and may differ from those in dicotyledons.</p><p><italic>Orchidaceae </italic>have sophisticated flower morphologies including two whorls of perianth segments, three sepals and three petals, one of which is highly evolved as a labellum (lip) and serves as a landing platform for pollinators. The <italic>Orchidaceae </italic>species pollinated by bees, wasps and bumble bees cover a wide range of scents, from rosy- and ionone-floral to aromatic- and spicy-floral. Many volatile components have been identified in <italic>Orchidaceae </italic>flowers from the American tropics, African tropics, Australian tropics and parts of Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, the biosynthetic pathways of orchid flower fragrance are not well understood. Little is known about the enzymes and genes controlling scent production in monocotyledons such as orchids, and the problem of understanding the molecular mechanisms involved is perhaps insurmountable without genomics.</p><p>In this report, we describe the combined use of chemical analysis, genomics and bioinformatics to uncover the scent biosynthesis pathway and the relevant genes. Volatiles from the flower of a scented <italic>Phalaenopsis </italic>species, <italic>P. bellina</italic>, were compared with those from a scentless species by detailed chemical analysis and by identifying secondary metabolism-related genes using EST. We also generated scent-related ESTs by data mining as well as by EST filtering of the <italic>P. bellina </italic>unigenes database against those of scentless <italic>Phalaenopsis</italic>, rice and <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>to identify relevant genes. We characterized genes encoding enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway from pyruvate and G3P to geraniol, linalool and their derivatives. Expression of the scent-related genes was confirmed using RNA blot hybridization. This is the first attempt to deduce the scent biosynthesis pathway in <italic>Phalaenopsis </italic>orchids through systems biology, and the results give biochemical insights into monoterpene biosynthesis in these species.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Major classes of volatiles emitted from <italic>P. bellina </italic>and <italic>P. equestris </italic>flowers</title><p>Taxonomically, the genus <italic>Phalaenopsis </italic>belongs to the family <italic>Orchidaceae</italic>, sub-family Epidendroideae, tribe <italic>Vandeae </italic>and subtribe <italic>Aeridinae</italic>. The genus <italic>Phalaenopsis </italic>is subdivided into five subgenera, namely <italic>Proboscidioides</italic>, <italic>Aphyllae</italic>, <italic>Parishianae</italic>, <italic>Polychilos </italic>and <italic>Phalaenopsis</italic>, and comprises approximately 66 species according to the latest classification of Christenson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. <italic>P. bellina </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a&#x02013;1c</xref>), classified in subgenus <italic>Polychilos</italic>, is native to Malaysia and numerous commercial varieties have been bred because of its pleasant fragrance. It has no linesof scentless varieties, so <italic>P. equestris </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d&#x02013;1f</xref>) was used for comparison. <italic>P. equestris</italic>, subgenus <italic>Phalaenopsis</italic>, is a scentless species native to Taiwan with a colorful perianth. The subgenera <italic>Polychilos </italic>and <italic>Phalaenopsis </italic>diverged more than 21 Mya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>All species of <italic>Phalaenopsis </italic>display a remarkably uniform diploid chromosome number of 38 (2n = 2x = 38); however, their chromosome sizes and centrosome positions vary considerably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although the <italic>P. bellina </italic>karyotype shows large chromosomes with a 2C value of 15.03 pg and that of <italic>P. equestris </italic>shows small chromosomes with a 2C value of 3.37 pg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the two species can be crossed to yield progeny (personal communication from research members at Taiwan Sugar Research Institute).</p><p>Qualitative and quantitative analyses of volatile compounds from <italic>P. bellina </italic>flowers were performed using GC-MS. Monoterpenoids, phenylpropanoids, benzenoids and fatty acid derivatives were detected (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Monoterpenoids including geraniol, linalool and their derivatives (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>) accounted for more than 80% of the total volatiles collected from the <italic>P. bellina </italic>flowers. They included geraniol, nerol, 2,6-dimethyl-octa-3,7-diene-2,6-diol, 2,6-dimethyl-octa-1,7-diene-3,6-diol, 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal, geranic acid and 2,6-dimethyl-octa-2,6-diene-1,8-diol (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>). In contrast, no monoterpenoid derivatives were emitted in the scentless <italic>P. equestris </italic>flowers; fatty acid derivatives, phenylpropanoids, and benzenoids were the major volatiles (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>). These compounds are barely detectable by the human nose.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of <italic>P. bellina </italic>floral dbEST</title><p>Previously, we found that the scent-emitting structures of <italic>P. bellina </italic>were mostly in its perianth but not in its column (data not shown). The column of an orchid flower is a specialized organ comprising fused stamen and carpel, and many genes are involved in regulating its development. To reduce the complexity, we constructed a cDNA library from <italic>P. bellina </italic>flower buds with the columns removed immediately before blooming.</p><p>A total of 2,359 individual 5'-ESTs was retained for the <italic>P. bellina </italic>flower bud with an average length of 916 bp, and the confidence level of the sequences called using PHRED was 22.8 per base. After 247 cDNA clones were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion, the average insert size was 1.2 &#x000b1; 0.32 kb. For better quality annotation, the ESTs were first refined and then the related genes were assembled as unigenes. The assembly program, Sequencher V. 4.1.2, was used to organize the redundant ESTs into unigenes of overlapping contigs at a stringency of 95% identity, with a minimum of 40 bases overlap. This process generated 1,187 unigenes: 499 contigs and 688 singletons. In the <italic>P. bellina </italic>floral dbEST, 1,748 (74.1%) of the 2,359 ESTs showed similarities to known sequences in the Uniprot database. The sequences in the flower bud dbEST were functionally characterized using a Gene Ontology (GO) scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Details of the gene species included in each group are given in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. GO allowed 45.6% of the total ESTs to be placed in the molecular function category, 18.5% in the biological process category and 1.8% in the cellular component category. The remaining 34% either showed insufficient similarities to any proteins (no hits, 25.9%) or hit proteins without a GO identifier (unclassified, 8.1%). Among the molecular functions, the categories most highly represented were the transferases (9.4%), other enzymes excluding hydrolases, kinases and transferases (8.7%), and hydrolases (5.9%). Among the biological processes, the largest proportion (10.9%) of functionally assigned ESTs fell into cellular processes excluding signal transduction, cell organization and biogenesis and transport; other metabolic processes (excluding protein metabolism, DNA metabolism, RNA metabolism, electron transport, energy pathways and transcription) accounted for 4.1%. Together, these two classes of molecular functions and biological processes accounted for 64.1% of the assignable ESTs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of scent biosynthesis pathway using the Pathway and Literature finder (PaL)</title><p>Analysis of the volatiles showed that monoterpenoids, including geraniol, linalool and their derivatives, are major compounds of <italic>P. bellina </italic>flower scent (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), so it is reasonable to speculate that monoterpenoids are biosynthesized in these flowers. To identify candidate genes in the DXP-geraniol-linalool pathway of <italic>Phalaenopsis</italic>, we developed a Pathway and Literature finder system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Five deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) and one deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate reductase (DXPR) related ESTs were mapped to the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, which was included in the Biosynthesis of Steroid pathway in KEGG database. No ESTs were mapped to the Terpenoid Biosynthesis or Monoterpenoid Biosynthesis pathways in KEGG. Possible reasons why only two types of ESTs were identified corresponding to the MEP pathway might include sequence diversification in different species and incompleteness of the KEGG collection of pathways. To extract further ESTs related to the DXP-geraniol-linalool pathway, EST annotations, the volatile components identified by GC-MS and the relevant PubMed literature were combined.</p><p>In the PaL system, we used 'plant terpene biosynthesis pathway and linalool' or 'plant linalool compound and scent' or 'plant geraniol' as background set keywords to collect literature from PubMed, and 'geranyl diphospate synthase' as functional keywords to search EST annotations. The program then connected the chosen keywords, ESTs and literature (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>). Other sets of keywords were also applied to repeat the process (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">Additional file 3</xref>).</p><p>On this basis, we elucidated the floral scent biosynthesis pathway in <italic>P. bellina </italic>further in accordance with the GC-MS data on geraniol, 2,6-dimethyl-octa-2,6-dien-1,8-diol and citronellol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We identified major steps in the pathway from pyruvate and G3P to geraniol, linalool and their derivatives (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These included genes encoding deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS), deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate reductase (DXPR), 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2-phosphate cyclase (DMEC), EPI, GDPS and cytochrome P450. The biosynthetic pathway for linalool and its derivatives, including linalool oxide, was also deduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ESTs differentially expressed between the floral dbESTs of <italic>P. bellina </italic>and <italic>P. equestris</italic></title><p>Comparisons of the most abundant ESTs by calculating the enrichment factor (defined below) for different transcripts in the floral dbESTs of <italic>P. bellina </italic>and <italic>P. equestris </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] facilitate the provisional identification of scent metabolism genes. The enrichment factor was obtained by dividing the proportion of a certain transcript in the scented species by that in the scentless species. Statistical significance was determined using the simple Monte Carlo Test (&#x003b1; &#x02264; 0.05). Geranyl diphosphate synthase (GDPS), EPI, LOX and diacylglycerol kinase (DAK) showed 16.6, 10.0, 9.9 and 9.5-fold enrichments, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). GDPS was significantly differentially expressed in the scented species (0.30% in <italic>P. bellina </italic>vs. 0.02% in <italic>P. equestris</italic>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). GDPS participates in the biosynthesis of monoterpenes in plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] primarily by supplying the essential precursor, suggesting that <italic>P. bellina </italic>may produce scent molecules in the plastids rather than the cytoplasm. Among the ESTs of the <italic>P. bellina </italic>flower bud, EPI (1.61% in <italic>P. bellina </italic>vs. 0.16% in <italic>P. equestris</italic>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) is a multi-functional protein with hydratase, dehydrogenase, epimerase and isomerase activities involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation in plant peroxisomes and glyoxysomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. DAK, enriched in the scented species (0.34% in <italic>P. bellina </italic>vs. 0.04% in <italic>P. equestris</italic>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), converts diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, which has been shown to accumulate rapidly in plant cells in response to stimuli and may function as a signal molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. If so, DAK may serve as a signal molecule for day-fragrance in <italic>P. bellina </italic>rather than being involved in scent biosynthesis directly.</p><p>In addition, expansin showed a 4.2-fold higher abundance in the scented species (0.68% in <italic>P. bellina </italic>vs. 0.16% in <italic>P. equestris</italic>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Expansin loosens plant cell walls and thereby stimulates cell enlargement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In orchids, expansin may burst the cell walls in the epithelium to release scent components. Indeed, transmission electron microscopy shows that bulges extend from the outer epidermis cell walls during flowering of <italic>P. bellina </italic>(unpublished results). Interestingly, our results show that peroxidase (1.36% in <italic>P. bellina </italic>vs. 0.39% in <italic>P. equestris</italic>, a 3.5-fold enrichment) might be related to scent metabolism.</p><p>More than 2-fold increases of O-methyltransferase transcripts (0.78% in <italic>P. bellina </italic>vs. 0.30% in <italic>P. equestris</italic>, a 2.6-fold enrichment) and cytochrome P450 transcripts (0.97% in <italic>P. bellina </italic>vs. 0.48% in <italic>P. equestris</italic>, a 2-fold enrichment) were also observed in <italic>P. bellina </italic>flowers. Previous research has shown that O-methyltransferase is involved in many reactions in volatile biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. O-methyltransferase methylates a wide range of substrates such as catechols, phenylpropanoids, orcinol and isoquinoline, all of which are involved in modifying scent molecules upon induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Cytochrome P450 can act as a hydroperoxide lyase and catalyze the cleavage of lipoxygenase products (fatty acid hydroperoxides), forming omega-oxoacids and volatile C6- and C9-aldehydes and alcohols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

LOX enzymes can be grouped into two types: 9-LOX, which specifically forms 9- hydroperoxy derivatives of fatty acids (9-HPOs), and 13-LOX, which specifically forms 13-HPOs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Interestingly, we discovered that three different kinds of 9-LOX-like ESTs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>) accounted for 2.12% of the <italic>P. bellina </italic>flower dbEST (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). One of them (<italic>PLOX3</italic>) was specific to the <italic>P. bellina </italic>flower. However, no 13-LOX-like ESTs were observed in such flowers. In contrast, only 0.21% of the floral dbEST of <italic>P. equestris </italic>encoded LOX, and both 9-LOX and 13-LOX were detected (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>). In addition, four cytochrome P450 enzymes of the CYP74 subfamily-related ESTs represented as one gene were mined in the <italic>P. bellina </italic>flower dbEST.

However, novel scent-related genes that have not been reported, or their sequences are too divergent from known ones, would not be identified by using the PaL finder. In addition, genes with low expression levels would not easily be identified by enrichment factor analysis. To detect still more scent-related genes, we performed EST filtering using less stringent conditions to remove genes homologous between <italic>P. bellina </italic>and <italic>P. equestris</italic>. The 1,187 <italic>P. bellina </italic>unigenes were filtered against the 3,555 floral unigenes of <italic>P. equestris </italic>using TBLASTX at an E-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>-5</sup>. The ESTs left over after filtering with the minimum acceptable threshold (E-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>-5</sup>) could plausibly represent non-homologous transcripts in <italic>P. bellina</italic>.</p><p>The results showed that 820 unigenes of <italic>P. bellina </italic>did not match the <italic>P. equestris </italic>unigene database (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The EST filtering results revealed genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway from pyruvate and G3P to linalool, geraniol and their derivatives in floral unigenes of <italic>P. bellina</italic>, consistent with the chemical analysis results showing that no linalool and geraniol were emitted from the floral organs of <italic>P. equestris</italic>. However, the filtered results may not account only for fragrance genes; some filtered unigenes may be involved in morphogenetic networks. Interestingly, <italic>P. bellina </italic>(colored from red to orange in petal and lip) and <italic>P. equestris </italic>(red petal, orange lip) have similar color spectra, so EST filtering eliminated the genes involved in the biosynthesis pathways for flower colors and reduced the complexity of analysis. Indeed, the fact that no anthocyanin biosynthesis genes were identified in the EST filtering results is evidence for the efficacy of EST filtering.</p><p>Further EST filtering by use of TBLASTX against the collected floral unigenes of rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which both lack fragrance, removed the genes involved in morphogenesis. An E-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>-7 </sup>was applied for the TBLASTX program, and the matched results with fewer ribosomal proteins and housekeeping genes were accepted. Unigenes with significant BLAST search results were classified as homologous genes among rice, <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and <italic>P. bellina</italic>. Altogether, 365 unigenes remained unmatched and included fewer housekeeping genes at E-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>-7</sup>, and thus were defined as <italic>P. bellina </italic>scent-related genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><p>A total of 330 unigenes common to the above two EST filtering results constituted a more refined set of scent-related genes in <italic>P. bellina </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). These transcripts included genes for NADPHDH, EPI, molybdopterin biosynthesis cofactors and GDPS (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Concomitantly, EPI and GDPS were among the highly expressed transcripts, and molybdopterin biosynthesis cofactors were only expressed in the <italic>P. bellina </italic>flower buds (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Our results also suggest that NADPHDH and cytochrome P450 are required for the formation of linalool and geraniol derivatives (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). From the chemical and bioinformatic analyses, we deduced a monoterpene biosynthesis pathway of 15 steps in the <italic>P. bellina </italic>flower, leading from G3P to geraniol, linalool and their derivatives. ESTs corresponding to 10 of these steps (66 %) were identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>Transcripts encoding signal transduction factors such as sensor proteins, membrane proteins and mitogen-activated protein kinase were also identified (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), suggesting that scent emission may be related to stimuli that elicit a series of signal transduction processes leading to gene expression and scent production. We also detected ferrochelatase, as well as Myb family protein (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), which has been shown to regulate the biosynthesis of petunia flower fragrance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, we could not rule out the possibility that the ESTs identified by enrichment factor analysis were merely the results of incompleteness and bias in the dataset used in this analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmation of scent-related genes by RNA blot hybridization</title><p>Differential expression of several of the identified scent-related genes was confirmed by RNA blot hybridization. <italic>PEPI3 </italic>was highly expressed in the scented species but rarely expressed in the scentless species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

The same blot was hybridized to a probe encoding a ribosomal RNA indicating that each individual lane had been loaded with the same amount of RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These results were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis of floral ESTs preferentially expressed in the scent species.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we developed a PaL system to facilitate the identification of literature and pathway information related to certain ESTs. Unlike PubMed, which can only provide keyword searches without identifying the papers really related to ESTs of interest to the user, PaL also provides an easier search platform for demonstrating which of the sequences in hand is engaged in a certain KEGG pathway. In PaL, BLAST is used for alignment in batch (BLASTALL) and its alignment results are parsed to extract such information. Thus, the PaL system covers the BLAST function. We drew the candidate scent biosynthesis pathway manually. In addition, we recognized enriched transcripts by comparing the floral unigene databases for scent and scentless species, and by EST filtering to identify other genes for scent biosynthesis and scent modification candidates. Systematic collection of ESTs and retrieval of related research documents from public databases were highly rewarding strategies for studying these non-model plants, particularly since genomic information is limited in orchids. Efficient connection of the biological components with related literature by computational methods was a useful strategy for deducing the metabolic pathways.</p><p>In this study, we were able to identify genes, including those for DXPS, DXPR, DMEC, GDPS, EPI, NADPHDH and cytochrome P450, all involved in the DXP-geraniol-linalool pathway, by combining EST data mining with metabolic profiling and analysis of volatiles and EST filtering. Although comparison with scentless plant material would in principle be optimal if isogenic scentless <italic>P. bellina </italic>lines could be used, no such variants yet exist. The flowers of <italic>P. bellina </italic>and <italic>P. equestris </italic>express similar sets of genes determining the nature of the organ even though they are phenotypically different. However, their final appearance, including scent, may be determined by a relatively small number of genes expressed in a cultivar-specific manner.</p><p>All monoterpenes are formed from GDP, which is synthesized from dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The high expression level of GDPS in <italic>P. bellina </italic>flowers suggests that scent biosynthesis in this species is predominately due to production of geraniol and linalool from DXP. Thus, EST data mining and EST filtering were informative in identifying genes among different dbESTs from different sources and may be applicable for comparative genomics.</p><p>Monoterpene synthase genes have been identified in both floral and vegetative organs of several angiosperms and gymnosperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] Of special interest in this respect are studies of terpene synthases, a large class of enzymes that appear to be responsible for most of the structural variety of terpenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, terpene synthase was not identified in <italic>P. bellina </italic>in this work. We have applied an HMM based method such as Interpro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] to validate whether any such protein domains were in fact present in the dataset. Results showed that no any terpene synthase domains were present in the <italic>P. bellina </italic>floral EST database. The low sequence-relatedness among monoterpene synthases in angiosperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] might have added to the difficulty; thus far, few terpene synthase genes have been identified in monocotyledons. In addition, these genes may belong to families with high diversity in non-conserved regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A further attempt to identify them was conducted by <italic>in silico </italic>hybridization using known monoterpene synthase genes as electronic probes, but neither linalool synthase nor geraniol synthase genes were found. The pool in the <italic>P. bellina </italic>EST database may be insufficient, so that not all genes in the scent biosynthesis pathway &#x02013; including monoterpene synthase genes &#x02013; have been identified. Alternatively, there may be regulation of the scent biosynthesis at the precursor level, and the enzymes responsible for synthesis are not transcriptionally regulated. Previous studies have shown that linalool synthase levels and activities in <italic>Clarkia breweri </italic>remain high while linalool emission decreases, suggesting that regulation of terpenoid precursors occurs in <italic>C. breweri </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>Both EPI and NADPHDH are multifunctional and are involved in &#x003b2;-oxidation and reduction reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. <italic>PEPI3 </italic>showed a distinct expression profile in the scented species and thus may be correlated with scent biosynthesis via the geraniol-linalool pathway. Altogether, our results suggest that EPI, cytochrome P450 and NADPHDH are related to monoterpenoid biosynthesis in orchids.</p><p>The role of the LOX pathway in plant-pathogen interactions and the importance of 13-LOXs and their product jasmonate in resistance against insects and pathogens have been analyzed in numerous pathosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] The 9-LOX pathway generates a group of metabolites that are structurally related to, but distinct from, those derived from the 13-LOX pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In our results, a much lower level of fatty acid derivatives was observed in <italic>P. bellina </italic>flowers than in <italic>P. equestris </italic>flowers (3.3 &#x000b1; 1.8 vs. 330.5 &#x000b1; 35.0 ng/flower/h; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Since no 13-LOX pathway genes were expressed in <italic>P. bellina</italic>, its fatty acid derivatives were produced mostly by the 9-LOX pathway. However, there was a discrepancy in that 9-LOX ESTs were the most abundant ESTs in <italic>P. bellina </italic>flowers, but fatty acid derivatives were at very low levels in its volatiles. These results suggest that fatty acid derivatives produced by the 9-LOX pathway in <italic>P. bellina </italic>flowers are mostly not volatiles. Recently, 9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12(Z), 15(Z)-octadecandienoic acid (KODA) biosynthesized by 9-LOX and AOS were shown to have flower-inducing activity in <italic>Lemna </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Although the biological function of the high levels of <italic>9-LOX </italic>expression in <italic>P. bellina </italic>flowers is unclear, the expression of <italic>PbLOX </italic>may control the synthesis of some signal for flower scent formation or emission. In addition, many lipid bodies were observed in the petal epidermis of <italic>P. bellina </italic>by transmission electron microscopy (data not shown), suggesting that the 9-LOXs are involved in converting storage lipids into substrates for further oxidation to provide energy for scent emission. It will be important to demonstrate products of the 9-LOX pathway <italic>in vivo </italic>and functionally characterize genes that encode 9-LOX and other enzymes involved in this pathway in order to understand their relationships to floral scent formation and emission in <italic>P. bellina</italic>.</p><p>Despite the popularity of <italic>Phalaenopsis </italic>species in cultivation, very little is known about their ecology and distribution in nature. So far, there have been no reports indicating the kind of insects that visit <italic>P. bellina </italic>or <italic>P. equestris </italic>in the wild. Flowers of <italic>Phalaenopsis </italic>spp., with its colorful perianth, are pollinated by bees and produce fragrances during the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Bumble bees are primarily attracted from a distance to visual stimuli, whereas landing depends upon both visual and olfactory cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The complex fragrances and vivid colors in <italic>P. bellina </italic>suggest that this species probably attracts pollinators by both olfactory and visual stimuli. In contrast, the strictly visual strategy used by <italic>P. equestris </italic>to attract pollination vectors is the presentation of the colored perianth. Although <italic>P. equestris </italic>has small flowers (1.0&#x02013;1.2 cm in diameter), it produces many more flowers in a peduncle compared to <italic>P. bellina</italic>, which produces 1 to 3 larger flowers (5&#x02013;6 cm in diameter) per plant but with fragrance. It seems logical that the evolution of <italic>Orchidaceae</italic>, a family that was probably already highly "pollinator-oriented" at its inception, further augmented the complexity of the pollination mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The emission of volatiles from <italic>P. bellina </italic>flowers may have evolutionary significance and thus increase reproductive fitness in orchids.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work we have shown how EST research can be usefully applied to the construction of a putative scent metabolism pathway in <italic>P. bellina </italic>and the identification of the genes encoding the enzymes involved in this pathway.
