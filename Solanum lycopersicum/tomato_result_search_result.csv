After the amplification of 35 PCR cycles, the concentration of the amplified  ChTps1 fragment was compared visually (Supplementary Fig.  S3). The amount of  ChTps1 transcript was high in the flowers, but quite low in the leaves and stems. Thus,  ChTps1 expression was flower specific. GC-MS analysis of  Camellia hiemalis floral scent About 30 years have passed since  C.  hiemalis volatile compounds were analyzed by Omata  et al. 28. Therefore, we performed a qualitative analysis of the floral scent of  C.  hiemalis by GC-MS (Supplementary Table  S1). The most abundant component was a phenyl propanoid, eugenol, which comprised more than 80% of the total floral scent compounds. Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were also detected, and these volatile terpenes accounted for about 10%, largely consisting of linalool and its derivatives. This result agreed with that of Omata  et al. 28, which detected linalool and linalool oxide as the major compounds in  C.  hiemalis cultivars. Sesquiterpene elemol and guaiol were detected as the minor components. Functional characterization of CsiTPS8 As mentioned above, we found that the amino acid sequence of  Camellia sinensis CsiTPS8 was quite similar to that of ChTPS1 (ChTPS1a) (Fig.  1). CsiTPS8 had only one amino acid substitution R477H, which located in the loop structure (Supplementary Fig.  S4). Since the product of CsiTPS8 was not reported in the NCBI database, we prepared a substituted construct encoding ChTPS1 variant R477H, which has the same amino acid sequence with that of CsiTPS8, and analyzed the product extracted from the transformed  E.  coli. We consequently found that the products of ChTPS1 (R477H) were the same as that of ChTPS1, and the primary product was valerianol (Supplementary Fig.  S5). The product amounts of the R477H clone averaged 40 percent increase in comparison with that of ChTPS1 (Supplementary Fig.  S6). As for valerianol (the peak 2 area), 46.5 ± 6.0% (n = 3) increased. Structure-activity relationship studies of  ChTPS1 The plausible 3D structural model of ChTPS1 was built by SWISS-MODEL 40 using the pdb of Tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase 16 as the template. Then the ChTPS1 3D model was applied to predict the effect of amino acid substitutions (Supplementary Table  S2). The substitution sites were roughly divided into 3 parts: surface, internal and loop. Substitutions on the molecular surface would have a little effect on the enzyme activity, whereas those exist in the internal part might have some effect interacting with neighboring residues. The loop, which means β-turn between α-helices, sometimes locates at the surface of the molecule and contributes to determine the molecular structure. Hence, substitutions in the loop would change the structure and have severe effects in some cases. Supplementary Table  S2 summarized these effects of substitutions in the ChTPS1 clones. Intriguingly, ChTPS1 clones contained 4 substitutions in the loops and 2 of them showed characteristic changes of the enzyme activity. One was K541N, which increased the Peak 1 ratio, mentioned above, and the other was R477H (see below). R477 is located at the loop and forms an ionic bond with E487 located at the α-helices based on the model structure. And the α-helices (483–493) is forming the hydrophobic interaction with the next α-helices (440–461) containing one of the the TPS-conserved motifs (Supplementary Fig.  S2). Phylogenetic analysis of  ChTPS1 The ChTPS1 protein was analyzed phylogenetically by comparison with known plant TPSs registered in the NCBI database (Fig.  1). TPS proteins derived from the same plant species or family tended to fall into the same clade, except for Poplar TPSs. ChTPS1 was phylogenetically positioned with the TPSs of other  Camellia species in a sole-gene clade. The amino acid sequence of  Camellia sinensis TPS8 (CsiTPS8) was quite similar to that of ChTPS1 and had only one amino acid substitution (R477H) except for the N-terminal extension. CbTPS1, which we have isolated and reported as hedycaryol synthase recently 30, was also similar to ChTPS1, and 9 amino acid substitutions existed (Supplemental Fig.  S2). Isolation of  ChTps1 and its paralogs from Camellia flower Since the existence of several volatile terpenes in the floral scent was reconfirmed by the GC-MS analysis, we decided to isolate  Tps ( ChTps) genes from  C.  hiemalis. For their isolation, degenerate primers designed based on the nucleotide sequences deduced from DDxxD motif (described above) were used. A partial  Tps cDNA fragment including its 5′-end was obtained by degenerate RT-PCR, using cDNA prepared from a  C.  hiemalis flower as the template. Subsequently, a full-length  Tps sequence was acquired by performing 3′-RACE. Depending on this sequence, 5′ and 3′-end primers were synthesized, and more than 20 full-length  Tps clones were isolated by PCR with high fidelity. These sequences were analyzed based on multiplicity of clones with the same sequence or the formation of an ORF, classified into seven genes, and designated  ChTps1a,  ChTps1b,  ChTps1c,  ChTps1d,  ChTps1e,  ChTps1f, and  ChTps1g, which have several substitutions  or a deletion ( ChTps1d)  (Table  1).  ChTps1a was also named  ChTps1, since it was found to be the representative corresponding gene as analyzed later. Four, three, and four clones had the same sequence to those of  ChTps1a,  ChTps1b, and  ChTps1c, respectively. As for  ChTps1d,  ChTps1e,  ChTps1f, and  ChTps1g,  only one clone each was obtained. These genes were inserted into the expression vector, introduced into  E.  coli together with plasmid pAC-Mev/Scidi/Aacl 36, and the amount of TPS products was compared (mentioned below). The clone  ChTps1a showed the highest enzyme activity. Therefore, we designated this clone as  ChTps1 and the encoded protein as ChTPS1. Supplemental Fig.  S2 shows the alignment of ChTPS1 and other TPS amino acid sequences isolated by our group. ChTPS1 consisted of 554 amino acids (aa) with a calculated molecular mass of 64.1 kDa. D-rich motifs, such as the RDR (270–272), DDxxD (307–311), and NSE/DTE (452–460) motifs, are conserved. No transit peptide was found at the N-terminus of the ChTPS1 protein by the iPSORT 37 prediction. GC-MS analysis of volatile compounds in green tea, roasted stem tea, and black tea Various teas, such as green tea and black tea, are consumed widely 41. Many researchers have analyzed fragrances of these teas, which contain several unknown compounds 29,  41. Since tea is extracted from young leaves (and stems) of  C.  sinensis, which has CsiTPS8, we expected that one of the unknown compounds in tea is valerianol. Figure  5 shows the result of GC-MS analyses of these teas. Valerianol was detected in green tea and black tea, although the peak intensities of valerianol in both teas were about 1/1000 of that in the recombinant  E.  coli extract (data not shown). Inhibitory effects of sesquiterpenes on induction of EBV-EA activation by TPA We finally carried out  in vitro functional analysis of the purified valerianol against tumor promoter activity, since there were no reports on its physiological functions. As such a screening study for anti-tumor promoters, valerianol and other several sesquiterpenes, β-eudesmol, elemol, α-selinene, and γ-amorphene, were examined for their inhibitory effects on induction of Epstein-Barr virus-early antigen (EBV-EA) activation in Raji cells by 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) 42. As a result, all the sesquiterpenes exhibited moderate inhibitory activity with very weak cytotoxicity on Raji cells, as shown in Table  2. Valerianol showed the strongest inhibitory activity among the examined sesquiterpenes. Functional characterization of  ChTPS1 and its paralogs in the mevalonate-pathway-engineered  E. coli As mentioned above, seven  ChTps1a-g clones were individually expressed in the MVA-pathway-engineered  E.  coli that can utilize acetoacetate as a substrate 35, and sesquiterpenes synthesized by each clone were analyzed by GC-MS. An empty vector clone showed two peaks (Fig.  2b). The predicted compounds of Peaks 4 and 5 were farnesol and farnesyl acetate, respectively, which are likely to be derived from FPP, and were found to disappear in the ChTps1 products, generating several new peaks, instead (Fig.  2a). Thus, we focused on three new distinct peaks (Peaks 1, 2, and 3) that were considered to be the ChTPS1 (ChTPS1a) products. The MS of the predominant product (Peak 2) had the highest similarity to that of guaiol in the MS database (Fig.  2e,f). We then mixed authentic guaiol with the ChTPS1 products, and carried out GC-MS analysis. As a result, the peaks of Peak 2 and guaiol were not overlapped, indicating that Peak 2 was not guaiol (Fig.  2h–j). Thus, the Peak 2 compound was purified, and subjected to 1D ( 1H and  13C) and 2D ( 1H- 1H COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY) NMR spectroscopic analyses (in CDCl 3).  1H and  13C NMR and HSQC spectral analysis of the Peak 2 compound confirmed that it possessed 4 methyls, 5 sp 3 methylenes, 2 sp 3 methines, 2 sp 3 quarternary carbons, 1 sp 2 methine, and 1 sp 2 quarternary carbon. Further, two vicinal  1H spin networks of H-1-H-11 and H-6 to H-9 (bold line in Fig.  3a) observed in the  1H- 1H COSY spectrum and the key  1H- 13C long range couplings observed in the HMBC spectrum (arrows in Fig.  3a) proved the planar structure of the Peak 2 compound as shown in Fig.  3a. The relative configuration of the Peak 2 compound was analyzed by NOESY spectrum, and the observed key NOEs (arrows in Fig.  3b) proved the relative configuration of the Peak 2 compound as shown in Fig.  3b. From these observations, the Peak 2 compound was identified to be valerianol. These results indicated that ChTPS1 synthesizes valerianol as the predominant product. The MS of Peak 1 (minor) coincided to that of elemol, while the MS of Peak 3 (minor) was an unknown sesquiterpene, (Fig.  2c,d,g). In order to check whether Peak 1 was elemol or not, we mixed authentic elemol with the ChTPS1 products, and carried out GC-MS analysis. Consequently, the peaks of Peak 1 and elemol were overlapped, indicating that the Peak 1 GC product was elemol (data not shown). Elemol was reported to be a thermal rearrangement product from hedycaryol 30,  38. It is therefore likely that elemol originated from hedycaryol during the heating-up process of GC-MS. The Peak 1 compound was confirmed to be hedycaryol by HPLC analysis, the same as described previously (data not shown) 30. The plausible conformations of hedycaryol were reported by Faraldos  et al. 39 Based on these results,  ChTps1 ( ChTps1a) was identified as a novel gene encoding valerianol  valerianol/hedycaryol (minor)  synthase (Fig.  3c). This is the first report on a gene that can mediate the synthesis of valerianol. The product amounts of all ChTPS1 substitution clones were less than ChTPS1 (ChTPS1a) (Fig.  4). In comparison with peak areas of each clone (Fig.  4), Peaks 1 and 3 were the third and second largest abundant products, respectively, in ChTPS1a, b, c, and e. As for the ChTPS1f product, the second and third most abundant products were in reverse order. These two sesquiterpenes were contained equally in the product of ChTPS1g. As for ChTPS1d, no TPS product was observed. These differences in each ChTPS1 product amount were attributed to the differences in amino acid sequences (Table  1). For example, Peak 2 valerianol amounts of ChTPS1c and f were almost the same, but the Peak1 hedycaryol amount of ChTPS1f was about 4 times higher than that of ChTPS1c (Fig.  4). This difference in the ChTPS1f enzyme activity was induced by the single amino acid substitution K541N (Table  1). ChTPS1g and d have a similar amino acid sequence except for a deletion from the 396 to 430 amino acid region of ChTPS1d (Table  1), which was the cause of inactivation (Fig.  4).","Seven cDNA clones encoding terpene synthases (TPSs), their structures closely related to each other, were isolated from the flower of Camellia hiemalis ('Kantsubaki'). Their putative TPS proteins were phylogenetically positioned in a sole clade with the TPSs of other Camellia species. The obtained Tps genes, one of which was designated ChTps1 (ChTps1a), were introduced into mevalonate-pathway-engineered Escherichia coli, which carried the genes for utilizing acetoacetate as a substrate, and cultured in a medium including lithium acetoacetate. Volatile products generated in the E. coli cells transformed with ChTps1 were purified from the cell suspension culture, and analyzed by NMR. Consequently, the predominant product with ChTPS1 was identified as valerianol, indicating that the ChTps1 gene codes for valerianol synthase. This is the first report on a gene that can mediate the synthesis of valerianol. We next synthesized a Tps ortholog encoding ChTPS1variant R477H (named CsiTPS8), whose sequence had been isolated from a tea tree (Camellia sinensis), carried out similar culture experiment with the E. coli transformant including CsiTps8, and consequently found valerianol production equally. Furthermore, GC-MS analysis of several teas revealed that valerianol had been an unknown ingredient in green tea and black tea.",NaN," 'Fig.', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'peak', 'amino acid', 'Supplementary Table', 'peaks', 'product', 'Supplementary', 'amino', 'acid' "," CsiTPS8, CsiTPS8, ChTPS1 (, ChTPS1a, CsiTPS8, ChTPS1, CsiTPS8, ChTPS1 (, ChTPS1, valerianol, ChTPS1 (Supplementary Fig.  S6, valerianol, ChTPS1, α-helices, K541N, 483–493, TPS-conserved, ChTPS1, ChTPS1, CsiTPS8, ChTPS1, CbTPS1, hedycaryol synthase, ChTPS1, ChTps, 3′-RACE, 5′, ChTps1d) , plasmid pAC-Mev/Scidi/Aacl, ChTPS1, ChTPS1, ChTPS1, RDR, 270–272, 307–311, ChTPS1, green tea, CsiTPS8, valerianol, Valerianol, valerianol, EBV-EA, valerianol, valerianol, β-eudesmol, EBV-EA, Valerianol, ChTps1, ChTPS1, ChTPS1a, ChTPS1, H-1-H-11, NOESY, valerianol, ChTPS1, valerianol, ChTPS1, Faraldos  , ChTps1a, valerianol  , valerianol, ChTPS1, ChTPS1, ChTPS1a, 3, ChTPS1a, b,, c, ChTPS1f, ChTPS1g., ChTPS1d, ChTPS1, ChTPS1c, f, ChTPS1f, ChTPS1c (, ChTPS1f, K541N (Table  1, ChTPS1, ChTPS1d "," 'CsiTPS8', 'CsiTPS8', 'ChTPS1', '(ChTPS1a)', 'CsiTPS8', 'CsiTPS8', 'ChTPS1', 'CsiTPS8,', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1,', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', 'TPS-conserved', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs.', 'ChTPS1', 'TPSs', 'TPS8', '(CsiTPS8)', 'ChTPS1', 'CbTPS1,', 'ChTPS1,', 'TPS', 'ChTPS1.', 'ChTPS1', 'TPS', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', 'CsiTPS8,', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', '(ChTPS1a)', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1', '(ChTPS1a)', 'ChTPS1a,', 'ChTPS1f', 'ChTPS1g.', 'ChTPS1d,', 'TPS', 'ChTPS1', 'ChTPS1c', 'ChTPS1f', 'ChTPS1c', 'ChTPS1f', 'ChTPS1g', 'ChTPS1d' "," 'GC-MS.', 'GC-MS.'

Here, we applied combined acute ozone and wounding stresses to the constitutive isoprenoid-emitter  Eucalyptus globulus  and studied how isoprene, 1,8-cineole, and isoledene synthase genes were regulated, and how the gene expression was associated with temporal changes in photosynthetic characteristics, product emission rates, and stomatal ozone uptake through recovery phase. Photosynthetic characteristics and emission rate of isoprene, 1,8-cineole, and isoledene were synergistically altered, while three TPS gene expressions were antagonistically altered by combined stress applications. A time-delay analysis indicated that the best correspondences between gene expression and product emission rates were observed for 0 h time-shift for wounding and 0-2 h time-shifts for separate ozone, and combined ozone and wounding treatments. The best correspondence between ozone uptake and gene expression was observed for 0-4 h time-shifts for separate ozone and combined ozone and wounding treatments.

SiTPS Is Induced during Root-Colonization Expression of  SiTPS was studied under two different growth conditions. Relative expression of  SiTPS was quantified in fungal biomass from 14-day-old  S. indica colonies, grown on complete medium (CM) agar plates and compared to expression in  S. indica-colonized tomato roots (11 days post inoculation, dpi) ( Figure 3). Gene expression was significantly upregulated by 3-fold when  S. indica was growing  in planta in comparison to the control samples. 3.4. Role of SiTPS during S. indica-Colonization of Tomato Roots The ratio of fungal DNA to plant DNA was used as a measurement of the colonization ability of each  S. indica strain. The colonization ratio was estimated in colonized roots at 2 and 11 dpi, but no difference was observed in the colonization ability between the over-expressing and the empty vector-carrying transformants at the selected time-points. No difference was observed in colonization ability between  S. indica transformants and the wild type either ( Table 1). Even though  SiTPS was shown to express a functional viridiflorol synthase in  E. coli expression systems, no terpenoids have been detected previously in  S. indica cultures   48 . In addition, data showing  SiTPS upregulation in fungal tissues associated with tomato roots ( Figure 3) suggested that SiTPS products might play a role during plant colonization. To investigate the role of SiTPS in root colonization,  S. indica mutants over-expressing  SiTPS were designed. According to the antiSMASH analysis performed on the  S. indica genome, SiTPS is a stand-alone gene and none of the genes in genomic proximity is related to terpene biosynthesis ( Supplementary Figure S2). Based on that, we hypothesized that overexpressing  SiTPS would have an accumulative effect on the amount of compounds produced. After protoplast transformation, the regenerative clones were screened for having all four mating type genes (heterokaryotes) ( Supplementary Figure S5A) and one  SiTPS-overexpressing transformant (ovII) was selected and checked for  SiTPS expression ( Supplementary Figure S5B). The ovII strain was used in time-course colonization experiments to evaluate its ability to colonize plant roots. An  S. indica-transformant carrying the empty vector (control treatment-evV) and the wild type  S. indica were also used in this colonization study.  3.3. SiTPS Encodes for a Viridiflorol Synthase The biochemical activity of SiTPS was elucidated by using an in vitro and in vivo heterologous expression system ( Figure 4). In the in vitro assays, the purified SiTPS, heterologously produced in  E. coli cultures, was incubated with three terpene substrates (geranyl diphosphate- GPP,  E,E-FPP and geranylgeranyl diphosphate-  E,E,E-GGPP). Hexane extracts showed activity only when SiTPS was incubated with  E,E-FPP ( Supplementary Figure S3). To validate results from the in vitro assays, an  E. coli-based in vivo system was used as well. GC-MS analysis of hexane extracts from the bacterial culture co-expressing  SiTPS with genes necessary for  E,E-FPP production showed a number of peaks that were absent in the extract derived from the  E,E-FPP-producing culture without SiTPS. The main product, matching the product from the in vitro assays in retention time and mass spectrum, showed closest matches to the sesquiterpene isomers viridiflorol and ledol in the NIST17 mass spectra database. Comparison with the authentic standard identified the product as viridiflorol ( Figure 4). Based on the phylogenetic position of SiTPS ( Figure 2) and the functional characterization of the enzyme ( Figure 4), a putative cyclization mechanism for viridiflorol by SiTPS was proposed ( Figure 5). 3.5. Viridiflorol Has Antifungal Properties To study whether SiTPS is involved in a fungal defense mechanism, we performed an in vitro growth assay using viridiflorol, the main terpene produced by SiTPS. Spores from the plant pathogen  Colletotrichum truncatum (syn.  Colletotrichum capsici) isolate CP2304 were added in the wells of a microtiter plate, containing liquid medium supplemented with viridiflorol in different concentrations. The compound inhibited germination of spores and consequently growth of  C. truncatum at a concentration of 100 µg/mL and higher, whereas the respective methanol controls did not affect at all fungal growth ( Figure 6).  3.1. SiTPS Belongs to Clade I of Basidiomycota STSs A phylogenetic tree containing previously characterized basidiomycete STSs (SiTPS included)   3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14  was constructed and it showed that the specific enzymes are grouped into four distinct STS clades ( Figure 2), also observed previously   3, 11 . SiTPS was found in Clade I, which includes enzymes that catalyze formation of sesquiterpenoids through an initial C1-C10 closure of  E,E-FPP ( Figure 1). An additional phylogenetic analysis was also conducted and included a selection of proteins, closely related to the  S. indica STS ( Supplementary Figure S1). The specific tree showed that SiTPS was grouped together with putative terpene synthases from other  Serendipita species. In addition, the  Serendipita sequences displayed close relation to a protein belonging to the lichen  Cladonia uncialis.","Interactions between plant-associated fungi and their hosts are characterized by a continuous crosstalk of chemical molecules. Specialized metabolites are often produced during these associations and play important roles in the symbiosis between the plant and the fungus, as well as in the establishment of additional interactions between the symbionts and other organisms present in the niche.  Serendipita indica , a root endophytic fungus from the phylum Basidiomycota, is able to colonize a wide range of plant species, conferring many benefits to its hosts. The genome of  S. indica  possesses only few genes predicted to be involved in specialized metabolite biosynthesis, including a putative terpenoid synthase gene ( SiTPS ). In our experimental setup,  SiTPS  expression was upregulated when the fungus colonized tomato roots compared to its expression in fungal biomass growing on synthetic medium. Heterologous expression of  SiTPS  in  Escherichia coli  showed that the produced protein catalyzes the synthesis of a few sesquiterpenoids, with the alcohol viridiflorol being the main product. To investigate the role of  SiTPS  in the plant-endophyte interaction, an  SiTPS -over-expressing mutant line was created and assessed for its ability to colonize tomato roots. Although overexpression of  SiTPS  did not lead to improved fungal colonization ability, an in vitro growth-inhibition assay showed that viridiflorol has antifungal properties. Addition of viridiflorol to the culture medium inhibited the germination of spores from a phytopathogenic fungus, indicating that  SiTPS  and its products could provide  S. indica  with a competitive advantage over other plant-associated fungi during root colonization."," 'Endophyte', 'Sesquiterpenoid', 'Terpene synthase', 'Basidiomycota', 'antifungal', 'Piriformospora indica', 'Viridiflorol' "," 'Supplementary Figure', 'Figure', 'SiTPS', 'indica', 'colonization', 'Expression', 'Supplementary', 'viridiflorol', 'tomato roots', 'roots' "," SiTPS, vector-carrying transformants, SiTPS, SiTPS, SiTPS, S5A, S5B, ovII, SiTPS, SiTPS, E-FPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate-, E-GGPP, SiTPS, E-FPP, E-FPP, SiTPS, NIST17, SiTPS ( Figure 2, SiTPS, SiTPS, SiTPS, CP2304, SiTPS, E-FPP, SiTPS "," 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS-overexpressing', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS,', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS.', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS.', 'SiTPS', '(SiTPS', 'SiTPS', 'SiTPS' "," 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'SiTPS.', 'SiTPS.', 'S.'

3,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC3193516/eupmc_result.json,PMC3193516,"Results Enzymatic activity of recombinant sesquiterpene synthases Although the TPS14 proteins only differ in a few amino acids from each other (Suppl. Fig. 5), their capacity to use ( Z,Z)- or ( E,E)-FPP as substrate differed substantially. SlTPS14 could use either ( E,E)-FPP or ( Z,Z)-FPP equally well to make mostly ( Z)-γ-bisabolene or α-bisabolene, respectively (Falara et al. in press). Interestingly, ShTPS14 from PI126449 appears to have no clear preference for either ( Z,Z)-FPP or ( E,E)-FPP. In the presence of ( Z,Z)-FPP the enzyme made predominantly ( Z)-β-farnesene, α- and β-acoradiene and α- and γ-bisabolenes, while when assayed with ( E,E)-FPP α-cederene, ( Z)-thujopsene, β-farnesene, β-acoradiene and β-bisabolene were produced (Fig.  5). ShTPS14 from PI127826 on the other hand clearly favored ( E,E)-FPP to synthesize β-farnesene and α- and β-bisabolene (Fig.  5a, b). SlTPS31 predominantly made viridiflorene from ( E,E)-FPP (Fig.  6).  Proteins isolated from  E. coli cells expressing the putative sesquiterpene synthases were assayed for their ability to convert ( E,E)-FPP into sesquiterpenes. The protein encoded by the Moneymaker allele of SlTPS9 produced germacrene C, and minor amounts of germacrene A, B and D (Fig.  2a), similar to the protein encoded by this locus in cultivar VFNT Cherry tomato. ShTPS9 catalyzed the formation of mostly germacrene B and minor amounts of A and C (Fig.  2b), similar to the products observed in the reaction catalyzed by a very similar protein, designated SSTLH1 encoded by a cDNA isolated from  S. habrochaites accession LA1777 (van Der Hoeven et al.  2000). Both recombinant TPS12 proteins had β-caryophyllene/α-humulene synthase activity (Fig.  3a, b).  SlTPS17 and ShTPS17, which are 98.6% identical and 99.1% similar on the protein level, produced both mostly valencene from ( E,E)-FPP and also an unidentified sesquiterpene, besides azulene and α- and β-farnesenes (SlTPS17; Fig.  3c) or β-farnesene (ShTPS17; Fig.  3d). As predicted, SlTPS15 and ShTPS15 from accession PI127826 had no activity, but the ShTPS15 allele isolated from accession PI126449 encoded a protein that catalyzed the formation of mostly germacrene A (Fig.  4). We were unable to detect activity of SlTPS16 although a soluble protein of the correct size was expressed in  E. coli upon IPTG induction (data not shown). Remarkably, all recombinant proteins that could use ( E,E)-FPP as substrate could also use ( Z,Z)-FPP as substrate (Suppl. Fig. 4). SlTPS9 made mostly germacrene C from both ( E,E)-FPP as well as ( Z,Z)-FPP whereas ShTPS9 produced germacrene B and α-humulene with ( Z,Z)-FPP (Suppl. Fig. 4a,b). SlTPS12 and ShTPS12 both made curcumene and β-bisabolene from ( Z,Z)-FPP (Suppl. Fig. 4c,d). SlTPS17 and ShTPS17 made various bisabolenes when activity assays were done with ( Z,Z)-FPP (Suppl. Fig. 4e,f).  All sesquiterpene synthases produce monoterpenes from GPP All sesquiterpene synthases were assayed for monoterpene synthase activity with GPP as substrate. Though not at high efficiency, they all converted the GPP precursor to a range of most simple monoterpenes (Suppl. Fig. 6). TPS9 and TPS12 produced mostly β-myrcene, limonene and low amounts of terpinolene. In the assays with TPS17 and ShTPS14 of PI126449, additionally the monoterpenes ( Z)-β-ocimene, ( E)-β-ocimene and linalool were produced (Suppl. Fig. 6). Sequences of sesquiterpene synthases from  Solanum lycopersicum and  Solanumhabrochaites show high levels of identity Searching the trichome EST database of  S. habrochaites accession PI126449, a line whose trichomes contain high levels of methylketones but also some sesquiterpenes (Fridman et al.  2005), identified a sequence in the TPS-a clade with high similarity to SlTPS15 (Suppl. Fig. 1) and additionally a sequence with high similarity to SlTPS14 (Falara et al. in press). The full-length cDNA of the ShTPS15 had an open reading frame of 540 codons without any apparent mutations. Apart from the sequence of TPS14 from  S. lycopersicum, expressed primarily in roots (Fig.  7), we were able to isolate a full-length cDNA of ShTPS14 from stem trichomes of accession PI127826 and flowers of accession PI126449 . These two ShTPS14 cDNAs had an open reading frame putatively encoding proteins of 554 amino acids. Massive parallel pyrosequencing of the trichome transcriptomes resulted in 195,377 reads from cDNA derived from  S. lycopersicum and 182,386 reads from  S. habrochaites accession PI127826, both with an average length of 80 nucleotides. About 0.20% of all reads had high sequence similarity to known sesquiterpene synthases for  S. lycopersicum versus 0.12% for  S. habrochaites reads (Table  1). This resulted in the identification of multiple TPS sequences belonging to the TPS-a clade according to the phylogeny of the plant TPS family (Bohlmann et al.  1998; Chen et al.  2011). Recently we have analyzed the nearly completed genomic sequence of  S. lycopersicum, and have identified a total of 44 TPS genes (Falara et al. in press). This analysis also showed that the majority of TPS genes in the tomato genome appear to encode sesquiterpene synthases and most of these putative sesquiterpene synthases belong to the TPS-a clade. In the  S. lycopersicum database, transcripts for  TPS9 (previously shown to encode germacrene C synthase; van Der Hoeven et al.  2000),  TPS12 (previously shown to encode β-caryophyllene/α-humulene synthase; van Der Hoeven et al.  2000),  TPS15,  TPS16 and  TPS17 were identified, as well as low numbers of reads for  TPS31 (TPS31 was formerly known as LeVS2 (GenBank: AAG09949.1), but the function of LeVS2 was not established). It was noted that the full-length cDNA of TPS15 has a premature stop at position 228 and is predicted to encode a non-functional protein of 76 amino acids.  Multiple putative sesquiterpene synthases from  S. habrochaites accession PI127826 were also observed, and full-length cDNAs for these genes were isolated. Based on phylogenetic analysis of their DNA sequences (Fig.  1), these cDNAs came from the TPS9, TPS12, TPS15, and TPS17. Again, TPS15 had several premature stop codons in the 5′ region of the cDNA but could putatively encode a shorter protein of 499 amino acids if the ATG at position 157 is functional as start codon, albeit this protein is unlikely to have sesquiterpene synthase activity. We were able to use the primers for  S. lycopersicum TPS16 to amplify the  S. habrochaites TPS16 cDNA as well. However, the ShTPS16 cDNA contained a single nucleotide deletion at position 459, a mutation that results in a premature stop at amino acid 153, thus ShTPS16 is predicted to encode a non-functional enzyme.  Phylogenetic analysis (Fig.  1) of the newly identified and previously characterized tomato TPSs shows that SlTPS9 clusters together with previously identified germacrene synthases from cultivated tomatoes (SlVFNT, SSTLE1, SSTLE2) and ShTPS9 with germacrene synthases from  S. habrochaites accession LA1777 (SSTLH1 and SSTLH2). It also indicates that each TPS from  S. lycopersicum has a higher similarity to its respective ortholog in  S. habrochaites accession PI127826 than to other tomato TPSs. Both monoterpene synthases TPS5 and TPS4 (formerly MTS1 and 2; van Schie et al.  2007) cluster together in the phylogenetic tree, as well as santalene/bergamotene (sesquiterpene) synthase (ShSBS) from  S. habrochaites, which accepts ( Z,Z)-FPP as a substrate (Sallaud et al.  2009), and phellandrene (monoterpene) synthase (TPS20, formerly SlPHS1) from cultivated tomato, which mainly uses NPP as substrate (Schilmiller et al.  2009). The relationships between the different TPSs were confirmed by a phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences (Suppl. Fig. 2). Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of TPS9, TPS12, TPS16 and TPS17, depicted in Supplemental figure 3, shows how closely related TPS9 and TPS12, and TPS16 and TPS17, respectively, are. All proteins contained the RR/P8xW motive found in most terpene synthases, which is involved in hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate group and the DDxxD motive, involved in cofactor binding. Differential expression in response to jasmonate treatment Since jasmonic acid (JA) treatment resulted in the induction of  SlMTS1 ( SlTPS3) in stem trichomes (van Schie et al.  2007), we tested whether expression of  SlTPS9,  SlTPS12,  SlTPS17 or  SlTPS31 was induced by JA treatment. Moneymaker plants that were 4 weeks old were treated with 1 mM JA or left untreated as a control, RNA was isolated after 24 h, and the levels of transcripts were measured by qRT-PCR (Fig.  8). Only the trichome-specific expression of  SlTPS31 was significantly induced, approximately threefold by JA treatment, just as the positive control  SlMTS1 ( SlTPS3, data not shown). Interestingly, expression of  SlTPS17 appeared to be reduced roughly twofold in JA-treated plants ( P = 0.059).  Expression of  S. lycopersicum sesquiterpene synthases is differentially regulated To investigate in which tissues the active  S. lycopersicum sesquiterpene synthases  TPS9,  TPS12,  TPS14,  TPS17 and  TPS31 were transcribed, we dissected mature  S. lycopersicum plants for RNA isolation and subsequent quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of all terpene synthases was lowest in fruits (Fig.  7).  TPS9 and  TPS17 displayed similar expression patterns, with highest expression in stem trichomes (Fig.  7a, d).  TPS12 expression was highest in leaves (Fig.  7b), most likely in the leaf trichomes as shown for  SlTPS12 in the cultivar M82 (Schilmiller et al.  2010). In  S. lycopersicum,  TPS14 is expressed mostly in the roots (Fig.  7c), while in the  S. habrochaites accession PI127826  TPS14 transcripts were found in trichomes (data not shown). Expression of  TPS31 was very low overall, but highest in stem trichomes and leaves (Fig.  7e), most likely in their trichomes. ","Solanum lycopersicum and Solanum habrochaites (f. typicum) accession PI127826 emit a variety of sesquiterpenes. To identify terpene synthases involved in the production of these volatile sesquiterpenes, we used massive parallel pyrosequencing (RNA-seq) to obtain the transcriptome of the stem trichomes from these plants. This approach resulted initially in the discovery of six sesquiterpene synthase cDNAs from S. lycopersicum and five from S. habrochaites. Searches of other databases and the S. lycopersicum genome resulted in the discovery of two additional sesquiterpene synthases expressed in trichomes. The sesquiterpene synthases from S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites have high levels of protein identity. Several of them appeared to encode for non-functional proteins. Functional recombinant proteins produced germacrenes, β-caryophyllene/α-humulene, viridiflorene and valencene from (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate. However, the activities of these enzymes do not completely explain the differences in sesquiterpene production between the two tomato plants. RT-qPCR confirmed high levels of expression of most of the S. lycopersicum sesquiterpene synthases in stem trichomes. In addition, one sesquiterpene synthase was induced by jasmonic acid, while another appeared to be slightly repressed by the treatment. Our data provide a foundation to study the evolution of terpene synthases in cultivated and wild tomato.",NaN," 'Suppl.

4,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7552398/eupmc_result.json,PMC7552398,"Results Induction of  NES genes in  A. philoxeroides prior to feeding by  A. hygrophila The early feeding behavior of  A. hygrophila adults was investigated, revealing that the time between the flea beetles touching the leaves and the initiation of feeding was typically longer than 5 min. The changes in  NES gene expression were evaluated in the leaves touched by  A. hygrophila for 5 min. The expression levels of  ApTPS10,  ApTPS12,  ApTPS16, and  ApTPS19 increased significantly in  A. philoxeroides leaves touched by  A. hygrophila ( P < 0.05), with the expression of  ApTPS16 being 6.27 times higher than that of the control group. By contrast,  ApTPS15 expression decreased significantly in the leaves touched by  A. hygrophila ( P < 0.05), whereas  ApTPS14 expression was not statistically different between the control and  A. hygrophila contact group (Fig.  4). A. hygrophila feeding strongly induces  NES gene expression in  A. philoxeroides The changes in the  NES gene expression upon  A. hygrophila feeding were also analyzed in a time series. All of the six  NES genes in the leaves were significantly up-regulated immediately after 1 h insect-damaged ( P < 0.05) (Fig.  5). ApTPS14 expression showed the greatest up-regulation, reaching a level 42.7 times higher than that of the control plants ( P < 0.05). The expression of  ApTPS19 showed the smallest up-regulation by insect feeding, reaching a level only 7.3 times higher than that of the control plants ( P < 0.05). The four other  NES genes showed several-fold up-regulation of their expression following  A. hygrophila feeding, and were significantly different from the control plants ( P < 0.05). Fifteen minutes after feeding ended, the expression of the six  NES genes remained statistically higher than in the control plants ( P < 0.05), but as time progressed their expression levels gradually decreased, returning to their normal levels within 15 to 30 min.  ApTPS12,  ApTPS14,  ApTPS15, and  ApTPS16 also showed a small peak in expression 1 h after feeding ended ( P < 0.05) (Fig.  5). Mechanical wounding induces delayed and low levels of  NES gene expression Upon mechanical wounding, all of six  NES gene expression showed no statistical difference from that in the leaves of the control group (Fig.  5). After the mechanical wounding, the expression levels of the differentially expressed  NES genes first increased to a peak at around 30–60 min, then gradually decreased to a level similar to that of the control plants after 1–3 h. After 30 min,  ApTPS10,  ApTPS12,  ApTPS15, and  ApTPS16 were significantly differentially expressed in the leaves subjected to mechanical wounding in comparison with the control plants ( P < 0.05). After 1 h,  ApTPS14 expression remained significantly different in the two groups ( P < 0.05). However, at several time points,  ApTPS19 expression was similar between the two groups (Fig.  5). Selection of reference genes in leaves under  A. hydrophila contact, feeding, or mechanical wounding To ensure the accuracy of the quantitative analysis of  NES expression under the different treatment conditions, the expression stabilities of the commonly used reference genes  ACT,  TUA,  TUB, and  UBC were screened. The results showed that the  Ct values of the four candidate reference genes were 19–26 (Fig.  S3), with the lowest  Ct values observed for  UBC (19–22) and the highest  Ct values observed for  TUB (23–26). The expression levels of each candidate reference gene were different when they were analyzed using GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The GeNorm and NormFinder software analysis revealed that the M values of the four reference genes were all less than 1.5, and therefore these genes were considered to be relatively stable when expressed. Among them,  UBC had the smallest M value and the best expression stability, whereas  TUA had the largest M value and a relatively poorer stability. The BestKeeper software analysis revealed that the SD values of the  Ct values for the four reference genes were < 1, indicating relatively stable gene expressions. Among them,  UBC had the smallest SD value and the best expression stability, whereas  TUA had the largest SD value and the worst stability (Table  4). Based on these results, the expression stabilities of the four candidate reference genes were ranked as follows:  UBC >  TUB >  ACT >  TUA. We therefore used  UBC as the reference gene to investigate the expression of the  NES genes in the leaves of  A. philoxeroides under the different damage treatments. Identification and analysis of the terpene synthase genes and  NES genes in  A. philoxeroides In total, six  NES genes were obtained:  ApTPS10,  ApTPS12,  ApTPS14,  ApTPS15,  ApTPS16, and  ApTPS19 (Table  2).  ApTPS19 was the longest of these genes (2161 bp), and was predicted to have an ORF of 1791 bp and to encode a protein of 596 aa in length. Four NES proteins were removed due to their shorter sequences, leaving ApTPS16 and ApTPS19, both of which were classified into the TPS-g subfamily. These proteins were annotated as NES, and shared about a 40% similarity with the other TPS enzymes in  A. philoxeroides. In the  A. philoxeroides transcriptome data, a total of 34 terpene synthase genes were identified (Table  S3). Their encoded protein sequences were compared with those of other species. The sequences of terpene synthase genes in  A. philoxeroides had the highest similarity to those of  B. vulgaris. The phylogenetic tree showed that the 12 terpene synthase proteins were divided into five subfamilies: TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, TPS-e, and TPS-g (Fig.  2). The TPS-a, TPS-b, and TPS-g subfamilies contained the terpene synthases specific to angiosperm species, which were isolated from the other TPS subfamilies. These angiosperm-specific proteins were class-III terpene synthases, which was in accordance with the species classification of  A. philoxeroides. ApTPS7, ApTPS9, ApTPS17, ApTPS18, ApTPS21, and ApTPS22 were classified into the TPS-a subfamily; ApTPS5 and ApTPS6 were classified into the TPS-b subfamily; and ApTPS16 and ApTPS19 were classified into TPS-g family. The TPS-e subfamily largely comprised kaurene synthase, which had a function similar to the annotated function of ApTPS23. The TPS-c subfamily mainly contained the monofunctional diterpene synthase, copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS). ApTPS25, which was annotated as CPS, was also grouped into the TPS-c subfamily. RNA sequencing, assembly, and annotation We classified the predicted genes of  A. philoxeroides using the GO, COG, KOG, KEGG, and other protein databases. A total of 42,386 unigenes were divided into three major categories and 52 functional groups (Fig.  1B); 23,984 unigenes were mapped to 277 KEGG pathways, including the glycolytic, gluconeogenesis, and pentose phosphate pathways, among which the numbers of unigenes associated with the carbon cycle (ko01200), amino acid synthesis (ko01230), and ribosome (ko03010) pathways were 1172, 1057, and 1016, respectively (Table  1; Fig.  S1,  S2). To identify the terpene synthase genes involved in DMNT biosynthesis in  A. philoxeroides, we performed transcriptome sequencing on the major tissues of this plant. A total of 9.91 Gb nucleotides and 40,984,113 raw reads were obtained from the  A. philoxeroides sequencing, and the percentage of Q30 bases reached 91.14%. The original data were deposited in the NCBI SRA library under the accession number SRR10537333. In total, 95.97% of the clean reads were assembled into 4,904,951 contigs, 182,318 transcripts, and 83,179 unigenes (Table  1). Homologs of the unigenes were identified by BLASTX; each publicly available protein database was searched using the transcriptome data, which resulted in the successful annotation of 63,536 (76.4%) of the unigenes. Among them, 63,076 genes were annotated based on their homology with sequences in the NR protein database, which accounted for 99.28% of the total number of annotations (Table  1). 32.74% of  A. philoxeroides annotated sequences were aligned to beet ( Beta vulgaris subsp.  vulgaris L.) (Fig.  1A). Basal expression of various  NES genes in healthy leaves We investigated the basal expression level of the  NES genes in the healthy leaves because of the large amount of DMNT from healthy  A. philoxeroides plants . The results revealed statistical differences in the basal expression of the six  NES genes in the leaves of the control plants ( P < 0.05). Among them,  ApTPS19 had the lowest basal expression, while  ApTPS15 had the highest basal expression, which was 2058.9 times higher than that of  ApTPS19 (Fig.  3). Short-term feeding behavior of  A. hygrophila In the present study, we examined the behavior of  A. hygrophila adults on the leaves of  A. philoxeroides within the first two hours. These actions include contacting, eating and resting. The time between the male and female adults touching the leaves and the initiation of feeding was 5.9 min and 6.2 min, respectively, after a 12-h starvation. The duration of a single feed was 19.6 min for males and 26.5 min for females. No statistical differences were observed between the feeding behaviors of male and female adults (Table  3). The interval between the first and second feeding periods varied from 1 to 90 min, during which the adults usually remained inactive. We, therefore, selected a 5-min period after placing the adults into the cage for use as the contact treatment in future experiments. In addition, the leaf areas consumed by one adult in 1 h and the areas consumed by different numbers of adults in 1 h were also evaluated (Tables  3,  S4). The feeding of male and female adults resulted in different leaf areas consumed; therefore, the use of six adults (three males and three females) was chosen as the insect feeding group for the subsequent 1-h feeding experiment. The leaf area consumed was about 20% of the entire leaf using this treatment method, which provided a basis for the mechanical wounding treatment of the  A. philoxeroides leaves.","Herbivorous insects use plant volatile compounds to find their host plants for feeding and egg deposition. The monophagous beetle Agasicles hygrophila uses a volatile (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonanetriene (DMNT) to recognize its host plant Alternanthera philoxeroides. Alternanthera philoxeroides releases DMNT in response to A. hygrophila attack and nerolidol synthase (NES) is a key enzyme in DMNT biosynthesis; however, the effect of A. hygrophila on NES expression remains unclear. In this study, the A. philoxeroides transcriptome was sequenced and six putative NES genes belonging to the terpene synthase-g family were characterized. The expression of these NES genes was assayed at different times following A. hygrophila contact, feeding or mechanical wounding. Results showed that A. hygrophila contact and feeding induced NES expression more rapidly and more intensely than mechanical wounding alone. This may account for a large release of DMNT following A. hygrophila feeding in a previous study and subsequently facilitate A. hygrophila to find host plants. Our research provides a powerful genetic platform for studying invasive plants and lays the foundation for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between A. philoxeroides and its specialist A. hygrophila.",NaN," 'NES genes', 'NES gene', 'NES', 'expression', 'genes', 'gene expression', 'Fig.', 'reference genes', 'feeding', 'expression levels' "," ApTPS14, 23–26, ApTPS19, NES, TPS enzymes, 12 terpene synthase, TPS-b, TPS-e, TPS-g (Fig.  2, TPS-b, ApTPS7, ApTPS9, ApTPS17, ApTPS18, ApTPS21, ApTPS22, ApTPS5, ApTPS6, ApTPS19, TPS-g, TPS-e, ApTPS23, monofunctional diterpene synthase, copalyl diphosphate synthase, CPS, ApTPS25, CPS, KOG, 42,386, ribosome (ko03010, SRR10537333, 4,904,951, 83,179 unigenes, 63,536, 63,076, Beta vulgaris, 2058.9 "," 'ApTPS10,', 'ApTPS12,', 'ApTPS16,', 'ApTPS19', 'ApTPS16', 'ApTPS15', 'ApTPS14', 'ApTPS14', 'ApTPS19', 'ApTPS12,', 'ApTPS14,', 'ApTPS15,', 'ApTPS16', 'ApTPS10,', 'ApTPS12,', 'ApTPS15,', 'ApTPS16', 'ApTPS14', 'ApTPS19', 'ApTPS10,', 'ApTPS12,', 'ApTPS14,', 'ApTPS15,', 'ApTPS16,', 'ApTPS19', 'ApTPS19', 'ApTPS16', 'ApTPS19,', 'TPS-g', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS-e,', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-g', 'TPS', 'ApTPS7,', 'ApTPS9,', 'ApTPS17,', 'ApTPS18,', 'ApTPS21,', 'ApTPS22', 'TPS-a', 'ApTPS5', 'ApTPS6', 'TPS-b', 'ApTPS16', 'ApTPS19', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-e', 'ApTPS23.', 'TPS-c', 'ApTPS25,', 'TPS-c', 'ApTPS19', 'ApTPS15', 'ApTPS19' ",  ,  ,terpene synthase

6,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6355774/eupmc_result.json,PMC6355774,"Results Analysis of the regulatory relationships between SlMYB75 TF and other genes To explore whether DEGs could serve as direct targets of SlMYB75, we checked the ability of this MYB TF to bind the promoters of some of the DEGs directly using a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay. Since many DEGs were identified in this study, we chose highly conserved elements rather than specific DEGs to verify which ones could be directly bound by SlMYB75. By analyzing the promoters with the New Place database tools, we identified eight conserved elements as the primary ones present in the DEG promoters (Supplementary Table  S1). Tests on these eight conserved elements in Y1H assays indicated that only MYBPLANT (AAACCAACCC) and MYBPZM (ACCTACCC) could be recognized by SlMYB75 (Fig.  6a), suggesting they might be direct targets of this MYB gene. To verify whether SlMYB75 could interact with native promoters of some DEGs, we performed dual-luciferase assays with genes involved in ethylene signaling and volatile aroma metabolism. The data showed that SlMYB75 could only trans-activate the promoters of the  LOXC,  AADC2 and  TPS genes (Fig.  6b). Overexpression of a single  SlMYB75 induces anthocyanin accumulation A qRT-PCR investigation of the  SlMYB75 expression pattern indicated that transcripts corresponding to this gene are detected in all tissues, but they display higher expression levels in vegetative tissues, especially in leaf organs (Fig.  1a and b). However, unlike the  Cs6g17570 gene 19, the expression level of  SlMYB75 in tomato fruit organs is very low (Fig.  1a, b). To address the functional significance of  SlMYB75, a tomato “Micro-Tom” cultivar was transformed with a sense construct of  SlMYB75, leading to the generation of three independent transgenic homozygous lines. The expression of  SlMYB75 in  SlMYB75-OE plants was assessed by  qRT-PCR, indicating a dramatic upregulation in line  #11 and line  #19, while the  #21 line only showed a slight upregulation (Fig.  1c), and then lines  #11 and  19 were selected to perform further experiments. A phenotypic evaluation revealed that the  SlMYB75-OE lines accumulated abundant amounts of anthocyanins in both vegetative and reproductive organs, especially in the stamen, in which the color turned totally purple (Fig.  1d). Furthermore, the  SlMYB75-OE lines displayed significantly smaller seeds than the WT (Fig.  1d). To further investigate the expression characteristics of  SlMYB75, we checked the expression level of this TF in WT seedlings treated with different hormones or ones that were subjected to stress conditions. The data showed that  SlMYB75 is responsive to all the treatments applied here, consistent with the presence of the corresponding  cis-elements identified in the promoter of  SlMYB75 (Supplementary Fig.  S2). These results indicated that overexpressing a single SlMYB75 TF can lead to abundant anthocyanin accumulation in both vegetative and reproductive organs, and this TF could be induced by various hormones or stress conditions. Transcriptome profiling of the  SlMYB75-OE tomato fruits To gain insight into the extent of transcriptomic reprogramming induced by the ectopic expression of  SlMYB75, we performed genome-wide transcriptomic profiling in WT and  SlMYB75-OE fruits (line  #11) at the MG and BR + 0 stages. Compared to the WT, a total of 1576 and 2843 genes were differently expressed (DEGs) in  SlMYB75-OE tomatoes at the MG and BR + 0 stages, respectively (Files  S1 and  S2). Based on the Gene Ontology (GO) assignment, the common DEGs of the MG and BR + 0 stages (675 common DEGs) were assigned to three categories, namely, biological process, cellular component and molecular function. “Biological process” was primarily focused on metabolic and cellular processes. Alterations in the molecular function analysis were primarily involved in the binding and catalytic activities (Supplementary Fig.  S3 and File  S3). Furthermore, 675 common DEGs were enriched in 73 KEGG pathways. The top five enriched pathways were the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, plant hormone signal transduction and flavonoid biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig.  S4 and File  S4). These results indicated that  SlMYB75 overexpression impacted multiple processes, including transcription, stress responses, secondary metabolism and phytohormone signaling pathways. Based on the phenotype properties and potential application values of the  SlMYB75-OE tomato, we focused on genes involved in metabolic processes, ripening-related processes and TFs (Table  1). To validate the accuracy of the generated transcriptome data, a total of 16 genes related to the above-cited processes were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. The outcome of this targeted expression analysis was highly consistent with the transcriptome data for all the tested genes (Fig.  3). Physiological features of the  SlMYB75-OE tomato plants One of the striking features of the  SlMYB75-OE lines is the purple color exhibited by several organs, including the seeds, stamens and fruits. An assessment of the anthocyanin accumulation revealed high levels in the  SlMYB75-OE fruits, and these compounds were not detected in the WT (Fig.  2a, b). Despite their deep purple color, it was easy to identify the different ripening stages of the transgenic fruits by checking the color of the low-anthocyanin region (Fig.  2a). Moreover,  SlMYB75-OE plants exhibited 3–5-day delays in the occurrence of fruit ripening onset compared to the WT (Fig.  2c, d). Strikingly, ripening-associated ethylene production was significantly higher in  SlMYB75-OE tomatoes at all ripening stages (Fig.  2e), which contrasted with the delayed ripening. These data suggested that overexpression of a single SlMYB75 TF can result in a series of physiological changes. Overexpression of  SlMYB75 affects volatile aroma metabolism Considering that some of the DEGs such as  LOX, AADC and  CXE1 have been reported to play critical roles in aroma volatile production 33,  34, we performed a comparative analysis of aroma volatiles in WT and  SlMYB75-OE tomatoes. Nearly 380 volatile compounds were identified in the Micro-Tom tomato fruits analyzed in this experiment, and only 38 characteristic volatiles were screened and quantified (Table  2). Based on the chemical nature of their precursors, tomato volatiles could be categorized into the following three groups: those derived from fatty acids, carotenoids and amino acids 34. As shown in Table  2, the aroma compounds derived from fatty acids, especially aldehydes, accounted for a large part of the tomato aroma content. The amount of aroma volatiles in fruits at the BR + 5 stage was much lower than the levels at the BR + 7 and BR + 10 stages, and some of the aroma volatiles could not even be detected at the early ripening stage. Most of the volatiles showed significantly higher levels in  SlMYB75-OE tomatoes than those in the WT, including trans-2-hexenal, hexanal, 3-hexenal, benzaldehyde, 3-nonanone, methyl salicylate and geranyl acetate. By contrast, some volatiles such as 2-propyl-1-pentanol and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate showed similar or lower contents in  SlMYB75-OE tomatoes compared to the WT. Noticeably, the contents of terpenoids/terpenes, terpineol, (-)-4-terpineol, copaene, γ-terpinen and β-myrcene in the  SlMYB75-OE fruits exhibited a dramatic increase, with some of them having more than 10 times higher levels than those in the WT, while the content in the WT stayed very low. Overall, the general trend is that volatiles in  SlMYB75-OE tomatoes are significantly higher than they are in the WT, in particular those corresponding to aldehydes and terpenes. Change in the ripening-related metabolic processes in  SlMYB75-OE tomatoes To further investigate the metabolic changes in the  SlMYB75-OE tomatoes, we measured the metabolite contents relevant to the DEGs at the BR + 5, BR + 7 and BR + 10 ripening stages. Interestingly, the total soluble solids (TSS), which primarily reflect the sugar content, was significantly higher in the  SlMYB75-OE tomatoes than in the WT (Fig.  4a) while the titratable acids showed no significant difference between WT and  SlMYB75-OE tomatoes (Fig.  4b). Strikingly, the total contents of phenolics and flavonoids were dramatically increased in  SlMYB75-OE tomatoes (Fig.  4c, d). A further characterization of the changes in phenolics and flavonoids contents revealed that the  SlMYB75-OE fruits exhibited higher levels of chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, rutin and quercetin than those in the WT (Fig.  5). These data indicated that in addition to increasing the anthocyanin content, overexpression of  SlMYB75 also led to elevated levels of sugar, phenolic and flavonoid compounds.","Genetic manipulation of genes to upregulate specific branches of metabolic pathways is a method that is commonly used to improve fruit quality. However, the use of a single gene to impact several metabolic pathways is difficult. Here, we show that overexpression of the single gene SlMYB75 (SlMYB75-OE) is effective at improving multiple fruit quality traits. In these engineered fruits, the anthocyanin content reached 1.86 mg g-1 fresh weight at the red-ripe stage, and these SlMYB75-OE tomatoes displayed a series of physiological changes, including delayed ripening and increased ethylene production. In addition to anthocyanin, the total contents of phenolics, flavonoids and soluble solids in SlMYB75-OE fruits were enhanced by 2.6, 4, and 1.2 times, respectively, compared to those of wild-type (WT) fruits. Interestingly, a number of aroma volatiles, such as aldehyde, phenylpropanoid-derived and terpene volatiles, were significantly increased in SlMYB75-OE fruits, with some terpene volatiles showing more than 10 times higher levels than those in WT fruits. Consistent with the metabolic assessment, transcriptomic profiling indicated that the genes involved in the ethylene signaling, phenylpropanoid and isoprenoid pathways were greatly upregulated in SlMYB75-OE fruits. Yeast one-hybrid and transactivation assays revealed that SlMYB75 is able to directly bind to the MYBPLANT and MYBPZM cis-regulatory elements and to activate the promoters of the LOXC, AADC2 and TPS genes. The identification of SlMYB75 as a key regulator of fruit quality attributes through the transcriptional regulation of downstream genes involved in several metabolic pathways opens new avenues towards engineering fruits with a higher sensory and nutritional quality.",NaN," 'Fig.', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'DEGs', 'tomatoes', 'genes', 'fruits', 'expression', 'volatiles', 'tomato', 'aroma' "," SlMYB75 TF, SlMYB75, MYB TF, Y1H, SlMYB75, DEG, MYBPLANT, AAACCAACCC, MYBPZM, ACCTACCC, SlMYB75, MYB, SlMYB75, dual-luciferase, SlMYB75, LOXC, TF, TF, BR + , BR + , BR + , “, ”, low-anthocyanin, 3–5-day, AADC, BR + , BR + 7, BR + , 3-nonanone, 2-propyl-1-pentanol, terpenoids/terpenes, (-)-4-terpineol, γ-terpinen, BR + , BR + 7, BR +  ", 'TPS' ,  ,  ,NaN
7,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC4464248/eupmc_result.json,PMC4464248,"Results Putative terpene synthases in  E. globulus We discovered 106 terpene synthase genes in  E. globulus using a strategy similar to that applied to  E. grandis, but without any gene expression data due to the lack of such datasets (Table  1). We further discovered 37 putative pseudogenes which contained multiple stop codons or frame shifts (Additional file  1: Table S3). Overall, the differences in gene copy numbers between  E. globulus and  E. grandis were small, with slightly fewer sesquiterpene synthases (TPS-a), two more mono- and hemi-terpene synthases (TPS-b) as well as TPS-f copies, similar copy numbers in TPS-c and –e and three fewer copies in the TPS-g subfamily (Table  1). Most pseudogenes were found among the TPS-a subfamily (16), with slightly fewer in the TPS-b (13) and four each in the TPS-f and –g subfamilies (Additional file  1: Table S3). Functional characterization of full-length  Eucalyptus grandis TPS genes Of the nine genes synthesised for characterization studies, five have predicted transit-peptide sequences at the N-terminus, which suggests they are monoterpene synthases. Based on sequence characteristics, the remaining four genes are likely to be sesquiterpene synthases. We were able to express all nine genes in the vector, however, only three were able to produce significant amounts of terpenes and two produced traces of terpenes (Additional file  1: Table S5). We characterised a bicyclogermacrene synthase (EgranTPS041), an isoledene synthase (EgranTPS013) and a γ-terpinene synthase (EgranTPS059), all of which are multi-product enzymes which produced between 5 and 15 terpenes (Figure  8). Genomic organization of terpene synthase genes from  Eucalyptus grandis Most (82 out of 92) EgranTPS genes of subfamilies –a, −b and –g, contain seven exons, with the exception of three TPS-a genes (EgranTPS016, EgranTPS017 and EgranTPS019) which appear to have recently obtained a seventh intron near the 3′ end of exon seven and seven genes for which sequence data is incomplete (Figure  3). Genes from the remaining subfamilies, −c, −e and -f, contain between 9 and 14 exons, with the exception of EgranTPS92 which has just seven exons. The length of the introns is largely conserved with a few exceptions, notably intron 1, which is highly variable across subfamilies -a, −b, and -g (Figure  3). Most  E. grandis TPS genes are organized in moderate to large groups (tandem gene arrays) in the genome. Each group contains only genes of the same TPS subfamily and genes are found in dense clusters. In some cases, the distance between two EgranTPS genes is less than 1 kb, e.g. between EgranTPS026 and EgranTPS027, the distance is only 508 bp between stop and start codon. On scaffold 6, there are 17 TPS genes and pseudogenes found within 317 kb, one TPS gene for every 18.6 kb (Additional file  1: Table S4 and Figure  2). The clustering of putative isoprene/ocimene synthases is even greater and on scaffold 11, eight isoprene synthase genes are found within 107 kb – one gene per 13.4 kb (Additional file  1: Table S4). Genes from different steps in the terpene biosynthetic pathway are found nearby the clusters of  E. grandis TPS genes, such as a prenyl transferase on scaffold 11 (Additional file  1: Table S4). The TPS-b cluster on scaffold 4 is also co-incident with eight quantitative trait loci (QTL) for foliar monoterpenes from  Eucalyptus nitens and one for foliar sideroxylonal discovered by Henery and co-workers   24 . Other genes of plant secondary metabolism are also found close to clusters of terpene synthases (e.g. phenylalanine ammonia lyase, anthocyanidin reductase, flavonol reductase) as are many transcription factors (Additional file  1: Table S4). Phylogenetic analysis of  Eucalyptus TPS genes in comparison to other plant species Genes from TPS subfamilies –b and – g are shown in Figure  6 and Additional file  2: Figure S2. TPS-g forms a clade embedded within TPS-b. Eucalypts have two clades of TPS-g genes, one closely related to the only  Arabidopsis TPS-g gene (At1g61680) gene and the other closest to two poplar genes. Six out of 13 and 10 TPS-g genes are in orthologous pairs for  E. grandis and  E. globulus, respectively (Additional file  1: Table S1), with several gene duplication events in the clade close to At1g61680 since the separation of these two eucalypt species. The phylogenetic analysis shown here includes all known TPS genes from  Arabidopsis thaliana,  Populus trichocarpa,  Vitis vinifera (cultivar Pinot Noir),  Solanum lycopersicum, Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, Eucalyptus grandis and  E. globulus. The phylogenies are divided into groupings of (i) TPS-a (Figure  5 and Additional file  2: Figure S1), (ii) TPS-b and -g (Figure  6 and Additional file  2: Figure S2) and (iii) TPS-c, −e and -f (Figure  7 and Additional file  2: Figure S3). The phylogenies contained too many terminal nodes to be easily viewable (210 for (i), 161 for (ii)) and the full phylogenies are therefore presented in the supplemental files, while the figures show only TPS genes from  Arabidopsis thaliana,  Vitis vinifera and  Populus trichocarpa in comparison to both eucalypt species studied here. Subfamilies TPS–c, −e and –f are involved in the formation of di-terpenes as well as mono- and sesquiterpenes. In the TPS-c subfamily, two out of two genes occur in orthologous pairs, while in TPS-e, two orthologous pairs are found, but  E. grandis contains one extra gene (Figure  7, Additional file  1: Table S1). Gene copy numbers are very similar in these two families compared to other species (Table  1, Figure  7). However, there has been a significant expansion of the TPS-f family in eucalypts compared to other plant species. Only three orthologous pairs occur between the two eucalypt species out of seven and nine genes (Additional file  1: Table S1). Recent duplications (e.g. EglobTPS119 and EglobTPS123) as well as loss of function (e.g. the  E. globulus orthologue of EgranTPS098) of genes have occurred. For the TPS-a subfamily, the most closely related genes to the eucalypt TPS clade are from  Vitis vinifera and  Populus trichocarpa (Figure  5). The  Eucalyptus TPS genes form a paralogous cluster, which is different from some of the  Populus/ Vitis TPS-a clades (Figure  2, Additional file  2: Figure S1). A comparison of the two eucalypt species shows that 31 out of 52 genes are found in orthologous pairs for  E. grandis (Additional file  1: Table S1) and 31 out of 45 for  E. globulus. For several genes in  E. grandis, the  E. globulus ortholog is missing and  vice versa (Figure  5). There are also several gene duplication events that post-date the separation of the two species. It is notable that the  Arabidopsis TPS genes have longer branches than both grape and eucalypts suggesting a longer period of gene differentiation without novel gene duplication events. The TPS-b subfamily falls into three separate clades, all of which contain multiple species (Additional file  2: Figure S2). The middle clade contains putative isoprene/ocimene synthases, and is described as TPS-b2, while the other two clades are described as TPS-b1 and contain putative cyclic monoterpene synthases (Figure  6). For the TPS-b1 19 out of 27 and 28 for  E. grandis and  E. globulus, respectively, occur in orthologous pairs (Additional file  1: Table S1). Roughly half of the isoprene/ocimene synthases occur in orthologous pairs (5/9 and 5/10 for  E. grandis and  E. globulus, respectively) with several gene duplications and loss of function events post- speciation (Additional file  1: Table S1). Global expression profiling of terpene synthase genes from  Eucalyptus grandis A heat map showing relative transcript abundance of 113 TPS genes in three biological replicates of seven tissues is shown in Figure  4. The hierarchical cluster analysis of the tissues shows that the six wood tissue samples (immature xylem and phloem) form one cluster, three root tissues a separate cluster and the ‘green tissue’ comprised of young leaf, mature leaf, shoot tips and flowers a third cluster. The only two tissues where all three biological replicates cluster together are root and flower. The hierarchical clustering of genes shows a cluster of highly expressed genes in the ‘green tissue’, dominated by TPS-b1 genes (I). The next major cluster is also expressed mostly in ‘green tissue’, but to a lesser extent (II). Gene expression cluster II contains mostly genes from the TPS-a group with several TPS-b1 and -b2 genes. Cluster (III) is moderately expressed in ‘green tissue’ with one sub-cluster expressed in root as well. Genes that cluster by gene expression patterns are a mixture of most subfamilies, excluding TPS-c and -e. Cluster (IV) shows highest levels of expression in root tissue, with minor expression in ‘green tissue’ and wood tissue. All subfamilies bar isoprene/ocimene syntases (TPS-b2) are represented in this cluster. Cluster (V) has the overall lowest level of gene expression scattered over all tissues, containing genes from TPS-a, −b1 and -g. Finally, cluster (VI) is a single gene, which is expressed constitutively in all tissues at moderate to high levels. This gene encodes a putative ent-kaurene synthase, which produces the precursor for gibberellic acid. Discovery of putative TPS genes from the  E. grandis genome We identified 172 loci in the  Eucalyptus grandis genome with a high sequence similarity to known terpene synthase genes from other species. Loci that spanned fewer than three exons (out of seven for most TPS sub families) were not further considered which resulted in the exclusion of 20 loci. Loci were considered putatively functional if they were full length (with the exception of genomic areas where sequence data was missing), which had fewer than two frame shifts and stop codons (combined) or showed evidence of gene expression either through the presence of expressed sequence tag (EST) models or RNAseq data that matched the loci (Additional file  1: Table S1). Publically available RNAseq data ( www.phytozome.net), as well as our own RNAseq dataset, were used to validate the genomic sequences. The resulting list of genes was then classified as (i) full-length, expressed with no premature stop codons or frame shifts (89), (ii) full-length, expressed with up to two stop codons or frame shifts (23), (iii) full-length, with no expression and no frame shift or stop codon (1), (iv) pseudogenes with more than two frame shifts or stop codons (39) and (v) partial genes (20) (Additional file  1: Table S2). A total of 113 loci in groups (i) (ii) and (iii) were considered to be putatively functional TPS genes (Additional file  1: Table S1). Six of the eight currently recognized TPS subfamilies are present in  E. grandis, the exceptions being the Gymnosperm specific TPS-d subfamily and the  Selaginella moellendorffii specific TPS-h subfamily (Figure  1). Gene copy numbers in diterpene synthase genes (TPS-c and –e) were similar to those found in other plant species (Table  1). However, the other TPS subfamilies are much more abundant in  E. grandis compared to other plant species (Table  1)."," Background Terpenoids are abundant in the foliage of Eucalyptus, providing the characteristic smell as well as being valuable economically and influencing ecological interactions. Quantitative and qualitative inter- and intra- specific variation of terpenes is common in eucalypts. Results The genome sequences of Eucalyptus grandis and E. globulus were mined for terpene synthase genes (TPS) and compared to other plant species. We investigated the relative expression of TPS in seven plant tissues and functionally characterized five TPS genes from E. grandis. Compared to other sequenced plant genomes, Eucalyptus grandis has the largest number of putative functional TPS genes of any sequenced plant. We discovered 113 and 106 putative functional TPS genes in E. grandis and E. globulus, respectively. All but one TPS from E. grandis were expressed in at least one of seven plant tissues examined. Genomic clusters of up to 20 genes were identified. Many TPS are expressed in tissues other than leaves which invites a re-evaluation of the function of terpenes in Eucalyptus. Conclusions Our data indicate that terpenes in Eucalyptus may play a wider role in biotic and abiotic interactions than previously thought. Tissue specific expression is common and the possibility of stress induction needs further investigation. Phylogenetic comparison of the two investigated Eucalyptus species gives insight about recent evolution of different clades within the TPS gene family. While the majority of TPS genes occur in orthologous pairs some clades show evidence of recent gene duplication, as well as loss of function.",NaN," 'Additional file', 'TPS genes', 'genes', 'Table', 'Additional', 'TPS', 'Figure', 'file', 'gene', 'synthase genes' "," –e, TPS-b (13), –g, transit-peptide, S5, EgranTPS041, EgranTPS059, –a, −b, –g, EgranTPS016, EgranTPS017, EgranTPS019, 3′, −c, −e, -f, EgranTPS92, −b, EgranTPS, EgranTPS026, EgranTPS027, prenyl transferase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, anthocyanidin reductase, – g, TPS-g, TPS-g, At1g61680, −e, -f (, TPS–c, −e, –f, TPS-e, EglobTPS119, EglobTPS123, EgranTPS098, TPS-b2, TPS-b1, TPS-b1, grandis A heat, TPS-b1, TPS-b1, -b2, TPS-b2, −b1, ent-kaurene synthase, RNAseq, RNAseq, RNAseq, TPS-h, –e "," '(TPS-a),', '(TPS-b)', 'TPS-f', 'TPS-c', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-f', 'TPS', '(EgranTPS041),', '(EgranTPS013)', '(EgranTPS059),', 'EgranTPS', 'TPS-a', '(EgranTPS016,', 'EgranTPS017', 'EgranTPS019)', 'EgranTPS92', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'EgranTPS', 'EgranTPS026', 'EgranTPS027,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-b.', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-g', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS', 'TPS–c,', 'TPS-c', 'TPS-e,', 'TPS-f', 'EglobTPS119', 'EglobTPS123)', 'EgranTPS098)', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-b2,', 'TPS-b1', 'TPS-b1', 'TPS', 'TPS-b1', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b1', 'TPS-c', '(TPS-b2)', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-d', 'TPS-h', '(TPS-c', 'TPS' ",  ," 'lycopersicum,' ",terpene synthase

Covariations between Genotypic Differences in above and Belowground VOC Production Based on the mean values per genotype, we performed Pearson correlation analyses in order to see whether genotypic differences in the above and below ground production of VOCs were linked to each other ( Table 3,  Figure 3). A clear positive correlation was seen between the genotypic variations in foliar VOC emission and foliar VOC contents for the sum of all VOCs ( Figure 3a) and the sum of major VOCs, especially if the genotype Levovil was left out. The correlations between contents and emissions of individual VOCs were more scattered than the sum of VOCs and β-phellandrene showed the best fit (R 2 = 0.53, data not shown). Using the emission data set that was obtained under dark conditions did not improve the correlations to foliar VOC contents. The mean leaf VOC contents per genotype were positively correlated with the mean CO 2-assimilation rates per genotype (R 2 total VOCs: 0.52, R 2 major VOCs: 0.70 ( Figure 3a, small inserted graph)), whereas there was no clear relationship between the genotypic differences in foliage VOC emission and CO 2-assimilation (R 2 < 0.3, data not shown). The mean soil emissions per genotype were unrelated to their root VOC contents either for the sum of VOCs ( Table 3) or for individual common VOCs. On the other hand, the mean soil emissions per genotype scaled weakly with mean foliar VOC emissions and contents ( Table 3,  Figure 3c,d). This positive relationship was mainly associated with monoterpene emissions and less with other VOC classes. Among the individual commonly emitted VOCs, the mean myrcene,  p-cymene, and β-phellandrene aboveground emissions showed the best correlations with the respective mean belowground emissions (R 2 = 0.75, 0.44 and 0.43, respectively, data not shown). Further, no or only traces of β-phellandrene and δ-2-carene were released from the soil surface of the genotypes Cervil and Plovdiv consistent with their absence in the foliar emissions. The mean VOC root contents per genotype were also uncorrelated with mean foliage emissions, while they weakly correlated with mean VOC leaf contents (R 2: 0.30 and 0.43,  Table 3). However, this correlation should be considered with caution, since it was mainly based on Levovil, showing strong VOC contents in both leaves and roots ( Figure 3b). Concerning the two individual compounds stored in both organs, only the mean foliar contents of β-phellandrene were weakly correlated with the mean β-phellandrene contents in the roots (R 2: 0.30, data not shown), whereas the mean methyl-salicylate contents in roots were unrelated to those in leaves (R 2: 0.0 and 0.26 after the removal of Levovil, data not shown). 2.1. Aboveground VOC Production and CO 2/H 2O Gas Exchange When plants were darkened ( Figure 1b), the total aboveground VOC emission was reduced by 60%, on average, when compared to light conditions (4.2 ± 1.0 ng m −2 s −1 and 0.71 ± 0.17 µg g −1 h −1). Darkening reduced emissions of all genotypes, albeit the effect was not significant for LA0147, whose dark emissions largely scattered among replicates. Sesquiterpene emissions were generally less reduced by darkness than monoterpenes (40% vs. 65%) and not significantly affected in seven of eight genotypes. Looking at individual VOCs, most of the main and trace compounds were still released in darkness, except linalool, β-pinene, and ( Z)-2,6-dimethyl-2,6-octadiene, which could never be detected in the absence of light, regardless of the genotype ( Figure 1b,  Supplementary material Table S2). Dark emissions were different among genotypes, although the differences were less significant than for light emissions ( p = 0.022 and 0.021 for total VOC and sum of major VOC emissions). Pairwise comparisons of genotypes revealed that only the dark emissions of Cervil and LA0147 were significantly different one from each other. Nevertheless, the pattern of genotypic variability of dark emissions was similar to that of light emissions. Tomato foliage emitted VOCs in low quantities, despite its aromatic character. The most abundant, regularly emitted ones were the monoterpenes β-phellandrene, δ-2-carene, linalool, α-pinene, and the sesquiterpene ( E)-β-caryophyllene ( Figure 1,  supplementary material Tables S1 and S2). The five major compounds emitted under light conditions represented between 55 and 85% of the total emission, depending on the genotype. The remaining was composed of 10 monoterpenes (or derivatives), including β-pinene, myrcene, α-phellandrene, α-terpinene,  p-cymene, β-ocimene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, ( Z)-2,6-dimethyl-2,6-octadiene), and four sesquiterpenes, namely δ-elemene, α-humulene, and germacrene- d, plus one unknown sesquiterpene. These minor emissions were more or less close to the detection limit of our system and, therefore, not consistently found in all of the replicate measurements. At 30 °C and lighted conditions, the mean rate of total VOC release was 10.2 ± 1.5 ng m −2 leaf area s −1 (1.87 ± 0.31 µg g −1 leaf dry weight h −1) across all of the genotypes. The emission rates (sum of total VOCs and sum of main VOCs) were significantly different between genotypes ( p < 0.001,  Figure 1a and  Supplementary material Table S2), while there was no genotypic effect on CO 2-H 2O gas exchange parameters apart from transpiration ( p = 0.023, Cervil > Criolo, data not shown). Genotypic differences in VOC emissions were mostly due to variability in the emissions of monoterpenes (the sum of monoterpenes,  p < 0.001), and less to variability in sesquiterpene emissions (sum of sesquiterpenes  p = 0.087). Regarding the main compounds, three cherry tomato genotypes from the  cerasiforme group (Cervil, Criolo and Plovdiv) had consistently lower emissions than all other genotypes, with β-phellandrene and δ-2-carene being absent in the emissions of Cervil and Plovdiv. However, Cervil and Plovdiv emitted α- and β-pinene at much higher rates than the other genotypes that are dominated by high emissions of β-phellandrene and δ-2-carene (mean α-pinene emissions of 2.43 ± 0.46 and 0.45 ± 0.14 ng m −2 s −1 for Cervil and Plovdiv, and other genotypes, respectively). Linalool emissions were highly variable and they occurred rather sporadically in all genotypes. When released, linalool emissions scaled positively with the foliar CO 2-assimilation rate (R 2 = 0.44, data not shown). The linalool emissions did not correlate to the emission of any other VOC. On the contrary, the emissions of all other compounds correlated to each other in a given VOC class (see  Supplementary material Figure S1 for examples). Foliar VOC contents that were gained from solvent extracts showed that most, although not all, emitted VOCs are stored in tomato leaves ( Table 1). Among the main emitted VOCs, only linalool was absent in the leaf extracts. By contrast, β-phellandrene, δ-2-carene, α-pinene, and ( E)-β-caryophyllene were consistently found in leaf extracts, even in the genotypes that hardly emitted them. In addition, two apparently non-emitted phenolic compounds were present in the leaf extracts (methyl-salicylate and eugenol) though not always. The mean VOC contents across the eight genotypes were 69.3 ± 9.8 µg g −1 leaf fresh weight (range: 43.5 ± 5.6–95.6 ± 18.1 µg g −1) for the sum of all VOCs and 56.8 ± 8.6 µg g −1 (range 30.6 ± 4.5–90.3 ± 16.7 µg g −1) for the sum of main compounds ( Table 1). VOC contents that were extracted from individual leaf samples were quite variable. Nevertheless, the plant’s genotype had a significant effect on the VOC contents of tomato leaves ( p = 0.04). As for emissions, this genotypic variability was mainly due to differences in monoterpene contents (ANOVA,  p = 0.002 for the sum of monoterpenes). Especially, β-phellandrene contents were markedly different among genotypes, with lowest contents being observed for Cervil, Criolo, and Plovdiv in accordance with their emissions. The leaf concentrations of individual VOCs were hardly correlated to each other. The best correlations were observed between β-phellandrene and δ-2-carene contents (R 2 = 0.44), and between methyl-salicylate and δ-elemene contents (R 2 = 0.33; data not shown). 2.2. Belowground VOC Production About 20 VOCs released from the soil surface were associated with the presence of plants, among which all of the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that were observed in the aboveground emissions ( Figure 2,  Supplementary material Table S1). In addition, methyl-salicylate and an unidentified monoterpene occurred in the soil emission, as well as various oxygenated VOCs, including dodecanal, tetradecanal, methyl-heptanone, hexanoic acid, and 3-octenol. However, the latter group of oxygenated VOCs, as well as linalool and the sesquiterpene δ-elemene, were also frequently detected in the emissions of soil blanks (without plant) indicating that a variable fraction of these VOCs emitted from the soil surface was not exclusively linked to the presence of plants. Belowground emissions, either expressed per soil surface or per root dry weight, scattered strongly among plant replicates in all genotypes. Consequently, no significant genotypic effects were observed neither for the sum of VOC emissions nor for individual VOC classes. Overall, the mean total VOC belowground emissions amounted to 4.86 ± 0.64 (± SE,  n = 34) ng m −2 ground surface s −1 or 0.53 ± 0.07 µg g −1 root dry weight h −1. There were distinct co-variations in the appearance of individual VOCs. β-Phellandrene, δ-2-carene, α-terpinene, α-phellandrene,  p-cymene, and terpinolene emissions correlated well with each other (R 2 > 0.7). By contrast, these VOCs were only moderately correlated with the emissions of myrcene, γ-terpinene, and β-ocimene (R 2: 0.3–0.6), and not at all with the emissions of α-pinene, linalool, sesquiterpenes, and other VOCs ( Supplementary material Figure S2). Instead, the linalool soil emissions scaled positively with the emission of methyl-salicylate (R 2 = 0.86) and with the emissions of sesquiterpenes, especially germacrene-D (R 2 = 0.81), while α-pinene emissions were not related to other VOCs other than β-pinene. The variability in the VOC emission rates per soil surface were mostly unrelated to the root dry weights of the plants. Among individual VOCs, only the soil emissions of myrcene, β-ocimene, linalool, and methyl-salicylate scaled positively with root dry weights (respective R 2 discarding zero emission values: 0.75, 0.49, 0.38, 0.29; data not shown). Analyses of root extracts revealed the presence of six VOCs in low concentrations, of which only β-phellandrene and methyl-salicylate were also found in the soil emissions. Two benzenoïds phenyl-acetaldehyde and guaiacol, the acyclic monoterpene alcohol geraniol and one unidentified aldehyde, were the other stored VOCs inside roots ( Table 2). The two major stored compounds, phenyl-acetaldehyde and methyl-salicylate, scaled positively with each other (R 2 = 0.77) and to a lesser extent with guaiacol (R 2: 0.52 and 0.30, data not shown). There were no apparent correlations between the amounts of the other stored VOCs. As for belowground emissions, the VOC contents from root extracts were highly variable among plant replicates and, hence, no significant genotype effect could be seen from our data. On average, the total amount of VOCs stored in the roots was 2.55 ± 0.38 µg g −1 FW.","The in-vivo monitoring of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions is a potential non-invasive tool in plant protection, especially in greenhouse cultivation. We studied VOC production from above and belowground organs of the eight parents of the Multi-Parent Advanced Generation Intercross population (MAGIC) tomato population, which exhibits a high genetic variability, in order to obtain more insight into the variability of constitutive VOC emissions from tomato plants under stress-free conditions. Foliage emissions were composed of terpenes, the majority of which were also stored in the leaves. Foliage emissions were very low, partly light-dependent, and differed significantly among genotypes, both in quantity and quality. Soil with roots emitted VOCs at similar, though more variable, rates than foliage. Soil emissions were characterized by terpenes, oxygenated alkanes, and alkenes and phenolic compounds, only a few of which were found in root extracts at low concentrations. Correlation analyses revealed that several VOCs emitted from foliage or soil are jointly regulated and that above and belowground sources are partially interconnected. With respect to VOC monitoring in tomato crops, our results underline that genetic variability, light-dependent de-novo synthesis, and belowground sources are factors to be considered for successful use in crop monitoring."," 'Sesquiterpene', 'Salicylate', 'Isoprene', 'Monoterpene', 'Biomarkers', 'Solanum Lycopersicum', 'Chemodiversity', 'Aboveground-belowground Interactions', 'Volatile Organic Compound Emission' "," 'VOCs', 'VOC', 'emissions', 'VOC contents', 'VOC emission', 'Figure', 'contents', 'foliar VOC', 'individual VOCs', 'VOC Production' "," Belowground VOC, β-phellandrene, CO, CO 2-assimilation, β-phellandrene, δ-2-carene, β-phellandrene, CO 2/H 2O, −2, −1, ±, µg g, −1, −1, LA0147, β-pinene, Dark, LA0147, α-pinene, germacrene- d, °C, ±, −1 (, µg g −1, −1, CO 2-H 2O, Criolo, Criolo, β-phellandrene, α-, β-pinene, β-phellandrene, ±, ±, −2, −1, α-pinene, µg g, ± 5.6–95.6 ±, µg g −1, µg g −1, ± 4.5–90.3, µg g −1, ’s, Criolo, β-phellandrene, methyl-heptanone, 3-octenol, ±, ±, −2, −1, ±, µg g, −1, β-ocimene (R 2, α-pinene, methyl-salicylate (, germacrene-D (R 2, α-pinene, benzenoïds phenyl-acetaldehyde, phenyl-acetaldehyde, µg g ",  ,  ,  ,NaN

10,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7952619/eupmc_result.json,PMC7952619,"Results Phylogenetic Divergence of  HcMYB Genes The domain structure analysis showed that all  HcMYB genes contain highly conserved typical SANT DNA-binding domains in their sequences, which is essential for their different regulatory interaction mechanism. The multiple sequence alignment of mostly  HcMYB genes revealed that they possess 2R and 3R repeat signatures at the N-terminus, and seven candidate  HcMYB genes were selected for multiple sequence alignment ( Supplementary Figure 1). The seven candidate HcMYB proteins were selected for further characterization based on their expression pattern with flower scent emission. To assess the phylogenetic relationship among  MYB genes in  H. coronarium (253  HcMYBs), rice (66  OsMYBs),  Arabidopsis (125  AtMYBs), and tomato (127  SlMYBs), an unrooted NJ phylogenetic tree was generated. All MYB proteins were divided into 15 distinct clades designed as G1–G15. Among them, subgroup G13 constitutes the largest group containing 64 MYB members of four different species followed by G15 (63), G1 (56), G7 (54), G8 (48), G6 (48), G7 (40), G11 (39), G5 (30), G12 (28), G2 (26), G10 (26), G4 (25), G14 (8), and G3 (6), respectively. Similarly, the maximum number of  HcMYB genes were clustered into subgroup G15 (29) followed by G11 (27), G8 (27), G1 (25), G7 (23), G8 (23), G13 (20), G2, (15), G10 (15), G5 (13), G9 (12), G12 (10), G14 (7), G4 (5), and G3 (2), respectively. Interestingly, subgroup G14 contains eight MYBs from which seven belong to  H. coronarium ( Figure 1). Overall, all HcMYBs with AtMYB, OsMYB, and SlMYBs were unevenly clustered into all groups indicating their evolutionary divergence. The group of MYB genes in the same subclade may have a similar function. The phylogenetic tree analysis of only MYB proteins from  H. coronarium revealed that 253 HcMYB proteins were distinctly grouped into 12 different clades ( Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, three groups (G3, G13, and G15) from four genome phylogeny, were missing. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree of 253 HcMYBs was also constructing with the previously identified scent-related MYB TFs ( Supplementary Figure 3). The data showed that all HcMYBs along with previously identified scent-related MYBs were clustered into five distinct clades (G I-G V). The maximum number of scent-related MYB proteins were clustered in G II (11) followed by G V (5), G III (2), and G I (1), respectively. Furthermore, the selected seven-candidate HcMYB proteins were also grouped in different clades. HcMYB79 was clustered in G I, which included AtMYBL2, and HcMYB75/145/238 was found in G II, which contains the majority of scent-related MYBs (AtMYB2/21/24, FaEOBII, PhEOBI, PhEOBII, FvEOBII, PsMYB26, AmMYB305/340, and NiMYB3005). Similarly, HcMYB248 was found in G III, which includes AtMYB42 and PhODOI, while HcMYB7/8 was clustered in G V which includes AtMYB4/7, FaMYB1/10, PhMYB4, and PtMYB14 ( Supplementary Figure 3). Expression of  HcMYB Genes at Different Organs and Flower Developmental Stages Based on transcriptome data, seven  HcMYB genes were selected and their spatial expression pattern was validated via RT-qPCR at four different flower development stages ( Figure 3C). The expression level of  HcMYB79 increased with the flower development and peak at the senescence stage, while  HcMYB8 and  HcMYB75 showed a high expression level at the D2 stage (half-open). However,  HcMYB7,  HcMYB145,  HcMYB238, and  HcMYB248 showed a dramatic increase in the expression level from D2 to D3 stage. Moreover, the expression of candidate  HcMYB genes correlates with the emission of total volatile contents ( Supplementary Figure 8). The expression level of  HcMYB genes significantly altered with the flower developmental process, suggesting their potential role during the development of flower and floral scent emission. The differential expression patterns of  HcMYB genes in different organs and flower developmental stages were analyzed using the RNA sequencing data ( Yue et al., 2015;  Supplementary Figure 7). The expression pattern of  HcMYB genes was grouped into three clusters. The cluster I showed a group of  HcMYB genes, which had preferential expression pattern in flowers. Similarly, cluster II and cluster III represent the member of  HcMYBs, which showed their high expression levels in rhizome and leaves, respectively ( Supplementary Figure 7A). Interestingly,  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB75,  HcMYB145,  HcMYB238, and  HcMYB248 from cluster I had the highest expression level in the flower. Some members of the cluster I also showed their spatial expression both in flower and rhizome including  HcMYB79,  HcMYB128,  HcMYB162,  HcMYB130,  HcMYB108,  HcMYB199, and  HcMYB208. The members of  HcMYB genes in cluster II showed high expression in the rhizome, while a few genes from cluster III showed high expression both in flowers and leaves and some in leaves and rhizomes. However, the majority of genes from cluster III showed their high expression in leaves. The amount of volatile contents released from flowers was maximum, while less quantity was observed in leaves and rhizomes ( Figure 3A). Previous studies showed that tissue-specific expression is important for gene functioning ( Sonawane et al., 2017). The data indicate the group of  HcMYBs present in cluster I might be involved in floral scent formation, while cluster II and cluster III in the functioning of vegetative organs (rhizome and leaves). In  H. coronarium, the process of floral scent formation is associated with flower development. The emission quantity of floral volatiles was low at the bud stage and substantially increase with the flower development peak at the blooming period and declined at the senescence stage ( Figure 3B). To clarify the functioning of  HcMYBs during flower development stages, their expression level at three stages was divided into three clades via a heat map ( Supplementary Figure 7B). Several  HcMYB genes showed high expression levels at the D1 stage followed by D4 and D6, respectively. However, some  HcMYBs ( HcMYB34,  HcMYB51,  HcMYB181, and  HcMYB232), which belong to cluster I, showed a substantial increase in expression level with the developmental stages. The members of  HcMYB genes from cluster II showed diverse expression levels. The majority of genes showed a high expression level at the D4 stage only, although  HcMYB5,  HcMYB62,  HcMYB106,  HcMYB111,  HcMYB240, and  HcMYB245 from cluster II showed high expression both at D1 and D4 stage. Likewise, within-cluster II, some  HcMYBs ( HcMYB16,  HcMYB94,  HcMYB203,  HcMYB208,  HcMYB218, and  HcMYB221) showed specific high expression both at D4 and D6 stage only ( Supplementary Figure 7B). Interestingly,  HcMYB22,  HcMYB55, and  HcMYB112, within-cluster III, showed a high expression at the D1 stage, with no expression at the D4 stage and dramatically peak at the D6 stage. Chromosomal Distribution and Duplication Events Among  HcMYB Genes To determine the evolutionary mechanism of  HcMYB genes, comparative synteny maps of  H. coronarium associated with rice, pineapple, Arabidopsis, and banana were constructed ( Figure 2B). A total of 7 ortholog MYB gene pairs between  H. coronarium and  Arabidopsis, 19 orthologs between  H. coronarium and rice, 44 orthologs between  H. coronarium and pineapple, and 193 orthologs between  H. coronarium and banana were identified ( Figure 2B and  Supplementary Tables 4– 7). The number of HcMYB-MaMYB was greater than HcMYB-AtMYB, HcMYB-OsMYB, and HcMYB-AcMYB, indicating the closer evolutionary relationship between  H. coronarium and  Musa accuminata and their divergence from the common monocot ancestor. Interestingly, HcMYB29 and HcMYB194 collinear gene pairs were present among four species. HcMYB29 was homologous pair of AT5G65230.1 ( A. thaliana), LOC_Os02g51799.1 ( O. sativa), Aco002802.1 ( A. comosus), and GSMUA_Achr10T24560 ( M. acuminata). Similarly, HcMYB194 was collinear gene pair of AT4G37780.1, LOC_Os03g56090.1, Aco004978.1, and GSMUA_Achr5T01930. In short, the aforementioned two collinear gene pairs were found among four species genomes, implying their evolutionary mechanism and specific function in  H. coronarium. The chromosomal location of  HcMYBs was performed to investigate the genomic distribution of the MYB gene family in  H. coronarium. The results revealed an uneven distribution of  HcMYB genes in the chromosomes ( Figure 2A). In total, 6  HcMYB genes were found on chromosomes 1 and 13, 7 on chromosomes 8 and 16, 9 on chromosomes 3 and 15, 11 on chromosomes 10 and 12, 12 on chromosome 6, 14 on chromosomes 7 and 11, 15 on chromosomes 5 and 9, 16 on chromosome 17, 18 on chromosome 14, and 19 on chromosome 2. The maximum number of  HcMYB genes (20) were presented on chromosome 4. The majority of  HcMYB genes were observed on the top and bottom of the chromosomes, while rarely found in the middle of the chromosome. Gene duplications play a crucial role in the evolution and expansion of gene families in plants. It was found that  H. coronarium genome contained 62 HcMYB segmental duplications ( Figure 2A). The maximum number of segmental duplication events was observed on chromosomes 14 and 17, while a low number of duplication events were found on chromosome 3. Moreover, three tandem duplication pairs were also identified on chromosome 17 in  H. coronarium genome. The  Ka/Ks (synonymous/non-synonymous) values of all segmentally and tandemly duplicated  HcMYB gene pairs had less than 1, indicating that they evolved under the pressure of purifying selection ( Figure 2A and  Supplementary Table 3). The average  Ka/Ks value of tandem duplication genes (0.57) was higher than that segmented duplication genes (0.27). Moreover, the segmental and tandem duplication gene events occurred about 47 Mya (million years ago), implying that duplication events play a crucial role in functional and evolutional divergence. HcMYBs Binds to the Promoters of Key Structural Volatile Biosynthesis Genes Promoter sequences analysis of  HcTPS1 (1,131),  HcTPS3 (1,557),  HcTPS10 (867), and  HcBSMT2 (1,131) revealed that they encompass 6, 4, 3, and 13 copies of MYB-core binding motifs, respectively ( Supplementary Table 10). To examine that the identified HcMYB regulators directly bind or not to the promoters of key volatile floral scent biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2) in  H. coronarium, a Y1H assay was conducted. It was observed that the bait strains harboring  proHcTPS1 and  proHcTPS3 grow well on gained aureobasidin A antibiotic SD-Leu medium co-expression with HcMYB7, HcMYB8, and HcMYB145. Moreover, bait strains harboring  proHcTPS10 gained aureobasidin A antibiotic resistance upon expression of HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB79, and HcMYB238. Furthermore, bait strains harboring  proHcBSMT2 gained aureobasidin A antibiotic resistance upon expression of HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB79, HcMYB145, and HcMYB248 ( Figure 7A). Suppression of  HcMYB Genes Altered the Emission of Main Floral Volatile Compounds To understand the potential involvement of  HcMYB genes in the floral scent formation, a virus-induced gene silencing system was performed for  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248. The data showed that the mRNA expression level of  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248 was decreased 41.4, 47.8, 78.7, 75.8, and 85.3%, respectively ( Figure 6A), relative to the control flowers. The silencing of  HcMYB genes in flowers also downregulated the expression level of key structural volatile biosynthesis genes. In the  HcMYB7-silenced flower, the expression level of  HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2 was downregulated up to 59.7, 23.1, 65.7, and 58.3%, respectively, compared to control. The silencing of  HcMYB8 in  H. coronarium flowers, downregulated the expression level of  HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2 by 76.5, 54.5, 82.8, and 87.7%, respectively. Alike, silencing of  HcMYB79 significantly downregulated the expression levels of  HcTPS1 (74.4%),  HcTPS10 (87.6%), and  HcBSMT2 (87.4%). The expression level of  HcTPS1 (68.3%),  HcTPS3 (57.7%),  HcTPS10 (52.6%), and  HcBSMT2 (48.3%) was significantly suppressed in the  HcMYB145-silenced flowers. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of  HcTPS1 (66.5%),  HcTPS3 (38.8%),  HcTPS10 (72.1%), and  HcBSMT2 (81.4%) were significantly changed in the  HcMYB248-silenced flowers ( Figure 6B). The effect of silencing of  HcMYB genes on the floral volatile profile of  H. coronarium was assessed. It was observed that eucalyptol contents were decreased 42.2, 40.8, 22.6, 34.6, and 39.8% in the  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers, respectively ( Figure 6C). Similarly, the silencing of  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8, and  HcMYB79 significantly decreased the accumulation of ocimene by 23.3, 24.4, and 27.1%, respectively. However, no significant change in volatile contents was found in the  HcMYB145 and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers ( Figure 6D). The volatile contents of methyl benzoate were significantly decreased by 27.6 and 31.9% in the  HcMYB8 and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers, respectively, while silencing of  HcMYB145 did not affect the level of methyl benzoate ( Figure 6E). Furthermore, the contents of linalool were decreased by 16.9, 26, 13.9, 26.2, and 15.1% in the  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers, respectively ( Figure 6F). The data showed that these  HcMYB genes play a crucial role in the floral scent formation in  H. coronarium. Gene Structure and Motif Analysis of  HcMYB Genes To investigate the functional diversification of HcMYB proteins, 10 conserved motifs (motifs 1–10) were identified in the MEME server ( Supplementary Figure 4). The majority of the HcMYB proteins within the subclade had a similar composition of motifs, while variation was observed among different subclades. The motifs 1, 2, and 3 were the most conserved and appear in most of the HcMYB proteins. All the HcMYB proteins contain two or more than two motifs except HcMYB185 which only has motif 2 ( Supplementary Figure 5). HcMYB23, HcMYB40, HcMYB47, HcMYB55, HcMYB110, HcMYB126, HcMYB168, and HcMYB253 proteins contained motif 3 and motif 8; HcMYB31, HcMYB67, HcMYB91, HcMYB121, and HcMYB179 proteins contained motif 1 and motif 2. HcMYB proteins containing motif 9 and motif 10 belong to subgroup G10 and G9, respectively. Interestingly, some HcMYB proteins contain the repetition of motif 3 and motif 8 and fall into subgroup G2 indicating their involvement in a specific function ( Supplementary Figures 2,  5B). Gene structure analysis was performed to better understand the expansion of  HcMYB genes in  H. coronarium. The number of exon/intron ranges from 0 to 21. Gene structure analysis revealed that five  HcMYB ( HcMYB27,  HcMYB87,  HcMYB185,  HcMYB217, and  HcMYB249) genes were intron-less, while  HcMYB10 have a maximum of 21 introns ( Supplementary Figure 5C). Moreover,  HcMYB89 has the longest intron, and the majority of them (82%) were disrupted by two or three introns. In General, the  HcMYB genes with the same number of introns were grouped into a similar subclade. Identification of the  HcMYB Genes in  Hedychium coronarium A total of 253 potential candidate  HcMYB genes were identified in  H. coronarium genome data. All genes were designated as  HcMYB1-HcMYB253 based on the chromosomal location. Among them, 27 HcMYB genes belong to 1R, six 3R, one 4R, and the rest are all R2R3 type. The HcMYB protein size and molecular mass range from 100 aa/11.37 kDa (HcMYB100) to 1,749 aa/192.53 kDa (HcMYB10). Similarly, the  pI also varies greatly from 4.51 (HcMYB170) to 12.2 (HcMYB252), indicating their functional diversity in microenvironments. A similar pattern was observed in  Prunus persica and  Phyllostachys edulis ( Zhang C. et al., 2018;  Yang et al., 2019b). Moreover,  in silico analysis revealed that HcMYB proteins were predicted to localize in the nucleus. The detailed information of  HcMYB genes is provided in  Supplementary Table 1. HcMYBs Interacts With JAZ1 Protein To further unravel the molecular mechanism of the involvement of HcMYBs in the regulation of floral aroma biosynthesis, a yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assay was performed. It was observed that pGADT7-T + pGBKT7-53 (positive control) along with yeast cells, which co-transformed with pGADT7-HcMYB7 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB8 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB75 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB145 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, and pGADT7-HcMYB7248 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, grew well on SD plates lacking Trp, His, Ade, and Leu but in the existence of 5 mM 3-AT. On the other hand, yeast cells harboring pGBKT7-Lam + pGADT7-T (negative control), pGADT7-HcMYB79 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, and pGADT7-HcMYB238 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1 did not grow ( Figure 7B). These results indicated that HcJAZ1 may interact with five HcMYBs (HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB145, and HcMYB248) in yeast. Subcellular Localization of HcMYB Proteins In silico subcellular localization of  HcMYB genes revealed that all  H. corornarium MYB genes are predicted to localize in the nucleus except HcMYB126, which is predicted to localize in the chloroplast ( Supplementary Table 1). To experimentally validate the predicted localization, four  HcMYB genes ( HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248) were selected for analysis in  Arabidopsis protoplast. The NLS-mCherry was applied in each transformed design to act as a marker for nuclear localization. The results revealed that HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, and HcMYB248 proteins were localized to the nucleus ( Figure 5). Cis-Regulatory Elements and  HcMYB Targeting miRNAs A 2-kb upstream promoter region of  HcMYB genes was scanned for  cis-regulatory elements analysis. The data showed that MeJA responsiveness elements are the most common ones, which were found in 210  HcMYB gene promoters. Other  cis-acting regulatory elements found in the promoter region of HcMYB genes were ABARE (208), ERE (180), GARE (144), MBS (128), Auxin responsive (120), SARE (99), and low-temperature responsiveness elements (96) ( Supplementary Figure 6). The detailed information regarding the  cis-elements present in the promoter region of  HcMYB genes is given in  Supplementary Table 8. Previous studies showed that miRNA play key roles in plant secondary metabolism. In  A. thaliana, miR858 encodes regulatory peptides and controls flavonoid biosynthesis and development ( Sharma et al., 2020). Similarly, miR156 was involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in poplar ( Wang et al., 2020). The miRNA prediction analysis showed that  HcMYB genes were targeted by different families of miRNA. About 37  HcMYB genes were mainly targeted by miR156, miR157, miR158, miR160, miR167, miR168, miR169, miR172, miR319, miR854, and miR858. The  HcMYB genes were commonly targeted by miR156, miR167, and miR319 ( Supplementary Table 9). Interestingly,  HcMYB187,  HcMYB166, and  HcMYB157 were targeted by both miR167 and miR319. The majority of  HcMYB genes (42) were targeted by miR858. Expression of  HcMYBs in Response to Hormone Stresses Plant hormones play several functions in growth and development and are involved in different signaling pathways. Auxin, abscisic acid, ethylene, and jasmonates are the key hormones playing an essential role in flower development and senescence. The amount of floral volatile contents was increased by 27.6, 23.9, 25.5, and 33.1% under IAA, ABA, ethylene, and MeJA treatment, respectively ( Figure 4A). The expression levels of selected  HcMYBs were analyzed via RT-qPCR under the abovementioned treatments. The data showed that mRNA levels of  HcMYB75,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB238 were upregulated under auxin treatments, while  HcMYB248 was downregulated ( Figure 4C). Under ABA treatment,  HcMYB145 expression level was increased by 19-fold followed by  HcMYB75,  HcMYB79, and  HcMYB238, respectively. However, the expression level of  HcMYB248 was reduced ( Figure 4D). For ethylene treatment,  HcMYB79 and  HcMYB145 were significantly upregulated; however,  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8, and  HcMYB248 were downregulated ( Figure 4E). The expression levels of  HcMYB75,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB238 were upregulated when treated with MeJA, while  HcMYB248 was downregulated ( Figure 4F). Moreover, mRNA levels of key structural biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2) were also upregulated upon phytohormones stresses ( Figure 4B). These results indicate that  HcMYB genes respond to various stresses and play crucial roles through crosstalk with different hormones.","The MYB gene family is one of the largest groups of transcription factors (TFs) playing diverse roles in several biological processes.  Hedychium coronarium  (white ginger lily) is a renowned ornamental plant both in tropical and subtropical regions due to its flower shape and strong floral scent mainly composed of terpenes and benzenoids. However, there is no information available regarding the role of the MYB gene family in  H. coronarium . In the current study, the MYB gene family was identified and extensively analyzed. The identified 253  HcMYB  genes were unevenly mapped on 17 chromosomes at a different density. Promoter sequence analysis showed numerous phytohormones related to  cis -regulatory elements. The majority of  HcMYB  genes contain two to three introns and motif composition analysis showed their functional conservation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HcMYBs could be classified into 15 distinct clades, and the segmental duplication events played an essential role in the expansion of the  HcMYB  gene family. Tissue-specific expression patterns of  HcMYB  genes displayed spatial and temporal expression. Furthermore, seven  HcMYB  ( HcMYB7/8/75/79/145/238/248 ) were selected for further investigation. Through RT-qPCR, the response of candidates  HcMYB  genes toward jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and auxin was examined. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays revealed that candidate genes directly bind to the promoter of bottom structural volatile synthesis genes ( HcTPS1 ,  HcTPS3 ,  HcTPS10 , and  HcBSMT2 ). Moreover, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay showed that HcMYB7/8/75/145/248 interact with HcJAZ1 protein. In  HcMYB7/8/79/145/248 -silenced flowers, the floral volatile contents were decreased and downregulated the expression of key structural genes, suggesting that these genes might play crucial roles in floral scent formation in  H. coronarium  by regulating the expression of floral scent biosynthesis genes. Collectively, these findings indicate that  HcMYB  genes might be involved in the regulatory mechanism of terpenoids and benzenoid biosynthesis in  H. coronarium ."," 'Structural genes', 'terpenes', 'Floral Scent', 'Myb', 'Hedychium Coronarium' "," 'HcMYB Genes', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Figure', 'HcMYB', 'Genes', 'expression level', 'expression', 'HcMYB proteins', 'Supplementary', 'Supplementary Table' "," NJ, MYB, G1–G15, G13, MYB, G15 (63), G8 (48), G7 (40, G11 (39), G5 (30), G12 (28, G10 (26), G4, G14 (8), G3 (6), G11 (27, G8 (27, G7 (23, G8 (23, G13 (20), G10 (15), G5 (13), G9 (12), G12 (10, G14 (7, G4, G3 (2, G14, HcMYBs, SlMYBs, MYB, MYB, G13, G15, HcMYBs, MYB TFs, HcMYBs, G I-G V, MYB, G II, G V, G III (2, G I (1, seven-candidate HcMYB proteins, G I, AtMYBL2, HcMYB75/145/238, G II, AtMYB2/21/24, FaEOBII, PhEOBI, PhEOBII, AmMYB305/340, NiMYB3005, HcMYB248, AtMYB42, PhODOI, HcMYB7/8, G V, AtMYB4/7, FaMYB1/10, PhMYB4, D2, D4, HcMYB34, D1, D4, within-cluster II, HcMYB16, D4, D1, MYB, HcMYB-MaMYB, HcMYB-AtMYB, HcMYB-OsMYB, HcMYB-AcMYB, HcMYB194, AT5G65230.1, LOC_Os02g51799.1 (, Aco002802.1, GSMUA_Achr10T24560 ( M. acuminata, HcMYB194, AT4G37780.1, LOC_Os03g56090.1, Aco004978.1, GSMUA_Achr5T01930, MYB, 12, 12, 9, MYB-core, HcTPS1, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB238, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, HcMYB248, HcMYB proteins, HcMYB185, HcMYB23, HcMYB40, HcMYB47, HcMYB55, HcMYB110, HcMYB126, HcMYB168, HcMYB253, HcMYB31, HcMYB67, HcMYB91, HcMYB121, HcMYB179, G10, G9, 1R, 3R, 4R, HcMYB100, HcMYB170, HcMYB252, 2019b, HcMYB proteins, HcMYBs, JAZ1, HcMYBs, yeast-two-hybrid, Y2H, pGADT7-T, pGBKT7-53, pGADT7-HcMYB7 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB8 +, pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB75 +, pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB145 +, pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB7248 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, Trp, pGBKT7-Lam, pGADT7-HcMYB79 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB238 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, HcJAZ1, HcMYBs, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB145, HcMYB248, HcMYB Proteins, MYB, HcMYB126, HcMYB7, NLS-mCherry, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, HcMYB248, HcMYB, ABARE, ERE (180), GARE (144), MBS (128), Auxin, SARE (99, miR156, miR156, miR160, miR167, miR168, miR169, miR172, miR319, miR156, miR167, miR319, miR167, miR319, Auxin, abscisic acid, ABA, auxin, ABA, HcTPS1 "," 'HcTPS1', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS10', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,', 'proHcTPS1', 'proHcTPS3', 'proHcTPS10', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,', 'HcTPS1', 'HcTPS10', 'HcTPS1', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS10', 'HcTPS1', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS10', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,' ",  ,  ,NaN

Drought Enhances Specific Responses to Each Herbivore While drought treatment enhanced the common transcriptional responses to both BAW and CPB, it enhanced the plant’s specific responses to each herbivore as well. Plants under drought treatment induced 569 more genes (309 upregulated, 260 downregulated;  Figure 4C, part g) in their specific response to BAW herbivory. When CPB was feeding, 163 unique genes responded (85 upregulated, 78 downregulated;  Figure 4C, part c). GO annotation tests on the BAW-specific response in control and/or drought conditions (417 + 285 + 569 genes;  Figure 4C, sums of part o + k + g) showed that upregulated genes were primarily involved in JA biosynthesis, cell wall biogenesis and organization, and carbohydrate metabolism, while downregulated genes were mainly involved in photosynthesis ( Table S4A). There was no enrichment of responses related to defence against insects in the CPB-specific response (4 + 3 + 163 genes;  Figure 4C, sums of part a + b +c). This CPB-specific response contained a large group of 41 genes, which were annotated as ribosomal proteins and/or involved in protein translation ( Table S4B). The 10 most upregulated or downregulated genes in the specific responses of drought-treated plants to each herbivore are shown in  Table S5. Notably, five of these CPB-specific upregulated genes were annotated as responsive to pathogens, including  osmotin-like protein,  patatin-like protein 3,  alternative oxidase,  universal stress protein, and  blue copper protein. On the other hand, the BAW-specific upregulated genes included two terpene synthases ( Sesquiterpene Synthase1 and  Limonene synthase). 2.5. BAW Elicits More Prominent Responses than CPB, Especially under Drought The above findings on transcriptional regulation and serPI levels, however, did not explain the reduced performance of BAW on  S. dulcamara plants under drought. We further investigated the transcriptomic data to identify the differential effects of drought on plant responses to BAW and CPB. Since SA signalling is considered a negative regulator of insect-induced JA-dependent defences, we hypothesized that the CPB-induced SA accumulation would suppress plant responses to CPB compared to responses elicited by BAW. The plot of directional changes in gene expression under single and combined treatments ( Figure 8) showed that BAW herbivory indeed affected more genes than CPB. This applies both to the numbers of upregulated (‘no < herbivore’, right horizontal) and downregulated (‘no > herbivore’, left horizontal) genes. Correspondingly, 61.5% of the herbivore-upregulated BPs in control plants were induced more strongly by BAW herbivory than by CPB ( Figure 5, blue parts of CPB-BAW  control  comparison). This effect was statistically significant for 26 BPs ( Figure S4A, blue dots). The difference in response to BAW and CPB was even more prominent on drought-stressed plants ( Figure 5, CPB-BAW  drought ), with 62 BPs upregulated significantly stronger by BAW than CPB ( Figure S4B, most of blue dots). Many of these BPs are related to cell wall biogenesis and organization (15 BPs), as well as the metabolism of carbohydrates (eight), lipids (seven), and secondary metabolites (eight). Conversely, CPB herbivory upregulated only one BP (GO:0019216, regulation of lipid metabolism) significantly stronger than BAW in control plants and four unrelated BPs (GO:0006626, 0001510, 0010421, 0015757) in drought-treated plants. Similar patterns were found among the herbivore-downregulated BPs, the majority of which were significantly more strongly affected by BAW than CPB herbivory, particularly those related to photosynthesis ( Figure 5 and  Figure S4). Together, these results clearly show that BAW had more pronounced effects than CPB on herbivore-mediated responses, especially in drought-stressed plants. 2.8. Plant Responses to Drought Are More Prominent under CPB Herbivory Interestingly, the circular histogram ( Figure 8) also revealed that drought induced many more genes in the treatment combination with CPB herbivory than with BAW: 116 upregulated (green dots towards ‘control < drought’) and 53 downregulated (green dots towards ‘control > drought’) genes compared to 41 upregulated (red dots towards ‘control < drought’) and seven downregulated (red dots towards ‘control > drought’) genes, respectively. A GO distribution test of the drought-upregulated genes specifically when in combination with CPB (86 genes) showed the enrichment of genes involved in photosynthesis and/or functioning in chloroplasts ( Supplementary Table S6), including isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis (GO:0019288), chlorophyll biosynthesis (GO:0015995), and photosynthetic electron transport chain (GO:0009767). This indicates that plant physiological processes, particularly photosynthesis, may be less constrained by CPB than by BAW herbivory under drought stress. 2.2. Water Availability Interacts with Herbivory in Regulating Plant Hormone Levels Ethylene emission of well-watered plants was similarly increased upon 24 h of herbivory by BAW and CPB ( Figure 3B). Drought did not affect plant intrinsic or BAW-induced ET emissions ( Figure 3A,C). Conversely, CPB-induced ET emissions of drought-treated plants were significantly lower than those of well-watered plants after 24 h of herbivory. This difference was further increased after a 48-h period of herbivory (repeated measures,  F(1, 10) = 5.728,  p = 0.038;  Figure 3D). This resulted in a significant interaction between water availability and CPB herbivory on ET emission rates ( F(2.29, 22.90) = 3.600,  p = 0.038). To investigate the plant hormonal responses underlying changes in herbivore performance on plants under different watering regimes, we measured concentrations of JA, JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile), ABA, SA, and ET in  S. dulcamara plants under control and drought treatments with or without 48-h herbivory by BAW or CPB. As individual stress factors, herbivory by either BAW or CPB significantly induced the accumulation of JA, JA-Ile, and ABA under control treatment ( Figure 2A–C,  Table S1). However, BAW herbivory had significantly stronger effects on the induction of these hormones than CPB, despite the similar damage levels caused by the two herbivory treatments ( Figure S1). Moreover, there was a statistically significant interaction between water and herbivory treatments with regard to the accumulation of JA and JA-Ile ( Table S1), mainly because drought only enhanced CPB-induced JA/JA-Ile accumulation ( Figure 2A,B). Drought stress alone significantly induced ABA accumulation ( Figure 2C), which likely overruled the potential effects of insect herbivory under combined stress conditions ( Figure 2C). Even though neither drought nor herbivory treatments alone affected SA accumulation, CPB herbivory enhanced SA accumulation in drought-treated plants ( Figure 2D). However, this effect was not observed for BAW herbivory, resulting in significantly higher SA levels in CPB-damaged plants compared to undamaged and BAW-damaged plants under drought stress. In conclusion, water availability interacts with CPB herbivory in regulating plant hormone levels, in which drought enhanced the CPB-induced accumulation of JA, JA-Ile, and SA, and suppressed the herbivory-induced ET emission in  S. dulcamara. In contrast, the increases in JA, JA-Ile, and ET levels upon BAW herbivory were independent of watering regimes. 2.3. Transcriptional Regulation Differences in plant hormonal responses upon herbivory by generalist or specialist insects may trigger diverging transcriptional responses. To analyse this, leaf RNA samples of the experimental plants used for hormone quantification were subjected to microarray analysis. Of all 33,957 targets, 25,570 had normalized expression values higher than the intensity threshold. These targets were selected for further analyses, and are hereupon referred to as ‘genes’. qPCR analyses on a set of selected genes were used to validate the results of the microarray analyses. This showed a highly significant correlation between genes’ expression levels, which were determined by the two methods (Pearson  R = 0.913,  p < 0.001;  Figure S2). Multidimensional scaling analysis showed that both insect herbivory treatments significantly impacted the transcriptomic response ( Figure 4A). Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEAs) identified 440 significantly affected biological processes (BPs). The clustering of their enrichment scores showed that herbivory by CPB or BAW larvae had similar effects on most BPs (87.5%, or 385 BPs, having at least one comparison with statistically significant normalized enrichment scores (NES;  Figure 5). In total, 165 BPs were always significantly induced in the same direction by the two insects, regardless of watering regimes ( Figure 4D, part i). The majority of the commonly regulated BPs (145) was upregulated, including many BPs related to responses to insect or JA biosynthesis and signalling ( Table 1,  Figure 6). Among the 165 genes that were upregulated by both insects regardless of watering regimes ( Figure 4C, upregulated genes in part i), many are involved in JA biosynthesis and secondary metabolism (particularly phenylpropanoids) or encode for protease inhibitors (PIs) ( Table S2). Together, these genes represent the common response to insect herbivory in  S. dulcamara. Drought treatment had a very different effect on the plant transcriptome than herbivory treatments ( Figure 4). Overall, it enhanced the general plant response to both herbivores, as indicated by the 587 additional genes that were induced by both insects (281 upregulated, 306 downregulated;  Figure 4C, part f) in drought-stressed plants. 2.7. Herbivore Responses that Were not Induced by CPB in Drought-Stressed Plants In addition to the insect-specific induced responses, we analysed the part of the common herbivory response that was no longer significantly induced when CPB herbivory occurred on drought-treated plants. We zoomed in on these responses because it may help to understand why CPB performance was not so negatively affected by drought-stressed plants as that of BAW. Forty BPs fell into this category ( Figure 4D, part h; listed in  Figure 9). Among them, 34 BPs were no longer significantly upregulated by CPB herbivory on drought-treated plants, including processes described as response to insect (GO:0009625, as shown in  Figure 6) or related to hormonal signalling (four), cell wall organization and biogenesis (six), lipid (six) and secondary metabolism (four BPs in biosynthesis of suberin, pigments, tetracyclic triterpenoid and sulphur compounds). The other six BPs, which were no longer significantly downregulated by CPB herbivory on drought-treated plants, included three BPs related to photosynthesis and two related to carbohydrate metabolism. At the gene level, 30 significant genes (17 upregulated, 13 downregulated) fitting these expressing patterns were found ( Figure 4C, part h;  Figure S5). Notably, among the herbivore-responsive genes that were no longer significantly upregulated by CPB on drought-treated plants, five are involved in cell wall remodelling and carbohydrate metabolism (a cellulose synthase-like protein, a pectin acetylesterase-like protein, a glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase, a UDP- d-glucuronate 4-epimerase, and a UDP-glucosyltransferase). These processes and genes might contribute to a better defence of drought-treated  S. dulcamara plants against BAW, but not to CPB, resulting in the reduced performance of BAW. 2.1. Drought Treatment Differentially Affects Herbivore Performance The effect of drought on the insect resistance of  S. dulcamara was examined by subjecting plants under well-watering (control) and drought treatments to herbivory treatments by either BAW or CPB larvae. Insect weight gain was used as a proxy measure of plant resistance to insect herbivores. The result showed a statistically significant interactive effect on insect weight gain between water treatments and herbivore species ( F(1, 44) = 6.734,  p = 0.013). After a five-day feeding period on drought-treated plants, BAW larvae gained significantly less weight ( p = 0.045), whereas CPB larvae tended to gain more weight ( p = 0.081) compared with their conspecifics feeding on control plants ( Figure 1). Thus, only the performance of BAW was negatively affected when feeding on drought-stressed plants, indicating an increased resistance of  S. dulcamara plants to BAW, but not to CPB when under drought. 2.4. Drought and Insect Herbivory Increase Serine-Type PI (serPI) Levels and PI Gene Expression As PI activity is a well-known defence against insect herbivores, we also analysed levels of serine PI (serPI), which inhibit proteases with a serine at their active sites, and the regulation of PI-related genes of  S. dulcamara plants under drought and herbivory treatments. As expected, insect herbivory significantly increased serPI levels of  S. dulcamara plants ( Figure 7A,  Table S3). Moreover, drought induced serPI levels as well as the expression levels of four PI genes (comp460, 251, 255, and 1799;  Figure S3). There was no statistically significant interaction between water availability and herbivory treatments on serPI levels. However, when comparing within each watering treatment, herbivory only significantly increased serPI levels in drought-treated plants, and the effect of CPB herbivory on serPI levels was more pronounced than that of BAW. In addition, drought had a significant and positive main effect on the total protein contents of  S. dulcamara leaves ( Figure 7B).","In nature, plants are frequently subjected to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses, resulting in a convergence of adaptive responses. We hypothesised that hormonal signalling regulating defences to different herbivores may interact with drought responses, causing distinct resistance phenotypes. To test this, we studied the hormonal and transcriptomic responses of  Solanum dulcamara  subjected to drought and herbivory by the generalist  Spodoptera exigua  (beet armyworm; BAW) or the specialist  Leptinotarsa decemlineata  (Colorado potato beetle; CPB). Bioassays showed that the performance of BAW, but not CPB, decreased on plants under drought compared to controls. While drought did not alter BAW-induced hormonal responses, it enhanced the CPB-induced accumulation of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid (SA), and suppressed ethylene (ET) emission. Microarray analyses showed that under drought, BAW herbivory enhanced several herbivore-induced responses, including cell-wall remodelling and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and secondary metabolites. In contrast, CPB herbivory enhanced several photosynthesis-related and pathogen responses in drought-stressed plants. This may divert resources away from defence production and increase leaf nutritive value. In conclusion, while BAW suffers from the drought-enhanced defences, CPB may benefit from the effects of enhanced SA and reduced ET signalling. This suggests that the fine-tuned interaction between the plant and its specialist herbivore is sustained under drought."," 'Transcriptional regulation', 'Spodoptera exigua', 'Plant defence', 'Leptinotarsa decemlineata', 'Drought Response', 'Hormonal Signalling', 'Solanum Dulcamara' "," 'Figure', 'CPB', 'CPB herbivory', 'BAW', 'BAW herbivory', 'herbivory', 'Plants', 'Drought', 'genes', 'Responses' "," ’s, BAW-specific, b +c, ribosomal proteins, S5, oxidase, BAW-specific, serPI, SA, 8), ‘, ‘, BPs, CPB-BAW, BPs, CPB-BAW  drought , BPs, BPs, BPs, GO:0019216, BPs, GO:0006626, BPs, ‘, ‘, ‘, ‘, drought-upregulated, GO:0015995, BAW-induced, C, F(2.29, ABA, SA, JA, ABA, JA, ABA, SA, SA, BAW-damaged, JA, SA, herbivory-induced ET, 33,957, ‘, ’, ’, BPs, BPs, BPs, BPs, BPs, BPs, protease inhibitors, Drought-Stressed, BPs, GO:0009625, BPs, BPs, BPs, S5, herbivore-responsive, pectin acetylesterase-like, glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase, UDP- d-glucuronate, UDP-glucosyltransferase, F(1, Serine-Type PI, serPI, serPI, serPI, serPI, comp460, serPI, serPI, serPI ",  ," 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.'

Elevated levels of methyl jasmonate induce jasmonate-dependent defense responses, associated with a decline in primary metabolism and enhancement of secondary metabolism of plants. However, there is no information of how stress resistance of plants, and accordingly the sensitivity to exogenous MeJA can be decreased by endophytic plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) harboring ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate) deaminase. In this study, we estimated stress alleviating potential of endophytic PGPR against MeJA-induced plant perturbations through assessing photosynthetic traits and stress volatile emissions. We used mild (5 mM) to severe (20 mM) MeJA and endophytic plant growth promoting rhizobacteria Burkholderia vietnamiensis CBMB40 and studied how MeJA and B. vietnamiensis treatments influenced temporal changes in photosynthetic characteristics and stress volatile emissions. Separate application of MeJA markedly decreased photosynthetic characteristics and increased lipoxygenase pathway (LOX) volatiles, volatile isoprenoids, saturated aldehydes, lightweight oxygenated compounds (LOC), geranyl-geranyl diphosphate pathway (GGDP) volatiles, and benzenoids. However, MeJA-treated leaves inoculated by endophytic bacteria B. vietnamiensis had substantially increased photosynthetic characteristics and decreased emissions of LOX, volatile isoprenoids and other stress volatiles compared with non-inoculated MeJA treatments, especially at later stages of recovery. In addition, analysis of leaf terpenoid contents demonstrated that several mono- and sesquiterpenes were de novo synthesized upon MeJA and B. vietnamiensis applications.

13,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7952643/eupmc_result.json,PMC7952643,"Results Evaluating TSSM Performance and Fecundity Under Controlled Growth Conditions To validate whether Ofir was more resistant to TSSMs than Shiran in a controlled environment, two complementary experiments were conducted: (i) mite reproduction, in which the number of mobile mites was evaluated on whole mite-infested plants for 13 days; and (ii) mite oviposition, in which the number of eggs was counted for 5 days during mite infestation using leaf disks. As shown in  Figure 3A, mite reproduction was significantly higher on Shiran (386.5) than on Ofir (306.2) plants, suggesting that Shiran is more susceptible to TSSMs under laboratory conditions. We determined the oviposition rate of TSSMs on the cultivars by applying females and counting new eggs each day, as shown in  Figure 3B. The two-way ANOVA indicated a significant difference in the number of eggs between sampling days ( df = 4;  F = 6.3;  p < 0.0001), while no significant difference was detected between the cultivars ( df = 1;  F = 1.1;  p = 0.29). Therefore, we conducted a one-way-ANOVA comparing the number of eggs on each cultivar separately. On Ofir, the highest number of eggs was counted on the 3rd day (9.4 eggs per female), then it declined to 8.3 eggs per female on the 5th day, while on Shiran, the highest numbers of eggs were counted on days 3–5 (9.1–9.9 eggs per female). These results revealed the different time responses of the two cultivars, possibly driven by variations in the molecular mechanisms. Comparing the Expression of Genes Associated With the Terpene Pathway and Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis Salicylic acid (SA) is synthesized via two pathways: (i) chorismate through  Isochorismate synthase (ICS) and (ii) from Phe via  Phe ammonia-lyase (PAL) (Lefevere et al.,  2020). The gene list was generated from LycoCyc ( http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/) and MetaCyc databases (Caspi et al.,  2018). The results of the genes involved in SA and volatile benzenoid ester biosynthesis are shown in  Table 2A. In Ofir, the expression levels of 11 genes from the Phe pathway were altered upon mite infestation, including  PALs (Solyc03g042560, Solyc05g056170, Solyc09g007900, and Solyc09g007910),  Benzoate-CoA ligase (BCLA; Solyc12g044300),  Benzyl alcohol benzoyl transferase (BEBT; Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, and Solyc07g049670),  Cinnamate:CoA ligase (CNL; Solyc02g081360), and  Salicylate 1-O-methyltransferase (SAMT; Solyc01g081340 and Solyc09g091550), and the expression of  ICS (Solyc06g071030) from the chorismate pathway was significantly decreased. In Shiran, the expression levels of 9 genes from the Phe pathway were altered, including  PALs (Solyc10g011920, Solyc03g036470, and Solyc09g007900),  BEBTs (Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, Solyc07g049670, and Solyc08g005760), and  CNLs (Solyc02g081360 and Solyc03g031870), while the level of  ICS did not change. While several genes were significantly modified in response to mite-infestation, none of these genes were significantly different between the two cultivars' untreated samples (constitutive differences), suggesting that the SA pathway is mostly involved in the inducible defense mechanisms. Altogether, the results indicate a dramatic change in the gene expression levels of SA and volatile benzenoid ester biosynthesis, mostly affected by mite treatment (inducible manner). Additionally, only a slight effect on the terpene biosynthesis pathway was seen, which was enriched more in the Ofir than the Shiran cultivar (constitutive manner). The terpene biosynthesis gene list was generated according to a recently published study characterizing the tomato  Terpene synthase (TPS) gene family by Zhou and Pichersky ( 2020) and  Apocarotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) by Ilg et al. ( 2014). Out of 51 genes, 23 were detected in our dataset. As shown in  Table 2A, five  Terpene synthase (TPS) genes were highly expressed in untreated Ofir vs. Shiran, including  TPS5 (Solyc01g105890),  TPS7 (Solyc01g105920), and  TPS19/20 (Solyc08g005665) involved in monoterpene biosynthesis,  TPS9 (Solyc06g059885) involved in monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis, and  TPS18 (Solyc08g005720) involved in diterpene biosynthesis. This revealed the constitutive transcriptomic difference between the two tomato cultivars. Upon mite-infestation in the Ofir cultivar, the expression levels of six genes were reduced, including  TPS4 (Solyc01g105880),  TPS12 (Solyc06g059930),  Geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases (GGPPSs; Solyc04g079960 and Solyc02g085700),  Solanesyl diphosphate synthase (SPPS; Solyc07g061990), and  Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD2; Solyc01g087260), while  TPS46 (Solyc03g006550) was significantly overexpressed. In Shiran cultivar, three genes were underexpressed ( TPS35, Solyc01g101210;  GGPPS2, Solyc04g079960 and  CCD2, Solyc01g087260), and two genes were overexpressed ( TPS5, Solyc01g105890; and  TPS46, Solyc03g006550). Notably, the gene ID of  TPS20 and  TPS19 was Solyc08g005665.1, Solyc08g005670.2, and then Solyc08g005665.1 again in  S. lycopersicum annotation versions 2.4, 3.2, and 4.0, respectively. Both gene IDs have been used in the literature (Xu et al.,  2018; Zhou and Pichersky,  2020). The current annotation suggests that  TPS19 and  TPS20 are two coding sequences on the same transcript and are likely splice variants. However, their high sequence similarity prevented the distinction between the two during the mapping phase. Therefore, to separate them in the current RNAseq data, their amino acid variation from the reference genome (Heinz. cv) was used to infer their presence in the raw sequencing reads. A few reads that showed amino acid profiles congruent with both proteins, were excluded. The quantification of the reads revealed that both isoforms are present in Ofir and Shiran ( Supplementary Figure 4). In all four groups,  TPS20 had more reads than  TPS19. Unlike the TMM analysis, where  TPS19/20 was not detected in control samples of Shiran cultivar ( Supplementary Table 5), a few reads were detected in these samples. Pathway Analysis and Identification of Relevant Metabolic Pathways Mediating the Tomato Responses Against TSSMs As presented in  Table 1C, only a few pathways within the overlap group were significantly enriched, including the initial reaction of phenylpropanoids toward flavonols and suberin biosynthesis, as well as the biosynthesis of the phytohormone, SA. Together, these observations revealed the contribution of cultivars to the variation, which was mainly associated with secondary metabolism. In contrast, the mite-inducible changes were related to both primary and secondary metabolism. The overlap group, which represents genes that differ by both cultivar type and infestation treatment, is related to secondary metabolism. GO enrichment for each of these groups showed similar results to  Table 1, with a few additional categories. The GO enrichment summary of biological process, molecular function, and cellular component is presented in the  Supplementary Table 4. There was at least one pathway in all the groups involved in the metabolism of volatile compounds, including monoterpenes, salicylate (and MeSA), and volatile benzenoid ester biosynthesis. Therefore, we further explored these two pathways, looking at gene expression and measuring volatile composition changes. To investigate the global transcriptional changes of the tomato cultivars, leaves from 5-week-old plants were infested with 60 TSSMs for 3 days, and then samples from TSSM-infested and untreated controls were collected. The total transcript levels (22,592 genes with no zero values) were used to construct a principal component analysis (PCA) plot. As presented in  Figure 4A, the PCA plot indicates that each cultivar's samples were clustered with one another. The samples were separated into infestation treatments, which explained 92% of the variance (PC1), and into cultivars, which explained 4% of the variance (PC2). This analysis suggests strong inducible responses of both cultivars following TSSM infestation, as well as distinct constitutively expressed sets of genes between the two cultivars. The DESeq2 tool was used to detect differentially expressed genes in the transcriptomic dataset (Love et al.,  2014), which generated two sets of transcriptional variations: (i) between the two cultivars and (ii) between treatments (TSSM-infested vs. untreated control). A list of the gene sets is presented in  Supplementary Table 3. The analysis of differentially expressed genes resulted in a total number of 7,099 differentially expressed genes, and the distribution of these genes was calculated and is presented in a Venn diagram ( Figure 4B). Many genes were altered in response to mite attack (6,632), while only a small number of genes (252) were differentially expressed between the two cultivars. Additionally, 215 genes varied between both cultivar and treatment. This result indicates that the major transcriptomic effects are induced by TSSM infestation. To reveal the biological processes involved in each group of the Venn diagram, an over-representation pathway enrichment analysis was performed, and the results were compared using the LycoCyc database ( http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/). In this analysis, the differentially expressed genes were included (both up- and downregulated in each group). In  Table 1, the significantly enriched pathways of cultivars, TSSM-induced treatment, and overlap group genes are presented ( Tables 1A–C, respectively). The pathways significantly enriched by the cultivars alone were mainly associated with the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids (flavonol, syringetin, luteolin, and leucopelargonidin and leucocyanidin) and terpenoids (monoterpenes). A large number of over-represented pathways were enriched upon mite infestation, including the following central metabolic pathways: amino acid biosynthesis (Phe, Tyr, Trp, Asp, and Glu), fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis (phospholipids), photosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism ( Table 1B). Additionally, several pathways associated with secondary compound biosynthesis were enriched: cofactor, prosthetic group, electron carrier, and vitamin (folate and chlorophyll cycle), nitrogen-containing compounds (hydroxycinnamic acid tyramine amides), and terpenoid (antheraxanthin and violaxanthin, and phaseic acid). Notably, another over-represented pathway was the biosynthesis of volatile benzenoid esters (i.e., MeSA and methylbenzoate), which result from the degradation of aromatic compounds (Tzin and Galili,  2010). Evaluation of Mite Populations in the Net House and Their Damage to Tomato Leaves The two commercial tomato cultivars (Shiran and Ofir) were selected based on the following information: description on the Rimi website ( www.rimi.co.il), and pre-observation by the Agriculture Extension Service of Israel that reported a lower mite population on Ofir than on the other commonly grown cultivars of cluster cherry tomato. Mite populations were evaluated according to the adult and juvenile pest life cycle stages (eggs were excluded). The average numbers of adult and juvenile mites on two sampling dates, 5 and 8 weeks after TSSM infestation, are presented in  Figure 1. A comparison of the two sampling dates indicated that Shiran had more mites than Ofir in the juvenile stages, while only on the 5 weeks the adult stage had significantly higher on Shiran than on Ofir. In the 8 weeks, the adult mite population on Shiran had reduced, and in Ofir, it was not changed, which might be the outcome of severe plant damage.  Supplementary Figure 3 shows the total number of adult and juvenile mites on the two tomato cultivars along 2 months of scouting for mites. These results also show a higher number of both adults and juveniles on Shiran vs. Ofir. Overall, they suggest that in net house growth conditions, Shiran is more mite susceptible than Ofir. Additionally, plant morphology was scored at a single time point (5 weeks after TSSM infestation;  Figure 2A), 3 months from the beginning of the experiment.  Figure 2B presents the distribution of the plant damage in the two tomato cultivars in the net house. Most Shiran plants were mildly damaged and more damaged than most of the Ofir plants. These results suggest that the plant damage was related to the intensity of mite infestation, and that the Ofir cultivar is more resistant to mites. Content of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) To compare the amount of VOCs in each cultivar and condition, we measured all compounds produced on day 3 dpi, and the change in each VOC was tested by a one-way ANOVA. Overall, 29 out of 54 VOCs varied significantly ( df = 4; Fisher's LSD;  p ≤ 0.05), indicating unique volatile content between the cultivars and treatments ( Supplementary Table 7A). The most pronounced differences between the cultivars were in the levels of monoterpenes, of which 3,7,7-trimethyl-1,3,5-cycloheptatriene and β-myrcene were only detected in Ofir, and seven other monoterpenes were over-represented in Ofir relative to Shiran. Additionally, the most pronounced difference in response to TSSM infestation was in the level of the benzenoid compound methyl benzoate, which increased in response to TSSM infestation in both cultivars. Overall, MeSA was the most abundant molecule, followed by β-phellandrene in Ofir and methyl benzoate in Shiran ( Supplementary Table 7B). To compare the total amount of VOCs in each cultivar and condition, we measured all 54 compounds produced. The total VOC content extracted from the Ofir control plants was approximately twice that of the Shiran plants. Upon infestation, both Ofir and Shiran plants produced ~1.5 times more VOCs ( Supplementary Table 7B). The transcriptome analysis suggested that one of the major differences between these cultivars was related to the metabolism of VOCs. The two cultivars' volatile content was determined under both mite-infested and untreated control conditions using the HS-SPME-GC-MS technique to link the transcriptomic to the metabolic changes. A total of 54 metabolites were identified across all different treatments, including 12 monoterpenes, 7 sesquiterpenes, 8 irregular terpenes, 7 phenylpropanoids and benzenoids, and 20 aliphatics ( Supplementary Table 6). In a principal component analysis, the majority of variance in volatiles content was due to the cultivar factor (PC1, 68.7% of total variation). The TSSM infestation factor (PC2) explained another 10% of the total variation in the data, reflecting the induced change in the volatiles content ( Supplementary Figure 5). Further evidence for volatile differences between the two cultivars was discovered by measuring the VOC profile of tomatoes grown in the net house. Leaf samples were collected over 3 months, and volatiles were detected using GC-MS liquid extraction. The results suggested that Ofir accumulated higher amounts of volatiles during this time than in Shiran ( Supplementary Figure 7). These findings supported our laboratory experiments, wherein the total amount of VOCs was higher in Ofir than Shiran ( Supplementary Table 7B). Furthermore, 1 week after TSSM infestation, the amount of volatiles increased until 2 weeks after infestation. Subsequently, it declined during the establishment of the mite population ( Figure 1 and  Supplementary Figure 5, respectively). The VOC list is presented in  Supplementary Table 8. To compare the relative levels of VOCs, Student's  t-tests were conducted. The values in log2 fold change, separated into five volatile biosynthetic classes, are presented in  Table 3. This analysis revealed that nine compounds from the mono-, and irregular terpenes differed between the two cultivars in both conditions (mite-infested and untreated control), including 4-carene, limonene, p-cymene, p-cymenene, terpinolene, α-terpinene, β-phellandrene, β-pinene, and crypton. However, only two compounds, α-pinene and o-guaiacol, were modified in the untreated Ofir vs. untreated Shian, and three compounds, 1-nonanol, 1-Octanol, and methyl salicylate, were altered in mite-infested Ofir vs. mite-infested Shiran. Methyl benzoate was the only compound that increased upon mite infestation in Shiran cultivar, while none of the metabolites changed upon mite infestation in the Ofir cultivar. Notably, two monoterpenes 3,7,7-trimethyl-1,3,5-cycloheptatriene and β-myrcene were detected only in the Ofir cultivar. These comparisons suggested that monoterpenes are the main VOCs that differ between cultivars (constitutive levels), while only minor changes occur upon TSSM attack. In this dataset, Ofir and Shiran seemed to produce different volatile patterns, both in quality and quantity. The question was whether differences in these patterns were due to changes in specific classes of metabolites. To that end, the use of hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward's linkage) resulted in a heatmap, presented in  Supplementary Figure 6. Overall, the VOC dataset was divided into six clusters, and volatiles mostly grouped by classes (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and irregular terpenes). Six groups of metabolites were further selected, and their average levels were present in infested and untreated plants at different times (1, 3, 5, and 7 dpi) shown in  Figure 5. The sum of 9 monoterpenes was more than 10 times higher in Ofir than in Shiran. Notably, the only monoterpenes in greater quantity in Shiran were α-pinene and β-pinene ( Figures 5A,B, respectively). Both sesquiterpene and the irregular terpenes presented similar patterns between the groups and were higher in Ofir than in Shiran. However, irregular terpenes varied more between the Shiran control and infested treatments ( Figures 5C,D, respectively). The volatile phytohormone MeSA was significantly higher in Ofir than in Shiran and increased in the infested treatments ( Figure 5E). Methyl benzoate was the most prominent compounds that increased in response to TSSM infestation in both cultivars and was the only compound that increased over time ( Figure 5F). VOCs associated with the aliphatic class did not show a clear pattern, and most of them were more abundant in Ofir than Shiran, except 1-nonanol, and 1-octanol, which presented the opposite trend ( Table 3 and  Supplementary Figure 6). Olfactometry Bioassay of TSSM and  Phytoseiulus persimilis Upon Exposure to Shiran and Ofir Odors A Y-shape olfactometry bioassay was designed ( Figure 6) to understand the effect of different VOC emissions on mite behavior. The TSSMs showed no preference for the odor source emitted by intact Shiran-control and Ofir-control plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577). Similarly, TSSMs had no preference when given a choice between Ofir-control and Ofir-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577), Shiran-control and Shiran-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.13;  p = 0.715), and Shiran-infested and Ofir-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.78;  p = 0.376;  Figure 6A).  Phytoseiulus persimilis predatory mite is known to respond to unique VOC compositions (Takabayashi et al.,  2000). Therefore, we tested the indirect effect of the VOCs blend of the two cultivars on these mites by exposing them to either TSSM-infested or untreated (control) Ofir and Shiran volatile emissions. The  P. persimilis clearly chose Ofir-infested over Shiran-infested plants (χ 2 = 4.94;  p = 0.0263;  Figure 6B).  Phytoseiulus persimilis did not show a significant preference when given a choice between Shiran-control and Ofir-control plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577), Ofir-control and Ofir-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577), and Shiran-control and Shiran-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.13;  p = 0.715). The results indicated that the predator mite could distinguish between infested Ofir and Shiran, but the TSSM could not.","The two-spotted spider mite (TSSM;  Tetranychus urticae ) is a ubiquitous polyphagous arthropod pest that has a major economic impact on the tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) industry. Tomato plants have evolved broad defense mechanisms regulated by the expression of defense genes, phytohormones, and secondary metabolites present constitutively and/or induced upon infestation. Although tomato defense mechanisms have been studied for more than three decades, only a few studies have compared domesticated cultivars' natural mite resistance at the molecular level. The main goal of our research was to reveal the molecular differences between two tomato cultivars with similar physical (trichome morphology and density) and agronomic traits (fruit size, shape, color, cluster architecture), but with contrasting TSSM susceptibility. A net house experiment indicated a mite-resistance difference between the cultivars, and a climate-controlled performance and oviposition bioassay supported these findings. A transcriptome analysis of the two cultivars after 3 days of TSSM infestation, revealed changes in the genes associated with primary and secondary metabolism, including salicylic acid and volatile biosynthesis (volatile benzenoid ester and monoterpenes). The  Terpene synthase  genes,  TPS5, TPS7 , and  TPS19/20 , encoding enzymes that synthesize the monoterpenes linalool, β-myrcene, limonene, and β-phellandrene were highly expressed in the resistant cultivar. The volatile profile of these cultivars upon mite infestation for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days, revealed substantial differences in monoterpenoid and phenylpropanoid volatiles, results consistent with the transcriptomic data. Comparing the metabolic changes that occurred in each cultivar and upon mite-infestation indicated that monoterpenes are the main metabolites that differ between cultivars (constitutive levels), while only minor changes occurred upon TSSM attack. To test the effect of these volatile variations on mites, we subjected both the TSSM and its corresponding predator,  Phytoseiulus persimilis , to an olfactory choice bioassay. The predator mites were only significantly attracted to the TSSM pre-infested resistant cultivar and not to the susceptible cultivar, while the TSSM itself showed no preference. Overall, our findings revealed the contribution of constitutive and inducible levels of volatiles on mite performance. This study highlights monoterpenoids' function in plant resistance to pests and may inform the development of new resistant tomato cultivars."," 'Salicylic acid', 'Tetranychus urticae (Koch)', 'Terpene synthase', 'volatile organic compounds', 'Solanum Lycopersicum', 'Phytoseiulus Persimilis' "," 'Ofir', 'Shiran', 'Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Figure', 'Ofir cultivar', 'Shiran cultivar', 'cultivars', 'TSSM infestation', 'Table' "," Ofir, TSSMs, mite-infested, TSSMs, TSSMs, Ofir, http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/, 2A, Ofir, Solyc03g042560, Solyc05g056170, Solyc09g007900, Solyc09g007910, BCLA, Solyc12g044300, BEBT, Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, Solyc07g049670, CoA ligase, Solyc02g081360, SAMT, Solyc01g081340, Solyc09g091550, Solyc06g071030, chorismate, 9, Solyc10g011920, Solyc03g036470, Solyc09g007900, Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, Solyc07g049670, Solyc08g005760, Solyc02g081360, Solyc03g031870, SA, Ofir, 2A, Ofir, Solyc01g105890, Solyc01g105920, Solyc08g005665, Solyc06g059885, Solyc08g005720, Solyc01g105880, Solyc06g059930, GGPPSs, Solyc04g079960, Solyc02g085700, Solyc07g061990, Solyc01g087260, Solyc03g006550, TPS35, Solyc01g101210, Solyc04g079960, Solyc01g087260, TPS5, Solyc01g105890, Solyc03g006550, Solyc08g005665.1, Solyc08g005670.2, Solyc08g005665.1, IDs, TPS19, RNAseq, Ofir, TSSMs, SA, mite-inducible, TSSMs, TSSM-infested, 22,592, PC2, DESeq2, TSSM, Venn, http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/, TSSM-induced, Trp, Asp, Ofir, Rimi, Ofir, TSSM, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, TSSM, Ofir, ≤, Ofir, Ofir, TSSM, TSSM, MeSA, β-phellandrene, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, mite-infested, TSSM infestation factor, PC2, Ofir, Ofir, TSSM, mite-infested, β-pinene, α-pinene, Ofir, TSSM, Ofir, Ofir, α-pinene, β-pinene ( Figures 5A, B, Ofir, D, Ofir, TSSM, Ofir, TSSM, Ofir Odors A Y-shape, TSSMs, Shiran-control, Ofir-control plants, χ 2, TSSMs, Ofir-control, Ofir-infested plants, χ 2, Shiran-control, Shiran-infested plants, χ 2, Shiran-infested, Ofir-infested plants, χ 2, TSSM-infested, Ofir-infested, Shiran-infested, χ 2, Shiran-control, Ofir-control plants, χ 2, Ofir-control, Ofir-infested plants, χ 2, Shiran-control, Shiran-infested plants, χ 2, Ofir "," '(TPS)', '(TPS)', 'TPS5', 'TPS7', 'TPS19/20', 'TPS9', 'TPS18', 'TPS4', 'TPS12', 'TPS46', 'TPS35,', 'TPS5,', 'TPS46,', 'TPS20', 'TPS19', 'TPS19', 'TPS20', 'TPS20', 'TPS19.', 'TPS19/20' ", 'S.' , 'lycopersicum' ,terpene synthase
14,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC8214791/eupmc_result.json,PMC8214791,"Results Aroma components in different types of grapes The aroma components of 10 varieties in berry skin and berry flesh were measured at the mature stage, and results showed that the aroma components in the berry skin were more abundant than that in berry flesh (Fig. S 3, Table S 5). There were 18, 20, 20, 26, 33 types of aroma in berry skin more than that in berry flesh in rose-scented varieties, 29, 37, 39 types in strawberry-scented varieties, and 20, 26 in non-fragrant varieties. The main terpene aromas in grapes included linalool and geraniol, of which geraniol was mainly in the rose-scented varieties. We found that β-pinene and α-pinene were mainly volatile aroma components in strawberry-scented varieties (Fig.  4). Linalool is the key component of terpene aroma in grapes, found in different scented varieties and occupied a large proportion. ‘Red Italia’ was a red rose-scented variety with many unique ingredients, different from red strawberry-scented varieties, red non-fragrant and green rose-scented varieties. D-limonene was rich in berry skin and berry flesh of ‘Red Italia’, cis-linaloloxide and trans-rose oxide were also specifically detected in ‘Red Italia’. In addition, we also detected germacrene D,which belong to the sesquiterpene aroma in ‘Jing Zaojing’ and ‘Summer Black’. Tissue expression of HMGR family in ‘Kyoho’ grape We detected the expression levels of 3 HMGRs family members in the bud, root, stem, leaf, flower, tendril, exocarp, pulp, and xylem sap of 'Kyoho' grape. The results showed that the expression of  VvHMGRs in 'Kyoho' had obvious organization specificity. As shown in Fig.  2A,  VvHMGR1 has always been highly expressed, and its expression levels in leaves, flowers, and exocarp was much higher than in other tissues. The expression level of  VvHMGR2 was the lowest among the three members, and expression level in stems, flowers and exocarp were higher than in other tissues. The expression level of  VvHMGR3 was low in peel and pulp and higher in other tissues. As the fruit develops, the expression level of  VvHMGR3 was getting lower gradually. By measuring the enzyme activity of HMGR during the fruit development process, as a whole, the enzyme activity in peel and pulp showed a decreasing trend, and higher in pulp than peel (Fig.  2B). This phenomenon indicates that  VvHMGR3 is more directly related to the enzymatic activity of HMGR, and its expression greatly affects the enzymatic activity. Therefore, the enzyme activity in the peel is lower than that in pulp. Identification and evolutionary analysis of  VvHMGRs genes in grape We predicted  VvHMGR in the genome sequence scaffolds of Pinot noir grape and used HMMER 3.0 and Pfam protein family databases to search sequence homologs in grape genomes. SMAT and INTERPROSCAN programs were used to verify the predicted genes, which were three  VvHMGRs in grape,  VvHMGR1 (XM_002283147),  VvHMGR2 (XM_002265602),  VvHMGR3 (XM_002275791). Three  VvHMGRs are located on chromosomes 3, 4, and 18, respectively (Fig.  1C), and the length of the coding region is between 1710 and 1930 bp, which is the same as  Arabidopsis thaliana, Citrus sinensis, Glycine max, Populus trichocarpa, and  Solanum lycopersicum. The information of  HMGRs genes of 7 species is listed in Table S 2. The secondary structure of all  HMGRs genes is dominated by α helix and random coils, accounting for 80% (Table S 3), and all are located at the endoplasmic reticulum (Table S 4). According to the analysis of the evolutionary relationship (Fig.  1A),  VvHMGR1 is closely related to  CsHMGR2, PtHMGR3 and  PtHMGR5, and  VvHMGR2 closest to  PtHMGR1 and  PtHMGR6, while  VvHMGR3 closest to  CsHMGR1 and  GmHMGR9, which has collinearity with  CsHMGR2 and  GmHMGR4 (Fig.  1B). HMGR is highly conserved among different species (Fig.  1A, Fig. S 1). It contains 14 common motifs (Fig. S 2). The structures of VvHMGR1 and VvHMGR2 are consistent. Compared with other members, VvHMGR3 has motif16. All  HMGR genes from selected species contain no introns, and at least one UTR region except for  GmHMGR6 (Fig.  1D). The gene structure of  VvHMGRs is consistent, with the same number and different lengths of UTRs. VvHMGR3 responds to external conditions We can see the variation of  VvHMGR3 under different pH, osmotic stress, NaCl concentration, temperature, and UV treatment time from Fig.  6. On the whole,  VvHMGR3 was regulated by salt stress, temperature stress, and ultraviolet radiation, and it also had different responses to four hormones. The final expression of  VvHMGR3 was up-regulated under Eth, MeJA, SA and IAA treatment, and the response time was different, Eth was 48 h, AA was 24 h, MeJA and SA were 12 h, respectively. For the concentration of treatment,  VvHMGR3 was affected by the high concentration of MeJA and medium concentration of SA, the expression of VvHMGR3 was proportional to the hormone concentration except for SA. In osmotic stress treatment, the response of  VvHMGR3 to pH and PEG was lower than that of NaCl, which was manifested as a relatively alkaline environment, high osmotic value, and high salt content. The expression of  VvHMGR3increased sharply at 24 h and then decreased slowly under normal conditions, while under UV treatment, the expression of  VvHMGR3 was much higher than normal grapes at 24 h, indicating that UV promoted the expression of  VvHMGR3. During the postharvest storage, ultra-low temperature treatment (-20 °C) slowed down the high expression of  VvHMGR3, while high temperature (25 °C and 37 °C) and ordinary low temperature (4 °C) decreased the expression of  VvHMGR3. In summary,  VvHMGR3 was regulated by hormone, osmotic stress, light and temperature stress, especially salt stress, and UV treatment. HMGR plays an important role in grape growth and development Combined with evolutionary bioinformatics analysis (Fig.  1, S 4), tissue expression pattern (Fig.  2), and expression pattern of  VvHMGRs in different types of fruits (Fig.  3,  5), we predicted  VvHMGR3 play an important role in the growth and development process of grape. By analyzing the transmembrane structure, VvHMGRs protein exhibited transmembrane properties. VvHMGR1 had 9 inside to outside (i-o) helices, 9 outside to inside helices (o-i), VvHMGR2 had 7 i-o and 8 o-i, and VvHMGR3 had 6 i-o and 5 o-i (Fig. S 4A). The secondary structures of VvHMGRs were quite different, composed of alpha-helix, extended strand, and random coil, and distributed throughout the protein (Fig. S 4B). The tertiary structure was highly conserved, and its catalytic region contains L, N, and S three binding domains. The L domain is the largest, with two HMG-CoA binding domains and one NADP(H) binding domain, while the small spiral S domain contains another NADP(H) binding domain (Fig. S 4C). The computational predictions for cis elements in the promoter of the  VvHMGRs genes suggest that they are in a complex network of environmental and phytohormone regulation (Fig. S 4D). Through the interaction protein prediction based on protein structure, VvHMGRs possibly interact with HMG-CoA synthase, MVA kinase, FPP/GGPP synthase, and diphosphate mevalonate decarboxylase confirming that the most important effect of HMGR was to take part in the synthesize and metabolize of terpenoids based on MVA pathways (Fig. S 4E). Expression patterns of  VvHMGRs during different developmental stages in different types of grapes Through the detection of expression levels of  VvHMGRs in ten grape varieties, we found that  VvHMGR1 has always maintained a relatively high expression level during the fruit development of all varieties, especially in yellow rose fragrance varieties (Fig.  3). The expression level of  VvHMGR2 was always low, not affected by the fruit development stage in ‘Summer Black’ ‘Fujiminori’ ‘Jing Zaojing’ and ‘Centennial seedless’, while decreased gradually in other varieties. The expression level of  VvHMGR3 in rose fragrance varieties (‘Shine Muscat’ and ‘Yellow Italia’) was higher than that of other varieties, and it showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing during fruit development, which was related to the enlargement of early fruit and strong terpenoid metabolism as aroma formation in the later fruit. However, this phenomenon did not exist in strawberry fragrance fruits. Overall, the expression levels of  VvHMGRs in different color fruits were different, and the expression level in red fruits was low, especially in ‘Summer Black’ and ‘Fujiminori’. In the yellow varieties with rose fragrance, the expression level of  VvHMGRs was the highest, and in the red varieties with strawberry fragrance was the lowest. The expression level of  VvHMGR3 in yellow fruit was overall high, especially deep yellow color variety ‘Shine Muscat’ and ‘Yellow Italia’, while ‘Jingzaojing’ and ‘Centennial seedless’, which are mainly green, showed relatively low expression. In the sampling process, we found that the yellow color of ‘Red Italian’ was deepening in the early stage of fruit development, and it was pale pink when mature. The expression pattern of  VvHMGR3 was similar to the yellow variety, which also confirmed this phenomenon. Changes of terpenoids and anthocyanin metabolism associated genes expression and their correlation with  VvHMGRs The gene expression levels of aroma formation and color-related pathways were tested in skins from ten grape varieties at the mature stage. After gene-level clustering (Fig.  5A), we found that  VvHMGR3 had similar trends in expression with  VvCRTISO1, VvZDS, VvCYP97A, VvDXR, and  VvCMK.  VvHMGR1 was similar with the changes of  VvMCT, VvNCED6, and  VvLCYB.  VvHMGR2 was similar with  VvGGPPS-SS and  VvCCD8, which means that  VvHMGRs might be linked to the carotenoid biosynthesis and MEP pathways. Because of the high expressed genes concealing the changes of other genes, we have carried out the normalization of genes to show each gene to the greatest extent. Through sample-level clustering (Fig.  5B), the MVA pathway genes expression patterns of typical yellow rose-scented varieties ‘Shine-Muscat’ were the same with ‘Centennial Seedless’, and clustered together with ‘Yellow Italia’. The MEP pathway gene expression pattern of ‘Shine-Muscat’ were different from others, and its anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway was consistent with the changes in ‘Yellow Italia’, carotenoid biosynthesis was similar to ‘Centennial Seedless’, but carotenoid catabolism and xanthophyll biosynthesis were different from others. The typical red cultivars ‘Wink’ and ‘Fujiminori’ were clustered together in all six pathways, suggesting that these two cultivars were very similar in terms of terpenoid synthesis and metabolism and anthocyanin biosynthesis."," Background 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) is a key enzyme in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, which regulates the metabolism of terpenoids in the cytoplasm and determines the type and content of downstream terpenoid metabolites. Results Results showed that grapevine HMGR family has three members, such as VvHMGR1, VvHMGR2, and VvHMGR3. The expression of VvHMGRs in 'Kyoho' has tissue specificity, for example, VvHMGR1 keeps a higher expression, VvHMGR2 is the lowest, and VvHMGR3 gradually decreases as the fruit development. VvHMGR3 is closely related to CsHMGR1 and GmHMGR9 and has collinearity with CsHMGR2 and GmHMGR4. By the prediction of interaction protein, it can interact with HMG-CoA synthase, MVA kinase, FPP/GGPP synthase, diphosphate mevalonate decarboxylase, and participates in the synthesis and metabolism of terpenoids. VvHMGR3 have similar trends in expression with some of the genes of carotenoid biosynthesis and MEP pathways. VvHMGR3 responds to various environmental and phytohormone stimuli, especially salt stress and ultraviolet (UV) treatment. The expression level of VvHMGRs is diverse in grapes of different colors and aroma. VvHMGRs are significantly higher in yellow varieties than that in red varieties, whereas rose-scented varieties showed significantly higher expression than that of strawberry aroma. The expression level is highest in yellow rose-scented varieties, and the lowest in red strawberry scent varieties, especially 'Summer Black' and 'Fujiminori'. Conclusion This study confirms the important role of VvHMGR3 in the process of grape fruit coloring and aroma formation, and provided a new idea to explain the loss of grape aroma and poor coloring during production. There may be an additive effect between color and aroma in the HMGR expression aspect."," 'Grape', 'Terpenoids', 'Color', 'Aroma', 'Hmgr' "," 'Fig.', 'expression', 'expression level', 'berry flesh', 'varieties', 'VvHMGRs', 'berry skin', 'berry', 'Yellow Italia’', 'Aroma' "," α-pinene, ‘Red, ’, ’, ’, ‘, ‘, ’, HMGR, HMGR, HMGR, XM_002283147, XM_002265602, Glycine, α, PtHMGR3, HMGR, Fig. S 1, VvHMGR1, VvHMGR2, VvHMGR3, motif16, UTRs, VvHMGR3, Eth, SA, Eth, SA were 12 , SA, VvHMGR3, alkaline, HMGR, S 4, VvHMGRs, VvHMGR2, VvHMGR3 had, VvHMGRs, Fig. S 4D, VvHMGRs, HMG-CoA synthase, FPP/GGPP synthase, HMGR, ‘, ‘Centennial, ‘Yellow, ’, ‘, ’, ‘Fujiminori’, ‘, ‘Yellow, ’, ‘Jingzaojing, ’, ‘Centennial, ‘Red, ’, VvZDS, VvCYP97A, VvDXR, VvNCED6, ‘, ‘Yellow, ’, ‘Yellow, ’, ‘, ’, ‘Fujiminori’ ",  ,  , 'lycopersicum.' ,NaN

The content of 3-hexen-1-ol, which belongs to aliphatic compound, differed in plants infested and non-infested, but did not differ in plants infested with non-viruliferous and viruliferous MEAM1/B and MED/Q ( Figure   2A). Among monoterpenes, β-myrcene, α-phellandrene, ρ-cymene and thujene differed in all five treatments ( Figure   2B). The ρ-cymene was reduced on viruliferous MED/Q -infested plants compared to control plants and plants infested with other whiteflies. Thujene was induced exclusively on plants infested with viruliferous MEAM1/B and MED/Q. The content of sesquiterpenes, such as β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, also differed in all five treatments ( Figure   2C). Neophytadiene was only detected on viruliferous MED/Q-damaged plants ( Figure   2D). Preference of  B. tabaci on Plants Previously Infested With Non-viruliferous or Viruliferous MEAM1/B and MED/Q The number of  B. tabaci was similar on plants that were previously infested with non-viruliferous MEAM1/B and on undamaged plants ( P = 0.404;  Figure   1A). Similarly, the number of  B. tabaci showed no difference on plants that were previously infested with viruliferous MEAM1/B and on undamaged plants ( P = 0.652;  Figure   1B). The number of non-viruliferous MEAM1/B and viruliferous MEAM1/B was significantly lower on non-viruliferous MED/Q -infested plants than on undamaged plants ( P = 0.006;  Figure   1C). However, the number of  B. tabaci was significantly higher on viruliferous MED/Q -damaged plants than on undamaged plants ( P < 0.001;  Figure   1D). Functionally Characterization of ρ-Cymene, Thujene and Neophytadiene Thujene attracted significantly more  B. tabaci in comparison to the control (purified air), while the number of non-viruliferous and viruliferous MEAM1/B and MED/Q showed no differences ( Figure   3A). Neophytadiene also attracted  B. tabaci, especially for MED/Q, regardless of the previous treatment ( Figure   3B). ρ-cymene, on the other hand, repelled  B. tabaci, especially for non-viruliferous MEAM1/B and non-viruliferous MED/Q ( Figure   3C). Compared to ρ-cymene, a mixture of thujene and ρ-cymene showed no effect on  B. tabaci ( Figure   4A).  B. tabaci, especially non-viruliferous and viruliferous MED/Q, showed a much higher preference to a mixture of ρ-cymene and neophytadiene than to ρ-cymene ( Figure   4B). Compared to a mixture of ρ-cymene and thujene, a blend of ρ-cymene, thujene and neophytadiene attracted more  B. tabaci, especially for MED/Q (either viruliferous or not) ( Figure   4C).","The sweet potato whitefly,  Bemisia tabaci , is one of the most invasive insect pests worldwide. The two most destructive whitefly cryptic species are MEAM1/B and MED/Q. Given that MED/Q has replaced MEAM1/B in China and the invasion of MED/Q has coincided with the outbreak of tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), we hypothesize that pre-infestation with viruliferous  B. tabaci  will affect the subsequent host preferences. To test this hypothesis, we (1) conducted bioassays to compare the host preference of viruliferous and non-viruliferous MEAM1/B and MED/Q, respectively, on plants pre-infested with viruliferous and non-viruliferous MEAM1/B and MED/Q; (2) profiled plant volatiles using GC-MS; and (3) functionally characterized chemical cues could potentially modulate  B. tabaci -TYLCV-tomato interactions, including ρ-cymene, thujene and neophytadiene, using a Y-tube olfactometer. As a result, plants pre-infested with MEAM1/B whiteflies carrying TYLCV or not, did not attract more or less B or Q whiteflies. Plants pre-infested with non-viruliferous MED/Q resisted MEAM1/B but did not affect MED/Q. However, plants pre-infested with viruliferous MED/Q attracted more whiteflies. Feeding of viruliferous MED/Q reduced the production of ρ-cymene, and induced thujene and neophytadiene. Functionally analyses of these plant volatiles show that ρ-cymene deters while neophytadiene recruits whiteflies. These combined results suggest that pre-infestation with viruliferous MED/Q promotes the subsequent whitefly infestation and induces plant volatile neophytadiene which recruits whiteflies."," 'Bemisia tabaci', 'Plant volatile', 'tomato yellow leaf curl virus', 'Ρ-cymene', 'Thujene', 'Neophytadiene' "," 'Figure', 'MED', 'viruliferous MED', 'Plant Volatiles', 'plants', 'Results Extraction', 'viruliferous', 'infested', 'plants infested', 'non-viruliferous MED' "," MEAM1/B, MED/Q (, MED/Q -infested plants, MEAM1/B, MED/Q., MED/Q, MEAM1/B, MEAM1/B, MEAM1/B, MEAM1/B, MED/Q -infested, MED/Q, Neophytadiene Thujene, MEAM1/B, MED/Q, MED/Q, MEAM1/B, MED/Q, MED/Q, MED/Q ",  ,  ,  ,NaN
16,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC8051600/eupmc_result.json,PMC8051600,"Results Whole‐genome duplication We further determined the age of WGD events in Myrtales plants according to their distributions of  Ks (Badouin  et al.,  2017; Vanneste  et al.,  2013). Synonymous substitutions are putatively evolutionarily neutral and accumulate changes at a constant rate, which can be used to infer the age of WGDs. We inferred an average  Ks/year rate of 1.14 × 10 −8 in Myrtales. Based on this, we inferred that the independent WGD events in Myrtaceae and Lythraceae occurred 50.1–61.2 million years ago (MYA) and 55.8–61.7 MYA with a confidence interval of 95%. Collectively, our results indicate that the WGD events in Myrtaceae and Lythraceae are family‐specific but occurred within similar timeframes. Distributions of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ( Ks) for paralogous genes of guava showed a peak at  Ks ≈ 1.3 (Figure  2b; Figure  S12), and similar peaks were identified in  L. scoparium and  E. grandis (Figure  2b; Figure  S12). In addition, collinearity patterns between  Vitis vinifera L. (common wine grape; Vitales, Vitaceae),  P. guajava, and  E. grandis (Figure  3) and synteny analyses among species of Myrtaceae (Figure  1; Figure  S13) indicated that Myrtaceae underwent a whole‐genome duplication (WGD) event after the well‐known paleo‐hexaploidization event, γ, in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all eudicots (Jiao  et al.,  2012; Myburg  et al.,  2014). Qin  et al. ( 2017) inferred that the MRCA of Myrtales underwent a WGD event after the γ event based on analysis of synteny patterns between  E. grandis and  P. granatum. However, the  Ks distributions for paralogous genes in our analyses revealed a little higher peak value in  P. granatum than species of Myrtaceae (Figure  2b; Figure  S12). Peak values of the  Ks distributions for orthologous genes between Myrtaceae and Lythraceae were a little larger than those within Myrtaceae (Figure  2b, c; Figure  S12). However, differences in the distribution of  Ks between Myrtaceae and Lythraceae, represented by  P. granatum, were too small to determine if they underwent a shared WGD event or independent ones. In order to precisely locate the phylogenetic position of WGDs in Myrtales, we conducted a Multi‐tAxon Paleopolyploidy Search (MAPS) analysis (Li  et al.,  2015) with seven species:  P. guajava,  L. scoparium,  E. grandis,  P. granatum of Myrtales and  Arabidopsis thaliana,  V. vinifera, and  Solanum lycopersicum of Brassicales, Vitales and Solanales, respectively. We recovered 8587 phylogenies of gene families with at least one gene copy from each taxon. Based on MAPS, we identified 7572 trees representing these gene families that included the MRCA of Myrtaceae, and among these, 60% showed a WGD for the MRCA of Myrtaceae (Figure  S14; Table  S15). In contrast, only 5.8% supported a gene duplication shared between Myrtaceae and  P. granatum (i.e. for Myrtales). (Figure  S14; Table  S15). These results support that WGD events in Myrtaceae occurred separately from those in Lythraceae, which is consistent with the finding of inferring putative ancient whole‐genome duplications in the 1000 Plants (Li and Barker,  2020; One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative,  2019). Gene family analysis We examined the evolutionary relationships among guava and ten other plant species with sequenced genomes using phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic analysis, based on alignments of 487 single‐copy genes, supported the placement of  P. guajava,  E. grandis, and  L. scoparium in Myrtaceae and  P. granatum in the Myrtales order (Figure  2a). Interestingly,  P. guajava and  L. scoparium comprised a monophyletic group, which is inconsistent with phylogenetic analyses reported by Biffin  et al. ( 2010) and Thornhill  et al. ( 2015). To improve phylogenetic resolution among species of Myrtaceae, we reconstructed species trees using protein and DNA sequences of 3454 single‐copy orthologs with  P. granatum as the outgroup. In these analyses, both the DNA and protein sequences yielded the topology of ( P. guajava,  L. scoparium,  E. grandis,  P. granatum) with high support (bootstrap values = 100%; Figure  S11). Compared with ten other genomes of angiosperms, we found a total of 4310 species‐specific single‐copy genes in guava (Tables  S10 and S11). We conducted an analysis of GO annotations for these genes and found they were enriched in GO terms including regulation of cell death, receptor regulator activity and chromatin (Table  S12). The shared gene families among guava and ten other angiosperm species are summarized in Table  S11. We found that guava shared more gene families with  L. scoparium and  E. grandis than with  Punica granatum (pomegranate; Myrtales, Lythraceae; Figure  S6). In total, we found that 22 gene families were expanded in guava, while 140 gene families experienced losses compared to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of guava and  L. scoparium (Figure  2a). Guava showed fewer gene family expansions and more gene family contractions than the other species in Myrtaceae (Figure  2a), and this is consistent with the smaller number of genes we detected in guava compared to the other myrtaceous species. The expanded gene families are enriched in biological processes, especially stimulus response and phosphorelay signal transduction and in several molecular functions, particularly ADP binding and ribosyltransferase activity (Figures  S7 and S8; Table  S13). Functional analysis of contracted gene families indicated enrichment of GO terms such as response to auxin and terpene synthase activity (Figures  S9 and S10; Table  S14), suggesting possible function losses in the xylem formation (Soler  et al.,  2015) and essential oil producing (Myburg  et al.,  2014) pathways. Repeat annotation and gene prediction We analysed repetitive sequences by combining  de novo prediction and a homology‐based search at both the DNA and protein levels, and found that repetitive sequences occupy 43.55% (193.2 Mb) of the genome of guava (Figure  1b; Table  S6). We performed an annotation pipeline combining  de novo, homolog‐based search and RNA‐Seq methods to predict gene models from the repeat‐masked guava genome sequence (Table  S5; Figure  S3). These analyses predicted a total of 25 601 protein‐coding genes, representing 23.56% of the genome assembly (Table  S7). This is a much smaller number of genes than in the sequenced genomes of the myrtaceous species,  L. scoparium and  E. grandis (Myburg  et al.,  2014; Thrimawithana  et al.,  2019). Among the 25 601 genes, 25 428 (99.3%) were functionally annotated (Table  S8). There were 25 498 genes (99.59%) present on chromosomally anchored contigs. In a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, 9724 (37.98%), 12 866 (50.26%) and 13 400 (52.3%) of annotated genes were assigned to the GO terms cellular component, molecular function and biological process, respectively (Figure  S4). In addition to the protein‐coding genes, we also identified 330 miRNA genes, 405 tRNA genes and 844 rRNA genes in the guava genome (Table  S9; Figure  S5a). We also detected a total of 22 334 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) across the whole genome (Figure  S5b). Positive selection in guava,  L. scoparium and  E. grandis In order to investigate the evolutionary footprint of natural selection on candidate genes associated with the ascorbic acid pathway and fruit softening, we conducted positive selection analyses for guava,  L. scoparium and  E. grandis using orthologs from  P. granatum as the outgroup. Among the 15 681 orthogroups, 3627 contained single‐copy orthologous genes. In guava, we identified 285 positively selected genes (PSGs) ( P < 0.01; Table  S22). A GO functional classification of significant PSGs in guava revealed several categories associated with proteolysis (Figures  S20 and S21). Among the 285 genes, we found two (Pgu12819 and Pgu22300) encoding  AMY and two genes involved in starch biosynthesis (Pgu05347 and Pgu03782). Furthermore, three of these positively selected genes (Pgu03782, Pgu12819 and Pgu22300) were expressed increasingly during fruit ripening (Figures  S16b and S18). There were 859 and 313 genes possibly under positive selection in  L. scoparium and  E. grandis ( P < 0.01), respectively. We found that four and three genes, which were involved in lignin biosynthesis pathways, were PSGs of  L. scoparium and  E. grandis, respectively (Table  S23). These results are consistent with the hypotheses that woody‐fruit formation occurs via secondary cell wall synthesis and lignification (Dardick and Callahan,  2014). Together with the analyses of gene expression during fruit softening, these results support that fleshy‐fruited species in Myrtaceae underwent positive selection on starch metabolic genes, and the starch degradation may be the main contributor to fruit softening. Ascorbic acid metabolism We measured ascorbic acid content in three different fruit developmental stages (young, expanding and mature). We found that ascorbic acid content increased along with fruit development (Figure  4a; Table  S16). We investigated genes encoding key enzymes involved in all four known ascorbic acid biosynthesis pathways and the regeneration pathway (Figure  S15) during guava fruit development. All genes associated with the L‐galactose pathway were found in guava genome, but Alase (aldonolactonase), which produces precursors of ascorbic acid in the galacturonate pathway, GlcUR (D‐galacturonate reductase) in the  myo‐Inositol pathway, and a series of genes in the L‐gulose pathway were absent (Figure  S15; Table  S17). Comparisons with two other sequenced species of Myrtales,  E. grandis and  P. granatum, and with  A. thaliana revealed no expansion of genes in the ascorbic acid biosynthesis pathways, but gene families responsible for regenerating ascorbic acid  AO (L‐ascorbate oxidase) and MDHAR (monodehydroascorbate reductase)  expanded in guava (Table  S17). Expression profiling analysis revealed that most genes involved in L‐galactose and recycling pathways were more highly expressed in fruits compared to other tissues, except one and two members of the MDHAR and AO families, respectively (Figure  5; Table  S18). Genes encoding downstream biosynthesis enzymes exhibited a positive correlation between expression level and ascorbic acid content in fruits (Figure  5). This result is similar to a previous report in a closely related species,  Myrciaria dubia (Myrtaceae) (Castro  et al.,  2015a). In other pathways, however, only one member of GalUR (D‐galacturonate reductase) and two of MIOX (myo‐inositol oxygenase) had detectable expression (Figure  S16a). Taken together, these results indicate that the L‐galactose pathway is the major route for ascorbic acid biosynthesis in guava. In particular, MDHAR, rather than DHAR (dehydroascorbate reductase), contributes to ascorbic acid regeneration in guava. In a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), we found that three of the 20 coexpression modules (Figure  4b) were positively correlated with ascorbic acid content (Figure  4c: tan, 0.91; yellow, 0.81; and light yellow, 0.74). Within these modules, we found six genes involved in ascorbic acid biosynthesis and regeneration pathways (Figure  S17a, b, c; Table  S19), indicating that these genes play key roles in ascorbic acid accumulation. Expression of these genes showed positive correlation with the stages of fruit development. Five of the six key genes (except the one in the regeneration pathway) also showed high expression levels in the stem which, therefore, may also have the capacity for ascorbic acid biosynthesis (De Tullio and Arrigoni,  2003). Genome sequencing and assembly We sequenced the genome of the guava cultivar, ‘New Age’ (2 n = 2 x = 22) (Figure  1a), which is commonly grown in Guangdong Province, China. We sequenced it using a combination of short‐read sequencing from Illumina NovaSeq with the PE 150 bp protocol and SMRT from PacBio Sequel platform. The sequencing generated ~53.2 Gb of high‐quality short‐read sequences and ~53.6 Gb of PacBio sequences, both representing over 115× coverage for the genome, which has an estimated size of 463.8 Mb based on the 17‐mer depth distribution analysis of the sequenced reads (Figure  S1) and previous flow cytometry analysis by Coser  et al. ( 2012). The final assembled sequence was 443.8 Mb, representing 95.7% of the guava genome. The assembly consisted of 44 scaffolds with an N50 of 40.4 Mb and 73 contigs with an N50 of 15.8 Mb (Table  1; Table  S1). We used the Hi‐C technology to reorder and anchor the total 99.44 % (441.27 Mb) of the genome onto 11 pseudochromosomes (Figure  S2). The GC content of the assembled guava genome was 39.5%, which is similar to those of  E. grandis (Myburg  et al.,  2014) and  L. scoparium (Thrimawithana  et al.,  2019), the two most closely related species to guava with sequenced genomes. We used BWA v0.7.17 (Li,  2014) to align Illumina short reads to the assembly, and obtained the mapping rate of 96.75%. We then assessed the quality of the guava genome assembly through the Conserved Core Eukaryotic Gene Mapping Approach (CEGMA) (Parra  et al.,  2007). The analysis revealed that 94.4% of the core protein‐coding genes were recovered in our assembled genome (Table  S2). In addition, we found 1352 (93.9%) complete gene models and 28 (1.9%) fragmented gene models out of 1440 Benchmarking Universal Single‐Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) genes (Simão  et al.,  2015; Table  S3). Furthermore, 97.7% of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were covered by the assembly, with >50% sequence identity (Table  S4). Moreover, we successfully mapped 91.6%–94.1% of RNA‐Seq datasets generated from different tissues and developmental stages to the assembled genome of guava (Table  S5). Taken together, these results suggest a high‐quality genome assembly of guava. Fruit softening related metabolism We evaluated starch content in fruits at different developmental stages (Figure  4a; Table  S16). Gene expression in 21 samples of  P. guajava was clustered into 20 coexpression modules (Figure  4b), of which, two were significantly negatively correlated with starch content (Figure  4c: tan, −0.92; light yellow, −0.70). Within these two, we found four and one starch degradation genes, respectively (Figure  S17a, b; Table  S19). Most genes involved in starch degradation showed increased expression with fruit development in guava (Figure  6; Figure  S18), indicating that starch degradation plays an important role in fruit softening during the ripening process. Guava fruit loses its firmness during ripening (Ali  et al.,  2004). In comparison with woody‐fruited species (e.g.  L. scoparium and  E. grandis), ripening of fleshy fruits is often associated with starch degradation or cell wall metabolism (Cordenunsi‐Lysenko  et al.,  2019; Wang  et al.,  2018). Here, we investigated genes involved in these two pathways. In the genome sequences of guava, we found that 44 members of seven gene families involved in the starch degradation pathway (Figure  6; Table  S20). Compared with  E. grandis,  P. granatum and  A. thaliana (Table  S20), guava has the greatest number of genes in gene families related to starch degradation. The main degradation genes in guava are  AMY (α‐amylase) and  BAM (β‐amylase) genes, which account for 61.4% of these starch degradation genes in guava. We detected more members of  AMY and  BAM in guava than in any other plant that we surveyed. Within guava, we also detected α‐glucosidase (AGL), 4‐α‐glucanotransferase (DPE) and isoamylase (ISA), which are additional key enzymes in the starch degradation pathway, and these were not present in  E. grandis or  P. granatum. We also identified a total of 192 genes encoding five key enzymes related to cell wall degradation (Table  S21). Guava possesses more gene members of  β‐galactosidase than other plants. We found many genes related to cell wall degradation with high expression levels in fruits, even though they did not show consistent trends during ripening (Figure  S19). Some genes encoding β‐galactosidase, polygalacturonase and pectate lyase had increasingly higher expression during fruit ripening (Figure  S19). This is in accord with prior work showing that the content of soluble pectin (i.e. galacturonic acid) increased with a reduction of guava fruits firmness (Braga  et al.,  2017). Together, these results indicate that cell wall degradation may also contribute to fruit softening in guava.","Guava (Psidium guajava) is an important fleshy-fruited tree of the Myrtaceae family that is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas of the world and has attracted considerable attention for the richness of ascorbic acid in its fruits. However, studies on the evolution and genetic breeding potential of guava are hindered by the lack of a reference genome. Here, we present a chromosome-level genomic assembly of guava using PacBio sequencing and Hi-C technology. We found that the genome assembly size was 443.8 Mb with a contig N50 of ~15.8 Mb. We annotated a total of 25 601 genes and 193.2 Mb of repetitive sequences for this genome. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that guava has undergone a recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) event shared by all species in Myrtaceae. In addition, through metabolic analysis, we determined that the L-galactose pathway plays a major role in ascorbic acid biosynthesis in guava fruits. Moreover, the softening of fruits of guava may result from both starch and cell wall degradation according to analyses of gene expression profiles and positively selected genes. Our data provide a foundational resource to support molecular breeding of guava and represent new insights into the evolution of soft, fleshy fruits in Myrtaceae."," 'Myrtaceae', 'Ascorbic acid', 'Starch degradation', 'Hi-c', 'Pacbio Sequencing', 'Fleshy Fruit' "," 'Figure', 'Table', 'genes', 'guava', 'Myrtaceae', 'gene', 'gene families', 'ascorbic acid', 'Figures', 'genome' "," Whole‐genome, WGD, Badouin  , WGDs, WGD, 50.1–61.2, 55.8–61.7, WGD, family‐specific, whole‐genome, WGD, γ, WGD, γ, c, WGD, WGDs, WGD, WGD, whole‐genome, single‐copy, auxin, S10, homology‐based, RNA‐Seq, Thrimawithana  , 12 , SSRs, S21, Pgu12819, Pgu22300, Pgu05347, Pgu03782, Pgu03782, Pgu12819, Pgu22300, S18, woody‐fruit, L‐galactose, Alase (aldonolactonase, galacturonate, GlcUR (D‐galacturonate reductase, L‐gulose, Myrtales, L‐ascorbate oxidase, MDHAR (, monodehydroascorbate reductase, L‐galactose, MDHAR, AO, GalUR (D‐galacturonate reductase, MIOX (, myo‐inositol oxygenase, L‐galactose, MDHAR, DHAR, b, c, ‘New, short‐read, NovaSeq, PE 150 , SMRT, ~53.2 , ~53.6 , 17‐mer, Hi‐C, 441.27 Mb, Thrimawithana  , v0.7.17, Single‐Copy, BUSCO, Simão  , 91.6%–94.1, RNA‐Seq, −0.92, −0.70, woody‐fruited species, Cordenunsi‐Lysenko  , α‐amylase, β‐amylase, 4‐α‐glucanotransferase (DPE, isoamylase (ISA), β‐galactosidase, polygalacturonase, pectate lyase, pectin ",  ,  , 'lycopersicum' ,terpene synthase

However, whether WRKY33 can mediate plant innate immunity against whitefly is still unclear. To test the regulation of WRKY33 in response to whitefly, we performed a whitefly two-choice preference assay. Electronic supplementary material, figure S5 a shows that more whiteflies were attracted to  wrky33 plants compared with Col-0 plants. Our previous work has indicated that suppression of JA-regulated repellent terpene biosynthesis in  Arabidopsis makes the host more attractive to the whitefly vector   9 , and thus we examined the expressions of  ArabidopsisTerpene Synthase ( TPS) genes such as  TPS10,  TPS14,  TPS18 and  TPS20. As expected, the expression levels of  TPS10,  TPS18 and  TPS20 in the  wrky33 mutant were greatly reduced compared with those of Col-0 plants (electronic supplementary material, figure  S5 b). In addition to the increased whitefly attraction, more eggs were laid by whiteflies on  wrky33 mutants than on Col-0 plants ( figure 4c). Furthermore, late fourth whitefly nymphs were much more prevalent on  wrky33 than on Col-0 plants ( figure 4d). That whiteflies preferred and performed better on  wrky33 plants indicates that WRKY33 is essential for plant resistance against whitefly. Taken together, our results imply that Bsp9 inhibits WRKY33-mediated anti-whitefly resistance. (f) Bsp9 may disrupt the interaction between MPK6 and WRKY33 WRKY33 is an essential transcription factor in response to the attack of pathogens, but how it regulates immunity against whitefly and begomovirus is unknown. Bsp9 interacts with WRKY33 in the cytoplasmic bodies, raising a possibility that Bsp9 competes with MPK3 or MPK6 for the interaction with WRKY33. A modified BiFC competitive protein-binding assay was used to test this hypothesis.  Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains containing expression vectors for fusion proteins of MPK6 and WRKY33, together with  35S:Bsp9, were co-injected into  N. benthamiana leaf cells. Yellow fluorescence was observed owing to the interaction between cEYFP-MPK6 and nEYFP-WRKY33. Co-expression with a  35S:β-glucuronidase ( 35S:GUS) was used as a negative control. The interaction strength of MPK6-WRKY33 as indicated by EYFP fluorescence intensity was significantly decreased after the addition of Bsp9 protein ( figure 4a, b). A negative control of GUS co-expression did not affect the interaction between MPK6 and WRKY33. These results demonstrate that Bsp9 interferes with the interaction between MPK6 and WRKY33, and, therefore, might disrupt a signal transduction event.  (e) Whitefly salivary protein Bsp9 interacts with  Arabidopsis transcription factor WRKY33 To investigate the molecular mechanism of how whitefly salivary protein Bsp9 promotes TYLCV accumulation in plants, we sought to identify Bsp9-targeted host factor(s). Therefore, a yeast two-hybrid experiment was conducted to screen an  Arabidopsis cDNA library by using Bsp9 as the bait, and an immunity-related transcription factor AtWRKY33 was found as a putative positive interactor. Yeast transformants carrying AD-WRKY33 and BD-Bsp9 were able to grow on SD-Leu-Trp-His selection plates with 2 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, whereas yeast transformants carrying AD and BD-Bsp9 constructs were unable to do so ( figure 3a). To confirm the interaction between WRKY33 and Bsp9 proteins  in vivo, we performed a BiFC assay in  N. benthamiana. The N-terminus of the yellow fluorescent protein was fused in-frame to WRKY33 (nEYFP-WRKY33) and C-terminus YFP was fused to Bsp9 (cEYFP-Bsp9). The constructs were transiently expressed in  N. benthamiana leaf cells by  Agrobacterium co-infiltration. A direct interaction between WRKY33 and Bsp9 was observed in the form of cytoplasmic speckles, which altered the nucleus localization of WRKY33 as a functional transcription factor to regulate downstream defensive gene expression ( figure 3b). No fluorescence was detected when cEYFP-Bsp9 or nEYFP-WRKY33 was co-expressed with nEYFP or cEYFP as a negative control. A split-luciferase complementation assay was further performed to confirm the interaction  in vivo.  Agrobacterium carrying the constructs of nLUC-Bsp9 and cLUC-WRKY33 were infiltrated into  N. benthamiana leaves, and the intensity of luminescence was increased only by the combination of nLUC-Bsp9 and cLUC-WRKY33 compared with the vector control ( figure 3c). Taken together, these results consistently prove that Bsp9 interacts with WRKY33.  (c) Whitefly salivary protein Bsp9 suppresses plant immune response As a functional analysis platform for whitefly salivary proteins has rarely been reported, we sought to establish a suitable screening and reporter system to identify whitefly effectors. We observed that the expression of a PTI membrane receptor  PEPR1 was rapidly induced upon whitefly infestation in  Arabidopsis ( figure 2a). Furthermore, another downstream defensive marker gene  ArabidopsisPDF1.2 was also highly induced upon whitefly infestation or the treatment with Pep1 polypeptide, a ligand for PEPR1/2 receptors ( figure 2b; electronic supplementary material, figure S3). These results indicated that Pep1 treatment can mimic the stimulation of whitefly infestation on plants and the expression level of  PDF1.2 may represent the level of plant immune response to whitefly. Accordingly, we developed a novel system consisting of an effector and a reporter system together to functionally identify a whitefly salivary immunity regulator (as shown in  figure 2c). Each of these two plasmids was transformed into  A. tumefaciens and co-inoculated leaves of  N. benthamiana by agroinfiltration. By measuring the activity of the  PDF1.2 promoter upon co-expression of tested protein, it is convenient for high-throughput screening of whitefly salivary effectors which can repress plant immune response induced by Pep1. As expected, we found that Pep1 treatment stimulates activity of the  PDF1.2 promoter ( figure 2d). Interestingly, four salivary effectors repressed the Pep1-triggered activation of  PDF1.2 promoter. By contrast, two salivary effectors improved this activity. The preliminary functions of all tested salivary proteins are listed in electronic supplementary material, table S2. Among those, the degree of immune repression by Bsp9 was the highest ( figure 2d). Thus, we chose Bsp9 for a detailed downstream analysis on the mechanism of its suppression of PTI.  (d) Bsp9 secretes from whitefly into plant cells Bsp9 encodes a small protein with 112 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 12.4 kDa (electronic supplementary material, table S3). The N-terminal of Bsp9 protein contains a 25 amino acid residue signal peptide with a transmembrane domain (electronic supplementary material, figure S4 a, b). The secondary structure of Bsp9 mature protein is rich in α-helix. To confirm whether Bsp9 protein can be secreted from whitefly into plant cells, we detected Bsp9 protein in whitefly-infested tomato by immunoblot using anti-Bsp9 polyclonal antibody. The Bsp9 protein was indeed detected in tomato leaves infested by whitefly, as well as protein extracted from adult whitefly ( figure 2e). As expected, there is no detectable signal in tomato leaves without whitefly feeding. To further check the subcellular localization of Bsp9 in plants, Bsp9-YFP fusion protein was expressed and highly accumulated in the cytoplasm of  N. benthamiana leaf cells (electronic supplementary material, figure S4 c). (h) Bsp9 increases whitefly performance and transmission of TYLCV Previous studies demonstrated that plants pre-infested with TYLCV-viruliferous whitefly could attract more vector insects   32 . Transient expression of Bsp9 inhibits WRKY33-mediated resistance, but whether the suppression of Bsp9 affects whitefly preference for better virus transmission is unknown. Thus, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing  Bsp9. Intriguingly, we found that  35S:Bsp9-HA stable transgenic lines were more attractive to whiteflies compared with  35S:HA vector control plants (electronic supplementary material, figure S5 c). Besides increased whitefly attraction, daily number of eggs laid per female whitefly on  35S:Bsp9-HA plants showed a significant increase compared with that of vector control plants, indicating that Bsp9 suppresses plant resistance against whitefly ( figure 4e). The promoted whitefly preference and performance raised the conjecture of whether the manipulation of whitefly behaviours by Bsp9 can eventually affect the viral transmission efficiency from whitefly to plants. To test this, we detected the amount of whitefly virus transmission into  Arabidopsis plants which were fed on by TYLCV-viruliferous whiteflies for 72 h, at which time point no viral transcription could be detected in plants (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). Results showed that TYLCV titre in  35S:Bsp9- HA plants was threefold higher than that in vector control plants ( figure 4f). Consistent with the promoted whitefly performance on the  wrky33 mutant, the amount of virus transmission to  wrky33 plants increased fourfold compared to that of vector control plants. Based on the above results, we conclude that the whitefly salivary protein Bsp9 suppresses WRKY33-mediated immunity to increase whitefly preference, performance and, in turn, eventually increases virus transmission. (b) Comparative transcriptomic screening of whitefly salivary effectors One hypothesis for the enhancement of TYLCV pathogenesis by the infestation of whitefly is that TYLCV could induce accumulation of whitefly salivary effectors and, in turn, inhibit host defence against virus. To identify candidate whitefly salivary effectors induced by TYLCV, we firstly undertook a comparative transcriptomic analysis of viruliferous whitefly versus virus-free whitefly (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). High-quality total RNA samples of viruliferous whitefly and virus-free MEAM1 whitefly were extracted, and de novo sequencing was conducted with the Illumina sequencing platform. Through filtering the adaptors and low-quality sequences, assembling by Trinity and mapping by Bowtie2, we finally got 86 428 unigenes based on the raw data of scaffolds. Among them, expression levels of 53 353 unigenes were induced by TYLCV at least twofold. Comparing with the whitefly salivary gland dataset, only 1.4% of TYLCV-induced unigenes (778/53 353) were found in salivary glands   31 . Taking into consideration that most effectors are putative secreted proteins which possess a suitable opening reading frame size, an N-terminal signal peptide and have no transmembrane regions, finally, we cloned 10 full-length cDNA of TYLCV-induced candidate salivary effector proteins for further functional characterizations (electronic supplementary material, table S2). (a) Whitefly infestation increases the accumulation of tomato yellow leaf curl virus We inoculated tomato with TYLCV, a begomovirus transmitted by an invasive MEAM1 whitefly, and examined the symptoms of infected plants. TYLCV-infected tomatoes showed mild yellowish symptoms at 14 days after inoculation while using the agroinfiltration method alone. Interestingly, TYLCV-infected tomato plants, followed by infestation of MEMA1 whiteflies for 3 days, exhibited more obvious yellowish and upward curling leaf symptoms at 7 days after infestation of whitefly compared with mock control ( figure 1a). To see whether accumulation levels of TYLCV in virus-infected plants are increased due to whitefly infestation, we further performed quantitative PCR analysis for TYLCV titre. The relative level of TYLCV was obviously 10-fold higher in whitefly-infested plants ( figure 1b). Therefore, the infestation of whitefly enhances the pathogenesis of its transmitted begomovirus on tomato. ","Whiteflies, Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera), are pests causing economic damage to many crops, capable of transmitting hundreds of plant vector-borne viruses. They are believed to secrete salivary protein effectors that can improve vector colonization and reproductive fitness in host plants. However, little is known about effector biology and the precise mechanism of action of whitefly effectors. Here, we report a functional screening of B. tabaci salivary effector proteins (Bsp) capable of modulating plant innate immunity triggered by plant endogenous pattern peptide Pep1. Four immunity suppressors and two elicitors were identified. Bsp9, the most effective immunity suppressor, was further identified to directly interact with an immunity regulator WRKY33. We provide evidence that Bsp9 may suppress plant immune signalling by interfering with the interaction between WRKY33 and a central regulator in the MAPK cascade. The interference by Bsp9 therefore reduces plant resistance to whitefly by inhibiting activation of WRKY33-regulated immunity-related genes. Further detailed analysis based on transgenic plants found that whitefly effector Bsp9 could promote whitefly preference and performance, increasing virus transmission. This study enriches our knowledge on insect effector biology.

RT-qPCR-Based Transcriptional Profile of MVK and DXR Genes in C. arabica Levels of  CaMVK and  CaDXR gene expression in flowers, endosperm and the perisperm of fruits 120 days after flowering (DAF) were evaluated using RT-qPCR. Both genes were more active in flowers, followed by perisperm and endosperm ( Figure 8A,B). We also verified that exogenous application of hexanoic acid, a well-known natural priming substance, was capable of modulating  CaMVK and  CaDXR transcriptional profiles in leaves and roots.  CaMVK was upregulated in the roots of Obatã cultivar ( Figure 8D) post-Hx treatment.  CaDXR was downregulated in leaves of Catuaí Vermelho ( Figure 8E) treated with Hx. 2.7. RNA-seq-Based Expression Profiles In order to provide an overall picture of transcriptional responses of MVA and MEP pathways in coffee, we provide DGE analysis of 23 genes of these pathways after MJ application ( Figure S2) and in several organs ( Figure S3), including  CaMVK and  CaDXR. Eleven genes (52.3%) were upregulated similarly to  CaMVK and  CaDXR ( CaDXS2,  CaDXS4,  CaMCT,  CaCMK,  CaHDS1,  CaHDS2,  CaIDI,  CaGGPPS1,  CaGGPPS2,  CaAACT2,  CaHMGS,  CaMPDC and  CaIDI), while six were downregulated ( CaDXS1,  CaDXS3,  CaMECPS,  CaGGPPS3,  CaAACT1,  CaPMK) and two genes ( CaIDS and  CaHMGR) did not show significant differences under MJ application ( Figure S2). We observed in the fruit development DGE analysis ( Figure S3) that 18 genes showed similar expression pattern with  CaMVK and  CaDXR—high transcript levels in flowers and low in leaves ( CaDXS2, C aDXS4,  CaCMK,  CaMECPS,  CaHDS1,  CaHDS2,  CaIDI,  CaIDS,  CaGGPPS1,  CaAACCT1,  CaAACCT2,  CaHMGS,  CaHMGR,  CaPMK,  CaMPDC and  CaIDI). To determine the  MVK and  DXR gene expression profiles among angiosperms, we used public RNA-seq data from seven plant species ( A. thaliana, C. canephora, P. trichocarpa, O. sativa, S. bicolor, B. distachyon and S. italica) and four tissues (leaves, roots, flowers and fruits) ( Figure 6).  MVK transcripts were expressed most highly in  A. thaliana roots with 56 RPKM ( At5g27450),  P. trichocarpa roots with 60 RPKM ( Potri.013g024000),  C. canephora flowers ( Cc00_g15600) with 70 RPKM and  S. bicolor flowers with 42 RPKM ( Sobic.004g012400) ( Figure 6).  DXR, on the other hand, was most highly expressed in  A. thaliana leaves ( At5g62790) with 181 RPKM  C. canephora roots with 88 RPKM ( Cc04_g14010),  O. sativa leaves with 308 RPKM ( Os01g01710),  S. bicolor leaves with 215 RPKM ( Sobic.003g103300) and  S. lycopersicum flowers with 608 RPKM ( Solyc03g114340.2). For both genes, the lowest levels of expression were observed in  P. trichocarpa in most organs analyzed ( Figure 6). Our results indicated that  MVK is mostly expressed in roots and flowers, and  DXR in leaves. Digital gene expression (DGE) profile analysis of  CaMVK ( Figure 7A,B) and  CaDXR ( Figure 7C,D) from several organs of  C. arabica was also analyzed. The  CaDXR ( Figure 7C) gene had higher transcript levels than  CaMVK ( Figure 7A) in leaves, flowers and fruits (30 to 150 DAF). However, while  CaMVK steadily decreases its expression along fruit development,  CaDXS is decreased only in the late stages of fruit development. In addition, we observed that application of methyl jasmonate upregulated the expression of  CaMVK and  CaDXR in fruits ( Figure 7B,D). 2.1. Copy Number of MVK and DXR Genes in Plants We used a diverse array of angiosperm species to perform genome-wide analysis of  MVK and  DXR genes and three species as outgroups: one basal angiosperm, one basal Viridiplantae and one Chlorophyta ( Figure 1). Thirty-one  MVK and 31  DXR sequences were identified in 24 species. We identified 22  MVK and 21  DXR genes in 16 eudicotyledonous species, while in monocotyledons we identified 7  MVK and 6  DXR sequences in five species. In the three outgroup species assessed, we identified 2  MVK and 4  DXR genes, except in the unicellular green algae,  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which does not have a gene encoding  MVK ( Table 1).  Chenopodium quinoa,  Glycine max,  Gossypium raimondii,  Marchantia polymorpha,  Populus trichocarpa,  Ricinus communis,  Musa acuminata and  Setaria italica had between two and three genes encoding  MVK and  DXR ( Table 1). As expected, predictions of the subcellular localization of MVK and DXR proteins for all 24 species revealed that MVK is likely located in the cytosol and DXR is likely located in chloroplasts. 2.6. Recombination Events of MVK and DXR Genes We identified intragenic recombination events in  MVK and  DXR using Geneconv, RDP and MaxChi methods. Five  MVK genes—in two eudicot species, two monocot species and one outgroup—experienced recombination events ( Table 6). A total of eight  DXR genes—in five eudicot species, two monocots and one outgroup—also had recombination events ( Table 7). In the analysis of the  MVK genes, Seita.3G273700 from  S. italica had the highest number of recombinations (5). The lowest number (1) was observed in  M. acuminta, in the gene MAC04G2409 ( Table 7). For  DXR, the highest number of recombinations (6) was observed in  M. polymorpha, in the Mapoly0064s0074 gene, and the lowest number of recombination events (1) in  T. cacao, in the TCA.TCM_01200 gene ( Table 7). 2.3. Exon–Intron Structure of MVK and DXR Genes Exon–intron structures were analyzed to enhance our understanding of the structural diversity of the  MVK and  DXR genes of angiosperm species. To perform the analyses, publicly available genomic sequences from the PLAZA database ( Figure 5A,B) were used. According to these analyses, the  MVK gene from all species have five exons, except the  LOC_Os10g18220 gene from  O. sativa, which has four ( Figure 5A). Further, most  DXR genes have between 11 and 13 exons, but for the  CAN.G1077.21 gene of  C. annuum we observed only four exons ( Figure 5B). The shortest  MVK and  DXR full length gene occur in  U. gibba (≅ 2Kb), while the longest ~12 kb  MVK full length gene is from  S. italica ( Seita.3G273700) and the longest  DXR full length gene ( ~10 kb) is in  C. quinoa (A UR62008212) ( Figure 5A,B). 2.2. Phylogenetic Analyses We focused our phylogenetic analysis on plant species whose complete genomes were available within the PLAZA 4.0 database ( Figure 2 and  Figure 3). The  MVK gene family was divided into three groups ( Figure 2). The first group was composed of outgroup species (red). The second group (blue) contained monocotyledon species and the last group (black) contained eudicotyledon species ( Figure 2). The phylogenetic tree of  DXR revealed a more complex division than  MVK ( Figure 3). We observed one group containing the outgroup species  C. reinhardtii and  M. polymorpha (red), while the monocotyledon genes were grouped into one major group (blue) and dicotyledons were divided into two groups (black), one of which was near the outgroup species  A. trichopoda. In  C. arabica,  MVK (comp31934) and  DXR (comp33448) sequences were retrieved from a transcriptome set previously developed by our group   28 . In this case, we demonstrate that these sequences are closely related to  C. canephora genes ( Figure 4). 2.5. Estimated Time of Duplication of MVK and DXR Genes All species with duplicated  MVK genes also have duplicated  DXR, except for  S. italica and  R. comunnis. Thus,  DXR duplication appears to be more genome duplication-dependent than  MVK duplication.  P. trichocarpha and  G. max have an unusual profile of the genes in which each have three  DXR genes and three  MVK genes, respectively ( Table 5). The duplication rates of the  MVK and  DXR genes were estimated for species with more than one gene copy ( M. polymorpha, G. raimondii, P. trichocarpa, R. communis, M. acuminata, S. italica, C. quinoa and  G. max). We used substitution data and inferred nucleotide substitution rates ( Table 4 and  Table 5). In order to clarify cases of tandem duplication, segmental duplication and whole-genome duplication, we also retrieved a synteny analysis from Plaza database 4.0 ( Figure S1). The  MVK gene has been duplicated in seven angiosperm species ( Table 4). Five species are eudicotyledons ( C. quinoa,  G. max, G. raimondii, P. trichocarpa and  R. communis) and two species are monocotyledons ( M. acuminata and  S. italica). In  MVK, the lowest dN/dS ratio and the most recent duplication event was identified in  P. trichocarpa ( Table 4), which corresponds to a tandem duplication ( Figure S1) between two copies of  MVK—Potri.005G034600 and  Potri.005G035300—which occurred less than 1 million years ago ( Figure S1 and  Table 5). The oldest event was determined to occur in  M. acuminata ( Table 4). Among the species considered, only  R. communis and  S. italica had more than one copy of  MVK and no recent genomic duplication events were identified   14 , suggesting that a species-specific event generated these gene duplications. We identified that  G. raimondii and  P. trichocarpa that had undergone a recent whole-genome duplication also have duplicated  MVK coding genes ( Figure S1 and  Table 4). The synteny analysis ( Figure S1) corroborate that most observed duplications correspond to WGD with two cases of local gene duplication. It was not possible to calculate distance for  DXR in  M. polymorpha ( Table 5). 2.4. Nucleotide Substitution and Selection in MVK and DXR Genes To verify the possibility of distinct evolutionary pressures, we analyzed the individual selection profile of each amino acid, as well as the non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions in eudicotyledonous and monocotyledonous  MVK and  DXR genes. Our results showed that the dN/dS ratios of sequences among the  MVK and  DXR genes were distinct ( Table 2). In addition, all estimated dN/dS values were substantially less than 1, suggesting that all  MVK and  DXR sequences within each group assessed are under strong purifying selection pressure. We observed lower dN/dS ratios in  DXR than  MVK ( Table 2). Both genes had lower dN/dS ratios in eudicotyledons than in monocotyledons, except for  DXR in model M5 ( Table 2). We found three positively selected sites in eudicots within the  MVK gene using a Bayesian inference approach to calculate site-specific positive and purifying selection. We also evaluated the identification of sites of positive selection using three methods: SLAC (single likelihood ancestor counting), FEL (fixed-effects likelihood) and MEME (Mixed Effects Model of Evolution). FEL and SLAC software did not detect any positively selected codon sites. MEME analyses, however, did positively identify the selected sites ( Table 3). In  MVK, the MEME model detected three positively selected sites in eudicotyledons and four sites in monocotyledons. Site 42 was identified as a positively selected site in both angiosperm groups. With regard to the analysis of  DXR using MEME, five positively selected sites in eudicotyledons and two in monocotyledons were identified.","Terpenoids are a diverse class of metabolites that impact plant metabolism in response to environmental cues. They are synthesized either via a predominantly cytosolic (MVA) pathway or a plastidic pathway (MEP). In  Arabidopsis , several enzymes from the MVA and MEP pathways are encoded by gene families, excluding  MVK  and  DXR , which are single-copy genes. In this study, we assess the diversity, evolution and expression of  DXR  and  MVK  genes in selected angiosperms and  Coffea arabica  in particular. Evolutionary analysis revealed that  DXR  and  MVK  underwent purifying selection, but the selection effect for  DXR  was stronger than it was fo r MVK . Digital gene expression (DGE) profile analysis of six species revealed that expression levels of  MVK  in flowers and roots were high, whereas for  DXR  peak values were observed in leaves. In  C. arabica , both genes were highly expressed in flowers, and  CaDXR  was upregulated in response to methyl jasmonate.  C. arabica  DGE data were validated by assessing gene expression in selected organs, and by plants treated with hexanoic acid (Hx) using RT-qPCR.  MVK  expression was upregulated in roots treated with Hx.  CaDXR  was downregulated in leaves by Hx treatment in a genotype-specific manner, indicating a differential response to priming."," 'Coffea', 'Purifying Selection', 'Rt-qpcr', 'Mva And Mep Pathways' "," 'DXR Genes', 'MVK', 'DXR', 'Figure', 'MVK genes', 'MVK gene', 'Genes', 'Table', 'gene', 'species' "," Obatã, MJ, CaDXS2, CaDXS1, MJ, C aDXS4, Potri.013g024000, Cc00_g15600, Sobic.004g012400, At5g62790, Os01g01710, Sobic.003g103300, Solyc03g114340.2, D, Seita.3G273700, MAC04G2409, Mapoly0064s0074, TCA.TCM_01200, PLAZA, Seita.3G273700, PLAZA 4.0, comp31934, comp33448, comunnis, —Potri.005G034600, WGD, SLAC ",  ," 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.'

19,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7608815/eupmc_result.json,PMC7608815,"RESULTS Reconstitution of a putative five-gene tomato cluster in yeast leads to synthesis of an HCAA compound We observed two differential peaks representing compounds only produced in the strain harboring the reconstructed tomato cluster, one at mass/charge ratio ( m/z) 168.0655 ( M + H  +) ( 1) and the other at 316.1179 ( M + H  +) ( 2) (fig. S1, A and B). To validate production of the two compounds in yeast, we analyzed the yeast culture media for production of ( 1) and ( 2) on liquid chromatography–tandem MS (LC-MS/MS). A product ion scan with a precursor ion set at 168.0  m/z showed two peaks at retention times of 4.291 and 5.872 min, respectively, and a product ion scan with a precursor ion set at 316.1  m/z showed a single peak at 5.872 min ( Fig. 1B). On the basis of retention times and fragmentation patterns of ( 1) and ( 2) from qToF-MS analysis (fig. S1, A and B), we hypothesized that the peak at 4.291 min corresponds to ( 1) and that the peak at 5.872 min (for both precursor ion settings) corresponds to ( 2). Our study investigated the biosynthetic potential of a tomato-derived putative gene cluster that was predicted to produce hydroxylated naringenin chalcone and/or methyl esters of hydroxylated naringenin chalcone, natural compounds that are found in tomato but without an elucidated pathway for biosynthesis ( 11). The putative tomato gene cluster predicted from PlantClusterFinder  referred to as C584_4 ( 11)  consists of a CHS ( SlCHS, SOLYC09G091510), a putative cytochrome P450 ( SlCYP, SOLYC09G091570), and three methyltransferases ( SlMT1/2/3; SOLYC09G091530, SOLYC09G091540, and SOLYC09G091550). SlCHS is a well-studied type III PKS, which is known to sequentially condense one  p-coumaroyl-CoA and three malonyl-CoA molecules to make naringenin chalcone, the first committed intermediate in the biosynthesis of flavonoids and anthocyanins ( 17). Among the three methyltransferases, SlMT3 was previously characterized as a putative salicylic acid methyltransferase potentially regulating tomato hormone emission ( 18). To our knowledge, no studies have been reported characterizing SlMT1, SlMT2, and SlCYP from the cluster. We examined the biosynthetic capacity of the predicted tomato gene cluster in yeast. Yeast expression cassettes for complementary DNAs encoding the five genes identified in the cluster ( SlCHS,  SlCYP, and  SlMT1/2/3) were designed and assembled into a yeast artificial chromosome and transformed into a wild-type yeast strain (CEN.PK2), resulting in yeast strain CSY1210. Two additional enzymes supporting the putative pathway enzymes were expressed in CSY1210 from low-copy plasmids: (i) a yeast codon-optimized 4-coumarate–CoA ligase from tomato ( Sl4CL), a precursor-producing gene from the flavonoid pathway, and (ii) an  Arabidopsis NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase ( AtATR1), a reductase partner to support the activity of the putative cytochrome P450 ( SlCYP). We cultured CSY1210 transformed with the additional plasmids and a control strain (transformed with the plasmids but not harboring the reconstructed tomato cluster) in synthetic dropout media supplemented with 100 μM  p-coumaric acid (the substrate for Sl4CL) for 72 hours at 25°C and analyzed the yeast media. The metabolites produced by the strain harboring the reconstructed tomato cluster were identified using an untargeted metabolomics analysis by qToF-MS (quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometry) (with a mass accuracy at 50 parts per million). Identification of the minimal essential tomato gene set, leading to synthesis of a previously unknown HCAA compound in yeast We next identified the genes from the predicted tomato cluster and supporting flavonoid pathway (i.e.,  Sl4CL and  AtATR1) that participated in the production of ( 1) and ( 2) in yeast. We first examined whether the methyltransferases individually participated in the biosynthesis of ( 1) and ( 2). To enable stable expression of the gene cassettes,  Sl4CL,  SlCHS, and  SlMT1/2/3 were chromosomally integrated into the wild-type yeast strain (CEN.PK2) such that each engineered strain harbors  Sl4CL,  SlCHS, and one of the methyltransferases—leading to construction of CSY1301 (SlMT1), CSY1302 (SlMT2), and CSY1303 (SlMT3). As a control, we eliminated  SlCYP (and  AtATR1) from the integration to isolate their functions in compound synthesis. We cultured the strains in synthetic complete media supplemented with 100 μM  p-coumaric acid for 72 hours at 30°C and analyzed the yeast culture media for production of ( 1) and ( 2). A product ion scan on LC-MS/MS with precursor ion set at 168.0 showed two peaks for  SlMT1 and  SlMT2 transformants at 4.324 and 5.864 min, respectively ( Fig. 1C). A product ion scan with a precursor ion set at 316.1 showed a single peak at 5.864 min for  SlMT1 and  SlMT2 transformants ( Fig. 1C). As previously hypothesized, the peak at 5.864 min detected at 168  m/z may be a molecular fragment of ( 2). Production of ( 1) and ( 2) in the absence of  SlCYP (and  AtATR1) indicates that  SlCYP and  AtATR1 are not involved in the production of the compounds. From the data, we observed production of ( 1) and ( 2) in both CSY1301 and CSY1302, and the product ion detected in CSY1302 was 14-fold greater than that in CSY1301 ( Fig. 1D). The results indicate that SlMT1 and SlMT2 participate individually in the production of ( 1) and ( 2) and that SlMT2 leads to ~21-fold higher level of ( 1) and ~14-fold higher level of ( 2) than SlMT1. Since the activities of SlMT1 and SlMT2 appear to be redundant in the context of characterizing the production of ( 1) and ( 2), we focused on the activity of SlMT2 for subsequent characterizations. Together, the results of methyltransferase characterizations revealed that ( 1) and ( 2) can be produced from a minimal set of genes consisting of  Sl4CL,  SlCHS, and  SlMT2. Validation of the proposed biosynthetic scheme of the HCAA compound in yeast The data further support that ( 2) is the final product of the reconstructed pathway in yeast. Specifically, ( 2) may result from the condensation of the two identified intermediates, 3-HAA methyl ester ( 1) and  p-coumaroyl-CoA, through the formation of an amide bond potentially catalyzed by SlCHS. However, direct condensation of the two intermediates would lead to a final  m/z of 314.1023 ( M + H  +), whereas the final  m/z we observed for ( 2) from yeast culture was  m/z 316.1179 ( M + H  +). A native yeast ECR, encoded by  TSC13, has been reported to reduce  p-coumaroyl-CoA to  p-dihydro-coumaroyl-CoA ( 21). We hypothesized that native Tsc13p activity in yeast may reduce  p-coumaroyl-CoA to  p-dihydro-coumaroyl-CoA and that SlCHS catalyzes the condensation of  p-dihydro-coumaroyl-CoA with ( 1), leading to production of ( 2) ( Fig. 1E). We next elucidated a biosynthetic scheme for the synthesis of ( 1) and ( 2) in yeast. Low-copy plasmids encoding the expression of  Sl4CL,  SlCHS, and  SlMT2 were cotransformed in different combinations into yeast, and the production of ( 1) and ( 2) were monitored in the presence and absence of fed  p-coumaric acid after 72 hours of growth at 30°C (table S1). We first coexpressed the three genes with or without fed  p-coumaric acid (groups 1 and 2). We then coexpressed all pairs of genes, e.g.,  SlCHS and  SlMT2,  SlMT2 and  Sl4CL, and  SlCHS and  Sl4CL with fed  p-coumaric acid (groups 3 to 5). Last, we expressed each single gene in the absence of fed  p-coumaric acid (groups 6 to 8). We observed that (i) the removal of fed  p-coumaric acid eliminates the production of ( 2) (groups 1 and 2), (ii) the removal of the expression of  Sl4CL or  SlCHS eliminates the production of ( 2) (groups 3 and 4), (iii) the removal of the expression of  SlMT2 eliminates the production of both ( 1) and ( 2) (group 5), and (iv) the single expression of  SlMT2 without fed  p-coumaric acid leads to production of ( 1) (groups 6 to 8). The observations (i) and (ii) indicate that  p-coumaric acid is a precursor for the production of ( 2), and both  Sl4CL and  SlCHS are required for the production of ( 2). The observations (iii) and (iv) indicate that  SlMT2 is responsible for the production of ( 1), which is independent of fed  p-coumaric acid, and that ( 1) is likely a substrate for the production of ( 2). On the basis of the production patterns of ( 1) and ( 2) under different enzyme combinations, we proposed the sequencing of intermediates along the reconstructed pathway in yeast. Sl4CL is known to catalyze the conversion of  p-coumaric acid to  p-coumaroyl-CoA ( 19), and we observed that  p-coumaric acid is an essential precursor for the production of ( 2) through the reconstructed pathway; thus, we hypothesized that  p-coumaroyl-CoA is likely an intermediate of the pathway. A previous study reported that a group of methyltransferases from the salicylic acid benzoic acid theobromine (SABATH) enzyme family in maize is able to catalyze conversion of anthranilic acid to methyl anthranilate, a volatile methyl ester with potential function in plant defense ( 20). We hypothesized that SlMT2 may use an anthranilate analog from yeast native metabolism (as the pathway precursor) and catalyze its conversion to a methyl ester (as a pathway intermediate). By searching anthranilate-related yeast native metabolites in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database, we identified 3-HAA, a primary metabolite involved in tryptophan metabolism, as a putative substrate for the SlMT2 methyltransferase and proposed the compound structure for the methyl ester ( 1) ( Fig. 1A). We confirmed the compound structure of ( 1) with its chemical standard by retention time and tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrum (fig. S1C). To validate our hypothesis, we used CSY1302 (which harbors chromosomally integrated  SlCHS,  SlMT2, and y Sl4CL) to engineer  TSC13 knockout strains. As deletion of  TSC13 inhibited cellular growth due to its essential role in fatty acid synthesis ( 22), we partially disrupted Tsc13p activity by inserting three consecutive stop codons at two-thirds the length of  TSC13 coding sequence, resulting in strain CSY1304. The insertion of stop codons in  TSC13 may lead to low activity through a low frequency of stop-codon readthrough, enabling very low expression of Tsc13p. Stop-codon readthrough has been reported in yeast, where readthrough efficiencies can be as high as 8% ( 23) and be induced by stress conditions ( 24). We also replaced  TSC13 with heterologous ECR variants from  Gossypium hirsutum ( GhECR2) and  Malus domestica ( MdECR) that were reported to have low activity on  p-coumaroyl-CoA ( 21), resulting in CSY1305 ( TSC13∆ ::GhECR2) and CSY1306 ( TSC13∆ ::MdECR), respectively. We cultured CSY1304 to CSY1306 in synthetic complete media supplemented with 100 μM  p-coumaric acid and 100 μM 3-HAA methyl ester for 72 hours at 30°C and analyzed the yeast culture media for production of ( 1) and ( 2) on LC-MS/MS by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection. Partial disruption of the native yeast ECR Tsc13p (CSY1304) resulted in a 40% reduction in production of ( 2), while replacement of Tsc13p with heterologous ECR variants (CSY1305 and CSY1306) resulted in the absence of production of ( 2) and the presence of a previously unknown compound ( 3), with an expected  m/z of 314.1 ( M + H  +) corresponding to the oxidized form of ( 2) ( Fig. 1, F and G). The compound identities of ( 2) and ( 3) were validated by comparing the retention times and MS/MS spectrums to those of the chemical standards (fig. S1, D and E). The results suggest that the yeast native enzyme participated in the tomato cluster activity and produced a derivative product ( 2); we eliminated this interference by knocking out the yeast native gene  TSC13, thereby restoring the true product ( 3) resulting from the minimal gene cluster (Sl4CL, SlMT2, and SlCHS). In vivo site-directed mutagenesis confirms the utilization of CHS active site for both naringenin chalcone and amide synthesis On the basis of the results of the docking simulation, we first investigated the roles of C164, H303, N336 (canonical catalytic triad residues), and G305 on amide synthesis. We created a  SlCHS knockout strain (CSY1307) by replacing the full sequence of  SlCHS with three consecutive stop codons in CSY1305 (which harbors chromosomally integrated  Sl4CL,  SlMT2,  SlCHS, and  TSC13∆ ::GhECR2). Low-copy plasmids encoding SlCHS point mutants (C164A, C164S, H303A, N336A, and G305A) were constructed and transformed into CSY1307. Transformed CSY1307 strains harboring individual SlCHS mutants were cultured in synthetic dropout media supplemented with 100 μM  p-coumaric acid and 100 μM 3-HAA methyl ester for 72 hours at 30°C. Yeast culture media was analyzed for production of naringenin chalcone and ( 3) on LC-MS/MS by MRM detection. C164A, C164S, and H303A mutants completely eliminated both the canonical activity and the amide synthesis activity ( Fig. 4B). The N336A mutant completely abolished naringenin chalcone production but resulted in an increase in the production of ( 3) compared to the wild-type variant, whereas the G305A mutant abolished canonical activity but exhibited only trace amounts of amide formation. The results indicate that C164 and H303 are essential for both canonical and amide synthesis, which is expected as these two residues are responsible for the loading of  p-coumaroyl-CoA. The C164S mutant confirms the importance of the thiol group of cysteine for forming the imidazolium ion pair with H303 to activate acyl transfer through nucleophilic attack during loading of  p-coumaroyl-CoA onto C164. Although N336 is essential for canonical activity for binding of extender malonyl-CoA, it does not contribute to binding of 3-HAA methyl ester to the active site. This result is further supported by an uninterrupted docking of 3-HAA methyl ester to the active site of a N336A mutant homology model using AutoDock Vina (fig. S3C). The increase in production of ( 3) observed from the N336A mutant relative to the parent enzyme is likely due to a lack of competition between 3-HAA methyl ester and malonyl-CoA for the  p-coumaroyl starter moiety at the active site of the N336A mutant. Last, the removal of amide and canonical activities observed in the G305A mutant suggests that G305 potentially performs a stabilizing role in anchoring 3-HAA methyl ester (as predicted by the docking simulation) and malonyl-CoA during their respective condensation reactions. Type III PKSs are characterized by a conserved cysteine-histidine-asparagine catalytic triad, which corresponds to C164-H303-N336 in SlCHS. For canonical synthesis of naringenin chalcone, C164 and H303 form an imidazolium ion pair, which initiates a nucleophilic attack on the thioester carbonyl of  p-coumaroyl-CoA that completes acyl transfer onto C164 ( 28). H303 and N336 coordinate the orientation of the incoming malonyl-CoA moieties during the process of iterative decarboxylation and condensation of the extender malonyl-CoA molecules in formation of the polyketide intermediate. In addition, F215 is an important gatekeeper residue that is reported to separate the CoA-binding tunnel from the active site cavity and help with folding and internal orientation of the tetraketide intermediate ( 28– 30). On the basis of our in vitro assay results, we hypothesized that SlCHS is likely to use the same active site for amide synthesis as for naringenin chalcone synthesis. We therefore investigated the catalytic mechanism of amide bond formation by examining the roles of these active site residues that are important for SlCHS canonical activity. Last, we investigated the potential effects of nonspecific binding by 3-HAA methyl ester to SlCHS protein. We mutated nine residues (T132A, S133A, S339A, S339T, I193A, T194A, L267A, V271A, and P272A) within ~10 Å of the 3-HAA methyl ester docking site and analyzed the effects of these mutations on production of ( 3) in yeast ( Fig. 4D and fig. S3D). CSY1307 strains transformed with the mutants encoded on low-copy plasmids were cultured under identical conditions, and production of naringenin chalcone and ( 3) was analyzed on LC-MS/MS by MRM detection. The results showed that most of the nine tested residues did not show statistically significant effects on production of ( 3), except for S339A, T194A, and P272A ( Fig. 4D). S339A completely abolished SlCHS activity, and the two distal residue mutants (T194A and P272A) significantly improved SlCHS activity for production of ( 3). Since S339 is located at a loop structure near the SlCHS active site, the mutation may have interrupted the correct folding of the active site cavity and therefore disrupted both naringenin chalcone and amide synthesis. Removal of the two distal residues (T194A and P272A) may have altered the entrance geometry of the active site cavity, which facilitated the access of 3-HAA methyl ester to the active site and therefore increased production of ( 3). Similarly, fluctuations in the production of naringenin chalcone observed among the mutants could be caused by an altered geometry around the active site, which affected the access of  p-coumaroyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA to the active site. We first evaluated which residues could potentially interact with 3-HAA methyl ester and use the substrate for amide formation. We built a homology model for SlCHS using Phyre2 ( 31) and simulated the docking of 3-HAA methyl ester to the homology model structure using AutoDock Vina ( 32). The simulation shows that 3-HAA methyl ester favorably docks at the SlCHS active site, potentially interacting with H303, N336, and G305 by hydrogen bonding ( Fig. 4A, fig. S3A). As a comparison, we simulated the docking of the canonical substrate malonyl-CoA to the SlCHS active site (fig. S3B), which shows that the substrate 3-HAA methyl ester is much smaller in size (molecular weight, 153 versus 854) than the canonical substrate and therefore can readily dock at the active site cavity. We next examined potential effects of F215 on amide formation ( Fig. 4C). We tested different mutants of the residue to conserve either the ring structure (F215W, F215Y, and F215H) or spatial occupancy (F215I) of the residue side chain. Low-copy plasmids encoding SlCHS mutants (F215A, F215W, F215Y, F215H, F215C, and F215I) were each transformed into CSY1307. The transformed CSY1307 strains were cultured under identical conditions, and production of naringenin chalcone and ( 3) was analyzed on LC-MS/MS by MRM detection. All F215 mutants except F215W completely abolished the canonical activity, where F215W maintained only 5% naringenin chalcone production as compared to the wild-type variant ( Fig. 4C). The results support the previously proposed role of F215 in orienting malonyl-CoA and polyketide intermediates at the active site ( 29,  30). We also observed that all mutants except F215W led to ≥70% reduction in production of ( 3), while F215W maintained 90% production of ( 3) compared to the wild-type variant ( Fig. 4C). The results suggest that the ring structure of residue 215 in wild-type and the F215W mutant may assist in orienting 3-HAA methyl ester at the active site to facilitate amide formation. However, the ring structure itself in the residue is not sufficient for 3-HAA methyl ester binding since decreased production of ( 3) was observed in F215Y and F215H (which conserved the ring structure); instead, spatial occupancy (F215I) by the residue may also contribute to substrate selection. Furthermore, reduced production of ( 3) observed in the F215Y and F215H mutants could result from a poorly oriented residue side chain shielding the active site, thus preventing the access of 3-HAA methyl ester to C164-bound  p-coumaroyl moiety. We also scanned for the production of pyrone derivatives bis-noryangonin (BNY) and 4-coumaroyltriacetic acid lactone (CTAL), the former a triketide and the latter a tetraketide early-released derailment by-product ( 29,  33), by F215 mutants in yeast culture media. We observed proportional levels of CTAL production compared to that of naringenin chalcone and no detectable levels of BNY production (fig. S4A). The results suggest that inhibited production of ( 3) by F215 mutants is unlikely due to pyrone by-product accumulation at the SlCHS active site. In summary, the results indicate that although F215 likely performs a specific structural role in orienting malonyl-CoA during extension of the polyketide intermediate in canonical activity, its function is less specific for selecting 3-HAA methyl ester as a substrate. Tomato CHS exhibits a previously uncharacterized activity for amide synthesis We next examined whether the amide synthesis interferes with the canonical activity. We performed an in vitro reaction with SlCHS under similar conditions but incubated equimolar amounts (200 μM) of 3-HAA methyl ester and malonyl-CoA with 200 μM  p-coumaroyl-CoA. Analysis of the reaction products showed an 85% decrease in production of ( 3) ( Fig. 3, reactions 2 and 3) and 6% decrease in production of naringenin ( Fig. 3, reactions 1 and 3). The results suggest that 3-HAA methyl ester is likely competing with malonyl-CoA for a  p-coumaroyl starter molecule at the SlCHS active site, indicating that SlCHS could use the same active site for amide formation as for Claisen condensation. Our in vivo characterization results of the minimal gene cluster ( Sl4CL,  SlMT2, and  SlCHS) indicate that SlCHS can potentially catalyze the condensation of  p-coumaroyl-CoA and 3-HAA methyl ester, leading to the formation of a nitrogen-carbon (amide) bond. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of amide formation by CHS, which canonically catalyzes Claisen condensation (carbon-carbon bond formation) ( 26). Last, we examined whether the observed amide synthesis activity was specific to the CHS variant from tomato (SlCHS). Specifically, we performed in vitro reaction assays with the CHS variant from  Arabidopsis (AtCHS). AtCHS was recombinantly expressed in  E. coli and purified, and its activities on malonyl-CoA and 3-HAA methyl ester were analyzed under the same assay conditions as were used for SlCHS. AtCHS exhibits identical patterns of catalytic activity and substrate preferences as SlCHS in vitro, i.e., highest production of amide with 3-HAA methyl ester, trace amounts of amide production with 2-amino-5-methoxybenzoic acid, and ester production with 3-hydroxybenzoic methyl ester (fig. S2, D and E). Together, the results indicate that the amide synthesis activity observed in SlCHS is not unique to this variant and could be a common secondary function in plant CHS enzymes. We further examined the amide bond catalytic activity of SlCHS by expressing SlCHS recombinantly in  Escherichia coli, purifying the enzyme, and characterizing its activities via in vitro enzymatic assays. SlCHS activity was examined with both its canonical substrates (malonyl-CoA and  p-coumaroyl-CoA) and the substrates identified in the context of the minimal tomato gene cluster (3-HAA methyl ester and  p-coumaroyl-CoA). The reactions were performed by incubating 4 μg of purified enzyme with 200 μM malonyl-CoA or 3-HAA methyl ester and 200 μM  p-coumaroyl-CoA for 4 hours and analyzed on LC-MS/MS by MRM detection. For SlCHS canonical activity characterization, we observed spontaneous conversion of naringenin chalcone to naringenin under the in vitro reaction conditions, and we confirmed the production of naringenin by comparing the resultant peak with an authentic standard of naringenin (fig. S2A). We observed the production of ( 3) when 3-HAA methyl ester was added to the reaction mixture by comparing the peaks with a chemically synthesized standard of ( 3). The chemical standard of ( 3) yielded a single peak when dissolved in water (retention time, 6.872 min) but resulted in a secondary peak (retention time of 7.484 min) when dissolved in acidic methanol (fig. S2B). The secondary peak was also detected in acidic methanol-quenched in vitro reaction mixtures, from which the detection of ( 3) is expected. A previous study compared nonenzymatic and chalcone isomerase–catalyzed conversion of chalcone to flavanone and the pH dependence of this reaction ( 27). We hypothesized that the secondary peak could result from an isomerized form of ( 3), similar to the isomerization process of converting naringenin chalcone to naringenin, possibly formed during the in vitro reaction. Together, these results validate that SlCHS is capable of amide formation. We next investigated whether SlCHS exhibited a substrate specificity toward 3-HAA methyl ester for amide synthesis. We incubated SlCHS with 200 μM anthranilic acid analog and 200 μM  p-coumaroyl-CoA with similar in vitro reaction conditions, and the reaction mixture was analyzed on LC-MS/MS by product ion scan with a precursor ions set to match the  m/z of expected condensation products. We tested numerous anthranilic acid analogs in this assay, including 3-HAA methyl ester, 2-amino-3/4/5-methoxybenzoic acid, 3-HAA, 2-amino-5-hydroxybenxoic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic methyl ester, and anthranilic acid. Analysis of the  m/z ( M + H  +) of the expected product for each substrate indicated product peaks with 3-HAA methyl ester, 2-amino-5-methoxybenzoic acid, and 3-hydroxybenzoic methyl ester, among which 3-HAA methyl ester yielded more than 15-fold and 49-fold higher product ion detected than those of 2-amino-5-methoxybenzoic acid and 3-hydroxybenzoic methyl ester, respectively (fig. S2C). In contrast, no amide product was observed when 3-HAA and anthranilic acid, which share a very similar molecular structure with 3-HAA methyl ester, were included in the reaction mixture. A trace amount of a possible ester product was observed when 3-hydroxybenzoic methyl ester was included as a substrate. The observed substrate preferences of SlCHS on the panel of anthranilic acid analogs tested indicate that methylation on the carboxyl group of the anthranilate may facilitate substrate access to the SlCHS active site and that SlCHS exhibits a high substrate preference toward 3-HAA methyl ester. Tomato methyltransferase shows activity on fed 3-HAA in yeast On the basis of our in vivo functional characterization of SlMT2, the methyltransferase recognizes yeast native 3-HAA as a substrate. According to the KEGG pathway database, 3-HAA is involved in central metabolism, i.e., tryptophan metabolism, and the metabolite is also present in tomato. Since no previous studies have been reported on the functional roles of SlMT1 and SlMT2, we investigated the activities of the methyltransferases on hydroxycinnamic acids, amines, and anthranilic acids by feeding these substrates to yeast engineered to express these methyltransferases. Among the three methyltransferases predicted in the tomato cluster, SlMT3 has been reported to catalyze the methylation of salicylic acid ( 19). SlMT1 and SlMT2 showed high protein sequence similarity to SlMT3 (78.12 and 81.42%, respectively), indicating that they may similarly exhibit activity on salicylic acid. In addition, the three methyltransferases were initially predicted as tailoring enzymes to modify  p-coumaric acid and other moieties of hydroxycinnamic acids, contributing to the production of hydroxylated naringenin chalcone and/or methyl esters of hydroxylated naringenin chalcone in tomato flavonoid metabolism ( 11). We tested the activity of SlMT1/2/3 toward a variety of candidate substrates in yeast, including hydroxycinnamic acids (cinnamic,  p-coumaric, caffeic, and salicylic acids), trace amines (tyramine, tryptamine, octopamine, dopamine, and serotonin), and anthranilic acid analogs (3-HAA and  p-aminobenzoic acid). Low-copy plasmids encoding the expression of  SlMT1/2/3 or inactive  ccdB (negative control) were transformed into the wild-type yeast strain (CEN.PK2). The transformed yeast strains expressing one of the methyltransferases (or negative control protein) were cultured in synthetic dropout media fed with 100 μM of each substrate candidate for 72 hours at 30°C. The resulting yeast media was analyzed on qToF-MS for total ion scan, and the methylation products were evaluated by analyzing differential peaks detected from the transformants compared to the negative control. A methylation product is counted if the  m/z ( M + H  +) of a differential peak (between the sample and the negative control) qualifies a putative methylated product catalyzed from the substrate. Among all the potential substrates tested, SlMT1 and SlMT2 exhibited detectable activities toward 3-HAA,  p-coumaric acid, and  p-aminobenzoic acid (a primary metabolite that shares similar functional groups with 3-HAA), and SlMT3 exhibited detectable activity only toward 3-HAA. The highest level of the methylation product was observed when supplying 3-HAA to SlMT2 ( Fig. 2). Among the three methyltransferases, SlMT3 showed the lowest production of the methylation product from 3-HAA, and the methylation products catalyzed from  p-coumaric acid and  p-aminobenzoic acid were not detected in our assay. None of SlMT1/2/3 showed detectable activity toward salicylic acid in the context of the yeast-based feeding assay. We hypothesized that either salicylic acid was not efficiently transported into yeast cells due to previously reported antagonism between salicylic acid and  d-glucose ( 25) or the volatile salicylate methyl ester product may have evaporated. Our results indicate that all three methyltransferases (SlMT1/2/3) showed the highest activity toward 3-HAA (among the fed substrates tested) and that SlMT2 led to the highest production of 3-HAA methyl ester in the yeast-based feeding assay. In vitro kinetic characterization shows competitive inhibition of CHS canonical activity by 3-HAA methyl ester We then fit the data points taken under 3 and 5 mM inhibitors to competitive (Fig. 5, Eq. 2), uncompetitive (Fig. 5, Eq. 3), or mixed-type (Fig. 5, Eq. 4) inhibition modes to interpret inhibition coefficients ( Kc for competitive inhibition and  Ku for uncompetitive inhibition) by fixing the values for  Km and  kcat at those obtained at 0 mM inhibitor ( Fig. 5, C to E). Here, we used the Hill coefficient  n to represent the effect of cooperativity resulting from sequential binding of three molecules of malonyl-CoA to coumaroyl-bound enzyme complex. For the data points obtained under 3 and 5 mM inhibitors, we observed minimization of RMSE with the mixed-type inhibition model, and the best fits were obtained at  n = 1.7 and 1.5 for 3 and 5 mM inhibitors, respectively ( Fig. 5, D and E, and table S2D). For 3 mM inhibitor,  Kc = 0.377 mM and  Ku = 1.01 mM ( Ku/ Kc = 2.67). For 5 mM inhibitor,  Kc = 0.341 mM and  Ku = 0.897 mM ( Ku/ Kc = 2.63). Together, the results indicate that inhibition is dominated by competitive mode in both cases with a shift from competitive to uncompetitive mode as inhibitor concentration increases from 3 to 5 mM. The results of the site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that SlCHS uses the same active site for canonical and amide synthesis. We performed in vitro enzymatic assays to further investigate the kinetic properties of SlCHS on 3-HAA methyl ester. Kinetic assays were performed by incubating purified SlCHS with  p-coumaroyl-CoA and varying concentrations of 3-HAA methyl ester (0, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3, 5, 10, and 15 mM). The reactions were stopped at different time points, and reaction products were analyzed on LC-MS/MS to derive the kinetic curve ( Fig. 5A and fig. S5A). The kinetic data show that the amide synthesis has a  Km (Michaelis-Menten constant) of 3.06 mM and a  Vmax of 14.47 nM min −1, resulting in a  kcat of 0.362 min −1 and  kcat/ Km of 1.18 × 10 −4 μM −1 min −1 under the in vitro reaction conditions ( Fig. 5A). As a comparison, we performed in vitro enzymatic assays to characterize the kinetic properties of SlCHS canonical activity by incubating purified SlCHS with  p-coumaroyl-CoA and varying concentrations of malonyl-CoA (0, 5, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 μM). The canonical synthesis of naringenin chalcone has a  Km of 21.34 μM and  Vmax of 11.32 nM min −1, resulting in a  kcat of 0.0943 min −1 and  kcat/ Km of 4.42 × 10 −3 μM −1 min −1 (fig. S5B). The results show a 143-fold difference between SlCHS’s  Km for 3-HAA methyl ester and malonyl-CoA, indicating that the enzyme has a much higher affinity for malonyl-CoA than for 3-HAA methyl ester. The results also show a 37-fold higher catalytic efficiency ( kcat/ Km) of SlCHS for synthesis of naringenin chalcone than for that of amide. Together, the results indicate that amide synthesis is likely to be a less efficient secondary function of SlCHS. We next examined the mechanism of 3-HAA methyl ester inhibition of SlCHS canonical activity. Kinetic assays were performed by incubating purified SlCHS with  p-coumaroyl-CoA and varying concentrations of malonyl-CoA (5, 50, and 100 μM) as the substrate and 3-HAA methyl ester (0, 3, and 5 mM) as the inhibitor. The reactions were stopped at different time points, and reaction products were analyzed on LC-MS/MS to derive the kinetic curve for each inhibitor concentration ( Fig. 5B). For the purpose of curve-fitting, only malonyl-CoA was considered as the substrate, since the reactions were performed under saturated concentrations of  p-coumaroyl-CoA (200 μM). We first fit all data points (measured under 0, 3, and 5 mM inhibitor) to Eq. 1 ( Fig. 5, B and C). By tuning the Hill coefficient, we observed that root mean square error (RMSE) is minimized for data points of 0 mM when  n = 1, for data points of 3 mM when  n = 1.7, and for data points of 5 mM when  n = 1.5 ( Fig. 5B and table S2A). The curve-fitting results suggest that the effects of cooperativity emerge only when inhibitors are present. Last, we investigated the production of pyrone derivatives BNY and CTAL by SlCHS when inhibited by 3-HAA methyl ester. We scanned for BNY and CTAL production from reaction mixtures fed with 100 μM malonyl-CoA; 100 μM  p-coumaroyl-CoA; and 0, 3, or 5 mM 3-HAA methyl ester inhibitor at the end of the kinetic assay time course. We detected proportional levels of CTAL production compared to that of naringenin and no detectable levels of BNY production (fig. S4, B and C). The results suggest that 3-HAA is unlikely to promote the release of derailment by-products due to early termination in extension and/or cyclization during polyketide synthesis.","Chalcone synthase (CHS) canonically catalyzes carbon-carbon bond formation through iterative decarboxylative Claisen condensation. Here, we characterize a previously unidentified biosynthetic capability of SlCHS to catalyze nitrogen-carbon bond formation, leading to the production of a hydroxycinnamic acid amide (HCAA) compound. By expressing a putative tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) gene cluster in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), we elucidate the activity of a pathway consisting of a carboxyl methyltransferase (SlMT2), which methylates the yeast primary metabolite 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) to form a methyl ester, and a SlCHS, which catalyzes the condensation of 3-HAA methyl ester and  p -coumaroyl-coenzyme A (CoA) through formation of an amide bond. We demonstrate that this aminoacylation activity could be a common secondary activity in plant CHSs by validating the activity in vitro with variants from  S. lycopersicum  and  Arabidopsis thaliana  Our work demonstrates yeast as a platform for characterizing putative plant gene clusters with the potential for compound structure and enzymatic activity discovery.",NaN," 'methyl ester', 'fig.', 'production', 'SlCHS', 'ester', 'methyl', 'acid', 'yeast', 'active site', 'p-coumaric acid' "," qToF-MS, C584_4 ( 11), CHS, SOLYC09G091510, cytochrome P450, SlCYP, SOLYC09G091570, SlMT1/2/3, SOLYC09G091530, SOLYC09G091540, SOLYC09G091550, SlMT3, SlMT1, SlMT2, SlCYP, CSY1210, 4-coumarate–CoA ligase, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, AtATR1, cytochrome P450, SlCYP, °C, qToF-MS, CSY1301 (, SlMT1, CSY1302, SlMT2, SlMT3, °C, CSY1301, CSY1302, CSY1302, CSY1301 ( Fig. 1D, SlMT1, SlMT2, SlMT2, ~21-fold, SlMT1, SlMT1, SlMT2, SlMT2, methyltransferase, 314.1023, Tsc13p, °C, 8), 8), Sl4CL, SlMT2, anthranilate, anthranilate-related yeast, SlMT2, CSY1302, Tsc13p, CSY1304, Tsc13p, MdECR, CSY1305, TSC13∆, CSY1306, TSC13∆, CSY1304, CSY1306, °C, Tsc13p, CSY1305, CSY1306, D, Sl4CL, SlMT2, CHS, CSY1307, CSY1305, C164S, N336A, G305A, CSY1307, CSY1307, °C, C164S, N336A, G305A, C164S, N336A, N336A, N336A, G305A, G305, Type III PKSs, cysteine-histidine-asparagine, C164-H303-N336, S133A, I193A, T194A, L267A, V271A, Å, CSY1307, T194A, P272A ( Fig. 4D, G305, F215Y, F215W, F215Y, F215C, CSY1307, CSY1307, F215W, F215W, F215W, F215Y, F215Y, C164-bound  p-coumaroyl, BNY, Sl4CL, CHS, CHS, CHS, AtCHS, AtCHS, AtCHS, D, CHS, recombinantly, methanol-quenched, chalcone isomerase–, μM anthranilic acid, carboxyl, anthranilate, Tomato methyltransferase, SlMT2, 3-HAA, SlMT1, SlMT2, SlMT3, SlMT1, SlMT2, SlMT3, SlMT1/2/3, serotonin, °C, qToF-MS, SlMT1, SlMT2, SlMT3, SlMT2, SlMT3, SlMT1/2/3, SlMT1/2/3, SlMT2, CHS, mixed-type (Fig. 5, C, coumaroyl-bound enzyme, D, S2D, Ku/, Ku/, −1, −1, −4 μM −1, −1, μM, −1, −1, −3 μM −1, −1 (fig.

20,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC3466413/eupmc_result.json,PMC3466413,"Results Plasticity in the activity of TPS20-related enzymes from  S. habrochaites The enzyme from clade D produced a sesquiterpene profile identical to that made by the closely related LA1777 ShSBS when supplied with  2z,6z-FPP as substrate ( Figure S4d). In contrast, the enzyme from clade E utilized  2z,6z-FPP to synthesize 7-epizingiberene,  R-curcumene and β-sesquiphellandrene, the module E terpenes ( Figure 2 and  Figure S4e). The enzyme therefore is designated ShZIS. SlPHS1 and ShSBS share 91% amino acid sequence identity, yet they use the structurally distinct NPP and  2z,6z-FPP for the synthesis of mono- and sesquiterpenes, respectively ( Sallaud   et al., 2009 ;  Schilmiller   et al., 2009 ). To explore the hypothesis that sequence diversification has resulted in functional divergence at TPS20 within  S. habrochaites, codon optimized versions ( Ikemura, 1981) of representatives from each of the five major clades in the phylogenetic tree were expressed in  E. coli. The recombinant proteins were tested with each of the potential substrates: geranyl diphosphate (C10, GPP),  e,e-farnesyl diphosphate (C15,  e,e-FPP), and the  cisoid substrates neryl diphosphate (C10, NPP) and  2z,6z-farnesyl diphosphate (C15,  2z,6z-FPP). The predicted proteins from group M utilized NPP to synthesize a variety of monoterpenes. As predicted based on sequence similarity, the recombinant enzyme from clade A accession LA2100 produced a monoterpene profile indistinguishable from SlPHS1 ( Schilmiller   et al., 2009 ), with β-phellandrene as the major product, along with limonene, α-pinene, δ-2-carene, α-phellandrene and γ-terpinene ( Figure 6a). The products of this enzyme (designated ShPHS1) with NPP substrate match the terpene profile from trichome extracts of accession LA2100 ( Figure S4a). In contrast, the enzyme LA2812A from clade B (one of the sequences recovered from accession LA2812) converted NPP to limonene, which again matches the profile observed in extracts of LA2812 trichomes and is therefore designated ShLMS ( Figure 6b,  Figures S4b and  S5). The enzyme from clade C accession LA2107 converted NPP predominantly to α-pinene together with lower amounts of β-pinene and β-phellandrene and/or limonene ( Figure 6c), and therefore is named ShPIS. Trichomes from LA2107 also accumulate the compounds produced by ShPHS1; however the presence of high β-pinene levels in the trichomes can only be explained by the activity of ShPIS ( Figure S4c). In general, enzymes from the sesquiterpene-rich clades D and E (from accessions LA1393 and LA2167, respectively) did not produce detectable amounts of monoterpenes from GPP or NPP except for very low amounts of limonene and α-terpineol in assays that contained NPP ( Figure 6d, e). However, these compounds were also observed in reactions that contained the empty vector and NPP and, in the case of limonene, are at least two orders of magnitude lower than in reactions that contained ShLMS ( Figure 6b,f). Furthermore, α-terpineol was not detected in trichome samples ( Figure 1 and  Figure S4). Therefore, it is likely that the formation of limonene and α-terpineol can occur either enzymatically or non-enzymatically in the crude  E. coli extracts used to perform the enzyme assays. In conclusion, the functional characterization of five different alleles of TPS20 from  S. habrochaites revealed five distinct enzyme activities. Enzymes that belong to group M utilize NPP for the production of monoterpenes, whereas enzymes from group S utilize  2z,6z-FPP to synthesize sesquiterpenes. Collectively, these enzymes synthesize many of the major terpenes identified in the trichomes of  S. habrochaites. A geographical-climatic context for terpene diversity A similar analysis was conducted to classify the accessions based on whether their chemical profile contains the predominant terpenes made by members of the TPS20-related enzymes, namely β-phellandrene, α-pinene and δ-carene for ShPHS1, limonene for ShLMS, santalene/bergamotene for ShSBS, or 7-epizingiberene for ShZIS ( Figure 7b and  Table S1). The production of santalene and bergamotene is confined to Ancash and Lima in Peru ( Figure 7b and  Table S1), whereas accessions from group I that lack the products of ShSBS are preferentially located in the southernmost area of the distribution. The narrow distribution of these terpenes is consistent with the low evolutionary divergence found in the sequences recovered from clade D that encode ShSBS enzymes ( Figure 3b). A different situation is observed for the β-phellandrene/limonene-producing accessions, which were mainly collected in the border between Ecuador and Peru, yet clade A possessed large sequence divergence ( Figure 3b). Meanwhile, the production of 7-epizingiberene is widely distributed and alleles from clade E showed intermediate levels of sequence divergence. Notably, the distribution of accessions that synthesize 7-epizingiberene is not continuous as they are not located in the area where santalene-/bergamotene-producing accessions predominate. Furthermore, no sequence features were detected within clade E that distinguishes the accessions from the southern region of the distribution from those in the northern region that are separated by the santalene- and bergamotene-producing accessions (data not shown). The  S. habrochaites accessions used in this study were collected in Peru and Ecuador from 1948 to 1997, and the geographical coordinates of most of the collection sites are available ( http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu/). This information was used to examine the terpene variation of  S. habrochaites throughout its range of distribution. The accessions were classified according to the five chemical groups described in  Figure 2 and mapped using their geographical coordinates ( Figure 7a,c). Additionally, annual mean temperature, annual precipitation and elevation were calculated for each group ( Figure 7d–f). Co-occurrence of the terpene groups with the geographical distribution of the accessions is observed. Group I accessions were preferentially located in the higher altitude southern range of the distribution, with lower mean temperatures and annual precipitation, whereas groups III and V were located further north, in regions that are at lower elevation, and warmer with a more humid climate. In contrast, group II accessions are present over a wide area of the distribution. Phylogenetic analysis of TPS20-related homologs from  S. habrochaites Cluster S is composed of sequences that are more similar to ShSBS from LA1777, and are subdivided into clades D and E. Clade D consists of accessions that belong exclusively to group I. Notably, this clade displays the highest level of sequence conservation among members, with a mean amino acid difference between sequence pairs of two, compared with 15, 16, 11 and 10 in clades A, B, C and E, respectively ( Figure 3b). Clade E includes accessions from groups I, III, and IV, but predominantly from II. Three TPS-e/f subfamily enzymes,  SlPHS1 ( SlTPS20),  SpPHS1 and  ShSBS, contribute to chemical variation in  S. habrochaitesLA1777,  S. lycopersicum M82 and  S. pennelliiLA0716 trichomes ( Sallaud   et al., 2009 ;  Schilmiller   et al., 2009 ;  Falara   et al., 2011 ). Based on the diverse catalytic activities and the strong level of sequence conservation between these enzymes, we hypothesized that sequence variation within TPS20-related enzymes could contribute to the observed terpene diversity in  S. habrochaites. Primers designed from  SlPHS1 were used to amplify full-length cDNAs from 23  S. habrochaites accessions that led to the recovery of 34  TPS cDNAs that represented 22 non-redundant sequences. In several accessions distinct cDNAs were recovered that may reflect the presence of separate, closely related loci, but could also be due to heterozygosity which is widespread within  S. habrochaites ( Rick   et al., 1979 ). The cDNAs encoded predicted proteins of either 777 or 778 amino acids that contain predicted chloroplast targeting sequences together with modified versions of the ‘DDXXD’ (in most of the sequences, the third aspartic acid is replaced by a glutamic acid) and NSE/DTE motifs found in TPSs ( Figure S2) ( Martin   et al., 2010 ). Phylogenetic studies suggest that all known TPSs are derived from diterpene synthases involved in gibberellin biosynthesis ( Chen   et al., 2011 ). While most plant TPSs are shorter than diterpene synthases, the sequences recovered here and others from TPS-e/f have maintained the internal sequence element or ‘γ domain’ ( Hillwig   et al., 2011 ). Phylogenetic analysis of the  S. habrochaites amino acid variants and previously characterized enzymes SlPHS1,  S. pennellii PHS1 (SpPHS1), and ShSBS revealed separation into two major clusters: M and S (for  Monoterpenes and  Sesquiterpenes, respectively, see below) ( Figure 3 and  Figure S3). As expected from the similarity of the chemical profiles, the sequences obtained from group V accessions cluster with SlPHS1 (cluster M in  Figure 3). This finding indicates that the  S. habrochaites sequences obtained from monoterpene-producing accessions have higher similarity to  SlPHS1 than to other  S. habrochaites sequences from cluster S. Cluster M is further divided into clade A (more closely related to SlPHS1) and clades B and C. Clade C sequences have an in-frame 3-bp deletion at alanine-538, which is adjacent to the DDXXE motif ( Figure S2). This clade includes sequences obtained from groups I and V. However, the accessions that belong to group I, namely LA2976 and LA1391, synthesize monoterpenes such as β-phellandrene and limonene as do other accessions from group V ( Figure 1). A genomic rearrangement contributes to  TPS-e/f sequence divergence The sequence divergence within the  S. habrochaites TPS-e/f family raises questions about the evolutionary origins of this diversity. To investigate this situation further, a codon alignment was performed that included the sequences of three additional TPS-e/f subfamily members identified within the  S. lycopersicum chromosome 8 cluster;  TPS18, 19 and  21 ( Figure 4) ( Falara   et al., 2011 ). These were included because TPS20 ( SlPHS1) is 82, 98.5 and 93% identical at the nucleotide level to  TPS18, 19 and  21 respectively, which suggested that they arose from a common ancestor by tandem duplication and functional divergence ( Falara   et al., 2011 ). Inspection of the alignment reveals that all sequences from group S contain a region of 200 bp (boxed region,  Figure 4), which corresponded to exon 4 in  SlPHS1, which is more similar to  TPS18 than to other sequences from group M. To illustrate this result, phylogenetic analysis of the codon alignments was performed following separation of the coding sequences into three regions, exons 1–3, exon 4, and exons 5–13 ( Figure 5a–c). The topology of the tree constructed with exon 4 varied considerably compared with the trees derived from the other regions. Within the exon 4 region, the sequences from group S cluster together with  TPS18 from  S. lycopersicum, whereas in the other regions,  TPS18 forms the out group for all sequences. In exon 4 the average identity of group S to  TPS18 is 98% at the nucleotide level, compared with 90 and 79% in the other two regions ( Figure 5d). In contrast,  S. habrochaites sequences from group M are 84% identical to  TPS18 in exon 4, and 89 and 80% identical in the other two regions ( Figure 5d). These observations suggest that a form of genomic rearrangement has occurred within exon 4 of  S. habrochaites accessions from group S, which introduced a sequence more similar to  TPS18 that contributes to sequence divergence within the  TPS-e/f subfamily. Variation in terpene quantity is associated with terpene composition A subset of 27 accessions that represent the diversity from the larger dataset were selected and re-grown both to validate the original data derived from 79 accessions and quantify the volatile terpene levels using β-caryophyllene and γ-terpinene standards (see Experimental procedures). The total amount of mono- and sesquiterpenes in this subset of accessions ranged 100-fold from 171 μg g −1 dry weight in LA1265 to 19 200 μg g −1 dry weight in LA2106 ( Figure S1). There were differences in terpene quantity between groups ( anovaF: 4.753,  P-value < 0.01). In addition, a Tukey Honest Significant Differences test revealed that group II means were significantly different from those of group I and III at a  P-value < 0.05, due to the high accumulation of 7-epizingiberene in group II accessions. In contrast, the abundance of β-caryophyllene and α-humulene did not vary significantly across the five groups. Solanum habrochaites accessions show high variability in their terpene composition A dendrogram was constructed to cluster accessions according to similarity in terpene content. Five chemical groups (group I through V) that were stable through several iterations of the algorithm were defined, which revealed patterns of terpene distribution across the accessions ( Figure 2). Group I, which contains the previously characterized LA1777 ( Figures 1 and  2), is defined by high abundance of γ-elemene. Group I could be further divided in two subgroups. Accessions from the first subgroup contain sesquiterpenes synthesized by ShSBS (module A) (e.g. LA1777 and LA1393). The second subgroup also has γ-elemene as the major terpene, but lacks terpenes made by ShSBS (e.g. LA1721). Group II, which constitutes the largest group of 38 accessions is defined by the presence of 7-epizingiberene as the major peak ( Bleeker   et al., 2011a ). The presence of 7-epizingiberene is highly correlated with the presence of  R-curcumene and β-sesquiphellandrene, and this chemical phenotype is collectively designated module E. Group V accessions, which also include  S. lycopersicum M82, produce a mixture of monoterpenes in which β-phellandrene is the major compound together with smaller amount of limonene, α-pinene, δ-2-carene, α-terpinene and α-phellandrene. β-Caryophyllene and α-humulene are the major compounds identified in nine accessions from group III, whereas δ-elemene is the prominent compound in five accessions from group IV. These compounds are not specific to a single group but are distributed across multiple groups. In contrast, module A is exclusive to group I, module B is mostly present in group V, and module E predominates in group II. Together, results of these analyses simplify the considerable terpene diversity within  S. habrochaites trichomes, which suggested common biosynthetic origins that may be reflected in the activity of relatively few TPS activities. To explore the terpene diversity in the glandular trichomes of  S. habrochaites, leaf dips of 79 accessions that cover the known geographic range of the species ( Table S1) were screened by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) ( Schilmiller   et al., 2010a ). A total of 21 analytical signals were identified that corresponded to six monoterpenes, 13 sesquiterpenes and two unknown compounds ( Figure 1 and  Table S2). These data reveal that some accessions possess a relatively simple terpene composition dominated by a single major compound e.g. LA2109 (group II, with 7-epizingiberene as a major component) and LA1978 (group IV, with δ-elemene) whereas others exhibit more complex profiles, e.g. LA2975 (group I) and LA2107 (group V). Peak area data normalized to the internal standard and leaf dry weight were used for hierarchical clustering ( Figure 2). The presence or absence of analytical signals was used to cluster terpenes to identify distinct phenotypic modules composed of terpenes whose accumulation is correlated across accessions. Four of these modules were assigned to previously identified TPS activities in  Solanum trichomes. For example, module A includes endo-α-bergamotene and (+)-α-santalene, products of ShSBS previously characterized from  S. habrochaitesLA1777 ( Sallaud   et al., 2009 ). Module B consists of six monoterpenes, five of which are the products of SlPHS1 from  S. lycopersicum ( Schilmiller   et al., 2009 ). Module C includes δ-and ε-elemene, the Cope rearrangement products of germacrene C and B, which are synthesized by TPS9 ( Colby   et al., 1998 ). Finally, module D includes the products of TPS12, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene ( Schilmiller   et al., 2010a ;  Bleeker   et al., 2011b ;  Falara   et al., 2011 ). Collectively, these observations support the hypothesis that terpenes within a module are produced by the same TPS(s).","A systematic screen of volatile terpene production in the glandular trichomes of 79 accessions of Solanum habrochaites was conducted and revealed the presence of 21 mono- and sesquiterpenes that exhibit a range of qualitative and quantitative variation. Hierarchical clustering identified distinct terpene phenotypic modules with shared patterns of terpene accumulation across accessions. Several terpene modules could be assigned to previously identified terpene synthase (TPS) activities that included members of the TPS-e/f subfamily that utilize the unusual cis-prenyl diphosphate substrates neryl diphosphate and 2z,6z-farnesyl diphosphate. DNA sequencing and in vitro enzyme activity analysis of TPS-e/f members from S. habrochaites identified three previously unassigned enzyme activities that utilize these cisoid substrates. These produce either the monoterpenes α-pinene and limonene, or the sesquiterpene 7-epizingiberene, with the in vitro analyses that recapitulated the trichome chemistry found in planta. Comparison of the distribution of S. habrochaites accessions with terpene content revealed a strong preference for the presence of particular TPS20 alleles at distinct geographic locations. This study reveals that the unusually high intra-specific variation of volatile terpene synthesis in glandular trichomes of S. habrochaites is due at least in part to evolution at the TPS20 locus.",NaN," 'Figure', 'group', 'accessions', 'sequences', 'habrochaites', 'NPP', 'sequence', 'clade', 'terpene', 'habrochaites accessions' "," LA1777, TPS20, e-farnesyl diphosphate, e-FPP, α-pinene, LA2812A, S4b, α-pinene, β-pinene, ShPIS (, D, E (, LA2167, α-terpineol, α-terpineol, α-terpineol, TPS20, α-pinene, ShSBS enzymes, bergamotene-producing, c, LA1777, D, B, C, SlTPS20, habrochaitesLA1777, TPS20-related enzymes, ‘DDXXD, gibberellin biosynthesis, habrochaites amino acid, SpPHS1, SlPHS1, SlPHS1, B, alanine-538, DDXXE, LA2976, LA1391, β-phellandrene, Figure 5a–c, −1, LA1265, μg g −1, β-caryophyllene, LA1721, α-pinene, B, LA2109 (group II, LA1978 (group IV, LA2975 (group I, habrochaitesLA1777, SlPHS1, δ-and ε-elemene, Cope, B, β-caryophyllene and, TPS(s "," 'TPS20-related', 'TPS20', 'TPS20', 'TPS20-related', 'TPS20-related', 'TPS-e/f', 'SlTPS20),', 'TPS20-related', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS-e/f', 'TPS-e/f', 'TPS-e/f', 'TPS-e/f', 'TPS18,', 'TPS20', 'TPS18,', 'TPS18', 'TPS18', 'TPS18', 'TPS18', 'TPS18', 'TPS18', 'TPS-e/f', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS9', 'TPS12,', 'TPS(s).'

Results and Discussion Finally, cluster 5 includes the two genes  LOXA and  TAS14 which were induced in bottom lateral leaflets under salt stress. 3.2. Gene Expression Analysis in Leaflets of Micro-Tom Exposed to Salinity The gene expression data are displayed in  Figure 7a as a heatmap hierarchical clustering and in  Figure S4 as bar chart.  Figure 7b shows the rescaled expression values of each cluster, which were calculated by subtracting from each expression value the average among the tissues and conditions and dividing by the standard deviation. For qPCR analysis, 46 genes involved in cell wall remodelling, emission of volatiles, phenylpropanoids’ biosynthesis and stress response were chosen, given their documented role in the response to environmental constraints   30, 35, 37, 38 . The goal was to provide information on the expression dynamics for members involved in the biosynthesis/remodelling of cell walls (which are the first line of defense of plants to exogenous stresses), the synthesis of secondary metabolites and volatiles, whose abundance changes in response to stress   39, 40 . Genes involved in stress response (e.g., coding for heat shock proteins, late embryogenesis abundant proteins) and ROS scavenging were also included to get an understanding of the transcriptional changes in the leaflets in response to salinity. The expression values were obtained for lateral and terminal leaflets sampled at the bottom and top of the stem. The genes within cluster 2 showed overall lower expression values (as evidenced by the lower pixel intensities in  Figure 7a) with an induction in bottom lateral leaflets under salt stress. Cluster 4 is composed of genes preferentially expressed in bottom terminal leaflets under control conditions and induced in bottom lateral leaflets under salt stress. For ease of reading, the lateral and terminal leaflets sampled at the bottom and top under control condition or salt stress are abbreviated in  Figure 7b,  Figure S4 and Table S2 as follows: CBL control bottom lateral, CBT control bottom terminal, CTL control top lateral, CTT control top terminal, SBL salt-stressed bottom lateral, SBT salt-stressed bottom terminal, STL salt-stressed top lateral, STT salt-stressed top terminal (the positions and abbreviations are indicated in  Figure S1). Cluster 3 comprises transcripts that were expressed at higher levels in lateral leaflets at the bottom and top regardless of salt stress. By setting a Pearson’s coefficient threshold > 0.63, it was possible to distinguish five major clusters. Cluster 1 groups those genes whose expression was higher in younger leaflets sampled at the top compared to older ones from the bottom under control and salt stress conditions ( Figure 7b). 3.2.2. Genes Involved in Cell Wall Biosynthesis and Remodelling XET/ XTH are genes coding for xyloglucan endo-transglucosylase/hydrolase, enzymes that play an important role in cell wall remodelling by acting on xyloglucans, the chief hemicellulose in primary cell walls. Xyloglucans bridge cellulose microfibrils and thus contribute to the mechanical properties of the cell walls and to morphogenesis   51, 52 . More specifically, xyloglucan chains may mediate the contact between cellulose microfibrils and determine “biomechanical hotspots”, i.e., limited regions of wall extensibility   52 . Cell wall-related genes involved in expansion were also detected in the first cluster: three expansins  EXPA4,  EXPA5,  EXPA18, three transcripts coding for fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins  FLA2,  FLA10,  FLA11, as well as three xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase  XTH4,  XTH20,  XTH16. The genes were expressed at statistically significant higher levels in top leaflets compared to bottom ones under control condition ( Table S2); this is expected considering the need to expand of young tissues. Upon salt stress, the expression of expansins was either unaffected or tended to decrease. The tendency to decrease is indicative of the reported growth arrest in aerial organs of plants subjected to salt stress   35 . Expansins are genes involved in cell-wall remodelling by their loosening action on cellulose, but their exact mechanism remains poorly understood   48 . Their action has also been linked to stress adaptation, including salinity, since overexpression of an expansin in  Arabidopsis thaliana conferred improved salt tolerance   49 , while gene knock-out increased salt sensitivity   50 . FLA genes did not behave in the same way in bottom and top leaflets with respect to salinity, since  FLA11 and  FLA2 tended to be upregulated in bottom lateral and terminal leaflets of salt-stressed plants but downregulated in top lateral and terminal leaflets of NaCl-treated tomato. FLAs are involved in the maintenance of the continuum between plasma membrane and cell wall. Their expression was shown to be affected by salt stress in other plant species, such as textile hemp   35 . XTHs have both xyloglucan endo-transglucosylase (XET, i.e., they cut and rejoin xyloglucan chains) and xyloglucan endo-hydrolase (XEH, i.e., they hydrolyze xyloglucan) activities   53, 54, 55, 56 .  XTH4,  XTH16,  XTH20 were all expressed at statistically significant higher levels in top lateral leaflets under control condition ( Figure S4 and Table S2).  XTH5,  XTH8 and  XTH6 were, however, preferentially expressed in bottom lateral leaflets compared to terminal ones under control condition (they belong to cluster 3 and 4,  Figure 7a) and tended to be induced in bottom lateral leaflets under salt stress ( Figure S4). A link between  XTH expression/activity and salt tolerance was previously demonstrated: the overexpression of  CaXTH3 (from  Capsicum annuum) in tomato resulted in an increased tolerance to salt stress, as evidenced by the higher levels of chlorophyll, as well as the reduced transpiration by means of increased stomatal cell wall remodelling   57 . 3.2.1. Genes Involved in the Phenylpropanoid Pathway For  4CL, which also partakes in the phenylpropanoid pathway and groups in cluster 3, the expression pattern showed non-significant differences between older and younger leaflets but indicated overall tendencies (higher values in bottom lateral and terminal leaflets of control plants). Downstream of PAL, 4CL plays a role both in lignin deposition and flavonoid synthesis. The  4CL gene chosen in this study is the one likely associated with lignin biosynthesis   46 . Indeed, it was phylogenetically associated with class I clade, while those implicated in the synthesis of flavonoids were from class II   47 . Several genes implicated in the phenylpropanoid pathway were found in cluster 1, such as  4CL3,  PAL2,  PAL6,  HQT,  CHI1 and  CHI2 (all gene acronyms are explained in the legend of  Figure 7).  4CL3,  PAL6,  CHI1,  CHI2 and  HQT were upregulated at statistically significant levels in the younger leaflets sampled at the top compared to the older ones sampled at the bottom ( Table S2).  CHI1 showed a statistically significant decrease in expression levels in the bottom lateral leaflets under salt stress condition ( Table S2). PAL is a well-known stress-responsive gene and its induction is responsible for lignification, as well as the synthesis of compounds such as flavonoids   35, 41, 42 . In salt-stressed plants, PAL activity was reported to increase under high salinity conditions (75 mM NaCl) compared to lower levels (i.e., 50 mM) and control   43 . However, no changes were observed in the present study in response to salinity. Several  PAL isoforms exist in higher plants: for example, thale cress has 4 genes and tomato has at least 18   44, 45 . The genes here investigated may thus not directly participate in salt stress response in tomato leaflets but be instead involved in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds under physiological conditions. The heat shock factor ( HSF) gene family contains 26 highly conserved members in  S. lycopersicum and plays an important role in high-temperature stress response   71 . The gene coding for the heat shock transcription factor  HSF30 was significantly higher in expression in salt-treated bottom lateral leaflets compared to control ones ( Figure 7 cluster 2 and  Table S2). In  S. chilense,  HSF30 showed a log2 fold change > 5 upon salt stress, thereby confirming its role in salinity tolerance in this wild species   9  3.2.3. Genes Involved in Volatile Emission and Stress Response Genes related to stress signaling/response, more specifically responding to ethylene, a plant hormone mediating several aspects of the (a)biotic stress response ( ERFB1) and belonging to the LEA family ( LEA7) showed a significant upregulation in bottom terminal leaflets compared to top terminal ones under control condition ( Table S2). The dehydrin  TAS14 tended to be induced in salt-treated bottom lateral leaflets ( Figure S4); in tomato,  TAS14 was shown to be induced by salinity and osmotic stress, as well as abscisic acid and its overexpression led to plants capable of withstanding drought and salinity in the long term, without any impact on plant growth under control conditions   62 . Genes implicated in volatile organic compounds’ (VOCs) synthesis ( TPS,  FPS,  IPI) were all expressed at statistically significant higher levels in top lateral leaflets under control condition ( Table S2). Terpene synthase ( TPS) and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase ( FPS) followed a trend towards downregulation by salinity ( Figure S4). These results are in agreement with those reported previously by Zhang and colleagues   43 , who measured a downregulation of volatile emission-related genes under salt stress, while the produced amount of some VOCs, as well as their emission profile, changed with osmotic stress. LEA15 showed a significant increase in expression in bottom lateral leaflets under salt stress ( Table S2). This is in agreement with the reported increased expression of  LEA15 in response to salinity and drought in tomato seedlings   63 . It should be noted that this gene was expressed in both vegetative and reproductive organs of tomato and could thus represent an important gene involved in both physiological and stress-related conditions. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are enzymes catalyzing the key step of lipid peroxidation to produce compounds such as oxylipins, but they are also indicative of membrane damage   68 .  LOXs showed different expression patterns.  LOXA, which was expressed at higher levels in top terminal leaflets rather than bottom terminal ones under control condition, was significantly higher in salt-treated bottom lateral leaflets compared to control ones ( Table S2).  LOXB and  LOXD grouped in another cluster ( Figure 7a) and did not show any statistically significant differences in expression under the experimental conditions studied.  LOXA and  LOXD are involved in a different metabolic pathway, since they are implicated in 9-LOX and 13-LOX synthesis, respectively, which are two molecules related with the response to herbivores   69 . LOX activity was reported to be higher in salt-stressed tomato plants (exposed to 75 mM NaCl) compared to control plants   43 . Similarly,  LOXs expression was induced by salinity and rose with silicon nanoparticles application under salt stress   70 . Superoxide dismutase genes ( SODs) code for proteins involved in the enzymatic response to ROS. Three  SOD genes were here monitored and they all grouped in the first cluster ( Figure 7a). They were expressed at statistically significant higher levels in top lateral leaflets under control and salt stress conditions ( Table S2). Moreover,  SOD3 tended to be induced in lateral and terminal leaflets at the bottom and top under salt stress. Due to their ROS-detoxifying function,  SODs are generally induced by stress   58 , but their increased activity is also a sign of stress alleviation   59 . However, it was previously reported that  SODs are a group of early-responsive genes whose expression shows a peak shortly after stress application due to the occurrence of salt-shock   60 . Therefore, it is legitimate to speculate that  SODs expressions might have been higher if sampling had been performed earlier. Long-term stress application may affect the expression of ion toxicity-related genes rather than osmotic stress-related transcripts   61 . Salt overly sensitive ( SOS) genes are involved in salinity tolerance through the regulation of Na + extrusion from the roots, the active loading of Na + into the xylem and the compartmentalization of Na +/K +   67 . In the present study, however, no significant differences were observed for  SOS1 and  SOS2. The reasons for this can be: 1) the expression of  SOS in Micro-Tom may show significant changes at earlier time-points after salt application, or 2) tissues other than leaflets (i.e., flower, fruits, roots) may show statistically significant differences in expression. The genes coding for late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins accumulated in response to water deficit in many organisms such as tomato, where 27  LEA genes were found and classified in several groups, namely dehydrins,  LEA1,  LEA2,  LEA3,  LEA4,  LEA5 and seed maturation proteins-SMPs   63 . These proteins were shown to have membrane stabilizing and maintenance functions   64 , as well as ion sequestration properties   65 . They were moreover shown to be implicated in general (a)biotic stress response   66 . Both collenchyma and parenchyma lost their regular contours with increasing salt concentrations since the cell walls showed invaginations, giving an overall wrinkly appearance that was particularly evident at 400 mM (see insets in  Figure 4a and the arrows in the inset in d). Additionally, the intercellular spaces increased as a consequence of the cell walls’ invagination (asterisks in the inset in d). The palisade layer in bottom leaflets was normally constituted by a single layer of elongated cells ( Figure 5a). In the bottom leaflets under high salt levels (200 and 400 mM), the palisade cells were smaller and appeared stacked because of constrictions ( Figure 5c,d). Under control conditions, the spongy parenchyma was characterized by scattered cells separated by air spaces ( Figure 5a,e), but it became denser under stress conditions ( Figure 5b–d and  Figure S3), since the intercellular spaces decreased. A marked reduction in intercellular air spaces was also observed in  S. tuberosum and  Arbutus unedo exposed to NaCl   33, 34 : the denser parenchyma affects gas exchanges within the mesophyll and ultimately impacts the conductance of CO 2 with consequences on photosynthetic performance. The results demonstrated that 200 mM NaCl was a concentration allowing the observation of differences in the growth and leaflets’ histology in the timeframe of four weeks. Other important biological parameters, namely the moisture content of shoots, the biomass of shoots and roots, decreased in stressed plants exposed to 200 mM NaCl ( Figure 6). In the light of the differences observed in plants treated with 200 mM NaCl compared to control ones, this salt concentration was chosen for gene expression analysis. The condition of 200 mM NaCl was previously used for textile hemp   35  and the conductivity of the soil treated with this salt concentration was reported to be 5 mS cm −1 (0.8 for the control condition). Therefore, the salinity condition used corresponds to a slightly saline condition (4 < ECe < 8, as reported in   36 ). As such, the concentration used allowed the study of the molecular response of Micro-Tom leaflets to a realistic condition of slightly saline soil environment. 3.1. Effects of Increasing Salt Concentrations on Micro-Tom Leaves and Stems In younger leaflets, stress effects were less severe than in older ones at the concentrations of 100 and 200 mM ( Figure 4e–g), while narrower xylem vessels and a less developed xylem tissues were well visible in young leaflets exposed to 400 mM ( Figure 4h). Younger leaflets have an active primary metabolism involved in expansion and growth, as well as an active reactive oxygen species-ROS scavenging activity counteracting the damages on membranes/lipids/nucleic acids. Older leaves that have ceased to expand and develop and start to senesce are the ones that will be impacted earlier by stress. A remobilization of carbon resources from older to younger leaves is also invoked as a strategy to increase resilience: this mechanism may therefore contribute to maintain the development of younger leaves under stress conditions   32 . The palisade parenchyma of younger leaves ( Figure 5e–h) was regular and tightly packed in a single row independently from the salt concentration, while the intercellular spaces in spongy mesophyll decreased with increasing salt concentration, similarly to bottom leaflets ( Figure 5a–d). Vibratome sections of Micro-Tom stems showed the effects of salt on the vascular tissue.  Figure 3 shows indeed a less developed xylem tissue, an altered thickening of the vascular tissues and a reduction of the vessels’ diameter at the highest concentration. Micro-Tom plants grew slower upon salt stress and were smaller than the control plants watered with tap water ( Figure 1). Plants subjected to 400 mM salt stress showed, as expected, the most severe symptoms: they stopped growing much earlier than the other plants treated with lower concentrations and were starting to wilt when sampled after four weeks of treatment. The stems showed a reduction of the xylem tissue, particularly evident for plants treated with 200 mM NaCl: this observation led to perform a microscopic assessment of the vascular bundle in the central veins of Micro-Tom leaflets at two different stem heights (bottom and top, corresponding to older and younger leaflets). Measures of the xylem vessels’ cell wall thickness revealed non-significant changes ( Figure S2b,d) between control and salt-stressed leaflets, although a significant increase was noticed when comparing 100 vs. 400 mM NaCl in bottom leaflets ( Figure S2b). Sánchez-Aguayo and colleagues showed that salt stress enhanced xylem development by increasing lignification in vascular bundle with a gradually less evident effect in roots, stem and leaves, where leaves were the less affected organs   31 . With an increasing salt concentration, a purple coloration started to develop rapidly in the epidermal layer of the abaxial side of leaves ( Figure 2). Anthocyanins act in stress response by increasing the solute content in the vacuoles thereby lowering the osmotic potential of the leaf   27 . Additionally, it was shown that anthocyanins’ accumulation led to a metabolic shift in leaves with respect to amino acids and non-structural carbohydrates: proline content increased together with starch reserves’ use to provide carbon skeletons required for the synthesis of metabolites involved in osmotic adjustment   28 . The morphology of the leaflets was different between the bottom and the top of the plant, since those located at the top were smaller than the ones sampled at the bottom ( Figure 4). As observed in the stems ( Figure 3), the xylem vessels of bottom leaflets were less developed in plants exposed to increasing concentrations of NaCl: the xylem vessels had smaller lumens’ area at 400 mM compared to control or 100 mM NaCl-treated plants ( Figure 4a–d and  Figure S2a,c). The same effect was observed on hemp leaves, where the impact of salt stress was compared in young and older leaves. In  Cannabis sativa, a reduced number and a smaller diameter of xylem vessels were indeed shown   30 . The reduction of the vessels’ diameter is a common phenomenon among plants that decreases the incidence of cavitation   29 ; the increased thickening of the xylem vessels improves stability by enhancing the mechanical properties of the secondary cell walls.","Salinity is a form of abiotic stress that impacts growth and development in several economically relevant crops and is a top-ranking threat to agriculture, considering the average rise in the sea level caused by global warming. Tomato is moderately sensitive to salinity and shows adaptive mechanisms to this abiotic stressor. A case study on the dwarf tomato model Micro-Tom is here presented in which the response to salt stress (NaCl 200 mM) was investigated to shed light on the changes occurring at the expression level in genes involved in cell wall-related processes, phenylpropanoid pathway, stress response, volatiles' emission and secondary metabolites' production. In particular, the response was analyzed by sampling older/younger leaflets positioned at different stem heights (top and bottom of the stem) and locations along the rachis (terminal and lateral) with the goal of identifying the most responsive one(s). Tomato plants cv. Micro-Tom responded to increasing concentrations of NaCl (0-100-200-400 mM) by reducing the leaf biomass, stem diameter and height. Microscopy revealed stronger effects on leaves sampled at the bottom and the expression analysis identified clusters of genes expressed preferentially in older or younger leaflets. Stress-related genes displayed a stronger induction in lateral leaflets sampled at the bottom. In conclusion, in tomato cv. Micro-Tom subjected to salt stress, the bottom leaflets showed stronger stress signs and response, while top leaflets were less impacted by the abiotic stressor and had an increased expression of cell wall-related genes involved in expansion."," 'Cell wall', 'Microscopy', 'Salinity', 'Qpcr', 'Leaflets', 'Phenylpropanoid Pathway', 'Tomato Cultivar Micro-tom' "," 'salt stress', 'Figure', 'lateral leaflets', 'leaflets', 'bottom lateral', 'stress', 'salt', 'bottom', 'terminal leaflets', 'genes' "," ’, heat shock proteins, ’s, XET/ XTH, xyloglucan endo-transglucosylase/hydrolase, xyloglucan chains, “, ”, fasciclin-like arabinogalactan, xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase, expansins, FLAs, XTHs, xyloglucan endo-transglucosylase, XET, rejoin xyloglucan chains, xyloglucan endo-hydrolase, XEH, PAL, 4CL, class I, class II   47, heat shock factor, HSF, salt-treated bottom lateral leaflets, ERFB1, LEA7, dehydrin  , abscisic acid, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, LEA15, LOXs, LOXs, salt-treated bottom lateral leaflets, LOX, LOXs, Superoxide dismutase, SODs, Salt, SOS, CO 2, ’, −1, Salt, Sánchez-Aguayo, epidermal layer, ’ "," 'TPS,', 'TPS)' "," 'S.', 'S.', 'ROS.', 'S.'

23,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6418210/eupmc_result.json,PMC6418210,"Results Lipid metabolism analysis of cold-stored tomato fruit In total, two metabolites and 12 DEGs were involved in fatty acid metabolism pathway (Fig.  6, Supplementary Table  S6). The contents of two saturated fatty acids, palmitic acid and stearic acid, were reduced in the cold-stressed fruit after 7 days storage. Intriguingly, stearic acid content increased after 14 days cold storage. Five fatty acids synthesis genes, including two acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 genes ( ACC1, EC: 6.3.4.14), one malonyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase gene ( MCAT, EC: 2.3.1.39) and two 3-oxoacyl- acyl-carrier-protein  reductase genes ( OAR, EC: 1.1.1.100), had increased expression levels in the cold-stressed tomato fruit at all four storage stages. This result indicates that cold stress can increase the synthesis of fatty acids in tomato fruit. Two other genes involved in the fatty acid elongation process (from 16* to 18*) were successfully mapped 17. One gene called very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA reductase 1 ( KCR, EC: 1.1.1.330) was down-regulated while another gene called very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase-like ( ECR, EC: 1.3.1.93) were up-regulated in tomato fruit at all four cold treatment stages. Moreover, acyl- acyl-carrier-protein  desaturase gene ( ACPD, EC: 1.14.19.2) and oleoyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase gene ( OTE, EC: 3.1.2.14) were down-regulated at all four cold treatment stages. These results indicated that cold stress may inhibit the transformation of saturated fatty acid to unsaturated fatty acid in tomato fruit. Amino acid metabolism analysis of cold-stored tomato fruit For amino acid metabolism, 6 DEGs and 5 differential amino acids were involved in the schematic network (Fig.  5, Supplementary Table  S6). Alanine and leucine had increased contents in cold-stressed fruit at 14 and 21 days storage, and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT, EC: 2.6.1.2) and branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase ( BcAT, EC: 2.6.1.42) had higher expression levels in cold-stored fruit. The higher expression of  ALT and  BcAT genes induced by cold stress may improve the synthesis of alanine and leucine in fruit, respectively. The serine content was also increased in cold stressed fruit at 7 days storage, and the expression of threonine ammonia lyase ( TAL, EC: 4.3.1.19) was decreased in the fruit. The result indicates that cold stress can suppress the expression of  TAL gene, thus potentially leading to an increase in the accumulation of serine in cold stress fruit. Moreover, proline content was decreased only at 14 days storage and stayed constant at 7, 21 and 28 days storage in cold-stressed fruit. Cold treatment entails extensive transcriptome reprogramming KEGG annotation suggested that photosynthesis pathways (15 DEGs), the biosynthesis of amino acids (23 DEGs) and the pentose phosphate pathway (8 DEGs) were induced after cold treatment in tomato fruit (Supplementary Fig.  S1). On the other hand, fatty acid elongation (6 DEGs), arginine and proline metabolism (9 DEGs) and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism (13 DEGs) were significantly depressed in cold stress (Supplementary Fig.  S1). RNA-Seq was performed to obtain a global view of the transcriptome of cold-treated tomato fruit from 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of low temperature treatment. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cold-stored fruit and room temperature stored fruit in each time stage were analyzed to identify the genes that respond to cold stress. A Venn diagram showed that 1735 DEGs were down-regulated and 1369 were up-regulated at each of the five storage stages, which were selected for further analysis (Fig.  2A). These DEGs were useful indicators to identify candidate genes for further in-depth analyses by qRT-PCR. Twenty-two out of 23 genes involved in sugar, amino acids and lipids metabolism, except Solyc02g088680.1 (UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase 2), showed similar expression patterns by RNA-Seq assay (Fig.  2B, Supplementary Table  S2). The results also indicated that the data from the RNA-Seq were reproducible and reliable. The DEGs were used for Gene Oncology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. Interestingly, GO and KEGG analysis indicated a different metabolism network may exist after cold treatment since there were no coinciding GO and KEGG term for down and up-regulated DEGs. GO analysis identified 4 significant terms related with chloroplast and 11 DEGs related with photosynthesis that were up-regulated, which indicated that cold treatment tomato fruit still maintain the function of chloroplast (Table  1, Supplementary Table  S3). GO terms was significantly enriched for down-regulated DEGs, integral component of membrane (212 DEGs), plasma membrane (47 DEGs), cell wall organization (14 DEGs), cell wall biogenesis (7 DEGs) as well as plant-type cell wall (13 DEGs) (Table  2, Supplementary Table  S4) indicating that cold stress potentially affects membrane and cell wall functioning. Moreover, 24 DEGs involving in calcium binding and 8 DEGs related with calcium-dependent kinase activity were down-regulated, which showed that cold stress decreased the calcium-dependent signal transductions process (Table  2, Supplementary Table  S4). To have a broader view of all DEGs, Mapman analysis was used for the metabolism overview (Fig.  3, Supplementary Table  S5). Similar to the GO and KEGG analysis, genes related to cell wall and lipid metabolism have decreased expression levels, whereas genes involved in Calvin cycle and light reactions pathway have increased expression levels after cold treatment in tomato fruit. Cold storage changes the metabolites profiles in tomato fruit Cherry tomato fruit in the breaker developmental stage were stored at low temperature (4 °C) and room temperature (25 °C) for 28 days. The tomato fruit exhibited typical chilling injury symptoms. Tomato fruit stored at 4 °C (Fig.  1A) delayed the maturation process and 50% of the tomato fruit exhibited skin pitting when storage was continued at 25 °C for 3 days, mimicking the 28 days 4 °C shelf selling storage condition. To investigate metabolic changes during cold storage, metabolite profiling was analyzed by using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. For the analysis, the tomato fruit were chosen after 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of low temperature treatment. Cold-stored fruit with significantly different metabolites content, including 7 amino acids, 27 organic acids, 16 sugars and 22 other compounds (Fig.  1B, Supplementary Table  S1) from each storage stage were selected for further analysis. Cluster analysis showed these metabolites were divided into 6 groups based on their content pattern. In group I metabolites were induced at 14 days of treatment, while in group II the metabolites showed an opposite pattern that was suppressed at 14 days of treatment. The metabolites were inhibited at 7 days in group III. The content was suppressed at 7 days and induced at 14 days of treatment for metabolites in group IV. Most of the metabolites in group V and VI had significantly different contents during long term storage of 14, 21 and 28 days, and the metabolites were significantly induced at 21 days in group VI. It is interesting that the contents of butanedioic acid and citrate were continually induced by cold temperature at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. However, glucaric acid and pyroglutamic acid showed an opposite pattern of gradually decreasing at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days cold treatment. Co-expression analysis of DEGs involved in sugar, organic acid, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism In an attempt to validate whether the DEGs in each metabolism network were “hub genes”, co-expression analysis was performed between the selected genes and other genes involved in the network. Hub genes are genes that have high centralities and play a crucial role in a network. A total of 57 tomato gene annotations involved in sugar and organic acid, amino acid as well as fatty acid schematic pathway were selected for co-expression analysis (Supplementary Fig.  S2). In the sugar and organic acid metabolism network, 7 genes were found to be significantly co-related with  ACS (EC: 2.3.3.8, Solyc05g005160.2, Solyc01g059880.2) and 1 gene was significantly co-related with  IDH (EC: 1.1.1.42, Solyc01g005560.2), indicating an important role of ACS in response to cold stress in tomato fruit. In amino acid metabolism, 3 genes were co-related with  ALT (EC: 2.6.1.2, Solyc06g063090.2) and 1 gene was co-related with  BcAT (EC: 2.6.1.42, Solyc03g043880.2). In lipids metabolism, the  ACC1 (EC: 6.3.4.14, Solyc01g008330.2),  MCAT (EC: 2.3.1.39, Solyc01g006980.2) and  FabG (EC: 1.1.1.100, Solyc06g071910.2) were significantly co-related, indicating a cooperation of fatty acids synthesis in cold-treated tomato fruit. Sugar and organic acid metabolism analysis of cold-stored tomato fruit Based on transcriptome and metabolome data, a schematic sugar and organic acid metabolism network was built with differential metabolites and DEGs (Fig.  4, Supplementary Table  S6). In total, 13 metabolites and 27 DEGs were involved in the network. In the TCA cycle, the contents of citrate, butanedioic acid, cis-aconitate and succinate were increased, which were consistent with the expression of ATP-citrate synthase ( ACS, EC: 2.3.3.8) and isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH, EC: 1.1.1.42) genes at all four cold treatment stages in tomato fruit. The result indicates cold stress promote the expression of  ACS and  IDH genes, thus may increase the synthesis of citrate, butanedioic acid, cis-aconitate and succinate. Besides, malate content showed another pattern: increasing in cold-stored fruit at 7 days and decreasing thereafter. Oxalic acid content was relatively lower in cold-treated fruit at 7 and 21 days storage and higher at 14 days storage. The glucose content was decreased at 14 days storage and increased at 7, 21 and 28 days storage of cold-treated fruit. The expression level of hexokinase ( HXK1, EC: 2.7.1.1) was induced at all four cold treatment stages in tomato fruit. Ribose and sedoheptulose had higher contents in cold-treated fruit at 14 and 21 days storage, and transketolase ( TKT, EC: 2.2.1.1), ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase ( RPE, EC: 5.1.3.1), and probable ribose-5-phosphate isomerase 2 ( RPI2, EC: 5.3.1.6) genes also had higher expression levels in cold-stored fruit. The result demonstrated that cold stress increases the expression of  TKT,  RPE and  PRI2 genes, thus may improve the accumulation of ribose and sedoheptulose in tomato fruit.","Tomato fruit are especially susceptible to chilling injury (CI) when continuously exposed to temperatures below 12 °C. In this study, integrative comparative analyses of transcriptomics and metabolomics data were performed to uncover the regulatory network in CI tomato fruit. Metabolite profiling analysis found that 7 amino acids, 27 organic acids, 16 of sugars and 22 other compounds had a significantly different content while transcriptomics data showed 1735 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were down-regulated and 1369 were up-regulated in cold-stored fruit. We found that the contents of citrate, cis-aconitate and succinate were increased, which were consistent with the expression of ATP-citrate synthase (ACS) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes in cold-treated tomato fruit. Cold stress promotes the expression of ACS and IDH which may increase the synthesis of citrate, cis-aconitate and succinate. Alanine and leucine had increased contents, which may result from alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BcAT)'s high expression levels, respectively.

24,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC8222033/eupmc_result.json,PMC8222033,"Results Production of mono and sesquiterpenes in type-VI trichomes under different allelic dosages at the  SsT2 locus The concentration of all plastid-derived sesquiterpenes α-bergamotene, α-santalene, exo-α-bergamotene, epi-β-santalene, and endo-β-bergamotene was higher in the homozygous  Sst2/ Sst2 type-VI trichomes when compared to the trichomes of hemizygous  sst2/ Sst2 plants, indicating that these compounds are under the effect of allelic dosage (Fig.  3). To investigate how the allelic dosage at the  SsT2 locus affects the levels of mono and sesquiterpenes in type-VI trichomes, we compared homozygous  Sst2/ Sst2, heterozygous  sst2/ Sst2 plants, as well as the control MT ( sst2/ sst2). The molecular markers used for genotype selection were designed based on polymorphisms found in the genomic sequence of cultivated tomato and LA1777 (Table S1). Note that there is no complete synteny between the  SsT2 locus of  S. lycopersicum, and  S. habrochaites. Hence, at this locus,  S. lycopersicum contains the functional genes  SlTPS18,  SlTPS19,  SlTPS20,  SlTPS21,  SlTPS41 and  SlNDPS1, whereas  S. habrochaites contains the functional genes  ShTPS18,  ShTPS20,  ShTPS45 ( SBS) and  zFPS (Matsuba et al.  2013). Thus, the  sst2/Sst2 plants can be better considered hemizygous for both sets of genes from each parental. As predicted, the monoterpenes 2-carene, α-phellandrene and β-phellandrene and D-limonene were absent in the type-VI trichomes of homozygous  Sst2/Sst2 plants, since they lack the  SlNDPS1 and  SlTPS20 genes due to the introgression of the  S. habrochaites chromosomal segment correspondent to the  SsT2 locus. There was no significant effect of allelic dosage for  SlNDPS1 and  SlTPS20 when comparing monoterpene content of the hemizygous  sst2/Sst2 plants and the homozygous ( sst2/sst2) MT control (Fig.  3). Regarding the concentration of cytosolic-derived sesquiterpenes β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, which are encoded by the  SsT1 locus, the hemizygous  sst2/Sst2 plants did not differ from the control MT ( sst2/sst2) (Fig.  3). Production of the sesquiterpenes α-santalene, α-bergamotene and β-bergamotene in the Micro-Tom line harboring the  S. habrochaites SsT2 locus We also noted that the concentration of the cytosolic-derived sesquiterpene α-humulene was higher in MT- Sst2 when compared to the control MT. The TPS12 responsible for the production of β-caryophyllene and α-humulene is encoded by a gene in the  SsT1 locus on chromosome 6, which is outside of the region introgressed. Therefore, the  TPS12 in the  SsT1 locus is likely to have the same alleles for both genotypes and it could not be the cause of the higher amount of α-humulene in MT- Sst2. Besides, we did not find the same increase in β-caryophyllene. Since α-humulene coelutes with endo-β-bergamotene (Hoeven et al.  2000) (Fig.  2a, peaks 9 and 10), we tried to improve the separation of both endo-β-bergamotene and α-humulene. After our attempt we still found a small overlap of α-humulene with peak 9 (endo-β-bergamotene) (Fig.  2c, peaks 9 and 10), but the separation was sufficient to distinguish endo-β-bergamotene from α-humulene. Consequently, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene in MT- Sst2 did not differ statistically from MT plants. To confirm the presence of the  S. habrochaites sesquiterpene pathway in the MT- Sst2 line, we performed Gas-chromatography Mass-Spectrometry (GC–MS) analyses on isolated type-VI trichome glands. The type-VI trichomes of the MT- Sst2 line not only accumulated α-santalene, α-bergamotene and β-bergamotene, but also produced higher amounts of these specific compounds, compared to the parental  S. habrochaites LA1777 (Fig.  2a–d, peaks 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9). As expected, the monoterpenes found in the MT parental (2-carene, α-phellandrene and β-phellandrene and D-limonene) were not detected in LA1777 and in the MT- Sst2 line (Fig.  2a–d, peaks 1, 2 and 3). Since these plastid-derived monoterpenes are associated to the presence of the  SlTPS20 genes on  S. lycopersicum chromosome 8, it was predicted that homozygous MT- Sst2 plants would replace them by the plastid-derived sesquiterpenes coded by  S. habrochaitesTPS genes introgressed on the same chromosomal region. Indeed, the MT- Sst2 line produced the plastid-derived sesquiterpenes, α-bergamotene, α-santalene, exo-α-bergamotene, epi-β-santalene, and endo-β-bergamotene, also present in  S. habrochaites LA1777 but not in MT (Fig.  2a–d). Although we found high levels of plastid-derived sesquiterpenes in the MT- Sst2 line, we did not detect any santalenoic and bergamotenoic acids derivatives, as in the wild species (Fig.  2a–d, peaks 14–16). As expected, no α-santalene, α-bergamotene, β-bergamotene and their acid derivatives were present in control MT trichomes (Fig.  2a–e). Introgression of  SsT2 gene cluster from  S. habrochaites LA1777 into  S. lycopersicum cv. Micro-Tom (MT) Additionally, we analyzed the relative transcript levels of  zFPS and  SBS by quantitative RT-PCR in trichomes of MT- Sst2 and  S. habrochaites LA1777. Both genes were indeed expressed in MT- Sst2, but transcripts levels were significantly lower in MT- Sst2 compared to the wild parental (Fig.  1d). To introduce the plastid-derived sesquiterpene pathway into the Micro-Tom (MT) cultivar, we crossed  S. habrochaites LA1777 with a MT line harboring the  lutescent 1 mutation (MT- l1) and used it as a recurrent parental (Fig.  1a, b). Both the  lutescent 1 mutation (Liu et al.  2021) and the  SsT2 locus map at the short arm of the chromosome 8 (Tanksley et al.  1992; Sallaud et al.  2009). The  lutescent 1 phenotype comprises a premature and progressive yellowing of the leaves due to impaired chlorophyll accumulation (starting from the base of the plant) (Fig.  1a), a lack of chlorophyll accumulation in the pistils (Fig.  1a) and whitish-yellow fruits (Barry et al.  2012). This allowed us to introgress the  S. habrochaites SsT2 locus into MT by a relatively easy visual selection of the progeny. In each generation of introgression, we selected for plants not presenting the  lutescent 1 phenotype, which implies the presence of the equivalent chromosome segment of  S. habrochaites containing the  SsT2 locus. In the F 2 generation, plants not harboring the  lutescent 1 mutation were used for backcrossing (BC) with MT- l1. This procedure was repeated in the BC 1 and subsequent generations. After six BC generations and self-pollination (BC 6F 2) using the visual marker, we employed CAPS markers based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for a genetic screen for homozygous plants harboring the  SsT2 locus from the wild species. In the BC 6F 3 generation and generations thereafter (BC 6F n), the obtained plants were considered a near-isogenic line (NIL), no longer segregating for the presence of the wild sesquiterpenes pathway and other traits. The NIL was named MT- Sesquiterpene synthase 2 (MT- Sst2). We employed CAPS markers to determine the size of the fragment introgressed into the MT background. Genetic mapping positioned the introgressed region between  Solyc08g005020 and  Solyc08g007130 on the top of chromosome 8 (Fig.  1c). The introgressed region overlaps with the mapping position of  SsT2 previously reported (Sallaud et al.  2009), which also confirmed that both  zFPS and  SBS genes were mapped to this region, and it is furthermore consistent with the  SsT2 locus described (Hoeven et al.  2000). It is worth noting, however, that the genotype used by Hoeven et al. ( 2000) and Sallaud et al. ( 2009) contain more than one chromosomal segment introgressed. The NIL MT- Sst2 produced here is more adequate for comparative studies since it has only a relatively small chromosomal segment introgressed in chromosome 8. Herbivore resistance of the Micro-Tom line with increased amounts of α-santalene, α-bergamotene and β-bergamotene Finally, we conducted a bioassay with western flower thrips ( Frankliniella occidentalis) comparing adult survival on MT, MT- Sst2 and the wild species. No significant differences in survival or egg hatching were observed as a result of the  Sst2 introgression (Fig.  5c). Female thrips were still able to oviposit on both genotypes and the larvae hatched from the eggs reaching the larval stage. Conversely, significant reductions in the number of surviving adults and the number of emerged larvae were observed for the wild species. To verify if the increase in plastid-derived sesquiterpenes in type-VI trichomes of MT- Sst2 would result in improved resistance to piercing-sucking pests, we conducted no-choice bioassays using four relevant pests in tomato. In the whitefly bioassay, survival of whiteflies did not differ between MT- Sst2 and MT plants, whereas LA1777 displayed a high reduction in the survival of this pest. Almost 80% of the whiteflies survived on MT- Sst2, whereas less than 40% survived on the wild tomato species (Fig.  5a). Next, bioassays using the defense-suppressing spider mite  Tetranychus evansi and the defense-inducing spider mite  Tetranychus urticae were performed. Both MT and MT- Sst2 showed 100% of both spider mites species surviving, whereas on  S. habrochaites LA1777 only approximately 20% of  T. evansi and 40% of  T. urticae survived after 2 days (Fig.  5b). Oviposition rates of both spider mite species were equal on MT- Sst2 and MT leaf disks, as they were strongly reduced in the wild species (Fig.  5b). Trichome abundance and morphology in the Micro-Tom line harboring the  S. habrochaites genes in the  SsT2 locus We also observed that  S. habrochaites LA1777 had a high density of type-IV trichomes (Fig.  4c). Type-IV trichomes were previously associated with increased production of acylsugars providing resistance to insect pests in wild species (Simmons and Gurr  2005). Type-IV trichomes were however absent on adult leaves of MT and MT- Sst2. Type-V is the most abundant non-glandular trichome found on MT and MT- Sst2. Interestingly, we found an increased number of (non-glandular) type-V trichomes on both leaf surfaces in MT- Sst2. Approximately two-fold more type-V trichomes were observed on the adaxial leaf surface of MT- Sst2 compared to MT (Fig.  4c). We next verified if the locus substitution caused changes in abundance of different trichome types and the morphology of type-VI trichomes in adult leaves of the MT- Sst2 line. We analyzed the gland and internal cavity size of the type-VI glandular trichomes (Fig.  4a, b). There was no significant difference between MT and MT- Sst2 gland size, which were much smaller than that of LA1777. However, the size of the internal cavity increased in MT- Sst2 compared to MT. The introgression line also appeared to exhibit an increase in stalk length compared to MT, but still the stalk and the gland cavity were smaller than that of LA1777 type-VI trichomes (Fig.  4a, b). The majority of glandular trichomes found in MT and MT- Sst2 was type VI. The density of type-VI trichomes were not altered in MT- Sst2 compared to MT for both adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces (Fig.  4c). The wild species showed significantly higher numbers of type-VI trichome on the adaxial and fewer numbers on the abaxial leaf surface."," Main conclusion Cultivated tomatoes harboring the plastid-derived sesquiterpenes from S. habrochaites have altered type-VI trichome morphology and unveil additional genetic components necessary for piercing-sucking pest resistance. Arthropod resistance in the tomato wild relative Solanum habrochaites LA1777 is linked to specific sesquiterpene biosynthesis. The Sesquiterpene synthase 2 (SsT2) gene cluster on LA1777 chromosome 8 controls plastid-derived sesquiterpene synthesis. The main genes at SsT2 are Z-prenyltransferase (zFPS) and Santalene and Bergamotene Synthase (SBS), which produce α-santalene, β-bergamotene, and α-bergamotene in LA1777 round-shaped type-VI glandular trichomes. Cultivated tomatoes have mushroom-shaped type-VI trichomes with much smaller glands that contain low levels of monoterpenes and cytosolic-derived sesquiterpenes, not presenting the same pest resistance as in LA1777. We successfully transferred zFPS and SBS from LA1777 to cultivated tomato (cv. Micro-Tom, MT) by a backcrossing approach. The trichomes of the MT-Sst2 introgressed line produced high levels of the plastid-derived sesquiterpenes. The type-VI trichome internal storage-cavity size increased in MT-Sst2, probably as an effect of the increased amount of sesquiterpenes, although it was not enough to mimic the round-shaped LA1777 trichomes. The presence of high amounts of plastid-derived sesquiterpenes was also not sufficient to confer resistance to various tomato piercing-sucking pests, indicating that the effect of the sesquiterpenes found in the wild S. habrochaites can be insect specific. Our results provide for a better understanding of the morphology of S. habrochaites type-VI trichomes and paves the way to obtain insect-resistant tomatoes."," 'Glandular trichome', 'terpenes', 'Introgressed line', 'Santalene', 'Tomato Trichome', 'Bergamotene', 'Piercing-sucking Pest' "," 'Fig.', 'trichomes', 'type-VI trichomes', 'locus', 'habrochaites', 'plants', 'sesquiterpenes', 'line', 'type-VI', 'wild' "," Sst2 type-VI, Sst2, Sst2, MT, sst2/ sst2, LA1777 (Table S1, β-phellandrene, SlNDPS1, cytosolic-derived sesquiterpenes, MT ( sst2/sst2), β-bergamotene, cytosolic-derived, MT- Sst2, MT, β-caryophyllene, MT- Sst2, MT- Sst2, MT, MT, β-phellandrene, Sst2 line, MT- Sst2, habrochaitesTPS, Sst2, α-bergamotene, MT (, bergamotenoic acids, MT trichomes, –e, MT, MT- Sst2, MT line, MT-, MT, MT-, BC 6F 2, CAPS, BC 6F 3, MT- Sesquiterpene synthase 2, MT- Sst2, CAPS, MT, NIL MT- Sst2, MT, MT- Sst2, MT- Sst2, MT- Sst2, MT, LA1777, MT, MT- Sst2, MT- Sst2, type-IV trichomes, MT, MT- Sst2, MT, MT- Sst2, MT- Sst2, MT, MT- Sst2, MT, MT, LA1777 type-VI, MT, MT- Sst2, type VI, MT- Sst2, MT "," 'SlTPS18,', 'SlTPS19,', 'SlTPS20,', 'SlTPS21,', 'SlTPS41', 'ShTPS18,', 'ShTPS20,', 'ShTPS45', 'SlTPS20', 'SlTPS20', 'TPS12', 'TPS12', 'SlTPS20', 'habrochaitesTPS' "," 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.'

Maize is cultivated as a staple crop worldwide, and insect feeding causes large production losses. Despite its importance in agriculture, little is known about how maize reacts to insect herbivory. Taking advantage of advances in sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, we studied the response of maize to mechanical wounding and simulated Mythimna separata (a specialist insect) herbivory by applying its oral secretions (OS) to wounds. In comparison to the responses induced by mechanical wounding, OS elicited larger and longer-lasting changes in the maize transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and phytohormones. Specifically, many genes, proteins and metabolites were uniquely induced or repressed by OS. Nearly 290 transcription factor genes from 39 families were involved in OS-induced responses, and among these, more transcription factor genes were specifically regulated by OS than by wounding. This study provides a large-scale omics dataset for understanding maize response to chewing insects and highlights the essential role of OS in plant-insect interactions."," 'Proteome', 'Transcriptome', 'metabolome', 'phytohormones' ",  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,NaN

In this study, we exposed the constitutive terpene emitter,  Solanum. lycopersicum  leaves to mild (37 and 41 °C), moderate (46 °C) and severe (49 °C) heat ramps of 5 min. and monitored foliage photosynthetic activity, lipoxygenase pathway volatile (LOX), and mono- and sesquiterpene emissions and expression of two terpene synthase genes, β-phellandrene synthase and ( E )-β-caryophyllene/α-humulene synthase, through a 24 h recovery period upon return to pre-stress conditions. Leaf monoterpene emissions were dominated by β-phellandrene and sesquiterpene emissions by ( E )-β-caryophyllene, and thus, these two terpene synthase genes were representative for the two volatile terpene classes. Photosynthetic characteristics partly recovered under moderate heat stress, and very limited recovery was observed under severe stress. All stress treatments resulted in elicitation of LOX emissions that declined during recovery. Enhanced mono- and sesquiterpene emissions were observed immediately after the heat treatment, but the emissions decreased even to below the control treatment during recovery between 2-10 h, and raised again by 24 h. The expression of β-phellandrene and ( E )-β-caryophyllene synthase genes decreased between 2-10 h after heat stress, and recovered to pre-stress level in mild heat stress treatment by 24 h. Overall, this study demonstrates a highly sensitive heat response of terpenoid synthesis that is mainly controlled by gene level responses under mild stress, while severe stress leads to non-recoverable declines in foliage physiological and gene expression activities."," 'Heat stress', 'Β-phellandrene', 'Recovery Kinetics', 'Monoterpene Emission', '(E)-β-caryophyllene', 'Sesquiterpene Emission', 'Terpenoid Synthase Expression' ",  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,NaN
27,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7497057/eupmc_result.json,PMC7497057,"RESULTS Functional characterization of class II diTPSs from  S. italica To biochemically analyze the predicted TPS activities we focused on the  S. italica TPS family on account of the agricultural relevance of this species. Enzyme functional studies were conducted via  in vivo combinatorial expression assays using  Nicotiana benthamiana or  Escherichia coli as platforms (Zerbe  et al.,  2013; Kitaoka  et al.,  2015a), dependent on the relative activity of individual TPS candidates in each host system. Consistent with their predicted activity as CPP synthases, expression of the class II diTPSs SiTPS9, SiTPS34 and SiTPS35 in  N. benthamiana showed that these three enzymes produced CPP as compared to the authentic product of the maize  ent‐CPP synthase, ZmAn2 (Harris  et al.,  2005) (Figure  2a). To verify the stereochemistry of the respective CPP products, each enzyme was further co‐expressed with class I diTPSs specific to CPP of  ent‐ or normal (+)‐stereochemistry, represented by an  ent‐kaurene synthase from  Grindelia robusta (GrEKS) (Zerbe  et al.,  2013) converting  ent‐CPP into  ent‐kaurene and a class I diTPS from  Marrubium vulgare, MvELS, that converts (+)‐CPP into miltiradiene (Zerbe  et al.,  2014). This modular co‐expression approach revealed that SiTPS34 and SiTPS35 showed coupled activity only with GrEKS, identifying both enzymes as  ent‐CPP synthases (Figure  2b). Conversely, SiTPS9 showed activity only in the pairwise reaction with MvELS, verifying the SiTPS9 product as (+)‐CPP (Figure  2c). Small quantities of  ent‐kaurene observed in the product profiles of SiTPS34 and SiTPS35 probably result from the activity of endogenous  ent‐kaurene synthases in  N. benthamiana (Zerbe  et al.,  2013) . Expression of SiTPS6 in  N. benthamiana did not yield detectable products. However, the use of  E. coli co‐expression assays revealed that SiTPS6 produced  syn‐CPP as verified by comparison with the product of the rice  syn‐CPP synthase, OsCPS4, and characteristic product mass ions of  m/ z 192 and 177 (Xu  et al.,  2004) (Figure  2d). Mass spectra of enzyme products are given in Figure  S4. Identification of TPS candidates To identify the  S. italica TPS gene family , we mined publicly available genome data (v.2.2;  https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov) using BLAST analysis against a curated protein database of known plant TPSs (Zerbe  et al.,  2013). A total of 39 genes with best matches to known TPSs were identified, of which 32 represented full‐length sequences (Table  S1 in the online Supporting Information). Most TPS genes mapped to  S. italica chromosomes 1, 6 and 7, whereas no TPS genes were located on chromosomes 4 and 5 (Table  S2). Next, analysis of signature sequence motifs and phylogenetic comparison with TPSs from related monocot crops were used to functionally categorize the identified gene candidates. The presence of the catalytic DxDD motif and lack of a DDxxD motif characteristic for class I catalysis, combined with a close phylogenetic relationship to known TPSs of the TPS‐c clade, supported class II diTPS activity for SiTPS6, SiTPS9, SiTPS34 and SiTPS35 (Figures  1a,  S1 and S2). Specifically, SiTPS34 and SiTPS35 clustered most closely with characterized  ent‐copalyl pyrophosphate (CPP) synthases of general metabolism (e.g.  Z. mays ANTHER EAR 1, ZmAn1) or specialized metabolism (e.g.  Z. mays ANTHER EAR 2, ZmAn2), respectively, and contained the catalytic His–Asn dyad conserved among  ent‐CPP synthases involved in GA biosynthesis (Harris  et al.,  2005; Köksal  et al.,  2014; Potter  et al.,  2014; Lemke  et al.,  2019), suggesting related functionalities (Figures  1a and  S1). By contrast, SiTPS6 and SiTPS9 lacked the His–Asn motif, and phylogenetic analysis placed both enzymes with class II diTPSs of specialized metabolism, such as the maize 8,13‐CPP synthase ZmCPS4 and the wheat (+)‐CPP synthase TaCPS2 (Wu  et al.,  2012; Murphy  et al.,  2018) (Figures  1a and  S1). The remaining 28 TPS candidates were designated as putative class I TPSs on account of the presence of only the conserved C‐terminal DDxxD motif (Figure  S2). Of these TPSs, five clustered with diTPSs of the TPS‐e/f clade (Figure  1a). A close phylogenetic relationship of SiTPS28 and SiTPS29 to ZmTPS1, ZmKSL3 and ZmKSL5 indicated possible  ent‐kaurene synthase activity for the encoded enzymes. This is further supported by the presence of a catalytic isoleucine residue previously shown to be conserved among  ent‐kaurene synthases (Xu  et al.,  2007a; Jia and Peters,  2016) (Figure  S2). By contrast, SiTPS5, SiTPS8 and SiTPS13 were most closely related to class I diTPSs of known functions in specialized metabolism (Figure  1a). Notably, SiTPS5 and SiTPS8 clustered on a separate branch distant from other specialized diTPSs. In addition, SiTPS8 was the only  S. italica diTPS candidate featuring the βα‐bi‐domain architecture more commonly present in mono‐ and sesqui‐TPSs. Similar bi‐domain diTPS have also been discovered in a range of other plant species including wheat and switchgrass (Hillwig  et al.,  2011; Zhou  et al.,  2012; Pelot  et al.,  2018). However, SiTPS8 does not phylogenetically cluster with the respective bi‐domain diTPSs from wheat (TaKSL5; Hillwig  et al.,  2011) and switchgrass (PvKS3/4; Pelot  et al.,  2018) (Figure  1a). Outside the TPS‐e/f clade, SiTPS1 and SiTPS2 were placed with members of the TPS‐g clade that predominantly contains class I TPSs producing acyclic terpenes (Gao  et al.,  2018). The remaining 23 class I TPS candidates were assigned to the TPS‐a2 clade comprising monocot sesqui‐TPSs (Figure  1a). Putative functions of these TPSs in sesquiterpenoid metabolism were further supported by the absence of the N‐terminal RRx 8W motif characteristic of mono‐TPSs and the lack of plastidial transit peptides in at least 19 of the identified TPS candidates. Close phylogenetic relationships of several  S. italica TPS candidates with known sesqui‐TPSs from related monocot species, such as maize and switchgrass, suggested similar sesqui‐TPS activities (Schnee  et al.,  2002; Köllner  et al.,  2008a; Köllner  et al.,  2008b, Köllner  et al.,  2009; Muchlinski  et al.,  2019). Having identified gene candidates for the  S. italica TPS family, we next applied the same strategy to identify related TPS genes in the wild ancestor  S. viridis. Consistent with the close evolutionary relationship between both species (Huang  et al.,  2016), the  S. viridis genome (v.1.1;  https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov) contains 34 putative full‐length TPS genes. High protein sequence identities of 86–100% between these genes and their respective  S. italica homologs. with the majority of amino acid variation occurring in regions outside the predicted active site domains, suggested identical or closely related catalytic activities of the TPSs in these two species (Figure  S3). To further examine the evolutionary interrelations of the  S. italica and  S. viridis TPS families with TPSs in closely related diploid poaceous species, including maize, rice, sorghum,  Panicum hallii (diploid relative of the allotetraploid  Panicum virgatum) and  Brachypodium distachyon, gene synteny studies were conducted (Figure  1b,c, Table  S3). Comparison of the syntenic orthologs across the respective genomes demonstrated that, with the exception of  SiTPS19,  SiTPS26 and  SiTPS31, all  S. italica TPS loci had syntenic orthologs on  S. viridis chromosomes. The degree of syntenic ortholog conservation for  S. italica TPS candidates on other genomes varied, with 53% to  P. hallii, 38% to  B. distachyon, 59% to rice, 59% to sorghum and 50% to maize (Table  S3). Of the 32  S. italica TPS candidates, 13 TPS syntenic networks were conserved across almost all genomes analyzed in this study (Figure  1b,c, Table  S3). Of the five conserved  diTPS syntenic networks, those originating from  S. italica genes ( SiTPS29 and  SiTPS34) were observed among the genomes of all species, whereas  SiTPS6 and  SiTPS9 were common to all but the  B. distachyon genome and  SiTPS28 was common to all but the  O. sativa genome (Figure  1b). Similarly, among the eight conserved  S. italica class I TPS syntenic networks,  SiTPS1,  SiTPS21,  SiTPS25 and  SiTPS38 showed gene synteny across all investigated genomes, while  SiTPS12 and  SiTPS17 lacked syntenic orthologs only in the genome of  B. distachyon, and  SiTPS15 and  SiTPS18 lacked syntenic orthologs only in the genome of  Sorghum bicolor or  Z. mays, respectively (Figure  1c). All 13 of these TPS syntenic networks were highly conserved among the genomes of  S. italica and  S. viridis, whereas 11 were conserved between the genomes of  S. italica and  P. hallii, consistent with their close evolutionary relatedness. Syntenic TPS networks on  S. italica chromosomes 3, 6, 7 and 9 are mostly conserved on the respective homologous chromosomes 3, 6, 7 and 9 of  S. viridis and  P. hallii, consistent with the expected collinearity between genomes of closely related species (Table  S3). Select syntenic network associations included genes of known function, including switchgrass  1,8‐cineole synthase ( PvTPS3, chromosome 3),  β‐bisabolene synthase ( PvTPS17, chromosome 6), and a  germacrene   d‐synthase  ( PvTPS55, chromosome 9) (Muchlinski  et al.,  2019). Additionally, TPSs on  S. italica chromosome 6 featured syntenic orthologs mapping to one chromosome in  S. viridis (chromosome 6),  P. hallii (chromosome 6),  B. distachyon (chromosome 3),  S. bicolor (chromosome 7) and  Z. mays (chromosome 10), the latter including ZmTPS10 producing  α‐bergamotene and  β‐farnesene (Köllner  et al.,  2009). In contrast, TPSs on  S. italica chromosome 7 have syntenic orthologs mapping to one chromosome in  S. viridis (chromosome 6),  S. bicolor (chromosome 6) and  Z. mays (chromosome 2), but different chromosomes in  P. hallii (chromosomes 2 and 7),  B. distachyon (chromosomes 3 and 5) and  O. sativa (chromosomes 3, 4 and 8), indicating diverse chromosomal origins for evolutionary hotspots for TPS genes across the Poaceae (Table  S3). Interestingly,  SiTPS34 (chromosome 9) with a predicted  ent‐CPP synthase function, was placed in a syntenic network with known  ent‐CPP synthases from rice ( OsCPS1, chromosome 2), maize ( ZmAN1, chromosome 1) and switchgrass ( PvCPS14/15, chromosome 9) (Bensen  et al.,  1995; Toyomasu  et al.,  2015; Pelot  et al.,  2018). Similarly, the predicted  ent‐kaurene synthasesSiTPS28/ 29 (chromosome 7) clustered in a syntenic network with  ent‐ kaurene synthases from rice ( OsKS1, chromosome 4), maize ( ZmKSL3/ 5, chromosome 2) and switchgrass ( PvKSL13/ 15, chromosome 7). Additionally,  S. italica class II diTPS candidates potentially involved in specialized metabolism, such as  SiTPS6, were in syntenic networks with the  ent‐ CPP synthase of specialized metabolism in rice ( OsCPS2, chromosome 2) and 8,13‐ CPP synthases from maize ( ZmCPS4, chromosome 4) and switchgrass ( PvCPS3, chromosome 1) (Prisic  et al.,  2004; Murphy  et al.,  2018; Pelot  et al.,  2018). Likewise,  SiTPS9 was placed in a syntenic network with  ZmCPS4 and the maize (+)‐ CPPsynthaseZmCPS3 (chromosome 10) (Murphy  et al.,  2018),  PvCPS3 (Pelot  et al.,  2018) and the  rice syn‐ CPP synthase OsCPS4 (chromosome4) (Xu  et al.,  2004; Otomo  et al.,  2004). Occurrence of TPS and P450 products  in planta To examine the presence of enzyme products of stress‐inducible TPSs and CYP99A17  in planta, control and stress‐treated  S. italica leaf, stem and root samples used for gene expression studies were subjected to organic solvent extraction and targeted metabolite analysis using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)–hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)–tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) against the purified enzyme products as authentic standards. Of the 20 identified TPS products, germacrene‐ d‐4‐ol and the diterpene alcohols abietadien‐19‐ol and  syn‐pimara‐7,15‐dien‐19‐ol were detected in the tested plant tissues under both controlled and stress‐treated conditions (Figure  S14). Germacrene‐ d‐4‐ol was detected exclusively in roots with product identification based on a dominant mass fragment  m/ z 205.195076 corresponding to the dehydrated protonated adduct ( M‐H 2O + H  +, parent mass ion  M  + = 222.1984) (Figure  S14). By contrast, abietadien‐19‐ol and/or  syn‐pimara‐7,15‐dien‐19‐ol (parent ion  M  +m/ z 288.2453) were present in leaves, stems and roots as verified by characteristic mass ions  m/ z 289.2525 and 271.2419 corresponding to the protonated adducts ( M + H  +) and the protonated dehydrated adducts ( M‐H 2O + H  +), respectively (Figure  S14). However, overlapping retention times and a nearly identical fragmentation pattern of abietadien‐19‐ol and  syn‐pimara‐7,15‐dien‐19‐ol prevented an unambiguous verification if both or only one compound occurs  in planta. Furthermore, abietadien‐19‐ol and/or  syn‐pimara‐7,15‐dien‐19‐ol were detected in both stress‐exposed and control plants with no apparent difference in abundance. Antifungal activity of terpenes from select  S. italica TPSs Fungal‐elicited transcript accumulation of  SiTPS6,  SiTPS8,  SiTPS9,  SiTPS15,  SiTPS19,  SiTPS20 and  SiCYP99A17 suggested possible antifungal bioactivities of the corresponding enzyme products (Figure  6). To investigate possible antifungal activity of the corresponding terpenoids,  in vitro fungal growth inhibition assays were performed using commercial standards of α‐bisabolol, β‐caryophyllene and δ‐cadinene, and purified enzyme products of abietadiene,  syn‐pimara‐7,15‐diene, abietadien‐19‐ol and  syn‐pimara‐7,15‐dien‐19‐ol. The purified SiTPS21 product cubebol proved to be unstable at the assay temperature and was excluded from further analysis. The fungal pathogens  Fusarium verticillioides and  Fusarium subglutinans were chosen for bioactivity assays, as these species have been shown to cause pathogenic symptoms in  S. italica (Nwanma  et al.,  1991; Besharati fard  et al.,  2014; Li  et al.,  2015). Overall, at concentrations of 2 µg ml −1 and 10 µg ml −1 all tested metabolites showed no or moderate inhibitory activity on fungal growth within the 48 h assay duration (Figure  7). The strongest antifungal activity was observed for abietadien‐19‐ol, with a 40% reduction of  F. verticillioides and  F. subglutinans growth after 48 h at a metabolite concentration of 10 µg ml −1. Interestingly, the corresponding olefin precursor abietadiene exhibited a similar antifungal activity against  F. subglutinans but was less effective in inhibiting the growth of  F. verticillioides with only a 13% reduction in fungal growth at the same metabolite concentration (Figure  7).  syn‐Pimara‐7,15‐dien‐19‐ol showed a comparable antifungal efficacy, inhibiting growth of  F. subglutinans by about 40% at both tested metabolite concentrations, but showing less impact on  F. verticillioides with only a 6% decrease in fungal growth after 48 h even at the higher metabolite concentration. Unlike abietadiene, the corresponding olefin precursor of  syn‐pimara‐7,15‐dien‐19‐ol,  syn‐pimara‐7,15‐diene, showed only minor antifungal activity. Regardless of the metabolite concentration tested, the targeted sesquiterpenoids, α‐bisabolol, β‐caryophyllene and δ‐cadinene, reduced fungal growth at lower levels of 10–13% compared with the diterpene alcohols. Abundance of terpene‐metabolic genes in  S. italica Numerous gene expression studies across poaceous crops have demonstrated stress‐inducible transcriptome accumulation of  TPSs and  P450s in response to biotic and/or abiotic stressors (reviewed in Schmelz  et al.,  2014), suggesting a related defensive response in  S. italica. To test this hypothesis, we performed quantitative (q)PCR‐based gene expression studies of the identified  TPS and  P450 genes following different abiotic and biotic stress treatments. Abiotic stresses were applied to roots of 4‐week‐old  S. italica plants in the form of oxidative stress by soil treatment with 10 m m CuSO 4 for 2 days, in form of drought stress by lack of watering for seven consecutive days and by UV irradiation of leaves for 2 h. In addition, pathogen stress was approximated by treatment of stems of 10‐week‐old  S. italica plants with mycoprotein derived from  Fusarium venenatum (Quorn TM) (Figures  6 and  S13). In addition, publicly available data on  S. italica tissue‐ and treatment‐specific gene expression ( https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov) were queried. Although comparison of these experimental and public data has to be viewed with caution given the use of, for example, different growth conditions and plant ages at harvest, some notable trends could be observed.  SiTPS19 was the only transcript showing significantly induced expression in response to all stresses, except for UV irradiation (Figure  6), despite its apparently higher abundance in leaf and panicle (Figure  S13).  SiTPS15 was also most abundant in panicles and showed inducible expression patterns upon drought stress and mycoprotein treatment (Figures  6 and  S13). All other TPS genes showed significant changes in gene expression predominantly under only one of the applied treatments.  SiTPS26 showed the highest transcript changes in response to oxidative stress, although it was most abundant in leaves (Figures  6 and  S13). Increases in gene expression in response to drought stress were highest for  SiTPS19 and  SiTPS35 (Figure  6). Ultraviolet irradiation caused increased transcript abundance most significantly for  SiTPS1,  SiTPS27 and  SiTPS28, consistent with the primary occurrence of these genes in leaf and panicle tissue (Figures  6 and  S13).  SiTPS8,  SiTPS9, SiTPS15,  SiTPS19 and  SiTPS20 were also most abundant in aerial  S. italica organs and showed the most significantly induced gene expression in response to mycoprotein treatment, indicating a possible function in defense against above‐ground pathogens (Figures  6 and  S13). Identification of SiCYP99A17 as a P450 catalyzing C19‐hydroxylation of labdane scaffolds Monocot diterpenoids are almost invariably functionally modified by P450 enzymes, with members of the CYP701, CYP71, CYP76 and CYP99 subfamilies having been shown to function in rice and maize diterpenoid metabolism (Swaminathan  et al,  2009; Wang  et al.,  2011; Wu  et al.,  2011; Wang  et al.,  2012a; Wang  et al.,  2012b; Mao  et al.,  2016; Mafu  et al.,  2018; Ding  et al.,  2019). Previous rice studies further revealed patterns of gene co‐regulation and genomic clustering of  diTPSs and  P450s involved in the biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexins, such as momilactones and phytocassanes (Wilderman  et al.,  2004; Prisic  et al.,  2004; Shimura  et al.,  2007; Swaminathan  et al.,  2009; Boutanaev  et al.,  2015). Based on these insights, we analyzed publicly available gene co‐expression data ( https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov) to identify similar  diTPS/ P450 co‐expression patterns in  S. italica. Indeed, significant co‐expression was observed for  SiTPS8,  SiTPS9 and two P450 candidates, namely  Seita.2G145800 and  Seita.6G139100, henceforth designated  CYP99A17 and  CYP99A19, respectively (Figure  5a, Table  S1). Both P450s showed best BLAST matches against rice CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 that catalyze the consecutive oxidation at C19 of  syn‐pimara‐7,15‐diene in momilactone biosynthesis (Wang  et al.,  2011; Kitaoka  et al.,  2015b). Pearson‐correlated gene expression between  SiTPS9 and  SiTPS8 (0.88),  CYP99A17 and  SiTPS8 (0.89),  CYP99A19 and  SiTPS9 (0.87) and  CYP99A19 and  SiTPS8 (0.91) supported a functional relationship between these genes (Figure  5a). Further mining of the  S. italica genome regions upstream and downstream of the identified TPS loci revealed that  CYP99A17 was located proximal to  SiTPS8 and  SiTPS9 on chromosome 2 with a distance of about 550 kb from  SiTPS9 and about 590 kb from  SiTPS8 (Figure  5b). To biochemically characterize CYP99A17 and CYP99A19, the corresponding genes were synthesized as codon‐optimized and N‐terminally truncated (removal of the predicted endoplasmic reticulum membrane anchor; Table  S1). Since  SiTPS8 showed correlated gene expression with both  CYP99A17 and  CYP99A19, combinatorial activity assays were performed for both P450s via  E. coli co‐expression with SiTPS8 and an  ent‐,  syn‐ or ( +)‐CPP synthase, thus encompassing all specialized labdane diterpene scaffolds identified in this study. No P450 products were observed for CYP99A19 with any of the tested diTPS combinations (Figure  S10), whereas co‐expression of CYP99A17 showed product formation with all diTPS combinations to form several new products with mass fragments of  m/ z 288, indicating hydroxylated labdane diterpenoid scaffolds (Figure  5c). Combining HSQC, HMBC and NOESY analyses identified the purified products of the coupled activity of (+)‐CPP synthase, SiTPS8 and CYP99A17 as abietadien‐19‐ol as compared with previously reported NMR data (Lee  et al.,  2001) (Figures  5d, g and  S11), the presence of a hydroxyl group at C19 (CH 2OH,  13C 64.99 p.p.m.) and NOESY correlation with C20 (CH 3,  13C 14.69 p.p.m.). Low abundance of the product formed by SiTPS8 and CYP99A17 with  ent‐CPP as the substrate prevented compound purification and NMR structural verification (Figure  5e). The product resulting from the co‐expression of SiTPS8 and CYP99A17 with a  syn‐CPP synthase was tentatively identified via NMR analysis and comparison with reference spectra as  syn‐pimara‐7,15‐dien‐19‐ol (Figure  5f, h and  S12) (Wang  et al.,  2011). Functional characterization of selected class I sesquiterpene synthases from  S. italica Activity screening of selected  S. italica sesqui‐TPS candidates using  N. benthamiana and  E. coli co‐expression with ZmFPPS showed several different TPS activities (Figure  4).  Nicotiana benthamiana expression revealed SiTPS15 as an α‐bisabolol synthase, SiTPS20 as a β‐caryophyllene synthase, SiTPS19 and SiTPS27 as δ‐cadinene synthases and SiTPS26 as a germacrene  d‐synthase compared with commercial standards, while SiTPS38 produced germacrene‐ d‐4‐ol as verified by comparison with the product of a δ‐cadinene synthase variant (GhCAD:N403P/L405H) from cotton ( Gossypium arboreum) (Yoshikuni  et al.,  2006) (Figures  4a,e and  S5). Co ‐expression of enzymes not showing activity in  N. benthamiana with ZmFPPS in  E. coli identified SiTPS21 as a cubebol synthase as validated by comparison with the product profile of cubebol synthase from  Coniophora puteana (Mischko  et al.,  2018) (Figures  4e,f and  S5). The primary product of SiTPS25 featured mass ions of  m/ z 161, 207, 222 and 240 (Figure  4g,h), which closely matched the fragmentation pattern of the sesquiterpene alcohol eudesme‐2,11‐diol, recently identified in maize (Liang  et al.,  2018). Additional 2D NMR analysis (H2BC and HMBC) of the purified compound verified the presence of two hydroxyl groups at quaternary carbons C2 (C,  13C 74.257 p.p.m.) and C11 (C,  13C 73.090 p.p.m.) and identified the product as eudesme‐2,11‐diol (Figures  4h and  S9). Functional characterization of class I diTPSs from  S. italica Having identified the  ent‐, (+)‐ or  syn‐CPP activity of the four class II diTPSs present in the  S. italica genome, we set out to functionally analyze the identified  S. italica class I TPSs using co‐expression in  N. benthamiana or  E. coli. Individual expression of the class I TPS candidates SiTPS1 and SiTPS2 (sharing 82% amino acid sequence identity) in  N. benthamiana resulted in the formation of geranyllinalool and minor amounts of  trans‐nerolidol, derived from GGPP and FPP, respectively, endogenously produced in  N. benthamiana (Figures  3a and  S3). Next, to verify the predicted  ent‐kaurene synthase activity of the two class I diTPSs SiTPS28 and SiTPS29, co‐expression with the  ent‐CPP synthase from maize (ZmAn2) (Harris  et al.,  2005) or a (+)‐CPP synthase IrTPS3 from  Isodon rubescens (Pelot  et al.,  2017) (used here in place of SiTPS9 due to higher catalytic activity in  N. benthamiana) were performed. Both SiTPS28 and SiTPS29 showed activity when combined with  ent‐CPP synthases, whereas no class I diTPS products were detected with (+)‐CPP as a substrate, identifying these enzymes as  ent‐kaurene synthases (Figures  3b and  S5). Close phylogenetic relatedness of SiTPS28 to ZmTPS1 further indicated a possible dual diTPS and sesqui‐TPS activity, as previously demonstrated for ZmTPS1 (Fu  et al.,  2016). Corresponding  E. coli co‐expression assays of SiTPS28 with the maize  trans‐FPP synthase, ZmFPPS (Cervantes‐Cervantes  et al.,  2006), indeed resulted in the formation of  trans‐nerolidol in addition to the  ent‐kaurene synthase activity of SiTPS28 (Figure  3c). To examine the class I diTPSs with probable functions in specialized diterpenoid metabolism (SiTPS5, SiTPS8, SiTPS13),  E. coli co‐expression assays were performed with  ent‐, (+)‐ and  syn‐CPP as substrates using, as partnering class II diTPSs, the  ent‐CPP synthase ZmAn2, the rice  syn‐CPP synthase OsCPS4 and a grand fir ( Abies grandis) abietadiene synthase variant producing (+)‐CPP (Morrone  et al.,  2010). No class I diTPS products were detectable when co‐expressing SiTPS5 and SiTPS13 in  E. coli with enzymes producing  ent‐CPP, (+)‐CPP or  syn‐CPP or in  N. benthamiana expression assays with the (+)‐CPP synthase SiTPS9 or the  ent‐CPP synthases SiTPS34/35 (Figure  S6). In contrast, SiTPS8 showed catalytic promiscuity, converting all CPP stereoisomers (Figure  3d,f). The SiTPS8‐catalyzed conversion of  ent‐CPP yielded multiple diterpene products, including  ent‐pimara‐8(14),15‐diene,  ent‐sandaracopimaradiene,  ent‐abietadiene and a major product (product 8) that featured dominant mass ions of  m/ z 133, 161, 187, 257 and 272, indicating a related diterpene olefin (Figure  3d,g). To structurally identify product 8 via NMR analysis, in excess of 1 mg of the product was generated using large‐scale  E. coli co‐expression assays and purified by silica chromatography and semi‐preparative HPLC (Murphy  et al.,  2019). The purified product was then subject to 1D ( 1H and  13C) and 2D NMR (HSQC, COSY, HMBC, H2BC) analyses that identified the compound as  ent‐pimara‐8,15‐diene, tentatively assigning the same  ent‐stereochemistry at C9 ( 13CH 2 20.67 p.p.m.) and C10 ( 13CH 3 19.43 p.p.m.) based on  ent‐CPP as the initial substrate. Similarly, stereochemistry of methyl groups at C18 (CH 3,  13C 21.68 p.p.m.) and C19 (CH 3,  13C 33.25 p.p.m.) was tentatively assigned based on  ent‐CPP as substrate and mutual HMBC correlations to each other as well as C3 (CH 2,  13C 41.86 p.p.m.), C4 (C,  13C 33.32 p.p.m.) and C5 (CH,  13C 51.82 p.p.m.), whereas the defining double bond between quaternary carbons C8 ( 13C 124.15 p.p.m.) and C9 ( 13C 136.61 p.p.m.) was verified by HMBC correlations with the neighboring C14 (CH 2,  13C 42.48 p.p.m.), as well as the double bond between C15 (CH,  13C 149.45 p.p.m.) and C16 (CH 2,  13C 109.43 p.p.m.) with HMBC correlation to C17 (CH 3,  13C 23.20 p.p.m.) (Figures  3g and  S7). SiTPS8‐catalyzed conversion of ( +)‐CPP yielded abietadiene and sandaracopimaradiene as a minor byproduct (Figure  3e). Additionally, co‐expression of SiTPS8 with a  syn‐CPP synthase yielded  syn‐pimara‐9(11),15‐diene and two unidentified diterpene products (Figure  3f). The major product (compound 14) featured characteristic labdane diterpene mass fragments of  m/ z 229, 257 and 272. The NMR analysis of the purified compound identified it as  syn‐pimara‐7,15‐diene as based on a comparison with published NMR spectra (Mafu  et al.,  2016; Ye  et al.,  2017) (Figures  3h and  S8). Beyond its diTPS activity, co‐expression of SiTPS8 with ZmFPPS resulted in  trans‐nerolidol, highlighting the substrate promiscuity of this enzyme (Figure  3c). Mass spectra of all identified class I TPS products are given in Figure  S5.","Terpenoid metabolism plays vital roles in stress defense and the environmental adaptation of monocot crops. Here, we describe the identification of the terpene synthase (TPS) gene family of the panicoid food and bioenergy model crop foxtail millet (Setaria italica). The diploid S. italica genome contains 32 TPS genes, 17 of which were biochemically characterized in this study. Unlike other thus far investigated grasses, S. italica contains TPSs producing all three ent-, (+)- and syn-copalyl pyrophosphate stereoisomers that naturally occur as central building blocks in the biosynthesis of distinct monocot diterpenoids. Conversion of these intermediates by the promiscuous TPS SiTPS8 yielded different diterpenoid scaffolds. Additionally, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP99A17), which genomically clustered with SiTPS8, catalyzes the C19 hydroxylation of SiTPS8 products to generate the corresponding diterpene alcohols. The presence of syntenic orthologs to about 19% of the S. italica TPSs in related grasses supports a common ancestry of selected pathway branches. Among the identified enzyme products, abietadien-19-ol, syn-pimara-7,15-dien-19-ol and germacrene-d-4-ol were detectable in planta, and gene expression analysis of the biosynthetic TPSs showed distinct and, albeit moderately, inducible expression patterns in response to biotic and abiotic stress. In vitro growth-inhibiting activity of abietadien-19-ol and syn-pimara-7,15-dien-19-ol against Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium subglutinans may indicate pathogen defensive functions, whereas the low antifungal efficacy of tested sesquiterpenoids supports other bioactivities. Together, these findings expand the known chemical space of monocot terpenoid metabolism to enable further investigations of terpenoid-mediated stress resilience in these agriculturally important species."," 'Setaria italica', 'Natural products', 'Pathway Discovery', 'Terpene Synthases', 'Plant Specialized Metabolism', 'Crop Stress Resilience' "," 'Figure', 'TPS', 'italica TPS', 'Figures',

28,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC8212831/eupmc_result.json,PMC8212831,," Background Plants have evolved physical-chemical defense to prevent/diminish damage by their enemies. Chemical defense involves the synthesis' pathways of specialized toxic, repellent, or anti-nutritive metabolites to herbivores. Molecular evolutionary studies have revealed the origin of new genes, acquisition and functional diversification along time in different plant lineages. Methods Using bioinformatic tools we analyze gene divergence of tropane alkaloids (TAs) and terpene synthases (TPSs) in  Datura stramonium  and other species of Solanaceae; compared gene and amino acids sequence of TAs and TPSs on genomes, cDNA and proteins sequences of Viridiplantae. We analyzed two recently assembled genomes of  D. stramonium  (Ticumán and Teotihuacán), transcriptomes of  Datura metel  and genomes of other Solanaceae. Hence, we analyzed variation of TAs and TPSs to infer genes involved in plant defense and plant responses before stress. We analyzed protein modeling and molecular docking to predict interactions between H6H and ligand; we translated the sequences (Teo19488, Tic8550 and Tic8549) obtained from the two genomes of  D. stramonium  by using Swiss-Model and Ramachandran plot and MolProbity structure validation of Teo19488 protein model. Results For TAs, we detected an expansion event in the tropinone reductase II (TRII) and the ratio synonymous/non-synonymous substitutions indicate positive selection. In contrast, a contraction event and negative selection was detected in tropinone reductase I (TRI). In Hy-oscyamine 6 b-hydroxylase (H6H), enzyme involved in the production of tropane alkaloids atropine and scopolamine, the synonymous/non-synonymous substitution ratio in its dominion indicates positive selection. For terpenes (TPS), we found 18 DsTPS in  D. stramomiun  and seven in  D. metel ; evolutionary analyses detected positive selection in TPS10.1 and TPS10.2 of  D. stramonium  and  D. metel . Comparison of copies of TPSs in  D. stramonium  detected variation among them in the binding site. Duplication events and differentiation of TAs and TPSs of  D. stramonium , as compared to other Solanaceae, suggest their possible involvement on adaptive evolution of defense to herbivores. Protein modeling and docking show that the three protein structures obtained of DsH6H from Teo19488, Tic-8550 and Tic8549 maintain the same interactions and the union site of 2OG-FeII_Oxy with the Hy-o ligand as in 6TTM of  D. metel.  Conclusion Our results indicate differences in the number of gene copies involved in the synthesis of tropane alkaloids, between the genomes of  D. stramonium  from two Mexican populations. More copies of genes related to the synthesis of tropane alkaloids (TRI, TRII, H6H, PMT) are found in  D. stramonium  as compared to Viridiplantae. Likewise, for terpene synthases (TPS), TPS-10 is duplicated in  D. stramonium  and  D. metel . Further studies should be directed to experimentally assess gain (overexpression) or loss (silencing) of function of duplicated genes."," 'Solanaceae', 'Phylogeny', 'Tropane alkaloids', 'Terpene synthase', 'Datura stramonium', 'H6h', 'Gene Duplication And Contraction', 'Plant Defense To Herbivores', 'Tropinone Reductase' ",  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,NaN
29,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6214137/eupmc_result.json,PMC6214137,"2. Results 2.2. Transcriptomic Profiles Next, we isolated RNA from the same leaf tissue samples that were used for phytohormone extraction and performed gene-expression microarray analyses to get an overview of the transcriptomic responses of tomato plants upon single and dual mite infestations. 2.2.2. Detailed Analysis of Selected Defense-Associated Pathways SA Pathway In sharp contrast with the SA biosynthesis, metabolism or signaling genes, we found massive changes in the expression of downstream defense-associated genes ( Figure 4). Most SA-responsive genes associated with plant immunity code for so-called pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins that commonly have, or are predicted to have, antimicrobial and/or insecticidal properties   78 . The general picture that emerged from our microarray analysis of SA defense response marker genes is as follows: (i) The expression of dozens of genes encoding PR-proteins of various classes was highly induced in Tu and Al, often to the same extent, but was not induced in Te. (ii) Compared with the Tu and Al single infestations, in dual-infested leaves the number of up-regulated genes as well as the magnitude of their induction was higher in Tu+Al, while both factors were lower in Tu+Te ( Figure 4). Using qPCRs, we verified these typical expression profiles for some SA marker genes ( Figure S1I–J). Our results corroborate the report by Glas et al.   23  that  T. urticae and  A. lycopersici each induce SA-mediated defense responses and these are additive when mites from both species simultaneously infest the same leaflet. In line with the data of Alba et al.   33 , our results also indicate that  T. evansi suppresses SA defenses. In more detail: we found that for roughly 50% of the surveyed SA defense marker genes the magnitude of up-regulation was considerably lower (i.e., absolute Log 2FC difference > 0.2) in Tu+Te than in Tu samples, with five of them being among the top-31 candidate  T. evansi-suppressed genes ( Table 2). This suppression was confirmed with qPCRs ( Figure S1I–J). Despite the significantly increased concentrations of SA upon all mite infestation treatments, especially upon (dual) infestation with  T. urticae ( Figure 1D), changes in the relative expression level of genes predicted to be involved in SA biosynthesis, metabolism or signaling were relatively minor ( Figure 4). The available gene expression data suggests that SA biosynthesis   68, 69  in tomato upon infestation with mites proceeds via the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) pathway rather than via the isochorismate synthase (ICS) pathway. Tomato’s only  ICS (Solyc06g071030) is not represented on our microarray platform, but we confirmed with qPCRs that it was not induced after seven days of feeding by any of our mite species ( Figure S1H). In fact,  ICS was down-regulated in  A. lycopersici-infested leaves. Contrary to  ICS, several early phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes were induced by mite feeding (the phenylpropanoid pathway is discusses in more detail in the next section). One out of two chorismate mutase (CM)-encoding genes (Solyc02g088460) was significantly up-regulated in Tu+Te, Tu, Tu+Al and Al samples, but less than 1.5-fold. Genes coding for prephenate aminotransferase (PPA-AT; Solyc04g054710) and arogenate dehydratase (ADT; Solyc06g074530) enzymes were also up-regulated. The  PPA-AT expression pattern was similar to that of  CM, while  ADT was induced to higher levels. Two  PAL genes were significantly up-regulated in Tu samples, similar to the findings of Martel et al.   39 , albeit only one (Solyc05g056170) by more than 1.5-fold. Expression of this latter  PAL was induced to a similar level in Al, to slightly higher levels in Tu+Al, reduced to a level below the FC cutoff in Tu+Te, and was not significantly induced in Te. Despite their induction, the  CM,  PPA-AT,  ADT and  PAL expression patterns did not match the SA accumulation profiles very well, especially not in leaflets (dual) infested with  T. evansi. This may be explained by the single and relatively late sampling moment. Additionally, it may be explained by active metabolism of SA. Expression patterns of tomato genes coding for putative homologs of  Arabidopsis thaliana SA glycosyltransferases (SAGTs)   70, 71 , SA hydroxylases   72, 73  and a dihydroxybenzoic acid glycosyltransferase (DHBAGT)   74 , in particular those with the highest BLASTP scores, did not correlate well with SA levels. However, the expression pattern of  salicylic acid methyltransferase ( SAMT; Solyc09g091550) matched the SA accumulation profile much better ( Figure 4). SAMT catalyzes the methylation of SA, generating volatile methyl salicylate (MeSA) in tomato plants   75, 76 , and may thereby have control over internal SA pools. At the SA signaling level   68, 77 , expression of the tomato gene (Solyc07g040690) that encodes the putative homolog of  A. thaliana NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) was induced to similar levels in response to all mite-infestation treatments, except for the  T. evansi infestation ( Figure 4). A putative homolog of  A. thaliana NPR3/4 (Solyc07g044980) had the same expression pattern. With regard to TGA transcription factors, we found one  TGA gene to be down-regulated in Tu+Te, Tu, Tu+Al and Al, most strongly so in the latter two samples. Phenylpropanoid Pathway We assessed whether genes associated with lignin biosynthesis were up-regulated in Tu+Te, Tu, Tu+Al and Al, as an altered flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway   79  may explain the apparent down-regulation of flavonoid/anthocyanin biosynthesis in these samples. Our results are inconclusive, because we found up-regulated as well as down-regulated lignin-biosynthesis genes in the same samples ( Figure 5). Most relevant in this respect is that the genes coding for key enzymes cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) had contrasting expression patterns. Of the two  bona fide CCR-encoding genes,  CCR1 (Solyc06g068440) and  CCR2 (Solyc03g116910)   81 , only the latter was differentially regulated.  CCR2 expression was approximately 2-fold higher in Tu+Al than in C samples. No significant changes were detected in the other samples. The only DEG among putative CAD-encoding genes, Solyc02g030480, was down-regulated in Tu+Al, as well as in the Tu and Al single infestation samples. Lastly, we detected dozens of differentially regulated peroxidase and laccase-encoding genes in Tu+Te, Tu, Tu+Al and Al, but none in Te. The majority of these genes were up-regulated ( Figure 5). Hence, lignin polymerization activity may be increased in response to  T. urticae and  A. lycopersici feeding. Our transcriptional analysis of the phenylpropanoid metabolism in mite-infested leaflets yielded two main observations with potential biological relevance. The first observation is that, beside  CM and  PAL, genes putatively coding for the other core phenylpropanoid enzymes, i.e., cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL)   79 , were also induced upon (dual) infestation with  T. urticae and  A lycopersici, albeit not highly ( Figure 5). This suggests that the production of one or more phenolic compounds increased in tomato plants upon these treatments. It proved difficult to pinpoint which compound(s), for the following four reasons: (i) Different isoforms exist of most phenylpropanoid enzymes, creating both substrate redundancy and specificity   79, 80 . (ii) Phenylpropanoid enzymes do not always have strict substrate requirements and can therefore be involved in multiple branches of the pathway, generating various products   79, 80 . (iii) Genes (putatively) coding for functionally equivalent enzymes had opposite expression patterns in the same sample. (iv) Genes (putatively) coding for enzymes that sequentially function in the same biosynthetic pathway had opposite expression patterns. For instance, genes predicted to encode enzymes that: (a) convert naringenin into various dihydroflavonols (flavone-3-hydroxylase  F3H , flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase  F3’H , flavonoid 3’,5’-hydroxylase  F3’5’H ); (b) catalyze the first dedicated reaction towards the production of flavonols from dihydroflavonols (flavonol synthase  FLS ), and/or; (c) catalyze the first two committed steps of anthocyanin production from dihydroflavonols (dihydroflavonol reductase  DFR  and anthocyanidin synthase  ANS , respectively), had inconsistent expression patterns ( Figure 5). Nonetheless, the production of the phenylpropanoid chlorogenic acid (CGA) may be promoted upon (dual) infestation with  A. lycopersici. CGA is one of the most abundant phenolics in tomato leaves   81, 82, 83  and has been suggested to confer antinutritive properties in the herbivore’s gut, i.e., upon oxidation by e.g., co-ingested PPOs   84, 85, 86 . In tomato, the synthesis of CGA requires hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT), ρ-coumarate 3’-hydroxylase (C3H), and possibly hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA transferase (HCT) activity   87 . Expression of the gene encoding key enzyme HQT (Solyc07g005760;   87 ) was significantly induced in Tu+Al and Al samples, but less than 1.5-fold. Putative HCT and C3H-encoding genes were highly induced in response to all mite infestations, except for the  T. evansi single infestation ( Figure 5). The second observation is that tomato’s two established chalcone synthase (CHS)-encoding genes,  CHS1 and  CHS2   88, 89 , as well as one of its two canonical chalcone isomerase (CHI)-encoding genes,  CHI1   90 , were down-regulated in the Tu, Tu+Al and Al samples, most strongly so in Tu+Al ( Figure 5). Note that  CHI2 is normally not expressed in leaves   90 .  CHS1,  CHS2 and  CHI1 appeared to be down-regulated in Tu+Te samples as well, but this was only statistically significant for  CHI1. No such changes were observed in Te. By means of qPCRs, we confirmed the expression patterns of  CHS1 and  CHS2 ( Figure S2A,B). We additionally found that several genes encoding positive regulators of flavonoid (MYB12;   91, 92, 93, 94 ) or anthocyanin biosynthesis (AN2/MYB75, JAF13/bHLH90;   95 ) were also down-regulated in Tu+Al. The anthocyanin biosynthesis regulatory gene  ANT1/MYB113   96  was not differentially regulated in response to mite feeding. Together, our results suggest that the production of flavonoids and anthocyanins may be decreased in leaflets (dual) infested with  T. urticae and/or  A. lycopersici. Terpenoids Secondly, consistent with the increased emission of the monoterpene linalool, the sesquiterpene ( E)-nerolidol and the homoterpene (C 16) ( E,  E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT) in response to  T. urticae feeding   37 , expression of two TPS genes involved in the biosynthesis of these compounds, i.e.,  TPS5/MTS1 and  TPS46/GLS, was significantly up-regulated in Tu samples. The trichome-localized TPS5/MTS1 preferentially produces linalool from geranyl diphosphate (GPP), yet can also generate ( E)-nerolidol from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP)   101 .  TPS5/MTS1 was induced in Tu+Te as well, but not in leaflets (dual) infested with  A. lycopersici. TPS46/GLS, uses geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) as a substrate to produce the diterpene geranyllinalool   97 , which is the precursor of TMTT. The enzyme(s) responsible for the conversion of geranyllinalool into TMTT has/have not been identified in tomato. Although enzymatically less efficient, TPS46/GLS can synthesize ( E)-nerolidol from FPP   97 .  TPS46/GLS expression was up-regulated upon all mite infestation treatments, except for the single infestation with  T. evansi. It should be noted that whereas  TPS5/MTS1 was induced by  T. urticae feeding,  TPS37 was down-regulated (also in Tu+Te, Tu+Al and Al samples). This is noteworthy because TPS5/MTS1 and TPS37 are functionally equivalent   102 . However,  TPS5/MTS1 transcripts seem to be far more abundant than those of  TPS37, especially in glandular trichomes of JA-treated plants   102 . Overall, transcriptional changes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway of our mite-infested tomato plants were relatively minor in terms of both the number of DEGs as well as their FCs ( Figure 6). Most terpenoid-DEGs and highest FCs were observed in the Tu+Al samples, while no significant changes were found in Te. Here, we highlight four main findings of our transcriptional analysis of the terpenoid pathway.  Fourthly, further upstream in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, several genes coding for enzymes belonging to the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway (acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase  AACT ; 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase  HMGR ) or the plastidial 2-C-methyl- d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway (1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase  DXS ; 1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase  DXR ; 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl- d-erythritol kinase  CMK ) were down-regulated in leaves (dual) infested with  T. urticae and/or  A. lycopersici ( Figure 6). Firstly, we noted the strong, simultaneous down-regulation of  CPT1/NDPS1 and  TPS20/PHS1 in tomato leaves (dual) infested with  A. lycopersici ( Figure 6). These genes appeared to be down-regulated in Tu samples as well, but this was not statistically significant.  CPT1/NDPS1 is one of the most strongly down-regulated genes in the Al samples ( Table S6; #3) and encodes a neryl diphosphate (NPP)-producing cis-prenyltransferase   98 . The terpene synthase (TPS) encoded by  TPS20/PHS1 catalyzes the conversion of NPP into several monoterpenes (C 10), including α- and β-phellandrene   98 . The highly reduced expression of  CPT1/NDPS1 and  TPS20/PHS1 in  A. lycopersici-infested leaves suggests that phellandrene may be emitted in lower amounts by these plants as compared to non-infested controls. Although the magnitude of FCs was smaller than for  CPT1/NDPS1 and  TPS20/PHS1, we found similar expression patterns for  TPS17 and  TPS21 ( Figure 6).  TPS17 encodes a sesquiterpene (C 15) synthase   99  and  TPS21 a diterpene (C 20) synthase   100 . The main reaction products of these enzymes are valencene and lycosantalene, respectively   99, 100 . Thirdly, genes encoding the prenyltransferases responsible for the production of GPP (i.e., GPS   103 ), FPP (i.e., FPSs   104 ) or GGPP (i.e., GGPSs   105 ) were not up-regulated by mite feeding. One exception may be  GGPS1, whose expression is known to be induced by  T. urticae   105  and suppressed by  T. evansi   30 , as this gene is not present on our microarray. Another prenyltransferase gene,  CPT5, which encodes a polyisoprenyl diphosphate (C 55–C 80)-generating enzyme   106  was induced in all samples, except for Te ( Figure 6). CPT5 uses FPP as substrate   106 , yet  FPS1   104  was down-regulated in samples where  CPT5 was induced. The function of polyisoprenoids in plant-mite interactions is unknown. JA Pathway To get an approximate idea of the extent to which the JA pathway genes depicted in  Figure 3 are indeed JA-responsive, we cross-referenced our DEGs with genes whose expressions was significantly induced in  def-1, 24 h after exogenous application of JA   39 . As expected, each section of the JA pathway contained JA-responsive genes and, except for  TD-2, all were up-regulated in response to mite feeding, in particular in the Tu samples ( Figure 3). Next, we applied custom filters to our microarray data in order to identify  A. lycopersici-suppressed genes in dual-infested leaves ( Table 1). We found that 23 out of the resulting 30 candidates were JA-inducible according to the data of Martel et al.   39 . To put this into perspective, applying the same filters to identify  T. evansi-suppressed genes yielded a set of 31 candidates, four of which were JA-inducible ( Table 2). Moreover, of the 25 most highly up-regulated DEGs, seven were JA-inducible for the Tu treatment ( Table S3), 13 for the Te treatment ( Table S4), yet zero for the Al treatment ( Table S5). Our data, therefore, provides compelling evidence in support of the hypothesis that  A. lycopersici predominantly suppresses JA-regulated defense responses   23 . In general, jasmonate concentrations in mite-infested leaflets ( Figure 1A–C) correlated well with both the detected number of DEGs with a predicted function in JA biosynthesis, metabolism or signaling as well as with the magnitude of their expression ( Figure 3). Concurrent with the highly increased accumulation of jasmonates in leaflets (dual) infested with  T. urticae, the majority of genes encoding (putative) JA biosynthesis enzymes   55 , including phospholipases (PLs), lipoxygenases (LOXs), allene oxide cyclase (AOC), allene oxide synthase (AOC) and OPDA reductase 3 (OPR3), were significantly up-regulated in Tu+Te, Tu and Tu+Al samples ( Figure 3). By contrast, the expression of just two JA biosynthesis genes ( PLA1 and  AOS) was significantly up-regulated in  T. evansi-infested leaflets. In the Al samples,  PLs,  LOXs and  AOS were up-regulated, but expression of  AOC was not significantly altered, while  OPR3 was induced, but less than 1.5-fold. In addition, a putative jasmonate methyltransferase (JMT)-encoding gene (Solyc02g084950) was significantly induced in Tu+Al and Al samples. Note that the gene coding for JAR1, i.e., the enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of JA and Ile   56 , is not present on our microarray. Immediately downstream from JA-Ile accumulation, i.e., at the JA-Ile perception and signaling level   55, 57 , multiple JASMONATE ZIM DOMAIN (JAZ)-encoding genes were induced upon each of the mite infestation treatments.  JAZ induction, both in terms of gene numbers and magnitude of expression, was highest upon (dual) infestation with  T. urticae and lowest with  T. evansi ( Figure 3). Expression of  COI1 and  MYC2 was not significantly altered in mite-infested plants. Further downstream, concentrations of jasmonates still correlated well with the expression patterns of defense-associated genes in the Tu and Te samples, but no longer in the other samples, presumably due to suppression by  T. evansi and  A. lycopersici, respectively. In tomato, JA-induced responses to arthropod herbivores typically involve the production of various types of defensive proteins that have antinutritive properties   58 , such as: proteinase/protease inhibitors (PIs)   59, 60, 61 , arginases   62 , threonine deaminases (TDs)   62, 63 , polyphenol oxidases (PPOs)   64 , and possibly leucine aminopeptidases (Laps)   65, 66 . These defensive proteins exert their antinutritive activity inside the herbivore’s digestive tract, thus after ingestion of plant material   58, 67 . Multiple tomato genes encoding defensive antinutritive proteins of every class described above, except for TDs, were strongly up-regulated in the Tu samples ( Figure 3). Four of them were among the 25 most highly up-regulated genes for the Tu treatment, including #1; Solyc03g098760, a PI ( Table S3). This latter gene is also the top-ranking induced gene in the Te samples ( Table S4), although the induction is much stronger in Tu (26-fold induction versus 7-fold). In total, four antinutritive protein-encoding genes were significantly up-regulated in Te (two PIs, one Lap, one PPO). Despite the high total number of up-regulated DEGs in Al samples, only seven of them encode putative JA-responsive antinutritive proteins (five PIs, one arginase, one PPO) and none of them were among the 25 most highly up-regulated Al-DEGs ( Table S5). In addition, when directly compared with the antinutritive protein-encoding genes induced in Tu, the induction was considerably lower (i.e., absolute Log 2FC difference > 0.2) for nearly 60% of them in Tu+Al, and for about 20% of them in Tu+Te, indicative of suppression by  A. lycopersici and  T. evansi, respectively. We verified this for several genes by means of qPCRs ( Figure S1A–G). Our data indicates that suppressor mites do not suppress all antinutritive protein-encoding genes, i.e., at least at this single time point seven days after infestation. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that in dual-infested leaves those genes suppressed by  A. lycopersici were usually not suppressed by  T. evansi and vice versa. For instance, the  T. urticae-induced expression of Solyc03g098720, putatively coding for a Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor (a PI), is suppressed by  A. lycopersici but not by  T. evansi in dual-infested plants ( Figure S1C), while the opposite is observed for Solyc03g098740, which encodes another Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor ( Figure S1D). Steroidal (glyco)alkaloids Solanaceous plants typically produce steroidal alkaloids. These nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites are commonly glycosylated, presumably to reduce their autotoxicity, forming steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs)   107, 108 . Steroidal (glyco)alkaloids are generated from cholesterol   108  (which in turn is produced from the triterpene (C 30) squalene   109 ) via a series of hydroxylation, oxidation, transamination, reduction and/or glycosylation reactions that are catalyzed by various GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM (GAME) enzymes, of which ten have been characterized in tomato thus far   107, 108, 110, 111 . In addition, the JA-responsive transcription factor GAME9/JRE4 functions as a master regulator of steroidal (glyco)alkaloid metabolism by controlling, either alone or in association with MYC2, the expression of genes coding for key enzymes in the MVA, cholesterol and SGA biosynthesis pathways   112, 113, 114 . We observed that expression of eight out of nine  GAME genes present on our microarray was down-regulated in tomato leaves dual infested with  T. urticae and  A. lycopersici ( Figure 7). Although the FCs were smaller, the same genes were down-regulated upon single infestation with  A. lycopersici, for six of them this down-regulation was statistically significant.  GAME9/ JRE4 was the most strongly down-regulated  GAME gene in both Tu+Al and Al samples, followed by  GAME1 and  GAME18. The latter two code for glycosyltransferases that are responsible for two out of four sugar-attachment steps required for the conversion of tomatidine into α-tomatine, which is the major SGA present in green tomato tissues   107, 108 . The genes encoding the other two glycosyltransferases,  GAME2 and  GAME17   108 , are not present on our microarray. Expression of some  GAME genes appeared to be down-regulated in the Tu samples, but this was only statistically significant for  GAME9/ JRE4. No changes were found in the Te samples. We verified the expression patterns of  GAME1 and  GAME9/JRE4 with qPCRs ( Figure S2C,D). Very similar expression patterns were found for the putative cholesterol biosynthesis genes   109  ( Figure 7) as well as for genes encoding enzymes of the upstream MVA pathway, as discussed earlier ( Figure 6). Our results suggest that the steroidal (glyco)alkaloid contents of tomato leaves may be reduced and the sterol composition altered upon infestation with  A. lycopersici, possibly with  T. urticae as well, and that those changes are most severe when mites from both species simultaneously attack the plant. 2.2.1. General Overview of Mite-Induced Transcriptomic Changes in Tomato As a first step in our functional characterization of the mite-induced tomato transcriptomic responses, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) based on the 3570 DEGs (absolute FC ≥ 1.5; BH-adjusted  p ≤ 0.05). The PCA indicated that nearly half of the variance in differential gene expression could be attributed to the factor “mite-infestation treatment” ( Figure 2B, PC 1). The Te and C samples clustered together but separated from the other infestation treatments, which is in line with the low number of DEGs between these treatments. Accordingly, the Tu+Al samples clustered furthest away from the controls along PC 1. The transcriptomic profiles of the Tu, Tu+Te, Al and Tu+Al samples did not separate clearly in the PCA plot ( Figure 2B), which might be explained by the large overlap of DEGs across these treatments ( Figure 2C). Thirty-one out of 35 genes up-regulated in  T. evansi-infested leaflets were also up-regulated in response to each of the other mite infestation regimes. None of the genes on our microarray were found to be specifically (uniquely) up- or down-regulated by  T. evansi, and only one (Solyc12g040860; encoding a glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase) was significantly up-regulated in the Te and Tu+Te samples but not in the others. With respect to  A. lycopersici, a very different picture emerged from our transcriptome data analyses. Although the majority of up- and down-regulated Al-DEGs were shared with the other treatments, still 111 genes were specifically expressed in response to the  A. lycopersici single infestation. Moreover, a total of 1836 genes (including those 111) were differentially regulated in the Al and/or Tu+Al samples but not in the others ( Figure 2C). We annotated our EST-based gene-expression microarray using the ITAG3.2 tomato genome annotation. The probes of our microarray platform represent 16,431 tomato genes, which corresponds to 53.2% of the 30,868 genes annotated in ITAG3.2. Using the C samples as a common reference, a total of 5494 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified across all mite-infestation treatments at a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) false discovery rate adjusted  p ≤ 0.05. We found large variation in the number of DEGs in response to the different mite-infestation treatments ( Figure 2A,  Table S1). Most striking was the extremely low number of DEGs in the Te samples: only 38 were detected (0.1% of the genes annotated in ITAG3.2), from which all but one were up-regulated. In contrast, there were 2460 (8.0%) and 3200 (10.4%) DEGs in the Tu and Al samples, respectively, with an approximately equal number of genes being up- or down-regulated. For the dual-infested plants, we found 2032 DEGs (6.6%) in the Tu+Te samples, which is considerably less than in the Tu samples while leaflets were infested with twice as many mites. The opposite pattern was observed in the Tu+Al samples, which had as many as 5152 DEGs (16.7%). The number of up-regulated and down-regulated genes was similar in dual-infested plants. Third,  k-means clustering was performed on the 3570 DEGs based on the relative transcript levels across the mite-infestation treatments. Within this clustering analysis, the genes of clusters 1 and 2 were up-regulated in response to all mite-infestation treatments, except for Te, with those in cluster 1 being most strongly up-regulated in leaves (dual) infested with  A. lycopersici ( Figure 2D). The genes constituting clusters 4 and 5 were down-regulated in response to all mite-infestation treatments, except for Te, with those in cluster 5 being most strongly down-regulated in leaves (dual) infested with  A. lycopersici. Whereas clusters 1 and 5 contained genes most strongly responding to  A. lycopersici, the genes of cluster 3 were highly up-regulated in leaves (dual) infested with  T. urticae, but much less so in response to single infestations with either  T. evansi or  A. lycopersici. Hence, cluster 3 is mainly comprised of Tu-specific DEGs. In each cluster, the mean FC was lowest for the Te treatment ( Figure 2D), which may be explained by the low number of Te-DEGs. However, also for DEGs the magnitude of gene expression is lower in tomato leaves solely infested with  T. evansi than in leaves (dual) infested with  T. urticae or  A. lycopersici. This is evident when comparing the 25 most highly up-regulated DEGs of the Tu, Te and Al samples ( Tables S3–S5). Although, FC differences between the Tu+Te and Tu treatments were relatively small, the mean FC was smaller in the former in three out of five clusters. By contrast, the mean FC for the Tu+Al samples was higher than that of the Tu samples in four clusters ( Figure 2D). For the subsequent transcriptomic analyses, we followed a more conservative approach by applying an additional cutoff at an absolute fold change (FC) of 1.5 (i.e., a Log 2FC of 0.585), resulting in a total of 3570 DEGs across all mite-infestation treatments ( Figure 2A,  Table S1). The DEGs belonging to each cluster were subsequently subjected to gene set enrichment analysis based on their BP GO annotations. This analysis revealed that cluster 3 ( T. urticae-specific up-regulation) was significantly enriched in genes belonging to BP GO categories “response to wounding” and “pigment biosynthetic process”, whereas cluster 5 (strongest down-regulation in Tu+Al and Al samples) was enriched in genes belonging to BP GO categories “photosynthesis” and “photosynthesis, light harvesting”. The DEGs of the remaining clusters were not significantly enriched for any BP GO category. As a second step in our functional characterization, the DEGs sets of each individual mite-infestation treatment were analyzed for enrichment of biological process (BP) gene ontology (GO) annotations. The Te treatment was excluded, because the number of Te-DEGs was insufficient for this analysis. Across the remaining infestation treatments, 21 BP GO categories were found to be significantly overrepresented in the tomato transcriptional responses, with substantial overlap between treatments ( Table S2). Among the up-regulated DEGs in the Tu+Te, Tu, Tu+Al and Al samples, genes associated with the BP GO categories “recognition of pollen”, “protein phosphorylation”, “hydrogen peroxide catabolic process” and “chitin catabolic process” were significantly enriched ( Table S2A), while down-regulated DEGs were consistently enriched in genes belonging to BP GO category “photosynthesis”. In addition, genes corresponding to the photosynthesis-related BP GO categories “photosynthesis, light harvesting” and/or “chlorophyll biosynthetic process” were overrepresented among down-regulated DEGs in the Tu, Tu+Al and Al samples ( Table S2B). 2.2.4. Beyond Suppression of  T. urticae-Induced Genes Numerous DEGs were exclusively found in leaves (dual) infested with  A. lycopersici ( Figure 2C). Given that these genes were not differentially regulated in Tu samples, they may provide insight into the mechanism(s) underlying defense suppression by  A. lycopersici. We therefore mined the microarray data for those genes that were up-regulated in the Al samples but were not differentially expressed (BH-adjusted  p > 0.05) in the Tu ones. The resulting 612 genes (the top 25 is presented in  Table S7) appeared to be involved in various processes, but among the genes with the largest absolute difference in expression level in Al versus Tu were genes putatively involved in cell wall organization (e.g., expansins, pectinesterases, peroxidases), cell cycle control (e.g., cyclins), transport (e.g., of amino acids, ammonium, sugars) and defense/secondary metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450’s, GDSL esterases/lipases, β-1,3-glucanases). Very few of these genes were JA-responsive according to the data of Martel et al.   39 . Next, we searched the microarray data for genes that were down-regulated in the Al samples but were not differentially regulated in Tu samples. This yielded a set of 715 genes (the top 25 is presented in  Table S8), many of these appeared to be involved in photosynthesis (e.g., subunits of photosystem I or II, chlorophyll A-B binding proteins, thylakoid proteins), which is in line with the gene set enrichment analysis ( Table S2B). Furthermore, several of the Al (and Tu+Al)-specific DEGs coded for hormone-responsive proteins, but genes encoding proteins that were responsive to the same hormone were present in the lists of up-regulated as well as down-regulated genes, as discussed in the previous section. Compared with the non-infested controls, there were 1179 tomato genes whose expression was significantly down-regulated in  T. urticae-infested leaves ( Table S1). In total 401 of these genes, i.e., 34%, were no longer down-regulated in leaves dual infested with  T. urticae and  T. evansi. Among them are some of the genes that are strongly down-regulated in the Tu samples ( Table S9) and/or that may be linked to plant defense/susceptibility, such as: putative pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs: Solyc11g056680, Solyc01g107670), CHS1, CHS2, a sucrose synthase (Solyc07g042520) and pectate lyases (Solyc05g014000, Solyc06g083580). As we were unable to verify this gene expression pattern for  CHS1 and  CHS2 by means of qPCRs ( Figure S2A,B), this result may in part be explained by the statistical methods employed to analyze the transcriptomic data. However, the number of genes that is no longer down-regulated in Tu+Te versus Tu seems disproportionally large with respect to the absolute difference in down-regulated genes between these samples, which is 196 genes ( Table S1). We did not find anything similar for the Tu+Al versus Tu comparison, in which 72 of the 1179 genes (6.1%) were no longer down-regulated in leaves dual infested with  T. urticae and  A. lycopersici as compared to in  T. urticae-infested leaves. The total number of down-regulated genes is much larger for the Tu+Al samples than for the Tu+Te ones ( Figure 2A;  Table S1). These results suggest that  T. evansi not only suppresses induced defenses, but also counteracts the down-regulation of plant responses triggered by  T. urticae. 2.2.3. Hormonal Crosstalk To gather more insight into whether or not  T. evansi and/or  A. lycopersici suppress plant defenses by exploiting crosstalk mechanisms with other phytohormones, we surveyed expression profiles of DEGs (putatively) involved in the biosynthesis of- and signaling by abscisic acid, auxin, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, ethylene and gibberellins ( Figure S3). In short, there was no clear indication for crosstalk between any of these hormones and the JA or SA pathway, for four main reasons. (i) Most DEGs associated with hormones that primarily regulate growth and development (“G&D”) were regulated similarly in plants infested with defense-inducing  T. urticae versus in plants infested with defense-suppressing  T. evansi or  A. lycopersici. Only one G&D hormone-DEG (Solyc01g107400, a putative IAA-amido synthetase) had a contrasting expression pattern; it was up-regulated in Al, but down-regulated in Tu. (ii) Each G&D hormone pathway consisted of a mixture of up and down-regulated DEGs. No pathway was uniformly regulated in response to any of the mite-infestation treatments. (iii) The magnitude of FCs was lower for G&D hormone-DEGs than for DEGs of the JA and SA pathways. Several of the most highly up-regulated (putative) G&D hormone-DEGs, including Solyc01g107390 (auxin-responsive  GH3), Solyc04g080820 ( cytokinin oxidase 4) and Solyc07g049530 (ethylene biosynthesis gene  ACC oxidase), are actually also responsive to JA   39 . (iv) G&D hormone pathways, or subsections thereof, did not surface in our enrichment analyses. In Tu+Te samples, the magnitude of FCs of various G&D hormone-DEGs was reduced as compared to their expression in Tu. This was observed for up as well as down-regulated genes in all hormone pathways. The opposite expression pattern (an additive response) was apparent when Tu+Al samples were compared with Tu ( Figure S3). 2.1. Defense-Associated Phytohormones Consistent with previous studies on tomato-mite interactions   23, 33, 54 , higher concentrations of jasmonates and SA were detected after seven days of infestation with  T. urticae (Tu) when compared to the non-infested control (C) plants ( Figure 1). Note that mites from this  T. urticae strain were originally collected from spindle tree ( Euonymus europaeus), have subsequently been propagated on bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris) for over ten years and, hence, are not adapted to tomato (see  Section 4.2 Mites). Leaflets infested with  A. lycopersici (Al) also contained higher amounts of defense-associated hormones, however the concentrations were consistently about two-fold lower than in the Tu samples. The infestation with  T. evansi (Te) resulted in even smaller increases in the amounts of JA-Ile and SA, while no significant changes were detected for the JA-Ile precursors 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and JA. In general, the phytohormonal profiles of dual-infested leaflets were most similar to those of the Tu treatment ( Figure 1). Yet, in leaflets infested with  T. urticae plus  T. evansi (Tu+Te), the JA concentration was intermediate as compared to that of each of the respective single infestations. Similarly, the amount of OPDA in leaflets infested with  T. urticae plus  A. lycopersici (Tu+Al) was intermediate as compared to OPDA amounts measured in the Tu and Al samples. By contrast, JA-Ile was most abundant in Tu+Al samples, indicative of an additive response.","Tomato plants are attacked by diverse herbivorous arthropods, including by cell-content-feeding mites, such as the extreme generalist  Tetranychus urticae  and specialists like  Tetranychus evansi  and  Aculops lycopersici . Mite feeding induces plant defense responses that reduce mite performance. However,  T. evansi  and  A. lycopersici  suppress plant defenses via poorly understood mechanisms and, consequently, maintain a high performance on tomato. On a shared host,  T. urticae  can be facilitated by either of the specialist mites, likely due to the suppression of plant defenses. To better understand defense suppression and indirect plant-mediated interactions between herbivorous mites, we used gene-expression microarrays to analyze the transcriptomic changes in tomato after attack by either a single mite species ( T. urticae ,  T. evansi ,  A. lycopersici ) or two species simultaneously ( T. urticae  plus  T. evansi  or  T. urticae  plus  A. lycopersici ). Additionally, we assessed mite-induced changes in defense-associated phytohormones using LC-MS/MS. Compared to non-infested controls, jasmonates (JAs) and salicylate (SA) accumulated to higher amounts upon all mite-infestation treatments, but the response was attenuated after single infestations with defense-suppressors. Strikingly, whereas 8 to 10% of tomato genes were differentially expressed upon single infestations with  T. urticae  or  A. lycopersici , respectively, only 0.1% was altered in  T. evansi -infested plants. Transcriptome analysis of dual-infested leaves revealed that  A. lycopersici  primarily suppressed  T. urticae -induced JA defenses, while  T. evansi  dampened  T. urticae -triggered host responses on a transcriptome-wide scale. The latter suggests that  T. evansi  not solely down-regulates plant gene expression, but rather directs it back towards housekeeping levels. Our results provide valuable new insights into the mechanisms underlying host defense suppression and the plant-mediated facilitation of competing herbivores."," 'Facilitation', 'Herbivore', 'plant defense', 'Comparative Transcriptomics', 'Dual Infestation', 'Defense Suppression', 'Plant-mediated Interactions', 'Tomato Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus Evansi)', 'Tomato Russet Mite (Aculops Lycopersici)', 'Two-spotted Spider Mite (Tetranychus Urticae)' "," 'genes', 'Figure', 'samples', 'expression', 'Table', 'down-regulated', 'gene', 'up-regulated', 'down-regulated genes', 'DEGs' "," Tu, Al, Al, Tu+Al, Tu+Te, Alba, SA, Tu+Te, top-31, evansi-suppressed, SA, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, isochorismate synthase, Solyc06g071030, chorismate mutase, Solyc02g088460, Tu+Te, Tu, Tu+Al, Al, PPA-AT, Solyc04g054710, arogenate dehydratase, Solyc05g056170, Al, Tu+Al, Tu+Te, SA, SAGTs, SA hydroxylases, SA, SAMT, Solyc09g091550, SAMT, SA, SA, Solyc07g040690, NPR1, Solyc07g044980, Tu+Te, Tu, Tu+Al, Al, Tu+Te, Tu, Tu+Al, Al, flavonoid/anthocyanin, lignin-biosynthesis, Solyc06g068440, Solyc03g116910, Tu+Al, CAD-encoding, Solyc02g030480, Tu+Al, Al, peroxidase, laccase-encoding, Tu+Te, Tu, Tu+Al, Al, C4H, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, compound(s, flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase, flavonoid 3’,5’-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol reductase  DFR , anthocyanidin synthase  ANS , transferase (HQT), ρ-coumarate 3’-hydroxylase, Solyc07g005760, Tu+Al, Al, C3H-encoding, chalcone synthase (CHS)-encoding, chalcone isomerase (CHI)-encoding, Tu+Al, Al, Tu+Te, S2A, MYB12, AN2/MYB75, JAF13/bHLH90, Tu+Al, E)-nerolidol, TPS5/MTS1, geranyl diphosphate, Tu+Te, TPS46/GLS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPP, TPS46/GLS, E)-nerolidol, Tu+Te, Tu+Al, Al samples, TPS5/MTS1, TPS37, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, AACT, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl- d-erythritol kinase, Al samples, α-, β-phellandrene   98 , GGPP, GGPSs  , prenyltransferase, C 55–C 80)-generating enzyme   106 , CPT5, plant-mite, lycopersici-suppressed, evansi-suppressed, Al, S5, JA-regulated defense responses, phospholipases, LOXs, OPDA reductase 3, OPR3, Tu+Te, Tu, PLA1, Al, LOXs, jasmonate methyltransferase (JMT)-encoding, Solyc02g084950, Tu+Al, Al, JAR1, JA, mite-infested, JA-induced, proteinase/protease inhibitors, arginases   62 , Laps, TDs, Solyc03g098760, PIs, PPO, Al, PIs, arginase, PPO, Al-DEGs, S5, Tu, Tu+Al, Tu+Te, S1A–G, Solyc03g098720, dual-infested plants, Solyc03g098740, Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor (, S1D, SGAs, GLYCOALKALOID, MYC2, JRE4, Tu+Al, Al, sugar-attachment, α-tomatine, green tomato tissues  , JRE4, S2C, D, sterol composition, ≥, ≤, “, ”, Tu+Te, Al, Solyc12g040860, glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase, Tu+Te, Al-DEGs, Al, Tu+Al, 30,868, ≤, Al, Tu+Te, 2, Tu-specific, Te-DEGs, Al samples, Tu+Te, Tu, “, ”, “pigment, ”, Tu+Al, Al samples, “, ”, “, ”, Te-DEGs, Tu+Te, Tu, Tu+Al, Al, “, pollen”, “, ”, “hydrogen peroxide, ”, “chitin, ”, S2A, “, ”, “, ”, “chlorophyll, ”, Tu+Al, Al samples, urticae-Induced, Al, Al, Tu, expansins, peroxidases, cyclins, defense/secondary, cytochrome P450’s, GDSL esterases/lipases, β-1,3-glucanases, Al, photosystem I, Al, Tu+Al)-specific, PRRs, Solyc11g056680, Solyc01g107670, CHS1, sucrose synthase, Solyc07g042520, pectate lyases, Solyc05g014000, Solyc06g083580, S2A, Tu+Te, Tu, Tu+Te, abscisic acid, auxin, SA, “G&D”, hormone-DEG, Solyc01g107400, IAA-amido synthetase, Al, SA, Solyc01g107390, Solyc04g080820, cytokinin oxidase 4, Solyc07g049530, Tu+Te, G&D hormone-DEGs, Tu, tomato-mite, SA, Al, SA, Tu+Te, Al "," 'TPS', 'TPS5/MTS1', 'TPS46/GLS,', 'TPS5/MTS1', 'TPS5/MTS1', 'TPS46/GLS,', 'TPS46/GLS', 'TPS46/GLS', 'TPS5/MTS1', 'TPS37', 'TPS5/MTS1', 'TPS37', 'TPS5/MTS1', 'TPS37,', 'TPS20/PHS1', '(TPS)', 'TPS20/PHS1', 'TPS20/PHS1', 'TPS20/PHS1,', 'TPS17', 'TPS21', 'TPS17', 'TPS21' ",  ,  ,terpene synthase
30,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC4473991/eupmc_result.json,PMC4473991,"Results Phylogenetic analysis of  TPS genes from dwarf ylang ylang flowers Terpenes were the major VOCs of dwarf ylang ylang flowers. From the dwarf ylang ylang RNA-seq data, four full-length ORFs of  TPS genes were PCR amplified from cDNA pools of the flowers. Phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences of four  CoTPS cDNAs showed that CoTPS2 (561 aa) belonged to the TPS-a subfamily representing the sesqui-TPSs, whereas CoTPS1 (590 aa) and CoTPS3 (547 aa) fell into the TPS-b subfamily, which consists mainly of mono-TPSs ( Chen   et al., 2011 ;  Fig. 4A). CoTPS4 (586 aa) is a member of the TPS-g subfamily, which lacks the R(R)X 8W motif in the N-terminal region of mono-TPSs and produces acyclic monoterpenes ( Dudareva   et al., 2003 ;  Yuan   et al., 2008 ;  Chen   et al., 2011 ;  Fig. 4A). All four CoTPSs had the conserved aspartate-rich motif (DDXXD) and NSE/DTE motifs that chelate divalent metal ions, typically Mg 2+, in the C-terminal domain ( Fig. 4B). Both motifs are required for cyclization of the universal acyclic terpene precursors, such as GPP and FPP, to synthesize mono- and sesqui-terpene, respectively ( Chen   et al., 2011 ). The arginine-tryptophan motif, R(R)X 8W, present at the N terminus of most mono-TPS and in some sesqui-TPS and di-TPS, was found in CoTPS1, CoTPS2, and CoTPS3 but not in CoTPS4 ( Fig. 4B). One of the distinguishing structural features between mono- and sesqui-TPS is the presence of an N-terminal plastid transit peptide (Tp) sequence. Using the signal sequence analysis programs ChloroP ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP) and WoLF PSORT ( http://www.genscript.com/psort/wolf_psort.html), a putative N-terminal plastid Tp sequence of 41 and 35 aa for CoTPS1 and CoTPS4, respectively, was predicted, indicating they are likely to be mono-TPSs. However, we could not find a putative plastid Tp sequence for CoTPS3, which was supposed to be a mono-TPS belonging to the TPS-b subfamily. CoTPS2 did not contain a plastid Tp sequence, which correlated well with the prediction of it being a sesqui-TPS. The amino acid sequences of CoTPS1 and CoTPS2 had highest identity with the magnolia ( Magnolia grandiflora) TPSs Mg17 (70% similarity, 54% identity) and Mg25 (72% similarity, 55% identity) for α-terpineol and β-cubebene, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S9A, B, available at  JXB online) ( Lee and Chappell, 2008). CoTPS3 showed 65% amino acid similarity and 47% identity with mountain pepper ( Litsea cubeba)  trans-ocimene synthase ( Supplementary Fig. S9C) ( Chang and Chu, 2011). CoTPS4 was most similar to geraniol synthase from Madagascar periwinkle ( Catharanthus roseus) (92% similarity, 84% identity;  Supplementary Fig. S9D) ( Simkin   et al., 2013 ). Functional characterization of CoTPS  in vivo We further investigated whether CoTPSs would produce the same terpene products  in vivo using  Agrobacterium-mediated transient gene expression in tobacco leaves. The YFP-fused CoTPS1, CoTPS2, CoTPS3, or CoTPS4 was expressed in  N. benthamiana with or without co-expression of  Arabidopsis HMGR. HMGR catalyses a rate-limiting step of the MVA pathway and its overexpression is known to increases heterologous sesquiterpene production ( Song   et al., 2012 ;  Jin   et al., 2014 ). Analysis by GC-MS showed that the  in vivo results were consistent with those obtained  in vitro. CoTPS2–YFP clearly produced three compounds, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene, when it was co-expressed with AtHMGR ( Fig. 8A), whereas Co-TPS3 produced α-bergamotene when co-expressed with AtHMGR ( Fig. 8B). The expression of CoTPS2 or CoTPS3 alone without AtHMGR in  N. benthamiana did not produce any terpenes, which may be due to limiting amounts of the substrate, FPP ( Supplementary Fig. S12, available at  JXB online). CoTPS1 and CoTPS4 characterized as mono-TPS  in vitro failed to produce any new peaks  in planta, suggesting that they might require the co-expression of additional genes, probably a rate-limiting step in the non-MVA pathway. Alternatively, compounds formed by these TPSs might be further metabolized endogenously by the plants. RNA-seq analysis of different biosynthetic pathways active in flowers GC-MS analysis of the mature flowers showed that the majority of VOCs were terpenes. We used our RNA-seq data to analyse the expression profile of genes encoding enzymes for the precursor pathways leading to the formation of VOCs in mature flowers. The majority of ylang ylang orthologue unigenes were full length and showed high sequence similarity to known enzymes of these pathways from other plants ( Supplementary Fig. S6, available at  JXB online). The MEP and MVA pathways are the pathways leading to the formation of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Transcripts of all the enzyme genes involved in these two pathways were detected in our RNA-seq data, and their expression was validated by qRT-PCR ( Fig. 3). Additionally, the expression of these enzyme genes was also examined at earlier stages of flower development and in leaves by qRT-PCR. Genes encoding the MEP and MVA enzymes were active in all stages of flower development consistent with the high production of terpenes in the flowers ( Fig. 3A,  B). It has been reported that 1-deoxy- d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), the first enzyme of the MEP pathway, is important for the overall regulation of the pathway and is encoded by a small gene family ( Cordoba   et al., 2011 ). From our RNA-seq data, we were able to identify four different  DXS unigenes showing different levels of abundance in flowers and leaf. One of these,  DXS3, belonging to clade 2, which may be related to secondary metabolism ( Walter   et al., 2002 ;  Phillips   et al., 2007 ), was highly induced in stage III flowers ( Fig. 3A and  Supplementary Figs S7 and Fig. S8, available at  JXB online). The majority of the genes, except phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL), for the shikimate pathway enzymes, which produce phenylalanine for the production of benzonoids and phenylproponids, appeared to be expressed more in mature flowers ( Fig. 3C,  D). The significant benzenoids in VOCs were benzyl benzoate and benzyl salicylate, and the phenylproponoid was eugenol. These compounds were detected only in mature flowers (#18, #39, and #45,  Fig. 1B,  Table 1). Previous  in vitro experiments have indicated that benzyl benzoate might play a role in pollinator attraction ( Hoballah   et al., 2005 ;  Huber   et al., 2005 ) or in plant defence (miticide) ( Harju   et al., 2004 ). Functional characterization of CoTPSs CoTPS3 is a member of the TPS-b family with the unusual feature that it lacks a putative N-terminal Tp sequence. Our enzyme assays showed that CoTPS3 catalysed the formation of α-bergamotene from FPP ( Fig. 7C), which is a major sesquiterpene produced in the flowers of ylang ylang (#30,  Fig. 1,  Table 1). CoTPS4, which belongs to TPS-g family, was capable of utilizing GPP to synthesize an acyclic monoterpene, geraniol ( Fig. 7D). This was confirmed by comparison of retention time and mass spectra with those of an authentic standard ( Supplementary Fig. S11). This result was expected, as the protein showed the highest amino acid identity with geraniol synthases (84%) from Madagascar periwinkle ( Supplementary Fig. S9D) ( Simkin   et al., 2013 ). However, geraniol was not detected in our GC-MS analysis of ylang ylang flowers. The subcellular localization of each CoTPS–YFP fusion protein provided us with preliminary evidence to elucidate the function of each TPS. The exact functional annotation of a new TPS requires activity characterization of the recombinant protein. To determine the enzymatic activity of CoTPSs  in vitro, 6His-tagged CoTPS recombinant proteins purified from  E. coli BL21(DE3) ( Supplementary Fig. S10, available at  JXB online) were used for  in vitro assays. GPP (C10) or FPP (C15) was used as the common substrate for mono- and sesqui-TPS, respectively. Control assays using heat-inactivated recombinant 6His-tagged CoTPSs did not form any terpenes from GPP or FPP ( Supplementary Fig. S11, available at  JXB online).  Figure 7A shows that CoTPS1, a member of the TPS-b family, synthesized four products corresponding to β-thujene, sabinene, β-pinene, and α-terpinene from GPP, but not from FPP, which were found in the essential oil profiles of dwarf ylang ylang flowers (#1, #4, #5 and #7,  Fig. 1,  Table 1). These results suggested that CoTPS1 is a multifunctional β-thujene/sabinene/β-pinene/α-terpinene synthase that is able to catalyse the synthesis of a mixture of monoterpenes, namely β-thujene, sabinene, β-pinene, and α-terpinene. This is not surprising, as several multiproduct mono-TPSs that produce similar compounds, such as α-thujene, sabinene, α/β-pinene, α/γ-terpinene, have been reported widely in other plant species ( Lücker   et al., 2002 ;  Chen   et al., 2003 ;  Fäldt   et al., 2003 ;  Shimada   et al., 2004 ;  Fähnrich   et al., 2011 ). Similarly, recombinant CoTPS2 catalysed the synthesis of three compounds, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene, from FPP. CoTPS2 is a multifunctional β-ylangene/β-copaene/β-cubebene synthase capable of producing three sesquiterpenes, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene ( Fig. 7B). Many sesqui-TPSs are also known to be multifunctional ( Steele   et al., 1998 ;  Lee and Chappell, 2008). However, TPSs that produce β-ylangene/β-copaene/β-cubebene have not yet been reported. Of these three sesquiterpene compounds, we could only detect β-ylangene and β-cubebene in the flowers of dwarf ylang ylang (#23 and #27,  Fig. 1,  Table 1). Subcellular localization and expression of the four CoTPSs As well as phylogenetic analysis and bioinformatics-based attempts to classify TPSs, their subcellular localization is also important for function prediction. This was especially true for CoTPS3, since its function was unpredictable from the bioinformatics analyses based on amino acid sequences. To address this issue, we transiently expressed the full-length ORF of each CoTPS fused to a YFP reporter gene to produce a CoTPS–YFP fusion protein in  N. benthamiana leaves using  Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration.  Figure 5 shows that CoTPS1–YFP and CoTPS4–YFP, which had the N-terminal plastid Tp sequence, were localized in chloroplasts as expected, whereas CoTPS2–YFP and CoTPS3–YFP were distributed throughout the cytosol. Based on the results of the subcellular localization experiments, it is likely that CoTPS1 and CoTPS4 are involved in monoterpene synthesis in plastids, whereas CoTPS2 and CoTPS3 might produce sesquiterpenes in the cytosol. The transcript levels for the four  CoTPS genes at different developmental stages of dwarf ylang ylang flowers were examined by qRT-PCR. The expression levels of all four transcripts were very low or below detection limits in leaf tissues but greatly elevated in flower tissues ( Fig. 6). Transcripts for three  TPS genes,  CoTPS1,  CoTPS3, and  CoTPS4, were highest in mature green flowers (II), whereas  CoTPS2 was highly expressed at the floral bud stage ( Fig. 6). Stage-specific variations of VOCs in dwarf ylang ylang flowers Flowers can emit different volatile compounds at different stages of development ( Dudareva   et al., 2000 ). Dwarf ylang ylang flowers have little floral scent when the petals are green, but their scent gradually becomes stronger as the flower matures. To examine the overall intensity and the diversity of the floral scent during flower development, total essential oils from flowers at four different stages of development were analysed by GC-MS ( Fig. 1).  Figure 1B and  Supplementary Fig. S1 show that the chemical composition of the essential oils from the floral bud stage to the three different stages of open flower development was very diverse, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Only 15 compounds that had meaningful levels of >0.1% of total volatile compounds were detected from floral buds ( Fig. 1B,  Table 1). The number of peaks increased progressively during maturation of flower buds into fully open flowers. More than 20, 27, and 45 volatile compounds were obtained from the three different stages of flower development: undeveloped small flower (I), mature green flower (II), and fully mature yellow flower (III). Hence, the fully mature stage represents the stage where there was maximum production of VOCs by the flowers. At this stage, the majority of the volatiles were terpenes with a few benzenoid/phenolpropanoid compounds. Out of 45 compounds identified, 31 were identified as mono- and sesquiterpenes using the mass spectra reference library ( Fig. 1B and  Table 1). Interestingly, >90% of the total identified terpenes were sesquiterpenes consisting of α-farnesene (31.50%), α-bergamotene (26.79%), germacrene D (13.26%), β-caryophyllene (11.57%), humulene (1.63%), farnesol (0.75%),  trans-β-farnesene (0.77%), and β-ylangen (0.63%), whereas monoterpenes were quantitatively less than 10%, comprising mainly  cis-β-ocimene (1.99%),  trans-β-ocimene (1.55%), and β-linalool (1.40%). Other aromatic compounds comprised <3%. The relative amounts of all identified volatiles are shown in  Table 1 (see mature yellow flowers, III). Dried yellow flowers of ylang ylang also showed a similar volatile composition ( Supplementary Fig. S2A, available at  JXB online). Compared with flowers, ylang ylang leaves contained very low levels of terpenes, comprising mainly α-pinene, β-caryophyllene, germacrene D, and phytol ( Supplementary Fig. S2B). Two sesquiterpenes, germacrene D and β-caryophyllene, could be found at all stages of development, and their levels were retained or slightly decreased during open flower development (#22 and #28,  Fig. 1B, and  Supplementary Fig. S3, available at  JXB online). However, the other two major sesquiterpenes, α-farnesene and α-bergamotene, were undetectable at the floral bud stage but were found during early flower development (#29 and #30 in I,  Fig. 1B, and  Supplementary Fig. S3) and subsequently became the most abundant components of essential oils at mature stages of flower development (II and III,  Fig. 1B). Interestingly, most of the monoterpenes except α-pinene were undetectable at the floral bud stage, but they gradually increased during open flower development ( Fig. 1B). Among the monoterpenes,  trans-β-ocimene, β-ocimene, and β-linalool were highly inducible during flower maturation (#9, #10, and #13,  Fig. 1B). Additionally, our GC-MS analysis identified several sesquiterpenes or sesquiterpene alcohols that decreased during flower maturation such as δ-elemene (#46), α-ylangene (#47), γ-cadinene (#48), and α-copaene-11-ol (#49). Other aromatic compounds such as benzenoid/phenolpropanoid and volatile fatty acids were found almost exclusively in mature yellow flowers ( Fig. 1B and  Supplementary Fig. S1,  Table 1). GC-MS analysis of flowers at night did not show any change in VOC profile, suggesting that there are no significant diurnal changes in the emission pattern ( Supplementary Fig. S4, available at  JXB online). RNA sequencing,  de novo assembly, and annotation of the transcriptome To profile the dwarf ylang ylang floral transcriptome, we sequenced RNA-seq libraries synthesized from the mature yellow flowers. Illumina sequencing runs generated more than 110 million reads of 101bp, and the quality of reads was evaluated by FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) ( Supplementary Fig. S5, available at  JXB online). Due to the absence of reference genomic sequences for ylang ylang, the Trinity method was used for  de novo assembly of short sequence reads ( Grabherr   et al., 2011 ). These assemblies generated a total of 45 379 unigenes with an N50 value of 2016bp ( Table 2). The assembled unigenes were BLASTed against the National Centre for Biotechnology Information non-redundant (nr) protein database and protein databases for  Arabidopsis thaliana,  Vitis vinifera, and  Oryza sativa. Among 45 379 unigenes, 30 539 unigenes (67.3%) were annotated through a BlastX search with E-values ≤1e–3 ( Table 2). Functional classifications of Gene Ontology (GO) terms of all unigenes were performed using Trinotate ( Quevillon   et al., 2005 ).  Figure 2 shows enriched GO terms for the top 1000 highly expressed transcripts. From our annotated unigenes, 16 were identified as TPSs that were more than 500bp. Of these, four unigenes contained full-length ORFs encoding TPS.","The pleasant fragrance of ylang ylang varieties (Cananga odorata) is mainly due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the flowers. Floral scents are a key factor in plant-insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to β-thujene, sabinene, β-pinene, and α-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate. The other two TPSs were identified as sesqui-TPSs. CoTPS3 catalysed the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to α-bergamotene, whereas CoTPS2 was found to be a multifunctional and novel TPS that could catalyse the synthesis of three sesquiterpenes, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene. Additionally, the activities of the two sesqui-TPSs were confirmed in planta by transient expression of these TPS genes in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration."," 'Terpene synthase', 'volatile organic compounds', 'terpenes', 'Floral Scent', 'Cananga Odorata Var.

Worldwide, more and more attention is deserved to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which establish symbioses with the roots of most land plants and facilitate plant nutrient uptake, by means of a large network of extraradical hyphae spreading from colonized roots to the surrounding soil and functioning as a supplementary absorbing system. AMF protect plants from biotic and abiotic stresses and are able to modulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (phytochemicals), such as polyphenols, anthocyanins, phytoestrogens and carotenoids, that play a fundamental role in promoting human health. An increasing number of studies focused on the use of AMF symbionts for the production of functional food, with enhanced nutritional and nutraceutical value. Yet, while several plant species were investigated, only few AMF were utilized, thus limiting the full exploitation of their wide physiological and genetic diversity. Here, we will focus on AMF effects on the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites with health-promoting activity, and on the criteria for a finely tuned, targeted selection of the best performing symbionts, to be utilized as sustainable biotechnological tools for the production of safe and healthy plant foods."," 'Sustainable agriculture', 'Healthy Food', 'Nutraceutical Value', 'Amf Functional Diversity', 'Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbionts', 'Health-promoting Phytochemicals', 'Secondary Metabolism Gene Regulation' ",  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,NaN
32,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC4963619/eupmc_result.json,PMC4963619,"Results and Discussion De Novo Assembly and Functional Annotation Aromatic grasses have been widely studied in terms of their essential oil composition but there are limited studies on its essential oil biosynthesis, which could be due to non-availability of genomic resources. Here, we have generated  C. flexuosus leaf transcriptomic data using Illumina HiSeq2000 platform that has been used for sequencing many economically important monocots ( Shahin et al., 2012;  Davey et al., 2013). The transcript assembly details are provided in  Table   1. Majority of the transcripts were between 150 and 1000 bases (75,261 transcripts) followed by 1000–2000 bases (14,565 transcripts) (Supplementary Figure  S1A). The average length (635 bases), GC content (49.89%), and N50 values for the assembled transcripts were within the range of other monocot transcriptomes from  Zea mays ( Hansey et al., 2012),  Lilium genus ( Shahin et al., 2012;  Du et al., 2015), and  Musa balbisiana ( Davey et al., 2013), which were assembled using the same sequencing platform. Of the total transcripts, 92,139 (99%) with FPKM of  >1 (Supplementary Figure  S1B) were subjected to BLASTX against different databases and the annotation summary is provided in Supplementary Table  S2. The results showed that 82.80% (76,293) transcripts had at least one significant hit against NCBI non-redundant (Nr) protein database, with ∼ 98% having similarity of >60% at protein level, indicating high protein conservation (Supplementary Figures  S1C,D). Organism distribution in NCBI annotations showed presence of 906 organisms that contained homologous genes for  C. flexuosus transcripts with top 5 organisms belonging to Poaceae family.  Oryza sativa ssp. japonica showed highest coverage with 39.6% (30,235) followed by  Sorghum bicolor and  Z. mays with 23.5% (17,909) and 14.36% (10,962), respectively (Supplementary Figure  S2). In total, 69,984 transcripts represented 5,281 GO terms distributed among three main ontologies comprising molecular function (MF), cellular components (CC), and biological processes (BP) (Supplementary Figure  S3). Various GO assignments of classified unigenes revealed the diversity of transcripts represented in lemongrass transcriptome. Since, trancription factors (TFs) play key role in regulating gene expression and metabolite accumulation in different metabolic pathways, a BLASTX search against AGRIS was performed that resulted in 5,867 transcripts (6.37%) with “transcription factor activity” belonging to 44 known TF families (Supplementary Figure  S4). The top 5 hits of TFs were represented by Trihelix, C2H2, C3H, bHLH, and WRKY class. Further analysis and characterization of TFs from the transcriptome data could give insights into their role in regulating monoterpene biosynthesis in  Cymbopogon. Overall, 76,409 (82.92%) transcripts significantly corresponded to known or unknown proteins present in public databases. A significant number of 15,730 (17.07%) transcripts remained unannotated, which may belong to untranslated regions, non-coding RNAs, intergenic spacers ( Liu et al., 2012), or may be unique to  C. flexuosus and can be a great resource for the discovery of novel genes. SSR Mining and Distribution Analysis Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are tandem repeats of DNA sequences present in abundance and are distributed throughout the genome ( Liu et al., 2013). They are highly versatile PCR-based markers, which are successfully used in marker-assisted selection (MAS), comparative genomics, genetic diversity, and evolutionary studies ( Liu et al., 2013). Transcriptome SSR markers, also called as genic-SSRs or EST-SSRs, exhibit high inter-specific transferability as they are located in the coding region of the gene in contrast to genomic SSRs ( Liu et al., 2013). Although several molecular markers consisting of RAPD, ISSR, and genomic SSRs have been developed ( Khanuja et al., 2005;  Kumar et al., 2007;  Adhikari et al., 2015;  Bishoyi et al., 2016), so far no genic-SSRs are available for  Cymbopogon. In recent years, NGS technologies has massively increased the number of SSR markers discovered for both major crops and non-model plant species including  Lilium ( Shahin et al., 2012),  O. sativa ( Miah et al., 2013), and  Setaria viridis ( Xu et al., 2013). Here, for the first time we have mined genic/EST SSRs from lemongrass transcriptome that can be utilized for further crop improvement. Mining of assembled transcripts from  C. flexuosus leaf transcriptome resulted in 10,715 (11.5%) transcripts containing 12,968 promising SSRs, of which 1,805 (16.8%) sequences contained >1 SSRs (Supplementary Table  S7). A total of 966 SSRs were found to be present in compound formation (Supplementary Table  S7). For the motif type, tri-nucleotide (59.8%) repeats were most abundant, followed by mono- (24.2%) and di- nucleotide repeats (13.1%) ( Figure   8 and Supplementary Table  S7), which was consistent with earlier reports on other monocot species ( Davey et al., 2013;  Miah et al., 2013). The most common tri-nucleotide repeats were CCG/CGG in lemongrass ( Figure   8 and Supplementary Table  S8), which was also previously reported for  Cymbopogon jwarancusa using genomic library ( Kumar et al., 2007). The abundance of CCG repeats has been observed as a special feature of monocot genomes attributed to their higher GC content ( Morgante et al., 2002). The most common mono- and di-nucleotide repeats were A/T and AG/CT, respectively ( Figure   8 and Supplementary Table  S8). Several SSR motifs were linked to transcripts of several secondary metabolic pathways including terpenoid pathways with 6 and 9 SSR motifs linked to MEP pathway and MVA pathway, respectively (Supplementary Tables  S3 and  S4). In addition, SSR motifs linked to genes involved in other pathways such as steroid, brassinosteroid, alkaloid and phenylpropanoid were also found (Supplementary Table  S4). Among the short listed candidates possibly involved in essential oil biosynthesis, transcripts encoding CfPPase1, CfADH1, and CfADH2a contained (AG)6 and (GCC)5ggccgatccgccgcccggcgatgatg(CGT)5 at 5′ UTR, (A)19 at 5′ UTR, and (GGC)5 within the ORF, respectively. Similar to our observation, it has been previously reported that dinucleotide SSR motifs are located in the 5′ UTRs or in the introns of the genes, which are known to regulate promoter activity ( Morgante and Olivieri, 1993;  Debrauwere et al., 1997). The presence of trinucleotide motifs in the ORF of the genes can be attributed to the tolerance for frame shift mutations in coding regions ( Richard and Dujon, 1997;  Varshney et al., 2005). The genic/EST-SSRs generated in this study hold great potential for identifying functional markers and will aid in genetic and genomic studies in  Cymbopogon as they are better tools than other markers because of their co-dominant inheritance, multi-allelic nature, and high reproducibility ( Zhao et al., 2012). The role of these motifs in pathway genes containing SSRs needs to be further investigated in  Cymbopogon. Comparative Essential Oil Profiling and Gene Expression Analysis As aldehydes (GAL, NAL, and CAL) are reported to be formed  via different routes involving ADH/AKR ( Iijima et al., 2006;  Sato-Masumoto and Ito, 2014) and CCD ( Ilg et al., 2009,  2014), the expression of transcripts encoding the respective enzymes were analyzed. Of 9  ADH candidates used for phylogeny ( Figure   3A),  ADH1, ADH2a, ADH3b, and  ADH4 having highest FPKM were used for expression analysis. In addition, all 3  AKR candidates were used for expression analyses. All 4  ADH candidates showed differential expression with varying levels among the three species analyzed ( Figure   5). While expression of  ADH2a, ADH3b, ADH4, and  AKR2b was highest in  C. winterianus, ADH1 exhibited highest expression in  C.  flexuosus.  AKR1 and  AKR2a showed basal level of expression in all species as compared to  AKR2b ( Figure   5). The expression of all four  ADH candidates was least in  C. martinii and  AKR2b was least in  C. flexuosus ( Figure   5). In  C. flexuosus, the expression of  ADH1, ADH2a, and  AKR2b, and  ADH3b and  ADH4 was higher in leaf and root, respectively ( Figure   6 and Supplementary Figure  S8C). The species and tissue specific expression of  ADH1, and  ADH2a and  AKR2b was in agreement with citral and CAL content, respectively ( Rao et al., 2015) ( Figures   4B and  5). A similar trend in  ZoGeDH expression and GAL content was reported in ginger tissues ( Iijima et al., 2014). The higher expression of  ADH3b and  ADH4 in roots compared to leaf implied that they may not be involved in monoterpene aldehyde formation (Supplementary Figure  S8C). The transcript encoding CCD1 exhibited highest expression in  C. flexuosus, followed by  C. winterianus (80%) with negligible expression in  C. martinii, which corroborated with the aldehyde (citral and CAL) content in respective species ( Figures   4B and  5). Similar to  CfADH1, CfADH2a and  CfAKR2b, expression of  CfCCD1 was consistent with the aldehyde content in leaf of  C. flexuosus ( Figure   6). As suggested for aldehyde formation in  O. basilicum ( Iijima et al., 2006), multiple enzymes (ADH1, ADH2a, AKR2b, and CCD1) could be responsible for differential accumulation of different aldehydes in  Cymbopogon species. The chemical diversity in essential oil imparts different fragrances to aromatic grasses, which could be due to the differential expression of genes involved in conversion of basic substrate into their derivatives. Also, it has been reported in many plant species that the level of terpenoid volatiles correlates with the expression of corresponding genes ( Nagegowda, 2010). Hence, comparative gene expression and metabolite analyses could further facilitate narrowing down the possible gene candidates involved in essential oil formation. Since strong homology of gene sequences exists among the closely related species within the same genus, gene specific primers, designed based on lemongrass transcriptome, were used for determining the expression levels in all three  Cymbopogon species that accumulate varying composition of monoterpenes ( Lavania et al., 2012). First, leaf essential oils of  C. flexuosus, C. winterianus, C. martinii, and inflorescence of  C. martinii were analyzed ( Figure   4A and Supplementary Figure  S7).  C. flexuosus (group I - aldehyde type) was rich in GAL (42%) and NAL (33%) which are together called as citral with relatively trace amounts of GOL and GA ( Figure   4B). Essential oil of  C. winterinus (group II- intermediate type) was well represented by different levels of various monoterpene derivatives with CAL (39%) representing the major constituent followed by 21% of alcohols (GOL and COL) and 11% of acetates (GA and CA) ( Figure   4B). Essential oils from leaf and inflorescence of  C. martinii were dominated by GOL (71 and 57%) and GA (5 and 15%) ( Figure   4B and Supplementary Figure  S7). Next, the expression of identified candidate genes was compared in  Cymbopogon that were used for essential oil analysis. Before proceeding for qPCR analysis of candidate genes, endogenous reference genes were selected and validated for transcript normalization. Among the selected reference genes,  EF1α exhibited highest stability across different  Cymbopogon species and in different tissues (Supplementary Figure  S8A). Hence,  EF1α was used for normalization in all subsequent qPCR analysis. For analysis, the species/gene having the least  Ct was set to 100% to determine the abundance of transcripts relative to other species/genes. The expression of  TPS1 was highest in  C. winterianus followed by  C. flexuosus (24%) and negligible in  C. martinii ( Figure   5). Tissue specific expression of  CfTPS1 in  C. flexuosus indicated minimal expression in root as compared to leaf (Supplementary Figure  S8C).  PPase1 exhibited highest expression in  C. martinii followed by  C. winterianus (15%) with least in  C. flexuosus (5%). Although  PPase2 followed similar trend as that of  PPase1, the expression of  PPase1 was ∼ three to eightfold higher compared to  PPase2 in all three species. The GOL content in  C. flexuosus has been reported to be 4 and 0.4% in leaf and root, respectively ( Rao et al., 2015). Hence, to determine the involvement of  PPases, tissue specific expression was studied, which showed a differential trend of  PPase expression. While  PPase1 showed fivefold higher expression in leaf compared to root,  PPase2 exhibited sevenfold higher abundance in root ( Figure   5 and Supplementary Figure  S8C). Based on the GOL content, comparative and tissue specific expression, we implicate the involvement of  PPase1 in GOL formation in aromatic grasses, similar to involvement of FPPase and GGPPase in farnesol and geranylgeraniol formation in rice ( Nah et al., 2001). Esterification of alcohol to corresponding acetates by AATs is an important conjugative step in essential oil biosynthetic pathway. These acetates form one of the most predominant volatile esters in essential oils of different aromatic grasses. The essential oil profile of  C. martinii revealed ∼21% of GA in inflorescence (Supplementary Figure  S7B). Among the three  AATs analyzed, only  AAT3 exhibited significant expression in inflorescence and was high in  C. martinii followed by  C. flexuosus (∼48%) with negligible expression in  C. winterianus ( Figure   5). Also, the tissue specific expression (which accumulates high GA) indicated proportional expression with GA content (Supplementary Figures  S7B,C). These results are consistent with previous reports of correlation of expression of acetyl-CoA:benzylalcohol acetyltransferase in  C. breweri and  GAAT in  R. hybrida with floral scent acetates ( Dudareva et al., 1998;  Shalit et al., 2003). Hence,  AAT3 may be the possible candidate involved in GA formation in  Cymbopogon sp. Among the 3 ALDH candidates, while  ALDH3 showed higher expression in all three species, ALDH1 and ALDH2 expression was negligible, implicating the possible role of ALDH3 in geranic/citronellic acid formation in  Cymbopogon (Supplementary Figure  S8B). Identification of Transcripts Related to Terpenoid Metabolism The essential oil of  Cymbopogon comprises mainly of monoterpene alcohols (GOL, COL), aldehydes (GAL, NAL, CAL), and acetates (GA, CA). The schematic representation of the steps involved in biosynthesis of these compounds is shown in  Figure   2. Terpenoids are derived from two five-carbon precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)  via the cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway and plastidial methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway ( Nagegowda, 2010). In  C. flexuosus transcriptome, 56 and 77 transcripts were annotated for 7 genes of MEP pathway and 6 genes of MVA pathway, respectively (Supplementary Table  S3). IPP and DMAPP are further converted to geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), by GPP synthase (GPPS), FPP synthase (FPPS), and GGPP synthase (GGPPS), respectively ( Nagegowda, 2010). In this analysis, we identified 8 transcripts for  GPPS, 9 transcripts each for  FPPS and  GGPPS (Supplementary Table  S3). In general, plants produce monoterpenes from GPP, which is formed by GPPS. Both homomeric and heteromeric forms of GPPS have been reported in plants ( Rai et al., 2013), however, mostly heteromeric GPPS have been shown to be involved in monoterpene bisoynthesis ( Wang and Dixon, 2009). Although  C. flexuosus contained transcripts for both homomeric and heteromeric GPPS (Supplementary Table  S3), only heteromeric GPPS may be involved in monoterpene biosynthesis similar to dicots ( Rai et al., 2013). Geranyl diphosphate is further converted to GOL either by geraniol synthase (GES) in plastids ( Simkin et al., 2013) or through recently proposed NUDX1 of Nudix hydrolase superfamily in the cytosol ( Magnard et al., 2015) or by yet to be identified PPase ( Nah et al., 2001) ( Figure   2). We identified 16, 26, and 17 transcripts for TPS, NUDX, and PPase, respectively, which could play a role in GOL biosynthesis (Supplementary Table  S3). It is also proposed that GOL could be formed from GAL through the action of ADH/AKR ( Iijima et al., 2014;  Sato-Masumoto and Ito, 2014). Genes involved in downstream conversion of GOL into its aldehyde, acetate or acid derivatives involve ADH/AKR, AAT, and ALDH at their respective steps of synthesis ( Figure   2). Our search resulted in 92 ADHs, 38 AKRs, 35 AATs, and 88 ALDHs (Supplementary Table  S3). Aldehydes (GAL and NAL) could also be synthesized by a novel route utilizing carotenoids as substrate through the action of CCDs as reported in rice and tomato ( Ilg et al., 2009,  2014).  C. flexuosus transcriptome contained 11 transcripts annotated as CCDs (Supplementary Table  S3). Mining of Genes Related to Essential Oil Biosynthesis in  C. flexuosus With respect to AAT enzymes involved in GA/CA formation, 6 AATs have been identified from plants including banana AAT1( Beekwilder et al., 2004),  Clarkia breweri benzyl alcohol  O-benzoyltransferase ( Dudareva et al., 1998),  Fragaria ananassa AAT ( Cumplido-Laso et al., 2012),  F. chiloenisis AAT ( González et al., 2009), and  R. hybrida acetyl CoA geraniol/citronellol acetyltransferase (RhGAAT1) ( Shalit et al., 2003). Out of 8 AATs mined, CfAAT1, CfAAT2, and CfAAT3 showing 28, 40, and 23% identity, respectively, to banana AAT1, and RhGAAT1 were considered for further analyses ( Figure   3D and Supplementary Table  S5). For mining of candidate genes, only those transcripts encoding full length proteins were considered for further analyses. Search for candidates involved in GOL formation yielded 1, 6, and 8 genes encoding TPS (Supplementary Figure  S6), PPase, and NUDX, respectively. BLAST analysis of  C. flexuosus putative NUDX candidates showed no significant homology to the recently characterized NUDX from  Rosa hybrida (RhNUDX1) ( Magnard et al., 2015). Also, when RhNUDX1 was used to search homologous candidates against NCBI monocot and other databases including Oryzabase 10, Rice Genome Annotation Project 11, Phytozome v10.3 12 and PlantGDB 13, it did not yield any homologous NUDX candidates except in  Zostera marina (seagrass) (52% identity) of Zosteraceae family. The obtained results could possibly be due to the reason that  Z. marina is more close to dicots, further suggesting that divergence of monocots and dicots occurred after  Z. marina got established as a marine plant ( Kong et al., 2014). Since there were no homologs for RhNUDX1 in  C. flexuosus, only TPS and PPase were considered for further analyses. Although GES enzymes involved in the formation of GOL have been characterized in dicots ( Iijima et al., 2004;  Dong et al., 2013;  Simkin et al., 2013), they are yet to be identified in monocots. The identified CfTPS1 in this study had the closest similarity (63% identity) with putative LIS/NES from rice. Among the characterized GES from other plants,  Vitis vinifera GES exhibited a low similarity (36% identity) to CfTPS1 (Supplementary Figure  S6; Supplementary Table  S5). As for the PPase, it has been reported that in rice seedlings FPPase and GGPPase activities are involved in formation of farnesol and geranylgeraniol from FPP and GGPP, respectively ( Nah et al., 2001). A similar phosphatase activity could be possibly involved in GOL formation from GPP in monocots. However, the molecular evidence for such activity still needs to be determined. Members of MDR superfamily (medium chain dehydro genases/reductases) such as cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CAD) and ADH families have been reported in citral formation. In this study, among 46 transcripts encoding ADH proteins, 9 sequences (denoted as CfADH1, CfADH2a-b, CfADH3a-e, and CfADH4) showing high homology to already characterized geraniol dehydrogenase (GeDH) and CAD (with GeDH activity) were considered for their relatedness through phylogeny ( Figure   3A and Supplementary Table  S5). CfADH1, CfADH2a, and CfADH2b were clustered in the CAD class-II having specific GeDH activity catalyzing conversion of GOL/nerol (NOL) to GAL/NAL ( Figure   3A and Supplementary Table  S5). CfADH1 exhibited highest amino acid identity (59%) with  Zingiber officinale (ZoGeDH1) that catalyzes bidirectional inter-conversion of GOL to GAL ( Iijima et al., 2014). CfADH2a and CfADH2b exhibited highest identity of 65 and 62% identity, respectively, to ZoGeDH1 ( Iijima et al., 2014) ( Figure   3A and Supplementary Table  S5). CfADH3a-e formed a different clade with multifunctional CAD class-I members, sharing 77% identity with  O. basilicum ObCAD1 ( Iijima et al., 2006) and 74% identity with  Artemisia annua AaCAD ( Li et al., 2012) that exhibited catalytic ability toward different aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes/alcohols including GAL/GOL. CfADH4 formed a separate clade with members of benzyl alcohol denydrogenase (benzyl/aryl ADHs) family exhibiting GeDH activity. CfADH4 shared 35 and 31% identity to GeDH from astigmatid mite  Carpoglyphus lactis ( Noge et al., 2008) and  Castellaniella defragrans ( Lüddeke et al., 2012), respectively. Search for AKRs (members of ADH family) yielded 3 candidates showing maximum homology to the characterized AKRs from  Perilla ( Sato-Masumoto and Ito, 2014) involving GOL to GAL conversion with CfAKR1 sharing 62% identity; CfAKR2a and CfAKR2b having 68% identity ( Figure   3B and Supplementary Table  S5). From 7 transcripts encoding CCD proteins, one sequence named as CfCCD1 exhibited very high homology with rice (99%) and tomato (74–78%) CCDs that have been recently characterized to produce GAL and NAL by breaking C 7–C 8/C 7 = C 8 bonds ( Ilg et al., 2009,  2014) ( Figure   3C, Supplementary Figure  S12; Supplementary Table  S5). Geranic acid (GAc), an oxygenated monoterpene present in trace amounts in  Cymbopogon sp. has anticancer/tyrosinase inhibitor and antifungal activity ( Yang et al., 2011). GAc has been reported to be formed from GAL by ALDH enzyme. ALDH acting on GAL has so far only been reported from  C. defragrans that catalyzes the NAD + dependent oxidation of GAL to GAc ( Lüddeke et al., 2012). Of 18 candidates encoding ALDH proteins, 3 CfALDH sequences were closely related to previously characterized ALDH from other plants ( Figure   3E and Supplementary Table  S5). While CfALDH1 shared highest homology with uncharacterized OsALDH2b (99%) from rice, CfALDH2 and CfALDH3 had close relationship with maize fertility-restorer (RF) genes ZmRF2B (84%) and ZmRF2A (95%), respectively ( Cui et al., 1996;  Liu et al., 2001) ( Figure   3E and Supplementary Table  S5). All CfALDH proteins showed ∼37% identity with characterized  C. defragrans geranial dehydrogenase (GALDH) ( Figure   3E and Supplementary Table  S5). Secondary Metabolic Pathways Identified in  C. flexuosus Leaf Transcriptome In order to find transcripts related to secondary metabolic pathways, assembled transcripts were annotated against KEGG, NCBI, and UniProt databases. About 26.21% (24,147) transcripts were assigned to 280 KEGG pathways among different categories that included metabolism, cellular processes, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, and others, with “metabolism” having the highest share of 36% (8,719 transcripts) (Supplementary Figure  S5). Within the “metabolism” category, 38 metabolic pathways related to secondary metabolism (484 transcripts) were identified with terpenoid biosynthesis representing the largest group with 151 transcripts ( Figure   1). This is in accordance with higher amounts of terpenes present in  C. flexuosus essential oil. KEGG analyses of transcriptomes from terpene rich  Ocimum basilicum and phenylpropanoid rich  Ocimum sanctum also showed higher representation of respective pathway related transcripts ( Rastogi et al., 2014), indicating that the distribution of transcripts involved in secondary metabolism correlates with the essential oil composition. Also, significant number of transcripts involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites like phenylpropanoids (18%), alkaloids (12%), and flavonoids (10%) were represented. The total number of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in major metabolic pathways obtained from KEGG, NCBI, and UniProt annotations are represented in Supplementary Tables  S3 and  S4. Molecular Modeling and Docking Analysis of gene expression and essential oil profiling indicated the involvement of CfADH1, CfADH2a, CfAKR2b, CfAAT3, and CfALDH3 in  Cymbopogon aroma biosynthesis. To further support the role of these candidates,  in silico studies were performed to know the possible 3D structure and substrate interactions. The conversion of hydroxyl group to aldehyde requires a co-enzyme NAD + and co-factor zinc (Zn ++), and conserved catalytic motifs. While conserved glycine rich “GXGXXG” and catalytic “GHEXXGXXXXXGV” motifs are reported for ADH activity ( Lüddeke et al., 2012;  Iijima et al., 2014), AKR requires conserved “DXXXXY” motif having catalytic aspartic acid (D) and tyrosine (Y) for its enzyme function ( Kavanagh et al., 2008). Sequence analysis revealed the presence of these conserved motifs in CfADH1, CfADH2a, and CfAKR2b (Supplementary Figures  S10A,B and  S11), suggesting their NAD-dependent dehydrogenase and aldo-keto reductase activity, respectively. Indeed, molecular docking data clearly demonstrated that the GOL binds very proximal to the conserved catalytic motifs of CfADH1, CfADH2a, and CfAKR2b proteins ( Figures   7A–C; Supplementary Figure  S10A–C and  S11; Supplementary Table  S6). Among the tested aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, GOL exhibited the lowest ΔG energy for all three proteins (Supplementary Table  S6). Further, the docking revealed that the active site topology of CfADH1 and CfADH2b contains glutamic acid (E) and histidine (H) residues, where GOL binds and gets converted to GAL in presence of NAD + ( Figures   7A,B). The conserved “E” plays a vital role in ADH function, as it facilitates substrate binding and coordination of Zn ++ ion during catalysis ( Ryde, 1995). The GOL bound complex of CfAKR2b exhibited the ΔG energy of -6.96 kcal/mol ( Figure   7C; Supplementary Table  S6). It is possible that the co-factor NAD + binds to the conserved sites in ADH and AKR where the reduction of NAD + occurs by accepting hydrogen from GOL ( Strommer, 2011). In the case of CfAAT3 also, docking studies demonstrated higher affinity of CfAAT3 for GOL (ΔG energy of -5.67 kcal/mol) along with farnesol (ΔG energy of -5.97 kcal/mol) among the tested aliphatic and aromatic alcohols ( Figure   7D and Supplementary Table  S6). The GOL-bound CfAAT3 complex revealed that the conserved histidine (H) and aspartic acid (D) of catalytic HXXXD motif are closely located in the active site ( Figure   7D and Supplementary Figure  S13), where GOL is converted to GA by acetyltransferase activity ( Aharoni et al., 2000;  D’Auria, 2006). Similarly for CfALDH3, the molecular modeling and docking studies revealed greater affinity (ΔG energy of -6.16 kcal/mol) for GAL-bound CfALDH3 complex (Supplementary Figures  S9 and  S14; Supplementary Table  S6). Overall, the results from molecular modeling supported the gene expression data, further indicating the involvement of these candidates in essential oil formation. Nevertheless, further experimental evidences (i.e., site directed mutagenesis and  in vitro assays) are needed to confirm their precise role in  Cymbopogon aroma formation.","Aromatic grasses of the genus Cymbopogon (Poaceae family) represent unique group of plants that produce diverse composition of monoterpene rich essential oils, which have great value in flavor, fragrance, cosmetic, and aromatherapy industries. Despite the commercial importance of these natural aromatic oils, their biosynthesis at the molecular level remains unexplored. As the first step toward understanding the essential oil biosynthesis, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and analysis of C. flexuosus (lemongrass) by employing Illumina sequencing. Mining of transcriptome data and subsequent phylogenetic analysis led to identification of terpene synthases, pyrophosphatases, alcohol dehydrogenases, aldo-keto reductases, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases, alcohol acetyltransferases, and aldehyde dehydrogenases, which are potentially involved in essential oil biosynthesis. Comparative essential oil profiling and mRNA expression analysis in three Cymbopogon species (C. flexuosus, aldehyde type; C. martinii, alcohol type; and C. winterianus, intermediate type) with varying essential oil composition indicated the involvement of identified candidate genes in the formation of alcohols, aldehydes, and acetates. Molecular modeling and docking further supported the role of identified protein sequences in aroma formation in Cymbopogon. Also, simple sequence repeats were found in the transcriptome with many linked to terpene pathway genes including the genes potentially involved in aroma biosynthesis. This work provides the first insights into the essential oil biosynthesis of aromatic grasses, and the identified candidate genes and markers can be a great resource for biotechnological and molecular breeding approaches to modulate the essential oil composition."," 'Essential oil', 'Transcriptome', 'Cymbopogon', 'Monoterpene Biosynthesis', 'Aromatic Grasses', 'Gene Candidates' "," 'Supplementary Figure', 'Supplementary Table', 'Figure', 'Supplementary', 'Table', 'expression', 'GOL', 'transcripts', 'essential oil', 'Figures' "," 75,261, Hansey, 92,139, 76,293, ∼, D, NCBI, 69,984, AGRIS, “transcription factor, ”, C3H, WRKY, SSRs, genic-SSRs, EST-SSRs, SSRs, Liu, SSRs, genic-SSRs, NGS, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, A/T, CfPPase1, CfADH1, CfADH2a, (AG)6, (GCC)5ggccgatccgccgcccggcgatgatg(CGT)5 at, (A)19, (GGC)5, genic/EST-SSRs, SSRs, GAL, ADH/AKR, CCD ( Ilg et al., ADH2a, ADH3b, ADH3b, ADH4, ADH1, AKR1, ADH2a, ADH1, GAL, CfADH2a, ADH1, ADH2a, AKR2b, GAL (, GA, CAL (, COL, GA, CA), GA, species/genes, ∼, FPPase, GGPPase, AATs, GA, ∼48, GA, C, hybrida with floral scent acetates, GA, ALDH1, ALDH2, ALDH3, geranic/citronellic acid, COL, GAL, CA, DMAPP, geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPP, GPP synthase, GPPS, FPP synthase, FPPS, GGPP synthase, GGPPS, GPPS, GPPS, GPPS, GPPS, GPPS, GES, NUDX1, hydrolase, PPase, NUDX, PPase, GAL, ADH/AKR, ADH/AKR, AAT, ALDH, ADHs, AKRs, AATs, ALDHs, GAL, AAT, GA/CA, Cumplido-Laso, AAT, González, hybrida acetyl CoA geraniol/citronellol acetyltransferase, CfAAT1, CfAAT2, AAT1, RhGAAT1, 8, PPase, NUDX, NUDX, NUDX, hybrida (RhNUDX1, RhNUDX1, Oryzabase, Phytozome v10.3 12, PlantGDB, NUDX, RhNUDX1, PPase, GES enzymes, CfTPS1, GES, CfTPS1, PPase, FPPase, GGPPase, GGPP, MDR, alcohol dehydrogenases, ADH, ADH, CfADH1, CfADH2a-b, CfADH4, geraniol dehydrogenase, GeDH, GeDH, CfADH1, CfADH2a, CfADH2b, CAD class-II, GeDH, GOL/nerol, GAL/NAL, CfADH1, GAL, CfADH2a, CfADH2b, ZoGeDH1, aldehydes/alcohols, GAL/GOL, CfADH4, benzyl/aryl ADHs, GeDH, CfADH4, GeDH, Noge, Lüddeke, AKRs, ADH, AKRs, Sato-Masumoto, GAL, CfAKR2a, CfAKR2b, CfCCD1, GAL, C 8, anticancer/tyrosinase, GAL, ALDH, ALDH, GAL, NAD +, GAL, Lüddeke, ALDH, ALDH, CfALDH1, OsALDH2b (, CfALDH2, CfALDH3, ZmRF2A (, CfALDH proteins, ∼37, NCBI, “, ”, “, ”, NCBI, UniProt, CfADH1, CfADH2a, CfAKR2b, CfALDH3, NAD, “GXGXXG”, “GHEXXGXXXXXGV”, ADH, Lüddeke, AKR, “DXXXXY”, aspartic acid, CfADH1, CfADH2a, CfAKR2b, NAD-dependent dehydrogenase, aldo-keto reductase, CfADH1, CfADH2a, CfAKR2b proteins, CfADH1, CfADH2b, GAL, NAD +, “E”, ADH, CfAKR2b, NAD +, ADH, AKR, NAD, CfAAT3, GOL-bound CfAAT3, aspartic acid, GA, acetyltransferase, CfALDH3, GAL-bound CfALDH3 "," 'TPS1', 'CfTPS1', 'TPS,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CfTPS1', 'CfTPS1' ", 'GPPS.' ,  ,NaN
33,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6598649/eupmc_result.json,PMC6598649,"Results NSs manipulates the preference behavior of WFT on plants Our data demonstrated that the orthotospovirus TSWV increases the attraction of insect vector WFT to its host plant by inhibiting  terpene synthase expression in the host. Next, to explore which viral protein(s) in TSWV manipulate vector host choice, we selected three of the five viral proteins in TSWV, including a structural protein nucleocapsid protein (Ncp) and two non-structural proteins, NSm and NSs   24 . We used the heterologous Potato virus X (PVX) model system for systemic ectopic expression of individual genes for TSWV NSs, NSm or Ncp   43 . PVX-GFP, used to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the plant, was served as the control. There were no obvious morphological differences between these recombinant PVX vector-infected peppers ( Fig 3A). We performed a WFT two-choice assay to determine whether the expression of a single viral protein is sufficient to attract WFT. PVX-NSs-infected plants but not PVX-NSm- or PVX-Ncp-infected plants were significantly more attractive to WFT than PVX-GFP-infected plants ( Fig 3B), indicating the expression of  NSs alone is sufficient to attract WFT in peppers. NSs promotes thrips vector performance by targeting MYCs The viral transmission cycle can be roughly divided into two phases. In the first phase, the TSWV-infected plants attract non-viruliferous thrips to feed, with volatiles playing a key role in this early process (Figs  1– 5). In the second phase, a (viruliferous) thrips population is established on TSWV-infected plants to facilitate virus transmission. To investigate whether NSs influences thrips population establishment, we performed a thrips spawning experiment with a slight modification   40 . Seven female adult thrips were allowed to feed on  35S: YFP-NSs ( NSs-1; NSs-2) or wild-type  Arabidopsis for two weeks. We counted the number of new adults and larvae to analyze the effect of NSs on the thrips population. Plants expressing  NSs were more suitable for WFT population growth than wild type ( Fig 6A). We reasoned that NSs targets MYCs to disable the activation of  terpene synthase genes, thereby attenuating the defense of the host plant against thrips. To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted another spawning experiment using  myc2-1,  tps10-1, and  myc234 mutants. More WFT were found on the mutants compared with wild type; these lines were equally suitable for WFT growth compared to the lines expressing  NSs, confirming the important role for NSs in the tripartite WFT–TSWV–plant interaction ( Fig 6B and 6C). TSWV infection induces a terpene-dependent preference in the thrips vector To explore the metabolic consequences of the altered  TPS gene expression, we investigated changes in the emission of plant volatile compounds after TSWV infection. Plants have evolved a blend of HIPVs that are emitted in response to, and directly repel, herbivores   27– 33 . We measured the volatile emission collected in the headspace of peppers with or without thrips infestation. When infested by thrips, damaged plants emitted more volatiles than control plants ( S2 Fig). It is noteworthy that TSWV-infected plants emitted significantly less linalool, which is the main monoterpene collected from peppers after herbivory, compared to non-infected plants, consistent with their lower expression of  TPS genes. In addition, there was no significant difference in the emissions of the monoterpene D-limonene ( Fig 2A). We also monitored the emission of volatile compounds in the headspace of  N.  benthamiana, after applying MeJA to mimic WFT infestation; this plant hormone is known to elicit the production of various terpenes   42 . Among the five detected terpenes, the levels of three volatile monoterpenes, linalool, α-pinene, and β-pinene, were significantly lower in TSWV-infected plants compared to non-infected plants ( Fig 2B). To examine whether linalool, α-pinene and β-pinene play a role in plant–WFT interactions, we performed a two-choice assay in which non-viruliferous WFT had the choice between the changed monoterpenes and the solvent control hexane. The α-pinene and β-pinene directly repelled thrips similarly to linalool ( Fig 2C). These consistent results on pepper and  N.  benthamiana revealed that TSWV infection induces a terpene-dependent preference in the thrips vector and that this feature is common among various TSWV hosts. MYCs positively regulate volatile-dependent immunity against WFT in  Arabidopsis We previously showed that  Arabidopsis MYC2 plays important roles in JA-regulated plant defense responses, e.g. directly regulates  TPS10 transcript levels to promote plant volatile biosynthesis   38 . Thus, we hypothesized that AtMYC2, which interacts with virulence factor NSs, is involved in the viral-induced, volatile-dependent attraction of WFT to the host plant. To validate this hypothesis, we performed a GUS staining assay using two transgenic  Arabidopsis lines expressing an  AtMYC2 or  AtTPS10 promoter:  GUS reporter gene. As shown in  Fig 5A, high  GUS expression was detected after 24 h of WFT infestation. This expression pattern suggests that  AtMYC2 and  AtTPS10 both function in defense responses against WFT in  Arabidopsis. To analyze the effects of  AtMYC2 and  AtTPS10 on the feeding preferences of thrips, we performed two-choice assays using  myc2-1,  tps10-1, and wild-type Col-0  Arabidopsis. As shown in  Fig 5B, the  myc2-1 and  tps10-1 mutants were more attractive to WFT than wild type. We also tested the effect of triple mutant  myc234 on host preference, finding that WFT strongly preferred  myc234 plants over the wild type ( Fig 5B).  AtTPS10 encodes a monoterpene synthase that produces β-ocimene   48 . We therefore carried out a two-choice assay of β-ocimene to examine whether the attraction of  tps10 is terpene-dependent. β-ocimene had a strong repellent effect on WFT ( Fig 5C). These results indicate that  AtMYC2 is essential for terpene-dependent immunity against the thrips vector. We further examined if the TSWV NSs contributes to the preference of thrips on  Arabidopsis. In two-choice assays, two transgenic  Arabidopsis 35S: YFP-NSs ( NSs-1;  NSs-2) lines were significantly more attractive to thrips compared to controls ( Fig 5D), supporting the conclusion that NSs protein can modify vector feeding behavior in a terpene-dependent manner. TSWV infection enhances plant attractiveness to the thrips vector and suppresses plant terpene synthesis Another model (host) plant for tripartite interaction research,  Nicotiana benthamiana, was also tested. Similar to the observations in pepper, TSWV-infected  N.  benthamiana leaves also were more attractive to thrips than non-infected leaves ( Fig 1C). Moreover, RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the  terpene synthase genes  NbTPS5 and  NbTPS38 responded to thrips infestation in  N.  benthamiana ( S1A Fig). Consistent with the above results,  NbTPS5 and  NbTPS38 expression was notably induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, reflecting the same trends as during thrips infestation ( S1B Fig). JA signaling is normally rapidly activated by thrips feeding   40 . Considering that  N.  benthamiana is not a good host for thrips as indicated by their poor survival rate, and the finding that MeJA induces similar expression of  TPS genes in  N.  benthamiana as thrips infestation ( S1 Fig), we used MeJA to mimic WFT infestation in further tripartite interaction experiments. The expression of  NbTPS3,  NbTPS4,  NbTPS5, and  NbTPS38 was less changed in TSWV-infected plants compared to the control plants when induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) ( Fig 1D). We first investigated the indirect effect of TSWV infection on the behavioral responses of the vector  Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande (Western flower thrips, WFT). We conducted a two-choice assay between infected and non-infected plants. Pepper ( Capsicum annuum L.), a natural host of TSWV and an important crop worldwide, was first tested in the tripartite thrip–orthotospovirus–plant interaction. A group of 50 non-viruliferous WFT was released from the center of the two-choice arena between two types of pepper plants. Consistent with previous results from Maris et al.   9 , ~68% of thrips approached TSWV-infected plants, whereas the remaining approached non-infected plants ( Fig 1A), suggesting that TSWV infection indirectly increases the attractiveness of peppers to the thrips vector. The attraction of insect vectors induced by the infection of other viruses is dependent on plant volatiles   38, 41 . We therefore measured the expression levels of  terpene synthase ( TPS) genes in pepper leaves based on our previous functional analysis of  TPS genes   38 . Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis showed that the expression of four pepper  monoterpene synthase genes ( CaMTS1,  CaMTS2,  CaMTS3, and  CaMTS4), which are related to monoterpene synthesis, were upregulated after thrips infestation ( Fig 1B). However, the terpene biosynthesis gene expression activated by thrips was significantly lower in TSWV-infected plants compared with the control ( Fig 1B). A conserved protein interaction between  Orthotospovirus NSs and plant MYC2 In summary, our results suggest that NSs targets MYCs to attenuate host defense responses to thrips, thereby manipulating terpene-dependent chemical communication between the plant and the thrips vector. TSWV-infected pepper plants were more attractive to the thrips vector than healthy plants ( Fig 1A). Therefore, we asked whether NSs could interact with AtMYC2 orthologs in pepper. We examined the interaction between NSs and the homologous protein of AtMYC2 in pepper (CaMYC2). Our BiFC assay results showed interaction fluorescence of NSs–CaMYC2 in the nucleus, while there was no fluorescence of control ( Fig 7A). In Co-IP assays, CaMYC2-Myc protein was coimmunoprecipitated by YFP-NSs, but not by YFP alone ( Fig 7B). Taken together, our results suggest that NSs–MYC2 interaction is relatively conserved in pepper. Other orthotospoviruses also encode a NSs protein and might similarly manipulate vector behavior to accelerate their own transmission   49 . To explore whether the interaction between NSs–MYC2 is conserved among orthotospoviruses, we used Tomato zonate spot orthotospovirus (TZSV), a new species of genus  Orthotospovirus that threatens food security in Southwest China   50 . The evolutionary relationship of TSWV and TZSV is not very close   51 , as TSWV represents the American- and TZSV represents the Euro/Asian-type orthotospoviruses ( S4 Fig). We examined TZSV NSs–AtMYC2/CaMYC2 interactions by BiFC and Co-IP assays. Notably, BiFC showed interaction fluorescence of TZSV NSs–AtMYC2 and TZSV NSs–CaMYC2 aggregated in the nucleus, while the Co-IP assays again confirmed the interaction between TZSV NSs–AtMYC2 (left panel) and TZSV NSs–CaMYC2 (right panel) ( Fig 7D), providing evidence that TZSV NSs interacts with both AtMYC2 and CaMYC2  in vivo, consistent with NSs–MYC2 interaction in TSWV (Figs  4 and  7A). These results indicated that the interaction between NSs and MYC2 may be conserved in orthotospoviruses. TSWV NSs interacts with MYC2 and its homologs MYC3 and MYC4 To explore the host protein targets of NSs, we screened an  Arabidopsis cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid analysis and identified AtMYC2, a key components of the JA signaling pathway   44– 46 . Based on the importance of the JA signaling pathway to plant–herbivore interactions, we further confirmed the interaction between AtMYC2 and NSs. In a yeast two-hybrid assay, the yeast transformants harboring AD-AtMYC2 and BD-NSs could grow on SD-Leu-Trp-His medium with 0.04 mg/mL X-α-gal and turned blue, while the negative control transformants did not ( Fig 4A). A bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay confirmed the AtMYC2 and NSs interaction in plants. NSs-cEYFP and nEYFP-AtMYC2 constructs were co-expressed in transgenic  N.  benthamiana lines that expressed a nucleus-localized histone H2B-red fluorescent protein (H2B-RFP) fusion marker protein. A strong interaction (represented by fluorescence) was observed in the nucleus ( Fig 4B), while no fluorescence was observed in the negative controls ( Fig 4B). GST pull-down assay was used to verify the direct physical interaction between NSs and AtMYC2  in vitro. His-NSs was pulled down by GST-AtMYC2, but not by GST alone ( Fig 4C). Moreover, in a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay, AtMYC2-Myc was coimmunoprecipitated by YFP-NSs, but not the YFP control ( Fig 4D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that NSs directly interacts with MYC2  in vitro and  in vivo. MYC3 and MYC4 are two closely related bHLH transcription factors that function partially redundantly with MYC2 to activate JA responses in  Arabidopsis   47 . To determine whether TSWV NSs targets MCY3 and MYC4 as well, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay and a BiFC assay. MYC2 relatives MYC3 and MYC4 were also found to interact with TSWV NSs as indicated by AD-AtMYCs (MYC3 and MYC4) and BD-NSs yeast transformants turned blue when grown on SD-Leu-Trp-His medium with 0.04 mg/mL X-α-gal ( S3A Fig). In the BiFC assay,  N.  benthamiana coexpressing MYC3 and NSs exhibited fluorescence in the cytoplasm and nucleus, while coexpression of MYC4 and NSs led to fluorescence only in the cytoplasm ( S3B Fig). These results indicate that MYC family transcription factors are targeted by NSs protein.","Pandemics of vector-borne human and plant diseases often depend on the behaviors of their arthropod vectors. Arboviruses, including many bunyaviruses, manipulate vector behavior to accelerate their own transmission to vertebrates, birds, insects, and plants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this manipulation remains elusive. Here, we report that the non-structural protein NSs of Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus, a prototype of the Tospoviridae family and the Orthotospovirus genus, is a key viral factor that indirectly modifies vector preference and increases vector performance. NSs suppresses the biosynthesis of plant volatile monoterpenes, which serve as repellents of the vector western flower thrips (WFT, Frankliniella occidentalis). NSs directly interacts with MYC2, the jasmonate (JA) signaling master regulator and its two close homologs MYC3 and MYC4, to disable JA-mediated activation of terpene synthase genes. The dysfunction of the MYCs subsequently attenuates host defenses, increases the attraction of thrips, and improves thrips fitness. Moreover, MYC2 associated with NSs of Tomato zonate spot orthotospovirus, another Euro/Asian-type orthotospovirus, suggesting that MYC2 is an evolutionarily conserved target of Orthotospovirus species for suppression of terpene-based resistance to promote vector performance. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanism through which an orthotospovirus indirectly manipulates vector behaviors and therefore facilitates pathogen transmission. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which Orthotospovirus NSs counteracts plant immunity for pathogen transmission.",NaN," 'Fig', 'WFT', 'NSs', 'TSWV', 'thrips', 'TSWV NSs', 'plants', 'TZSV NSs', 'plant', 'TSWV infection' "," orthotospovirus TSWV, NSm, NSs   24, NSm, Ncp   43 , green fluorescent protein, GFP, PVX-NSs-infected, PVX-NSm-, PVX-Ncp-infected, PVX-GFP-infected, MYCs, NSs, YFP-NSs, NSs-1, NSs-2, NSs, NSs, MYCs, -1, NSs, terpene-dependent, α-pinene, α-pinene, α-pinene, terpene-dependent, MYCs, volatile-dependent, MYC2, AtMYC2, volatile-dependent, GUS, -1, -1, terpene-dependent, terpene-dependent, YFP-NSs, NSs-1, NSs, terpene-dependent, S1A, S1B, CaMTS1, MYC2, NSs, MYCs, terpene-dependent, NSs, AtMYC2, NSs, AtMYC2, CaMYC2, BiFC, NSs–CaMYC2, CaMYC2-Myc, YFP-NSs, YFP, NSs–MYC2, orthotospoviruses, NSs, NSs–MYC2, orthotospoviruses, Euro/Asian-type orthotospoviruses, BiFC, BiFC, AtMYC2, CaMYC2  , NSs–MYC2, NSs, MYC2, MYC2, MYC3, MYC4, NSs, AtMYC2, NSs, AD-AtMYC2, BD-NSs, X-α-gal, BiFC, NSs, NSs-cEYFP, nEYFP-AtMYC2, histone H2B-red fluorescent protein, GST, NSs, AtMYC2  , His-NSs, GST-AtMYC2, GST, AtMYC2-Myc, YFP-NSs, YFP, NSs, MYC3, MYC4, MYC2, JA, MCY3, MYC4, MYC2, MYC3, MYC4, AD-AtMYCs, MYC3, MYC4, BD-NSs yeast transformants, X-α-gal, S3A, BiFC, MYC3, NSs, MYC4, NSs, S3B, MYC, NSs "," 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS10', 'AtTPS10', 'AtTPS10', 'AtTPS10', 'AtTPS10', 'NbTPS5', 'NbTPS38', 'NbTPS5', 'NbTPS38', 'TPS', 'NbTPS3,', 'NbTPS4,', 'NbTPS5,', 'NbTPS38', 'TPS)', 'TPS' ",  ,  ,terpene synthase
34,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7861536/eupmc_result.json,PMC7861536,"Results Quantification of carotenoid components in juice sac tissues of mature fruits from 263 breeding pedigrees Phytoene, t-violaxanthin, c-violaxanthin, lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, α-carotene, zeaxanthin, and β-carotene in the juice sac tissues of the mature fruits were measured among 263 breeding pedigrees including 11 founders, for which fruits were available, by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The content of total carotenoid, β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin in the major cultivars is summarized in  S3 Table.  Fig 3 shows the carotenoid composition for each breeding generation from G1 to G4. The mean total carotenoid content in the 13 founders was 2.2 mg/100FWG, with a range 0.0 mg/100FWG to 6.0 mg/100FWG. The variance in total carotenoid content was 3.9. The fruits of Kishu mikan, King mandarin and ‘Murcott’ accumulated high concentrations of carotenoids and those of grapefruit, Hassaku and Hyuganatsu accumulated lower concentrations of carotenoids. The major carotenoids present in the 13 founders were either β-cryptoxanthin or violaxanthin, and they comprised more than 67.0% of the total carotenoids. In the breeding population, the mean total carotenoid content was 2.8 mg/100FWG, with a range of 0.2 mg/100FWG to 9.6 mg/100FWG. The variance of total carotenoid content was 2.7, which was less than that of the 13 founders. These results indicated that the variance of total carotenoids became smaller in the breeding population, whereas total carotenoids, β-cryptoxanthin, and VIO became more abundant owing to the removal of unnecessary alleles. For example, ‘Tsunokagayaki’ in G3 and Kuchinotsu 52 gou in G4 revealed a deep orange flesh color ( Fig 4), and β-cryptoxanthin (total carotenoids) content in the juice sac tissues were 2.2 mg/100FWG (4.6 mg/100FWG) and 2.4 mg/100FWG (4.5 mg/100FWG), which were higher than 1.5 mg/100FWG (2.3 mg/100FWG) of Satsuma mandarin in G0. Interestingly, β-cryptoxanthin content and violaxanthin content were highly correlated with the total carotenoid content among breeding populations, and both of their correlation values were 0.85 ( Fig 5). This result implied that the increase in total carotenoids was supported by the accumulation of these xanthophylls in mature fruits. These carotenoid profiles suggest that carotenoid enrichment was achieved by the exchange of allelic composition and by the targeted removal of the unnecessary alleles in conventional crossbreeding. SureSelect target enrichment of carotenoid metabolic genes among the 13 founders In previous studies of QTL and eQTL analyses using bi-parental populations   17,  20 , each genetic locus for  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP, and  NCED, and eQTL for  PDS and  ZDS in linkage group 8 ( TCL) were shown to have statically effects on carotenoid content and transcription level of carotenoid metabolic genes. In this study, we focused on them and explored an optimum allele associated with high carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits, from a total of 26 alleles present in 13 ancestral species of the Japanese breeding population. Citrus varieties comprised complex mosaic genome structures of a limited number of ancient species via repeated natural cross   36 ; therefore, the number of independent alleles that were shared by some of the 13 founders was estimated for five target genes based on SNPs. Since the genomic sequences of most founders are not available in the public database, a SureSelect target enrichment system was applied to acquire the SNP information of the target genes except for  TCL. The SNP information was collected from the gene region because sequence variation in promoter region were complicate among 13 founders by the combination of insertion, deletion and point mutation among citrus varieties and it would be unfavorable to extract stably inherited SNPs among citrus varieties and their progenies. Because carotenoid metabolic genes have several isoforms in the genome, genome sequences in the gene region of Ciclev10011841m.g for  PSY, Ciclev10005481m.g for  HYb, Ciclev10025089m.g for  ZEP, and Ciclev10014639m.g for  NCED in the clementine mandarin genome sequence ver 1.0 were utilized to create custom bait libraries that covered the genomic region around target genes. These loci were confirmed to influence the carotenoid content and transcription levels of metabolic genes in previous studies. The constructed captured libraries enriching four metabolic genes were sequenced using a HiSeq2500 system (Illumina), and NGS data were aligned with the reference sequence of clementine mandarin genome sequence ver 1.0 using CLC Genomic Workbench 6.5.1 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Numerous SNPs and indels were found in 4 target genes when overviewing 13 founders. The number of SNPs in  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP, and  NCED with more than readable SNP quality score (>150) according to manufacturer’s description were 107, 31, 54 and 19 respectively, when NGS data of 13 founders were compared with the corresponding reference gene of clementine mandarin. For  TCL, the causative gene that controls the transcription levels of  PDS and  ZDS has not been characterized. Therefore, arbitrary SNPs on  TCL were applied to estimate the number of independent alleles for uncharacterized causative genes on  TCL given that the allele on common haplotype blocks derived from common founders would reveal the same SNP genotypes. The candidate SNPs on  TCL were explored using the TASUKE program in MiGD   19 . Based on the SNP information, 17 SNP markers for  PSY, 15 for  HYb, 31 for  ZEP, 8  NCED, and 5 for  TCL were developed for a SNP genotyping assay using the GoldenGate assay system (Illumina) and Fluidigm BioMark™ HD assay system (Fluidigm). PSY catalyzes the first committed condensation step from GGPP to produce the first C40 carotene, phytoene. Carotenoid composition is highly influenced by the transcription balance among carotenoid metabolic genes   5 . In previous QTL and eQTL analyses,  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP,  NCED, and eQTL for  PDS and  ZEP have been shown to increase carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits   17,  20 . These genes including a causative gene on  TCL (denoted in red font within boxes) are the targets for allele mining in this study. PSY, phytoene synthase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase; LCYe, lycopene ε-cyclase; LCYb, lycopene β-cyclase; HYb, β-carotene hydroxylase; ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase; VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase; NSY, neoxanthin synthase; CCD, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; NCED, 9- cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase. Genotyping of trio-tagged SNPs in breeding populations and the frequency of alleles in the progress of breeding generation SNP genotyping assay was carried out for 275 plant materials, including13 founders, and their allelic composition was characterized based on the SNP genotype data of 57 trio-tagged SNPs. The allelic genotypes of five target genes in major cultivars are summarized in  S3 Table. There was no discrepancy in the transmission of all independent alleles from parents to offspring among the samples in the 78 parent–offspring combinations. Breeding populations have been generated by crossing with one another, and the most advanced breeding generations of the registered cultivars belong to the 4 th generation from 13 founders in the breeding program. The numbers of the registered cultivars and preserved selection lines in each generation were as follows: founder, 13 varieties; zero generation (G0): 2 (Satsuma mandarin and Clementine mandarin), 1 st generation (G1), 14 varieties and lines (i.e. ‘Kiyomi’, ‘Sweet spring’, etc.); 2 nd generation (G2), 23 (i.e. ‘Harumi’, ‘Tamami’, etc.); 3 rd generation (G3), 21 (i.e. ‘Setoka’, ‘Tsunokagayaki’, etc.); 4 th generation (G4), 10 (i.e. ‘Harehime’, ‘Ehime Kashi No. 28’, etc.). In Japanese breeding programs, the enrichment of carotenoids in fruit is one of the most important breeding traits. The allele frequencies of the five target genes were traced during those breeding generations, except for G0 because Satsuma mandarin and clementine mandarin were generated by the natural cross of founders between Kunenbo mandarin and Kishu mikan or between Willowleaf mandarin and King mandarin, respectively (Fujii et al. 2016). Interestingly, several alleles of the five target genes were selected out in progress of breeding generation. For example, out of seven  PSY alleles in founders,  PSY-g and  PSY-f disappeared from G2, and the occupied ratio of  PSY-c decreased from 15.4% in founders to 5% in G4 ( Fig 2A). Of the seven  HYb alleles in founders,  HYb-c,  HYb-e, and  HYb-f disappeared in the G4, and the occupied ratio of  HYb-g increased from 3.8% in founders to 27.8% in G4 ( Fig 2B). Of the 11  ZEP alleles in founders,  ZEP-f,  ZEP-g,  ZEP-h,  ZEP-j, and  ZEP-k disappeared in G4, and the occupied ratio of  ZEP-e increased from 7.7% in founders to 26.3% in G4 ( Fig 2C). Of the five  NCED alleles in founders,  NCED-d and  NCED-e disappeared in G4, and the occupied ratio of  NCED-c reduced from 15.4% in founders to 5.0% in G4 ( Fig 2D). Additionally, out of 4  TCL alleles in founders,  TCL-d disappeared in G4, and the occupied ratio of  TCL-a decreased from 38.5% in founders to 12.1% in G4 ( Fig 2E). Thus, several alleles in founders disappeared during the breeding generation although these disappeared alleles may be revived by crossing with old varieties. Association between the allelic composition of five target genes and carotenoid composition in juice sac tissues of fruits by Bayesian statistical analysis Fig 8 shows the transmission of  PSY and  ZEP alleles in the lineage of ‘Tsunokagayaki’ in G3 and Kuchinotsu 52 gou in G4, which accumulate high concentrations of β-cryptoxanthin in juice sac tissues. The alleles of  PSY and  ZEP come from either allele in five founders of Kishu mikan ( PSY-a/ PSY-d;  ZEP-a/ZEP-b), sweet orange ( PSY-a/ PSY-c;  ZEP-a/ZEP-i), Kunenbo mandarin ( PSY-a/ PSY-d;  ZEP-a/ZEP-c), willow leaf mandarin ( PSY-a/ PSY-b;  ZEP-a/ZEP-a), and King mandarin ( PSY-a/ PSY-b;  ZEP-c/ZEP-e). During breeding selection aiming for enrichment of β-cryptoxanthin,  PSY-a and  ZEP-e (or  ZEP-a) were pyramided in those cultivars and breeding lines, thus confirming that  PSY-a and  ZEP-e had statically strong positive effects on the increase in total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits. These alleles would operate to increase β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin contents, although the effects were smaller compared to those exerted overall on the total carotenoid content. Of note, most alleles with negative effects on carotenoid content were, consistently, those alleles that disappeared during the progress of breeding generation. The association between allelic composition of five target genes and carotenoid composition ( S3 Table) was evaluated by Bayesian statistical analysis using the data obtained from the 263 pedigrees. The five target genes detected some significant associations with the measured eight kinds of carotenoids and total carotenoid content ( Fig 6).  PSY,  ZEP, and  NCED significantly associated with total carotenoid content,  PSY and  ZEP significantly associated with β-cryptoxanthin content, and  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP,  NCED, and  TCL significantly associated with violaxanthin content. Based on the estimated effect size for each allele of the five target genes on the measured carotenoids, the allele with the value of more than one third of the max effect size was defined as the alleles with positive or negative effect ( Fig 7). With respect to the independent alleles of the five target genes,  PSY-a had a strong positive effect ( ζ = 0.82) on increasing the total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits, whereas  PSY-c and  PSY-g had medium negative effects ( ζ = -0.42 and -0.41, respectively) on decreasing the total carotenoid content ( Fig 7A). Among the  ZEP alleles,  ZEP-e had a strong positive effect ( ζ = 0.83) on increasing the total carotenoids in juice sac tissues of fruits, whereas three alleles,  ZEP-a,  ZEP-b, and  ZEP-c, had medium or weak positive effects ( ζ = 0.54, 0.38, and 0.66, respectively) on increasing the total carotenoid content. Four alleles of  ZEP-f,  ZEP-g,  ZEP-h, and  ZEP-k had medium or weak negative effects ( ζ = -0.42, -0.68, -0.59, and -0.31, respectively) on decreasing the total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits. Moreover, among the  NCED alleles,  NCED-a had a weak positive effect ( ζ = 0.34) on increasing the total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits. In contrast to those genes,  HYb and  TCL had unclear effect on the total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits. With regard to the β-cryptoxanthin content,  PSY-a had a medium positive effect ( ζ = 0.38), while  PSY-c and  PSY-g had weak negative effects ( ζ = -0.29 and -0.26, respectively). In contrast,  ZEP-a had a weak positive effect ( ζ = 0.25). Other alleles had unclear effect on β-cryptoxanthin content in juice sac tissues of fruits. Finally, with regard to the violaxanthin content,  PSY-a had a weak positive effect ( ζ = 0.20), while  ZEP-c and  ZEP-e also had weak positive effects ( ζ = 0.24 and 0.34, respectively). Other alleles had unclear effect on violaxanthin content in juice sac tissues of fruits. Regarding the other carotenoids, several alleles in  PSY,  HYb, and  ZEP had a weak effect on increasing their content ( S2 Fig). Notably,  PSY-a had a broad effect on multiple carotenoids, except for lutein. Verification of the effects of optimum  PSY and  ZEP alleles on increased carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits Box plot analysis was also carried out for β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin content ( S3 and  S4 Figs, respectively). With respect to β-cryptoxanthin, a slight effect of  PSY-a was observed on increasing the mean value, while  ZEP alleles with a positive effect clearly indicated that their numerical increase led to an increase in β-cryptoxanthin content. Furthermore, for violaxanthin, the increase in  PSY-a led to an increase in its mean value. In contrast, the numerical increase of  ZEP alleles with positive effects did not correlate with violaxanthin content, except for condition 5. These evaluation test results indicated that the optimum allele of  PSY-a emphatically had the ability to strengthen the flux of carotenoid metabolic pathway and increase total carotenoid content, along with an increase in β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin.  ZEP alleles with a positive effect also confirmed an increase in total carotenoids, and its effect preferentially increased β-cryptoxanthin content over violaxanthin content. It is considered that  ZEP alleles with positive alleles did not have a strong effect on increasing β-cryptoxanthin content by themselves, and they would likely synergistically increase β-cryptoxanthin content in cooperation with  PSY-a by the sandwich effect between upstream and downstream genes in the carotenoid pathway. Box plot analysis was carried out to inspect the ability of  PSY and  ZEP optimum alleles with the strongest positive effects on total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits.  Fig 9A revealed the distribution of total carotenoid content in six combinations of  PSY allele as follows: condition 1: a pair of negative alleles ( PSY-c or  PSY-g), condition 2: a single of negative alleles without an optimum allele  (PSY-a), condition 3: not including both optimum ( PSY-a) and negative alleles ( PSY-c or  PSY-g), condition 4: a single optimum allele ( PSY-a) and a single negative allele ( PSY-c or  PSY-g), condition 5: a single optimum allele ( PSY-a) without any negative allele ( PSY-c or  PSY-g); and condition 6, 2 optimum alleles ( PSY-a).When the mean values between conditions 2 and 3 were compared, it was clear that  PSY-c and  PSY-g had negative effects on reducing the carotenoid concentration. In contrast, the mean value of condition 6 with two  PSY-a alleles was 4.2 mg/100FWG, which was higher than those of conditions 3, 4, and 5. Interestingly, the allelic interaction between alleles with positive effect and negative effect would be observed in condition 4 In addition, the ability of 4  ZEP alleles ( ZEP-a,  ZEP-b,  ZEP-c, and  ZEP-e), which were identified to exert a positive effect on the total carotenoid content, was examined against the above six conditions of  PSY alleles ( Fig 9B). Under condition 3, which did not include any  PSY-a, the mean values of total carotenoid content increased proportionately with the number of  ZEP alleles. Under conditions 1 and 2, no consistent effect was observed along with an increase in the number of  ZEP alleles, indicating an epistatic interaction between the  PSY allele and  ZEP allele. This result was understandable as  PSY is located upstream of the carotenoid metabolic pathway compared to  ZEP. Consequently,  PSY alleles with negative effects could negate the effectiveness of  ZEP alleles with positive effects. Under condition 5, the mean values of total carotenoid content increased proportionately with the number of optimum  ZEP alleles. Under condition 6, the mean values of total carotenoid content with those  ZEP alleles were higher than those without them. Thus, these results confirmed that the optimum alleles of  PSY and  ZEP possess the capability of increasing carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits. Independent alleles in 13 founders based on the SNP genotype information of reliable SNP markers A total of 76 SNP markers were applied to the genotyping of 13 founders and 78 offspring that had parent–offspring relationships among them. Modern citrus varieties reveal extensive sharing of haplotypes from ancient species   37 . Considering the admixture genomes and long cultivation history of 13 founders, numerous  de novo mutations frequently occur in those sharing haplotypes; these would hamper the identification of a synonymous allele derived from common ancient species, out of the 26 alleles present in the 13 founders. Trio analysis was carried out to remove SNPs of  de novo mutations and obtain reliable SNPs on the basis of inheritance in the lineages. Seventy-eight combinations of parent-offspring varieties were evaluated by the computer software “MARCO”. In total, 57 SNPs passed through the filtering by trio analysis and were valid as trio-tagged SNPs. Schematic diagram to generate 57 trio-tagged SNPs and their detail information are summarized in  S1 Fig and  S1 Table, respectively. Tentatively, each of the 26 alleles calculated in the13 founders was also named according to the style of abbreviation combination for gene, variety, and allele number (1 or 2), i.e.,  PSY alleles in grapefruit were named  PSY-a-gf1 and PSY-a-gf2, and so on. The alleles with identical trio-tagged SNP genotypes were assigned as independent alleles, and 12, 10, 24, and 6 trio-tagged SNPs were used to find an independent allele for  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP, and  NCED alleles, respectively. The numbers of independent alleles in 13 founders were as follows: 7 alleles for  PSY, 7 alleles for  HYb, 11 alleles for  ZEP, 5 alleles for  NCED, and 4 alleles  for TCL. The members of each synonymous allele and their genotypes of trio-tagged SNPs are summarized in  Table 2. For example, the  PSY-independent allele was defined based on the genotype of 12 trio-tagged SNPs, and there were 7 independent alleles from  PSY-a to  PSY-g.  PSY-a-gf2 in grapefruit,  PSY-a-ks1 in Kishu mikan,  PSY-a-hs2 in hassaku,  PSY-a-so2 in sweet orange,  PSY-a-kb1 in Kunenbo mandarin,  PSY-a-wl2 in willow leaf mandarin,  PSY-a-kg2 in King mandarin, and  PSY-a-mch in ‘Murcott’ revealed the same SNP genotype and were assigned to  PSY-a. The trio-tagged SNP genotypes for  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP,  NCED, and  TCL are summarized in  S2 Table. Minimal set of trio-tagged SNPs to identify the optimum alleles of  PSY-a and  ZEP-e for marker-assisted selection Pyramiding for optimum alleles of  PSY-a and  ZEP-e would be promising for the enrichment of carotenoids, especially β-cryptoxanthin in juice sac tissues of fruits. To efficiently promote molecular breeding by marker-assisted selection (MAS), minimal sets of trio-tagged SNPs were evaluated using MinimalMarker software   35  in order to determine the optimum  PSY and  ZEP alleles among the others. For  PSY, MinimalMarker software revealed 45 minimal sets, which comprised different combinations of six trio-tagged SNPs, to discriminate any combination of the seven  PSY alleles. For example, PSY-SNP-05, PSY-SNP06, PSY-07, PSY-SNP08, PSY-SNP09, and PSY-SNP10 were one of the minimal sets to discriminate each other ( Table 3). Fortunately, the optimum  PSY-a allele could be discriminated with the other alleles by a single trio-tagged PSY-SNP06. For  ZEP, MinimalMarker software revealed a single minimal set comprising seven trio-tagged SNPs (ZEP-SNP01, ZEP-SNP03, ZEP-SNP05, ZEP-SNP14, ZEP-SNP17, ZEP-SNP20, and ZEP-SNP21) to discriminate each other ( Table 4). The optimum  ZEP-e allele could be discriminated with the other alleles by two trio-tagged ZEP-SNP17 and ZEP-SNP21. When the allelic genotypes for  PSY and  ZEP alleles in the parent varieties are available, the number of SNPs for MAS in their progenies will be smaller than the above calculated minimal sets. For example, the genotypes of seedlings from the cross between the seed parent with  ZEP-c and  ZEP-e and pollen parent with  ZEP-e and  ZEP-e would reveal homozygous genotypes of  ZEP-e or heterozygous genotypes of  ZEP-c and  ZEP-e. In this case, only one trio-tagged ZEP-SNP17 or ZEP-SNP20 was sufficient to discriminate the seedlings with homozygous genotypes of  ZEP-e ( Fig 10). Other trio-tagged SNPs, which were not included in the above minimal marker sets, are also applicable for MAS when they discriminated parent allelic genotypes. Recently, various SNP detection systems have been developed, such as the TaqMan-MGB SNP genotyping assay, Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR genotyping assay, and so on. SNP markers compatible with those systems could be customized based on the sequence information of trio-tagged SNPs listed in  S1 Table.","To enrich carotenoids, especially β-cryptoxanthin, in juice sac tissues of fruits via molecular breeding in citrus, allele mining was utilized to dissect allelic variation of carotenoid metabolic genes and identify an optimum allele on the target loci characterized by expression quantitative trait (eQTL) analysis. SNPs of target carotenoid metabolic genes in 13 founders of the Japanese citrus breeding population were explored using the SureSelect target enrichment method. An independent allele was determined based on the presence or absence of reliable SNPs, using trio analysis to confirm inheritability between parent and offspring. Among the 13 founders, there were 7 PSY alleles, 7 HYb alleles, 11 ZEP alleles, 5 NCED alleles, and 4 alleles for the eQTL that control the transcription levels of PDS and ZDS among the ancestral species, indicating that some founders acquired those alleles from them. The carotenoid composition data of 263 breeding pedigrees in juice sac tissues revealed that the phenotypic variance of carotenoid composition was similar to that in the 13 founders, whereas the mean of total carotenoid content increased. This increase in total carotenoid content correlated with the increase in either or both β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin in juice sac tissues. Bayesian statistical analysis between allelic composition of target genes and carotenoid composition in 263 breeding pedigrees indicated that PSY-a and ZEP-e alleles at PSY and ZEP loci had strong positive effects on increasing the total carotenoid content, including β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin, in juice sac tissues. Moreover, the pyramiding of these alleles also increased the β-cryptoxanthin content. Interestingly, the offset interaction between the alleles with increasing and decreasing effects on carotenoid content and the epistatic interaction among carotenoid metabolic genes were observed and these interactions complexed carotenoid profiles in breeding population. These results revealed that allele composition would highly influence the carotenoid composition in citrus fruits. The allelic genotype information for the examined carotenoid metabolic genes in major citrus varieties and the trio-tagged SNPs to discriminate the optimum alleles (PSY-a and ZEP-e) from the rest would promise citrus breeders carotenoid enrichment in fruit via molecular breeding.",NaN," 'ZEP alleles', 'carotenoid content', 'alleles', 'total carotenoid', 'ZEP', 'PSY', 'carotenoid', 'content', 'PSY alleles', 'trio-tagged SNPs' "," t-violaxanthin, c-violaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, G4, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, β-cryptoxanthin, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, β-cryptoxanthin, Kuchinotsu 52, G4, β-cryptoxanthin, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, β-cryptoxanthin, SNP, SNP, Ciclev10011841m.g, Ciclev10005481m.g, Ciclev10025089m.g, HiSeq2500, CLC, CLC, SNP, ’s, SNP, TASUKE, MiGD   19, SNP, GGPP, ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase, HYb, β-carotene hydroxylase, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, 9- cis-epoxycarotenoid, trio-tagged, trio-tagged, ’, ‘, ’, ‘Setoka’, G4, ‘, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, Kuchinotsu 52, G4, β-cryptoxanthin, PSY-a/ PSY-d, PSY-a/ PSY-c, PSY-a/ PSY-d, PSY-a/ PSY-b, PSY-a/ PSY-b, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, ζ, ζ, ζ, ζ, ζ, -0.59, ζ, β-cryptoxanthin, ζ, ζ, ζ, β-cryptoxanthin, ζ, ζ, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, PSY-c, PSY-a, PSY-a, PSY-c, PSY-a, PSY-c, PSY-a, PSY-c, PSY-a).When, 3, PSY-c, mg/100FWG, ZEP-a, 2, “MARCO”, trio-tagged, trio-tagged, PSY-a-gf2, trio-tagged, SNP, trio-tagged, trio-tagged, β-cryptoxanthin, trio-tagged, MinimalMarker, MinimalMarker, trio-tagged, PSY-SNP-05, PSY-SNP06, PSY-07, PSY-SNP08, PSY-SNP09, PSY-SNP10, MinimalMarker, trio-tagged, ZEP-SNP01, ZEP-SNP03, ZEP-SNP05, ZEP-SNP14, ZEP-SNP17, ZEP-SNP20, ZEP-SNP21, trio-tagged ZEP-SNP17, ZEP-SNP21, trio-tagged ZEP-SNP17, ZEP-SNP20, trio-tagged, SNP, trio-tagged ",  ,  ,  ,NaN

Characterization of CpMYC2 and bHLH13  Using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique, a transcriptomic library (NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession number PRJNA492170) was constructed from the full open flower stage of the Wintersweet H29 cultivar ( Figure 1), and out of 16 identified members of the  bHLH family, the desired sequence of two transcription factors  CpMYC2 (2858 bp) and  bHLH13 (2425 bp) was selected for further study   45 . Based on the NCBI ORF finder, the open reading frame of 1884 bp and 1779 bp nucleotide, encoding 628 and 593 amino acids, were observed in  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13, respectively. The theoretical isoelectric point (pI) and the molecular weight (Mw) of the  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 proteins were Pi/Mw: 5.65/68707.29 and Pi/Mw: 6.43/65502.53, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment of wintersweet  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 proteins with their homologous protein sequences in other species, especially  A. thaliana,  Nicotiana tabacum,  V. vinifera,  Cinnamomum micranthum,  Solanum lycopersicum, and  Zea mays revealed the presence of a basic helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain (446–493 amino acids for  CpMYC2 and 429–476 amino acids for  CpbHLH13) with an MYC-N terminal, which is a common feature of MYC family proteins ( Figure 2 and  Figure 3). The three-dimensional protein structure of  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 is shown in  Supplementary Figures S1 and S2. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that  CpMYC2 was closely related to the transcription factor Arabidopsis MYC2  (AT1G32640), whereas  CpbHLH13 was most homologous to  AtbHLH13 (AT1G01260), also known as JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED MYC2-like2 (JAM2) ( Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). Further phylogenetic analysis with different species revealed that  CpMYC2 had a close relationship with the predicted protein of  Cinnamomum micranthum ( CmMYC2) with 65.13% identity and  A. thaliana ( AtMYC2) with 54%, while  CpbHLH13 was mostly homologous to  C. micranthum ( CmbHLH13) with 69.77% identity followed by  Nelumbo nucifera ( NnMYC2) with 62.46% identity and  A. thaliana AtbHLH13 with 42% identity, although they were not in the same clade. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that  CpbHLH13 had a close relationship with the  A. thaliana AtbHLH13/JAM2 (At1g01260) and  AtbHLH17/JAM1 (At2g46510) transcription factors (See  Supplementary Figures S5 and S6). A summary of the homology of wintersweet  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 with identity% and functions of the genes from various plants is described in  Table 1 and  Table 2. 2.3. Expression Analysis of the Terpene Synthase Genes in Wild-Type and Transgenic Plants Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of terpene synthase genes in wild-type and transgenic plants. The results indicate that the expression of the linalool-producing gene  At1g61680 was about one and a half times higher in the plants transformed by  CpMYC2 than the other plants, while wild-type Col-0 plants, the mutant Salk_083483, and mutant plants transformed by the empty vector pCAMBIA2300S (2300S-Sk83) also showed lower expression of the  At3g25810 gene as compared to 35S:: CpMYC2 plants ( Figure 5a). Similarly, the expression of the β-caryophyllene-producing genes  At5g23960 and  At5g44630 was almost threefold higher in the plants transformed by the  CpbHLH13 gene than the wild-type arabidopsis plants (Col-0) and the plants transformed by the vector pCAMBIA2300S ( Figure 5b). The expression of the  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 genes in transgenic tobacco and arabidopsis plants was also measured ( Supplementary Figure S7) and the plants with almost identical expression were used for further experimentation. 2.2. CpMYC2 and CpbHLH13 Expression in Wintersweet To determine whether  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 expression was correlated with VOC biosynthesis during wintersweet inflorescence, the expression profile of  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 was analyzed in five developing stages of the flower of H29: flower bud (FB) stage, display petal (DP) stage, partially-open flower (POF) stage, open flower (OF) stage and senescing flower (SF) stage ( Figure 1) using qRT-PCR. The results indicated that the expression levels of  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 increased from the budding stage of the flower to the fully-open flower stage and then gradually decreased in the senescing stage ( Figure 4a,b). We also measured the expression level of both the genes in different tissues of wintersweet and found that the expression level of these genes was highest in flowers, followed by leaves and stems, and lowest in fruits ( Figure 4c,d). This indicates their importance and possible involvement in producing VOCs during blooming, also indicating that these two genes may play an important role in blooming and aroma production. 2.5. Application of MeJA and GA3 on Overexpressed CpMYC2 Plants Following MeJA and gibberellic acid (GA3) treatment, terpenoids were detected in the inflorescence of transgenic arabidopsis plants using GC-MS. The results again indicate that the emission of linalool was more than 1.5 times higher in the plants transformed by the  CpMYC2 gene (35S:: CpMYC2), while the mutant plants Salk_083483, mutant plants transformed by the vector pCAMBIA2300S (2300S-Sk83), and the Col-0 wild-type plants showed a lower amount of linalool emission compared to the wild-type (35S:: CpMYC2) plants ( Figure 9 and  Figure 10). Further analysis using real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated that the expression of the linalool-producing gene  At1g61680 was about twofold higher in the plants transformed by  CpMYC2 (35S:: CpMYC2) than the other plants, while the wild-type Col-0, mutant plants Salk_083483, and mutant plants transformed by the vector pCAMBIA2300S (2300S-Sk83) showed a lower expression of the  At3g25810 gene as compared to 35S:: CpMYC2 plants ( Figure 11). 2.6. Overexpression of CpbHLH13 Reduces Flower Pigmentation in Tobacco Plants  A few of the flowering transformed lines of  CpbHLH13 also showed phenotypic changes in petal pigmentation. These transgenic plants showed a reduction in the pigmentation of flowers ( Figure 12a). Anthocyanin contents from the inflorescence of these tobacco plants were measured by a spectrophotometer which showed a clear reduction in the anthocyanin concentration in 35S:: CpbHLH13 plants compared with those of the wild type and those transformed by the empty vector pCAMBIA2300S (2300S-SR1) ( Figure 12b,c). By measuring the anthocyanin contents in  CpbHLH13 gene-transferred transgenic tobacco (35S:: CpbHLH13) plants, we confirmed the reduction of anthocyanin contents in their inflorescence. 2.4. Overexpression of CpMYC2 and CpbHLH13 Induces VOC Emission The positively selected plants obtained from T3 generation were used to detect the terpenes from the inflorescence of transgenic arabidopsis and tobacco plants using GC-MS. We analyzed the emission of terpenes in arabidopsis and tobacco transgenic plants overexpressed with the  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 gene. The results indicate that linalool was the most abundant monoterpene ( Figure 6a,b) and its emission was more than 1.5 and 2 times higher in transgenic arabidopsis and tobacco plants transformed by the  CpMYC2 gene (35S:: CpMYC2), respectively, compared to the wild type (Col-0 and SR1) and transgenic plants transformed by the vector pCAMBIA2300S ( Figure 7a,b). Similarly, it was found that β-caryophyllene was the most abundant sesquiterpene produced in arabidopsis and tobacco plants transformed by the  CpbHLH13 gene ( Figure 6c,d). GC-MS analysis of linalool and β-caryophyllene emitted from the flowers of transformed  A. thaliana and tobacco plants is shown in  Figure 7 and  Figure 8. The results also indicate that the emission of β-caryophyllene was about twofold higher in the plants transformed by the  CpbHLH13 gene than the transgenic plants transformed by the vector pCAMBIA2300S and wild-type tobacco SR1 ( Figure 8a,b).","Wintersweet ( Chimonanthus praecox  L.) is an ornamental and economically significant shrub known for its unique flowering characteristics, especially the emission of abundant floral volatile organic compounds. Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanism of the production of these compounds is necessary to create new breeds with high volatile production. In this study, two  bHLH  transcription factors ( CpMYC2  and  CpbHLH13 ) of Wintersweet H29 were functionally characterized to illustrate their possible role in the production of volatile compounds. The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of  CpMYC2  and  CpbHLH13  increased from the flower budding to full bloom stage, indicating that these two genes may play an essential role in blooming and aroma production in wintersweet. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis revealed that the overexpression of  CpMYC2  in arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana )  AtMYC2-2  mutant (Salk_083483) and tobacco ( Nicotiana tabaccum ) genotype Petit Havana SR1 significantly increased floral volatile monoterpene, especially linalool, while the overexpression of  CpbHLH13  in  Arabidopsis thaliana  ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) and tobacco genotype SR1 increased floral sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene production in both types of transgenic plants respectively. High expression of terpene synthase (TPS) genes in transgenic  A. thaliana  along with high expression of  CpMYC2  and  CpbHLH13  in transgenic plants was also observed. The application of a combination of methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) showed an increment in linalool production in  CpMYC2 -overexpressing arabidopsis plants, and the high transcript level of TPS genes also suggested the involvement of  CpMYC2  in the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway. These results indicate that both the  CpMYC2 and CpbHLH13  transcription factors of wintersweet are possibly involved in the positive regulation and biosynthesis of monoterpene (linalool) and sesquiterpene (β-caryophyllene) in transgenic plants. This study also indicates the potential application of wintersweet as a valuable genomic material for the genetic modification of floral scent in other flowering plants that produce less volatile compounds."," 'Molecular cloning', 'Functional analysis', 'Bhlh Transcription Factors', 'Volatile Production', 'Terpene Production', 'Wintersweet (Chimonanthus Praecox L.)'

37,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7154873/eupmc_result.json,PMC7154873,"3. Results and Discussion 3.2. Annotation and Phylogenetic Analysis Based on Blastx analysis, 69% of the assembled contigs were annotated against the uniprot database with an E-value cut-off of 1e-3. A total of 71,401 S. hispanica contigs (File S1) matched to 30,628 unique sequences of plant origin in the uniprot database ( Table S1). The remaining sequences not matching to the uniport database could represent non-coding RNA, transposable element, and possible misassembled sequences. A total of 102 plant genera showed homology to at least 10  S. hispanica sequences, with the top 10 species belonging to orders Lamiales, Solanales, Gentianales, and Ericales ( Figure 1c). The phylogenetic relationship among 37 plant species representing seven families was assessed using the chloroplast Maturase K (matK) gene with the maximum-likelihood method. The matK gene has been widely used in plant evolutionary analysis at family and genus level   40 .  S. hispanica grouped with families Lentibulariaceae, Phrymaceae, Solanaceae and Rubiaceae ( Figure S1), consistent with the top species showing homology to  S. hispanica contigs. Based on Gene Ontology and KEGG annotations, diverse set of GO terms are represented in the assembled transcriptome ( Figure 2a–c). The biosynthetic, cellular protein modification, and cellular nitrogen compound metabolic processes are the top three representative terms within the Biological Process category. Ion binding is the top term in the Molecular Function category, followed by Kinase and Oxidoreductase activities and DNA binding. The top three terms in the Cellular Component category are intracellular, nucleus, and cell.  3.4. Enrichment of Vitamin Biosynthetic Genes and RT-qPCR Validation of Gene Expression  On dry weight basis, chia seed contain 8.83 mg niacin, 0.17 mg riboflavin (Vitamin B2), 0.62 mg thiamin (Vitamin B1), and 4.3mg vitamin A per 100 g of seed. Thus, from a nutritional standpoint, chia is a good source of B vitamins   41 . In comparison with rice and maize seeds, chia seeds contain more niacin and comparable amounts of thiamine and riboflavin   42 . Riboflavin plays a role in induction of plant defense responses   43 . Similarly, thiamine is an essential cofactor for a number of important metabolic pathways   44  and its deficiency is surprisingly common in humans which causes neurological and cardiovascular problems, weight loss, and confusion   45 . While cereal grains represent a good source of thiamine (0.55 mg/100 g of whole-wheat flour), most is lost during processing (0.06 mg/100 g white flour)   45 . Chia seed, which is eaten raw, contains 0.62 mg/100 g thiamine, representing a valuable source.  In this study, the vitamin biosynthetic process GO term was significantly enriched within the 6151 contigs upregulated in the  S. hispanica leaf compared to the root, and is represented by riboflavin, thiamine, pyridoxine (Vitamin B6), ubiquinone, and other terpenoid-quinone metabolic pathways. According to our comparative analysis, the Arabidopsis homologs of the majority of the biosynthetic genes functioning within these pathways were identified in our transcriptome and a number of them were full length sequences ( Table S5). RT-qPCR quantification of the riboflavin biosynthesis protein (RIBA2) homolog and homologs of two Arabidopsis thiamine biosynthetic genes were performed and shown to be upregulated in the leaf compared to the root ( Figure 5), consistent with the RNA-Seq results.  3.1. This Sequencing and de novo Assembly To obtain an overview of the  S. hispanica transcriptome, RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from leaf and root tissues of two-week-old seedlings. A total of 90 million high quality 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. The reads were  de novo assembled into 279,905 contigs greater than 300 bp, which is considerably higher than the number of protein-coding genes in well studied plants with similar size genomes such as Arabidopsis (35,386),  Medicago truncatula (62,319),  Ananas comosus (27,024), and  Populus trichocarpa (73,013) ( https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov). Unlike genome-guided assemblers, the currently available  de novo assembly programs are known to generate a high level of redundancy. Among the contributors of this redundancy are the sequencing errors and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which create mismatches   39 . Accordingly, redundant sequences get generated as the assembly programs fail to consolidate highly similar sequences. This fact is exacerbated with increasing the number of reads used in the transcriptome assembly   39 . To assess the completeness of our transcriptome and the level of redundancy, BUSCO analysis was performed. Among the 1440 BUSCO groups searched, 4% were “complete and single-copy”, 88.8% were “complete and duplicated”, 2.2% “fragmented”, and the remaining 5% were “missing” ( Figure 1a). Accordingly, the completeness score was 92.8%. This indicates that most of the evolutionarily conserved core plant gene set is present in our assembly, suggesting a high-quality assembly. However, as anticipated, high level (88.8%) redundancy was detected. The redundant sequences in our initial assembly were consolidated using the CD-HIT-EST program, which resulted in 103,367 contigs and BUSCO output of 50.2% “complete and single-copy”, 42% “complete and duplicated”, 2.4% “fragmented”, and 5.4% “missing” while maintaining completeness score of 92.2% ( Figure 1a). The remaining redundancy could be attributed to the heterogeneity of the  S. hispanica genotype sequenced in this study, in addition to possible sequencing and assembly errors. Around 40% of the assembled contigs had a length distribution between 300 and 1000 base pairs (bp) ( Figure 1b), with N50 equal to 2330 bp and a maximum transcript length of 26,500 bp.  3.3. Differential Gene Expression and GO Enrichment Analysis Gene expression profiles vary considerably among the different tissues and organs, giving each its unique characteristics. To identify tissue specific transcriptome profiles, the leaf and root RNA-Seq reads were independently mapped against the assembled contigs and differential expression analysis was performed using the EdgeR package   33 . A total of 14,267 contigs showed a significant difference (fold change >= 2; FDR < 0.01) in expression, among which 6151 and 8116 contigs were upregulated in the leaf and root, respectively ( Table S2). Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed contigs (DECs) and comparison between leaf and root tissues identified diverse and non-overlapping GO terms ( Figure 3;  Table S3). Hierarchical clustering of the DECs into 30 clusters according to their expression levels also showed both tissue specific and general gene expression patterns ( Figure 4a;  Table S4). For example, the root specific cluster 28 was enriched for lignin metabolic process and defense response ( Figure 4b), while the leaf specific cluster 16 was enriched for photosynthesis ( Figure 4c). The details of the clustering results are provided in  Table S4 and could be used by the scientific community to predict possible functions of unknown genes. 3.5. S. hispanica Terpene Synthase Family Genes Terpenes (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes) are secondary plant metabolites that play an important role in multiple biological functions   46 . Volatile terpenoids, mainly represented by isoprene (C5), monoterpenes (C10) and sesquiterpenes (C15), constitute the largest class of plant volatile compounds   47 . (E)-β-caryophyllene is a type of sesquiterpene that has been identified in a number of plant essential oils such as oregano ( Origanum vulgare L.), cinnamon ( Cinnamomum spp.), black pepper ( Piper nigrum L.), and chia leaves   7, 9, 48, 49, 50 . (E)-β-caryophyllene has been shown to selectively bind to the THC binding site in the CB2 receptor, leading to cellular activation and anti-inflammatory effects   51 . Several other biological activities are attributed to β-caryophyllene such as antibiotic, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and local anesthetic activities   52 . The plant Terpene synthases (TPSs) are the enzymes responsible for the formation of these diverse terpene metabolites   53 . The majority of the sesquiterpenes found in the tomato leaf trichomes have been attributed to the activities of TPS9 (Sst1), encoding a germacrene C synthase, and TPS12 (CAHS), encoding β-caryophyllene and α-humulene synthase   16, 54, 55 . In our assembled transcriptome, we identified 30 contigs belonging to the TPS family, evidenced by the presence of the conserved Terpene synthase family metal binding domain (pfam03936). According to a phylogenetic analysis using the 29 functional tomato TPS genes as reference, the 30  S. hispanica putative TPS sequences clustered with TS-a, TS-b, TS-c, TPS-g and TS-e/f groups ( Figure 6). Sh_contig_19087 and Sh_contig_14884 clustered with tomato TPS12, which encodes for (E)-β-caryophyllene/α-humulene synthase   16, 54 . Sh_contig_56017, Sh_contig_6900, and Sh_contig_18501 clustered with tomato TPS20, which encodes β-phellandrene synthase   16, 56 . Our analysis identified four  S. hispanica Terpene synthases that belong to TPS-g. In tomato, this clade encodes two enzymes with linalool/nerolidol synthase activity   16 . The expression of three contigs within TPS-a, two contigs within TPS-b, and two contigs within TPS-g were investigated following hormone, heat, and cold treatments. Plant hormones have a pivotal role in many physiological processes including development, immunity, adaptation to the environment, and primary metabolism. Similarly, hormones have been shown to modulate a plant’s secondary metabolism, including its terpenoid levels. The total amount of sweet basil ( Ocimum basilicum) terpenoids significantly increased after Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA) treatment   57, 58 , and cotton plants treated with MeJA emitted elevated levels of volatile terpenes   59 . In field-grown grapevines, exogenous ABA application significantly increased Sesquiterpene Nerolidol production   60 . In  Panax quinquefolium hairy root cultures, ABA induced the synthesis of triterpenoid saponins named ginsenosides   61 . Tanshinone production in the  Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy root system increased upon 3.76 μM ABA treatment   62 . Exogenous GA3 increased the percentage of some sesquiterpenes (Caryophyllene, Spathulenol, β-Eudesmol, α-Bisabolol) and decreased the percentage of tree sesquiterpenes (β-Farnesene, α-Humulene, Germacrene D)   63 . Hormone and abiotic stress treatments also effected the expression of some TPS gene family members in  S. hispanica. The gene expression of all the three putative TPS-a members tested in this study were significantly repressed following ABA treatment ( Figure 7a–c); this also occurred in Sh_contig_64857, which is a member of TPS-b ( Figure 7f). In contrast, the expression of Sh_contig_61221 (TPS-g member) significantly increased following ABA treatment ( Figure 7e). Interestingly, IAA and GA had no effect on the expression of the TPS genes tested in this study. Heat stress had mixed effects on the different group members. The relative expression of Sh_contig_42579 (TPS-a member) was significantly reduced, while that of Sh_contig_65227 (TPS-b member) was significantly increased three hours after heat treatment at 37 °C. Upon cold stress treatment, only the expression of Sh_contig_61221 (TPS-g member) was significantly induced. While gene expression analysis provides some ideas regarding the possible roles of the TPS genes in various plant physiological and adaptation processes, more direct characterization of their functions requires the expression of these genes in  Escherichia coli followed by enzymatic assays. "," Salvia hispanica  (commonly known as chia) is gaining popularity worldwide as a healthy food supplement due to its low saturated fatty acid and high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, in addition to being rich in protein, fiber, and antioxidants. Chia leaves contain plethora of secondary metabolites with medicinal properties. In this study, we sequenced chia leaf and root transcriptomes using the Illumina platform. The short reads were assembled into contigs using the Trinity software and annotated against the Uniprot database. The reads were de novo assembled into 103,367 contigs, which represented 92.8% transcriptome completeness and a diverse set of Gene Ontology terms. Differential expression analysis identified 6151 and 8116 contigs significantly upregulated in the leaf and root tissues, respectively. In addition, we identified 30 contigs belonging to the Terpene synthase (TPS) family and demonstrated their evolutionary relationships to tomato TPS family members. Finally, we characterized the expression of  S. hispanica  TPS members in leaves subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments. Abscisic acid had the most pronounced effect on the expression of the TPS genes tested in this study. Our work provides valuable community resources for future studies aimed at improving and utilizing the beneficial constituents of this emerging healthy food source."," 'Assembly', 'Plant', 'Differential expression', 'Rna-seq' "," 'Figure', 'Gene Expression', 'Expression', 'contigs', 'gene', 'Genes', 'TPS genes', 'contig', 'plant', 'Analysis' "," 30,628, Oxidoreductase, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B1, S5, 279,905, 27,024, genome-guided, BUSCO, BUSCO, “, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, BUSCO, “, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, 9, CB2 receptor, Sst1, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene synthase   16, pfam03936, TS-a, TS-b, TS-c, TPS-g, TS-e/f, Sh_contig_19087, Sh_contig_14884, (E)-β-caryophyllene/α-humulene synthase   16, Sh_contig_56017, Sh_contig_6900, Sh_contig_18501, TPS-g, linalool/nerolidol synthase, TPS-g, ’s, ABA, ABA, β-Eudesmol, α-Bisabolol, TPS-a, ABA, Sh_contig_64857, Sh_contig_61221, ABA, GA, Sh_contig_42579 (TPS-a, Sh_contig_65227, Sh_contig_61221 "," '(TPSs)', 'TPS9', 'TPS12', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-g', 'TPS12,', 'TPS20,', 'TPS-g.', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-g', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', '(TPS-g', 'TPS', '(TPS-a', '(TPS-b', '(TPS-g', 'TPS' "," 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.'

38,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7422722/eupmc_result.json,PMC7422722,"Results Subcellular localisation of tomato TPS and TPT proteins The subcellular localisation of only a handful of TPS enzymes in tomato has been reported. TPS14 was previously shown to be localised in the cytosol and TPS36 was targeted to the mitochondria (Falara  et al.,  2011). CPT1, CPT2 and CPT6 were shown to be localised to the plastids (Akhtar  et al.,  2013), but no short‐chain TPT has yet been localised to a subcellular compartment. We therefore endeavoured to determine the subcellular localisation of the all TPS and relevant TPT proteins. Sequence alignment showed that proteins in the TPS‐a clade have a short N‐terminal extension (9–18 residues) upstream the conserved R(R,P)(x) 8W motif, except for TPS36 (48 residues) and TPS14 (27 residues) (Fig.  S12). Most proteins in the TPS‐b clade and TPS‐g clade have a relatively long N‐terminal extension (28–56 residues), except for TPS38 (11 residues) (Fig.  S13). Proteins in TPS‐e/f clade appear to have a transit peptide except for TPS46 (Fig.  S14). TPS40 and TPS41 in TPS‐c clade both have a long N‐terminal extension (Fig.  S7). All TPT proteins seem to have a transit peptide (Fig.  S15). To experimentally determine their subcellular localisations, the part of each gene encoding the  c. 120 amino acids of the N‐terminus was fused to the N‐terminus of GFP and transiently expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Consistent with predictions made by TargetP and ChloroP (Fig.  S8), GFP fusion proteins of TPS3, TPS4, TPS5, TPS7, TPS19, TPS20, TPS21, TPS24, TPS40, GGPPS1, GGPPS2, GGPPS3 and SSU II were localised in the plastids, while GFP‐fusions of TPS8, TPS9, TPS10, TPS12, TPS16, TPS17, TPS25, TPS27, TPS28, TPS31, TPS32, TPS33, TPS35, TPS38, TPS39, TPS46, TPS47, TPS48, TPS51, TPS52 and FPPS1 were localised in the cytosol (Fig.  7). TPS18, TPS41, TPT1 and TPT2 were targeted to mitochondria as predicted by TargetP (Figs  8,  S8a). TPS37 was predicted to be localised in the plastids by both TargetP and ChloroP (Fig.  S8), however fluorescence signal of TPS37‐GFP fusion protein was only observed in the nonorganellar area of the cell, presumably the cytosol (Fig.  7). SSU I was targeted to plastids instead of the predicted cytosol localisation (Fig.  7). Taken together, three of the tomato TPS proteins are localised in the mitochondria, nine of them are targeted to the plastids and all the rest reside in the cytosol (Figs  7,  8). Analysis of the TPTs relevant to the production of TPS substrates indicates that FPPS1 is localised in the cytosol, while GGPPS1, GGPPS2, GGPPS3, SSU I and SSU II are localised in the plastids (Fig.  7). The speckled fluorescence pattern of GGPPS3, SSU I and SSU II‐GFP fusion proteins inside the plastid also suggests a suborganelle localisation, presumably the thylakoid, as reported in other plants (Zhou  et al.,  2017; Wang  et al.,  2018). It must be noted that these results, obtained in Arabidopsis protoplasts, will need to be confirmed in the future using tomato cells. Characterisation of the enzymatic activities of previously uncharacterised  trans‐prenyltransferases The  cis‐prenyltransferase (CPT) gene family in tomato has been fully characterised (Akhtar  et al.,  2013), but the composition and enzymatic functions of the  trans‐prenyltransferase (TPT) family members have not been thoroughly investigated. Our analysis shows that the tomato genome contains 10 putative full‐length TPTs (Fig.  1; Table  S5), including one enzymatically characterised FPP synthase (FPPS1; Gaffe  et al.,  2000), two GGPP synthases (GGPPS1 and GGPPS2; Ament  et al.,  2006) and two long‐chain (C 45 and C 50) prenyl diphosphate synthases (SPPS and DPPS; Jones  et al.,  2013). Our analysis of the genome sequence also identified one homologue each of type I and type II small subunit genes of GPP synthases (GPPSs), called respectively SSU I and SSU II (Wang & Dixon,  2009) (Figs  1,  S9; Table  S5). SSU I and SSU II proteins are catalytically inactive by themselves but each is able to bind a subunit of GGPPS to form a heterodimer that can produce GPP (Orlova  et al.,  2009; Zhou  et al.,  2017). To examine the prenyltransferase activities of the newly identified TPT enzymes (Table  S5), affinity‐purified His‐tagged recombinant proteins were incubated with IPP and DMAPP, and the hydrolysed products were analysed by GC–MS. Consistent with previous reports, GGPPS1 and GGPPS2 exhibited GGPPS activity, producing GGPP as the main product (66.3% and 86.3%, respectively) with small amounts of GPP (28.1% and 9.6%, respectively) and FPP (5.6% and 4.1%, respectively) (Fig.  6). Solyc02g085700 also showed predominantly GGPPS activity, producing a mixture of GGPP (61.2%), FPP (2.8%) and GPP (36.0%) (Fig.  6), and was thus designated as GGPPS3. No activity was observed for TPT1 and TPT2 (Fig.  6). SSU I and SSU II displayed no catalytic activity alone, but SSU I was able to change the product specificity of GGPPS1, GGPPS2 as well as GGPPS3 from GGPP to predominantly GPP (95.3%, 93.3% and 87.1%, respectively), while the heterodimers formed between SSU II and GGPPS1, GGPPS2 and GGPPS3 catalysed the formation of mainly GGPP (92.0%, 97.4% and 79.0%, respectively) (Fig.  6). Taken together, these results indicated that GPP and GGPP pools in tomato cells are provided by heteromeric GGPPSs/SSU I and three GGPPSs, respectively. Identification of new TPS genes in the tomato genome A search for TPS genes in the most recently updated tomato genome ( https://solgenomics.net/organism/Solanum_lycopersicum/genome; the 2017 release of v. SL3.0) identified 52 gene models, of which 45 had previously been reported ( TPS1– TPS46, not including  TPS45, which is present in  S. habroichaites but not in  S. lycopersicum; Tables  S3,  S4). The seven additional loci were designated as  TPS47–TPS53.  TPS47 and  TPS48 appeared to have uncompromised open reading frames (Table  S3), whereas  TPS49,  TPS50 and  TPS53 appeared to have mutations and deletions (Table  S4). Genomic sequences of  TPS51 and  TPS52 had  c. 1 kb gaps between exons 2 and 5 (Fig.  S1). To verify the mutations and fill the gaps in the new gene sequences, genomic DNA of these seven genes was amplified by PCR and fully sequenced. The results indicated that  TPS47,  TPS48,  TPS51 and  TPS52 encoded potentially functional TPSs, with protein lengths of 562, 560, 550 and 551 amino acids, respectively (Table  S3). By contrast,  TPS49,  TPS50 and  TPS53 were pseudogenes (Table  S4). TPS47 and  TPS49 are located on chromosome 3,  TPS48 and  TPS50 are located on chromosome 4,  TPS51 and  TPS52 are close to each other and in the same orientation on chromosome 7, and  TPS53 resides on chromosome 10 (Fig.  1). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that TPS47 belongs to the TPS‐b clade, together with five previously characterised monoterpene synthases, one previously characterised sesquiterpene synthase and two uncharacterised enzymes (TPS25 and TPS27) (Fig.  2). TPS48, TPS51, TPS52 and six other uncharacterised enzymes (TPS10, TPS16, TPS28, TPS33, TPS35 and TPS36, which was previously shown to have activity with  Z, Z‐FPP, but the structure of the sesquiterpene product could not be identified) (Falara  et al.,  2011), belong to the TPS‐a clade, a clade that also contains seven previously characterised enzymes, all of which are sesquiterpene synthases. Thus, the tomato genome contains at least 52 TPS genes including 34 putative functional TPSs, among these 14 (the 12 genes listed above, plus  TPS18 and  TPS41, which belong to the e/f clade) have not been previously functionally characterised. To determine the terpene synthase activity of the 14 uncharacterised TPS enzymes, their full‐length cDNAs were obtained from different tissues and functionally tested by expression in  Escherichia coli or in  Nicotiana benthamiana. Characterisation of the enzymatic activities of 14 previously uncharacterised TPS genes TPS enzymes of the TPS‐e/f and TPS‐c clades – TPS18 and TPS41 TPS18 and  TPS41, which were not previously biochemically characterised, belong to the e/f and c clades of the TPS family, respectively (Fig.  2). Proteins in these two clades are typically longer ( c. 800 amino acids) than other TPS proteins, and past attempts to express such proteins, including TPS18 and TPS41, in  E. coli have met with meagre success in obtaining soluble, enzymatically functional proteins (Falara  et al.,  2011; Matsuba  et al.,  2013). We transiently expressed these two genes in  N. benthamiana, but no terpene products were observed (Fig.  4b).  TPS18 and  TPS41 are present in a cluster on chromosome eight where  CPT1 (encoding neryl diphosphate synthase) and  CPT2 (encoding nerylneryl diphosphate synthase) are also present (Fig.  1), suggesting that they may be functionally associated. To test this hypothesis,  TPS18 and  TPS41 were each co‐expressed with either  CPT1 or  CPT2 in  N. benthamiana leaves. When  TPS18 was co‐expressed with  CPT2, an unidentified diterpene was produced (Figs  4b,  S3; Table  S2), while no monoterpene was detected when co‐expressed with  CPT1 (Fig.  S5). By contrast,  TPS41 showed no activity when co‐expressed with either  CPT1 (Fig.  S5) or  CPT2 (Fig.  4b). Neither TPS18 nor TPS41 showed activity when their genes were co‐expressed with  CPT6 (Fig.  S5). TPS41 is most similar to TPS40, another TPS‐c member with a proven  ent‐copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) activity (Bensen & Zeevaart,  1990; Falara  et al.,  2011). To test whether TPS41 has CPS activity, we co‐expressed  TPS41 with the previously characterised  ent‐kaurene synthase (TPS24, KS; Falara  et al.,  2011). No terpene product was detected when the full‐length cDNAs of  TPS41 and  KS were co‐expressed. By contrast, co‐expression of  TPS40 and  TPS24 led to the production of  ent‐kaurene (Fig.  4c). TPS41 has a long N‐terminal extension (Fig.  S7) and was predicted to be localised to the mitochondria by TargetP, which is different from the predicted plastidic localisation of KS (Fig.  S8 and see below subcellular localisation section). We then co‐expressed the truncated versions of  TPS41,  KS, as well as  GGPPS1 (Ament  et al.,  2006) to provide GGPP in the cytosol, and  ent‐kaurene was detected, indicating that TPS41 does have CPS activity (Figs  4c,  S3; Table  S2). Since the TPS18 protein was also shown to be in the mitochondria (see below subcellular localisation section), we expressed a  TPS18 construct lacking a transit peptide‐encoding region together with a similarly truncated construct for  TPS41 and  GGPPS1 in  N. benthamiana, but no new product was detected in those plants (Fig.  4c). TPS enzymes of the TPS‐a clade – TPS48, TPS51, TPS52, TPS10, TPS16, TPS28, TPS33, TPS35 and TPS36 All soluble TPS proteins (Fig.  S2) described in this section (and subsequent ones) were assayed  in vitro using GPP, NPP,  E, E‐FPP,  Z, Z‐FPP and GGPP. Results indicated that both TPS28 and TPS48 (which show 85% amino acid sequence identity) used  E, E‐FPP to produce a product identified as elemol (Figs  3a,  S3; Table  S2); elemol is reported to be the thermal breakdown product of (+)‐hedycaryol (Fig.  S4; Hattan  et al.,  2016). TPS28 and TPS48 also catalysed the formation of a major sesquiterpene from  Z, Z‐FPP that is currently unidentified (Figs  3b,  S3; Table  S2). TPS33 and TPS35 (91.7% identical) both catalysed the formation of guaia‐1(10),11‐diene from  E, E‐FPP (Figs  3a,  S3; Table  S2). When assayed with  Z, Z‐FPP, TPS33 made several sesquiterpenes including β‐acoradiene, β‐curcumene, α‐cedrene and  cis‐α‐bergamotene, while TPS35 made predominantly  Z, Z‐farnesol (Figs  3b,  S3; Table  S2). TPS36 only had activity using  Z, Z‐FPP and produced mostly  cis‐muurola‐3,5‐diene (Figs  3b,  S3; Table  S2). TPS51 and TPS52 (94.7% sequence identity) catalysed the formation of mostly  E‐nerolidol from  E, E‐FPP (Figs  3a,  S3; Table  S2) and several sesquiterpenes (α‐bisabolol,  Z‐nerolidol, α‐bisabolene, β‐bisabolene and  Z‐β‐farnesene) from  Z, Z‐FPP (Figs  3b,  S3; Table  S2). No activity was observed for either of these proteins with any of the other tested substrates. We could not obtain soluble proteins from  TPS10 and  TPS16 when expressed in  E. coli, and we therefore transiently expressed their full‐length cDNAs in  N. benthamiana. Using this approach, we determined that TPS16 catalysed the formation of δ‐cadinene from the endogenous  E, E‐FPP pool (Figs  4a,  S3; Table  S2). However, no product was detected when  TPS10 was expressed alone (Fig.  4a).  TPS10 is located on chromosome 6  c. 60 kb away from  CPT6, the gene encoding the  cis‐prenyltransferase responsible for the biosynthesis of  Z, Z‐FPP (Fig.  1), and when  TPS10 was co‐expressed with  CPT6 in  N. benthamiana, the formation of α‐bisabolol was detected (Figs  4a,  S3; Table  S2). TPS10 and TPS16 showed no activity when their genes were co‐expressed with either  CPT1 or  CPT2 (Fig.  S5). TPS enzymes of the TPS‐b clade – TPS25, TPS27 and TPS47 These three enzymes fall into a separate subclade within the TPS‐b clade (Fig.  2). TPS25 had activity only with GPP as the substrate, producing mostly β‐ocimene (Figs  5a,  S3; Table  S2). TPS27 had activity only with  E, E‐FPP to form α‐farnesene (Figs  3a,  S3; Table  S2). TPS47 showed no activity towards any of the initially tested substrates (GPP, NPP,  E, E‐FPP,  Z, Z‐FPP and GGPP). Further phylogenetic analysis with terpene synthases from other plants indicated that isoprene synthases (IspSs), which catalyse the enzymatic conversion of DMAPP to isoprene, from various species are closely related to these three enzymes (Fig.  S6a). Structural and functional analysis have established four ‘isoprene score’ amino acids that are specific to isoprene synthases (Köksal  et al.,  2010; Sharkey  et al.,  2013; Ilmén  et al.,  2015). These four amino acids are F338, S445, F485 and N505 (numbering refers to IspS from  Populus alba) (Fig.  S6b), of which only F338 is strictly conserved in all functional IspSs presently known, and when both F338 and F485 are present, the enzyme is always isoprene synthase (Ilmén  et al.,  2015). Among the tomato TPS enzymes, TPS36 has the first Phe residue, while TPS47 contains both Phe residues (Fig.  S6b). When tested  in vitro, TPS47 catalysed the formation of isoprene from DMAPP (Figs  5b,  S3). By contrast, no isoprene synthase activity was observed for TPS25, TPS27 or TPS36 (Fig.  5b). The current tomato genome does not contain sesterterpene synthase genes TPT1 and TPT2 are the only two remaining unidentified TPTs (Fig.  6). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that TPT1 and TPT2 are clustered with Arabidopsis GFPP synthases (Fig.  S9), however, neither enzyme is predicted to have GFPP synthase activity by the well established ‘three floors’ model (Table  S5; C. Y. Wang  et al.,  2016). Since no activity was detected when TPT1 and TPT2 were assayed  in vitro, we co‐expressed both genes with a sesterterpene synthase (sesterTPS) gene ( AtTPS19; Shao  et al.,  2017) in  N. benthamiana cytosol to test whether they have GFPP synthase activity. As a positive control (−)‐retigeranin B was produced when  AtGFPPS2 was co‐expressed with  AtTPS19, while no sesterterpenes were formed when either  TPT1 or  TPT2 was co‐expressed with  AtTPS19 (Fig.  S10), indicating that TPT1 and TPT2 do not have GFPP synthase activity. Arabidopsis sesterTPSs belong to the TPS‐a clade (Fig.  2), and a recent study revealed that a single amino acid with a small side chain – Gly or Pro – near the active centre determines the substrate specificity of sesterTPSs (Chen  et al.,  2019), providing a large active‐site cavity for the larger GFPP substrates (Fig.  S11a,c). However, TPS enzymes from tomato all possess a large‐side‐chain amino acid at the same site (Fig.  S11a,b). These results suggest that the current tomato genome does not contain GFPPS or sesterTPS genes. Expression of TPS and prenyltransferase genes and metabolic profiling of terpenes Our metabolic profiling of multiple tomato tissues detected a total of 21 monoterpenes and eight sesquiterpenes (Figs  10,  S3; Table  S2). In addition to the abundant and previously reported monoterpenes (+)‐2‐carene and β‐phellandrene and the sesquiterpenes β‐caryophyllene and α‐humulene (Schilmiller  et al.,  2009; Falara  et al.,  2011), we also identified several new terpenes (Fig.  10). Particularly noteworthy are α‐farnesene and  cis‐muurola‐3,5‐diene, detected only from leaf tissues (Fig.  10), positively correlated with the expression patterns of  TPS27 (α‐farnesene synthase) and  TPS36 ( cis‐muurola‐3,5‐diene synthase) (Fig.  S17), which are responsible for their synthesis respectively (Figs  3,  11; Table  S6). To determine the relative amount and tissue distribution of all the TPS transcripts as well as TPT and  cis‐prenyltransferase transcripts encoding the enzymes that form the substrates of TPS enzymes, the expression of each gene was measured in a total of 17 tomato tissues using quantitative real‐time PCR (RT‐qPCR) with gene‐specific primers. Expression was quantified and is presented as a heat map (Fig.  9) to compare the relative expression levels for each gene in different tissues. To identify any correlation between TPS and prenyltransferase gene expression and terpene profiles, terpene volatiles in these tissues were analysed as well (Figs  10,  S16). Transcripts of the four new TPS genes ( TPS47,  TPS48,  TPS51 and  TPS52) are present at low levels in multiple tissues, with slightly higher amounts observed in young leaf, flower bud, petal and mature leaf, respectively (Fig.  9). Among the other previously functionally uncharacterised TPS genes, transcripts of  TPS16 and  TPS41 are almost exclusively found in various trichomes.  TPS10 transcripts are enriched in immature green fruit in addition to trichomes, while  TPS25 is expressed in multiple tissues primarily in petiole and flower bud,  TPS27 is maximally expressed in young leaf trichomes, and  TPS28 is mainly expressed in flower bud at low levels.  TPS18 is mostly expressed in roots and flower buds,  TPS36 is mainly expressed in mature leaf trichomes and immature green and yellow fruits.  TPS33 is primarily expressed in immature green fruit and flower bud, while  TPS35 is mainly expressed in stem trichomes, flower bud and immature green fruit (Fig.  9). The TPT genes  FPPS1,  SSU II and  GGPPS3 are highly expressed in all 17 tissues,  GGPPS1 is mostly expressed in leaf tissues,  GGPPS2 is mainly expressed in fruits and flower parts, and  SSU I is mainly expressed in flower bud and fruits (Fig.  9). Our results for CPTs were similar to those previously reported (Akhtar  et al.,  2013; Matsuba  et al.,  2013), with the highest expression of  CPT1 found in trichomes, lower expression of  CPT2 mostly in petiole and stem, and lowest expression of  CPT6 mainly in stem and root tissues (Fig.  9).","Analysis of the updated reference tomato genome found 34 full-length TPS genes and 18 TPS pseudogenes. Biochemical analysis has now identified the catalytic activities of all enzymes encoded by the 34 TPS genes: one isoprene synthase, 10 exclusively or predominantly monoterpene synthases, 17 sesquiterpene synthases and six diterpene synthases. Among the monoterpene and sesquiterpene and diterpene synthases, some use trans-prenyl diphosphates, some use cis-prenyl diphosphates and some use both. The isoprene synthase is cytosolic; six monoterpene synthases are plastidic, and four are cytosolic; the sesquiterpene synthases are almost all cytosolic, with the exception of one found in the mitochondria; and three diterpene synthases are found in the plastids, one in the cytosol and two in the mitochondria. New trans-prenyltransferases (TPTs) were characterised; together with previously characterised TPTs and cis-prenyltransferases (CPTs), tomato plants can make all cis and trans C 10  , C 15  and C 20  prenyl diphosphates. Every type of plant tissue examined expresses some TPS genes and some TPTs and CPTs. Phylogenetic comparison of the TPS genes from tomato and Arabidopsis shows expansions in each clade of the TPS gene family in each lineage (and inferred losses), accompanied by changes in subcellular localisations and substrate specificities."," 'Tomato', 'Terpene synthase', 'terpenes', 'Subcellular Localisation', 'Prenyltransferase', 'Functional Characterisation', 'Specialised Metabolism' "," 'Fig.', 'Table', 'TPS', 'Figs', 'TPS enzymes', 'SSU', 'TPS genes', 'activity', 'TPS proteins', 'proteins' "," TPS enzymes, TPS14, TPS36, CPT1, CPT2, TPS‐a, N‐terminal, 9–18, R(R, P)(x, TPS36 (48 residues, TPS14 (27, TPS‐b, TPS38 (11, TPS46 (Fig.  S14, TPS40, TPS41, N‐terminal, N‐terminus, N‐terminus, GFP, TargetP, GFP, TPS3, TPS4, TPS5, TPS7, TPS19, TPS20, TPS21, TPS24, TPS40, GGPPS1, GGPPS2, GGPPS3, SSU II, GFP‐fusions, TPS8, TPS10, TPS16, TPS17, TPS25, TPS27, TPS28, TPS32, TPS33, TPS35, TPS38, TPS39, TPS46, TPS47, TPS48, TPS51, TPS52, TPS41, TPT1, TPT2, TargetP, TPS37, TargetP, TPS37‐GFP, GGPPS1, GGPPS2, GGPPS3, SSU I, SSU II, GGPPS3, SSU I, full‐length TPTs (Fig.  1, FPP synthase, GGPP, GGPPS1, GGPPS2, long‐chain, C, prenyl diphosphate, DPPS, type II small subunit, SSU I, SSU II, SSU II, GGPPS, TPT enzymes, affinity‐purified His‐tagged, DMAPP, GGPPS1, GGPPS2, GGPPS, GGPP, Solyc02g085700, GGPPS, GGPP, GGPPS3, TPT1, TPT2 (, SSU II, GGPPS1, GGPPS2, GGPPS3, GGPP, SSU II, GGPPS1, GGPPS2, GGPPS3, GGPP, GGPP, GGPPSs/SSU, GGPPSs, https://solgenomics.net/organism/Solanum_lycopersicum/genome, SL3.0, TPS47, TPS47, TPS‐b, TPS25, TPS27, TPS48, TPS51, TPS52, TPS10, TPS28, TPS33, TPS35, TPS36, Z‐FPP, TPS‐a, full‐length, TPS‐c clades – TPS18, c clades, TPS41, nerylneryl diphosphate synthase, co‐expressed, co‐expressed, co‐expressed, co‐expressed, TPS41, co‐expressed, TPS41, TPS40, diphosphate synthase, CPS, TPS41, CPS, co‐expressed  TPS41, TPS24, KS, full‐length, co‐expressed, TPS41, N‐terminal, TargetP, KS (Fig.  S8, co‐expressed, GGPP, TPS41, CPS, TPS51, TPS52, TPS10, TPS28, TPS33, TPS35, TPS36, E‐FPP, Z‐FPP, GGPP, TPS28, TPS48, E‐FPP, (+)‐hedycaryol (Fig.  S4, TPS28, TPS48, Z‐FPP, TPS33, TPS35, E‐FPP, Z‐FPP, TPS33, β‐acoradiene, β‐curcumene, α‐cedrene, TPS35, TPS36, Z‐FPP, TPS51, TPS52, E‐FPP, α‐bisabolol, β‐bisabolene, Z‐FPP, full‐length, δ‐cadinene, E‐FPP, Z‐FPP, co‐expressed, α‐bisabolol, TPS10, co‐expressed, TPS‐b clade – TPS25, TPS27, TPS47, TPS‐b clade, TPS25, E‐FPP, TPS47, E‐FPP, Z‐FPP, GGPP, DMAPP, ‘, ’ amino, Köksal  , S445, IspS, TPS36, TPS47, TPS47, TPS25, TPS27, TPS36 (Fig.  , TPT1, TPT2, TPT1, TPT2, ‘, ’, TPT1, TPT2, co‐expressed, AtTPS19, (−)‐retigeranin B, co‐expressed, co‐expressed, TPT1, TPT2, TPS‐a clade, c, TPS enzymes, GFPPS, sesterTPS, prenyltransferase, TPS enzymes, gene‐specific, prenyltransferase, TPS47, green fruit "," 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS14', 'TPS36', 'TPS', 'TPS‐a', 'TPS36', 'TPS14', 'TPS‐b', 'TPS‐g', 'TPS38', 'TPS‐e/f', 'TPS46', 'TPS40', 'TPS41', 'TPS‐c', 'TPS3,', 'TPS4,', 'TPS5,', 'TPS7,', 'TPS19,', 'TPS20,', 'TPS21,', 'TPS24,', 'TPS40,', 'TPS8,', 'TPS9,', 'TPS10,', 'TPS12,', 'TPS16,', 'TPS17,', 'TPS25,', 'TPS27,', 'TPS28,', 'TPS31,', 'TPS32,', 'TPS33,', 'TPS35,', 'TPS38,', 'TPS39,', 'TPS46,', 'TPS47,', 'TPS48,', 'TPS51,', 'TPS52', 'TPS18,', 'TPS41,', 'TPS37', 'TPS37‐GFP', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS1–', 'TPS46,', 'TPS45,', 'TPS47–TPS53.', 'TPS47', 'TPS48', 'TPS49,', 'TPS50', 'TPS53', 'TPS51', 'TPS52', 'TPS47,', 'TPS48,', 'TPS51', 'TPS52', 'TPSs,', 'TPS49,', 'TPS50', 'TPS53', 'TPS47', 'TPS49', 'TPS48', 'TPS50', 'TPS51', 'TPS52', 'TPS53', 'TPS47', 'TPS‐b', '(TPS25', 'TPS27)', 'TPS48,', 'TPS51,', 'TPS52', '(TPS10,', 'TPS16,', 'TPS28,', 'TPS33,', 'TPS35', 'TPS36,', 'TPS‐a', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS18', 'TPS41,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS‐e/f', 'TPS‐c', 'TPS18', 'TPS41', 'TPS18', 'TPS41,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS18', 'TPS41,', 'TPS18', 'TPS41', 'TPS18', 'TPS41', 'TPS18', 'TPS41', 'TPS18', 'TPS41', 'TPS41', 'TPS40,', 'TPS‐c', 'TPS41', 'TPS41', '(TPS24,', 'TPS41', 'TPS40', 'TPS24', 'TPS41', 'TPS41,', 'TPS41', 'TPS18', 'TPS18', 'TPS41', 'TPS', 'TPS‐a', 'TPS48,', 'TPS51,', 'TPS52,', 'TPS10,', 'TPS16,', 'TPS28,', 'TPS33,', 'TPS35', 'TPS36', 'TPS', 'TPS28', 'TPS48', 'TPS28', 'TPS48', 'TPS33', 'TPS35', 'TPS33', 'TPS35', 'TPS36', 'TPS51', 'TPS52', 'TPS10', 'TPS16', 'TPS16', 'TPS10', 'TPS10', 'TPS10', 'TPS10', 'TPS16', 'TPS', 'TPS‐b', 'TPS25,', 'TPS27', 'TPS47', 'TPS‐b', 'TPS25', 'TPS27', 'TPS47', 'TPS', 'TPS36', 'TPS47', 'TPS47', 'TPS25,', 'TPS27', 'TPS36', '(sesterTPS)', 'AtTPS19;', 'AtTPS19,', 'AtTPS19', 'sesterTPSs', 'TPS‐a', 'sesterTPSs', 'TPS', 'sesterTPS', 'TPS', 'TPS27', 'TPS36', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS47,', 'TPS48,', 'TPS51', 'TPS52)', 'TPS', 'TPS16', 'TPS41', 'TPS10', 'TPS25', 'TPS27', 'TPS28', 'TPS18', 'TPS36', 'TPS33', 'TPS35' "," 'GC–MS.', 'S.\xa0habroichaites', 'S.\xa0lycopersicum;' "," 'https://solgenomics.net/organism/Solanum_lycopersicum/genome;', 'S.\xa0lycopersicum;' ",terpene synthase
39,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC5562913/eupmc_result.json,PMC5562913,"Results Transcriptome changes through flower to fruit and fruit development to ripening Variations in the transcriptome were studied using several parameters, such as differentially expressed transcripts, transcripts distinctive to a stage and gene ontology enrichment during flower to fruit transition and through process of fruit development and ripening. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment Fisher’s exact test was performed to understand over- and down-represented GOs (p-value ≤ 0.001) during the transition, which gave an overall picture of the Alphonso mango development and ripening (Fig.  3). During the flower to 30 DAP fruit transition certain GOs were over-expressed such as post-embryonic developmental and anatomical structure morphogenesis process, response to abiotic stimulus and various plastid and thylakoid processes. At the same time, hydrolysis of  O-glycosyl compounds and UDP-glycosyltransferase activity along with the methyltransferase, sucrose metabolic and lipid biosynthetic activities coding GOs were down-represented. 30 DAP to 60 DAP transition described enriched GOs for starch and sucrose metabolic process, fatty acid, cellulose and vitamin biosynthetic processes, protein glycosylation, response to oxidative stress and heat along with HSP binding. During the same event cell differentiation, growth and cell death in addition to the anatomical structure morphogenesis, secondary metabolic process and response to biotic stimulus coding GOs were observed to be decreased. Comparison between 60 DAP fruit and 90 DAP pulp revealed over-represented GOs for cell differentiation and cell growth, response to biotic stimulus, secondary metabolic process, tropism and regulation of gene expression. While, starch and sucrose metabolic processes,  O-glycosyl hydrolase UDP-glucosyltransferase activities, fatty acid biosynthesis and catabolic processes along with the lipid transport, various amino acid and terpenoid biosynthesis and cell wall biogenesis were down-represented. 90 DAP pulp and skin tissues showed over-expression of various ion, ADP and sequence-specific DNA binding activities along with the response to hormone, chemical and organic substances in the skin tissue; whereas only cytoplasm and cytoplasmic part related GOs were found to be down-expressed in the skin compared to that in the pulp at 90 DAP.  Transition of 90 DAP pulp to 5 DAH pulp revealed only over-representation of GOs such as biosynthesis of RNA, aromatic compounds, and nucleobase containing compounds; binding of various ions; regulation of primary, cellular, nitrogenous compounds, RNA biosynthesis processes and gene expression and response to hormone, chemical and organic substance. Surprisingly, none of the GOs showed significant (P-value ≤ 0.001) enrichment during the transition from 5 DAH to 10 DAH and reflected as the stationary phase of Alphonso mango ripening. The 10 DAH (mid ripe stage) to 15 DAH (ripe stage) transition showed over-expression of many GOs such as binding of various ions; phospholipid, glycolipid, amino acid, co-enzyme and water soluble vitamin biosynthetic processes; methyltransferase, UDP-glycosyltransferase and  O-glycosyl hydrolase activities; starch, sucrose metabolic processes, gluconeogenesis and glycolytic process; protein phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, folding, protein modification and small protein conjugation along with the regulation and response to oxidative stress, oxidoreductase activity and redox homeostasis. While the GOs related to plastid and cytosol; post embryonic development; response to abiotic and endogenous stimulus; anatomical structure morphogenesis, plasma membrane, cell differentiation and communication were down-represented. Idiosyncratic transcripts for the stage Various transcripts unique to each of these stages (Fig.  2, Table  4, Supplementary Table  ST2) representing multiple stage specific processes were identified during this comparative analysis. A total of 388 transcripts were identified as unique to flower tissue, which mostly included various transcription and translation factors, late embryogenesis abundant proteins, stress-sensitive and dehydration-responsive element-binding protein-1b and various ribosomal proteins.  Similarly, distinct transcripts specific to fruit developing and ripening stages were identified, wherein 1,090 and 27 transcripts were idiosyncratic to the fruit developing and ripening stages, respectively (Supplementary Table  ST2). Various auxin and gibberellin induced and regulated proteins as well as several proteins responsible for various vacuole activities, multiple disease resistance proteins and various terpene synthases were distinct to the developing stages. Transcripts encoding for multiple transcription and translation factors during Alphonso fruit development were also detected. Interestingly multiple ethylene responsive transcription factors along with the protein reversion-to-ethylene sensitivity were uniquely revealed in the developing stages. Whereas, NIN-like protein, respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein d-like, rhamnogalacturonate lyase b-like, lectin receptor kinase, gag protein and methionine Υ-lyase were exclusive to the Alphonso ripening stages. Similarly, WRKY transcription factor 43, b3 domain-containing val3 and ap2 ERF domain-containing transcription factors were uniquely identified from the ripening stages. Several hypothetical and uncharacterized proteins were also found to be Alphonso ripening specific and their characterization might help to reveal the ripening process in Alphonso. Differentially expressed transcripts During ripening of Alphonso pulp from 90 DAP to 5 DAH, 42 transcripts were up-regulated (>2-fold) including methyltransferase, amino-acid permease, chloroplastic 9- cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, beta-galactosidase and protein phosphatase mainly, whereas 52 transcripts were down-regulated, important ones being few disease resistance proteins, peroxidase, sucrose synthase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The highest level of differential expression was evinced through transition from 5 DAH to 10 DAH among all the ripening tissues wherein 418 transcripts were down and 191 were up-regulated. These stages are known for non-climacteric to climacteric transition during Alphonso fruit ripening based on metabolite analysis 17,   34. Prominently down regulated transcripts were phospholipase-A LCAT3, sugar phosphate exchanger, auxin-responsive protein IAA9, abscisate β-glucosyltransferase and membrane-associated kinase regulator with more than 3-fold change, while up-regulated transcripts were aspartic proteinase nepenthesin, UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, peroxidase, bidirectional sugar transporter sweet1-like, omega-6 fatty acid desaturase and squalene monooxygenase. During the transition from 10 DAH to 15 DAH stage, increased phosphate metabolism was evident. Total 30 transcripts were up-regulated mainly including phospholipase-D, inorganic pyrophosphatase, phosphate transporter, transcription factor glk2 and DNA translocase, whereas 12 transcripts were down-regulated and important ones were aspartic protease, plastocyanin-like domain protein, annexin d2-like and glucuronosyltransferase (>2-fold). Comparison between adjacent tissue stages was carried out to identify differentially expressed transcripts at each stage of fruit development and ripening (Table  3, Supplementary Table  ST1). Flower to fruit of 30DAP, 524 transcripts were down regulated while 181 were up-regulated. Among the down-regulated transcripts alpha-amylase and subtilisin inhibitor-like (contig_6593), carbonic anhydrase (contig_5377), chitinase (contig_4907) and maternal effect embryo arrest 59 (contig_4949) exhibited the highest fold change (>2-fold); while homeodomain-like protein (contig_12912 and 12913), cytochrome p450 - cyp72a219-like (contig_4083), heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein (contig_5948) and inositol-3-phosphate synthase (contig_9620) were highly up-regulated (>2-fold).  Transition from 30 DAP to 60 DAP resulted in up-regulation of 73 and down-regulation of seven transcripts. Important down-regulated transcripts were, n-acetyltransferase (contig_1261), 9- cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (contig_1680), protein reversion-to-ethylene sensitivity (contig_9164) and ethylene receptor 2 (contig_6147). While important up-regulated transcripts were nucleotide sugar transporter family protein (contig_6337), beta-xylosyltransferase (contig_4150), various cellulose synthase catalytic subunits and laccases. Comparison of 60 DAP fruit tissue with 90 DAP pulp and skin tissue, respectively revealed down-regulation of beta-xylosyltransferase, beta-d-xylosidase, cellulose synthase and galacturonosyl transferase; whereas spx and exs domain-containing protein was up-regulated in both 90 DAP pulp and skin. Up-regulation of homeobox protein sbh1, gdsl esterase lipase, caffeoyl shikimate esterase, hydroperoxide lyase, udp-rhamnose:rhamnosyl transferase and pectinesterase inhibitor was evinced from 90 DAP pulp tissue compared to that in 60 DAP fruit tissue. Evaluation of differentially expressed transcripts between pulp and skin of 90 DAP revealed very few transcripts down-regulated in skin with none of them showing change more than 2-fold, while 54 transcripts were up-regulated in 90 DAP skin tissue including the important ones as DNA mismatch repair protein msh5, acyl carrier protein, amino-acid permease, calcium-transporting ATPase, isoflavone reductase and various disease resistance proteins. Transcriptome analysis identified novel enzyme inhibitors from Alphonso mango We identified various classes of enzyme inhibitors (Supplementary Table  ST3) such as α- amylase inhibitor (2 contigs), inhibitor of proliferation pds5, apoptosis inhibitor (2 contigs), bax inhibitor (4 contigs), lipid transfer protein inhibitor (6 contigs), various kinase inhibitors (16 contigs), cysteine proteinases inhibitor (4 contigs), inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (3 contigs), serine protease inhibitor, kunitz family trypsin and protease inhibitor, guanosine nucleotide diphosphate dissociation inhibitor, nf-kappa-b inhibitor (2 contigs), pectinesterase inhibitor (12 contigs), polygalacturonase inhibitor, proteasome inhibitor, protein transport inhibitor (4 contigs), protein phosphatase inhibitor and rho gdp-dissociation protein inhibitor (4 contigs). Along with these, contigs coding for protein reversion-to-ethylene sensitivity (3 contigs), cell wall and vascular inhibitor of beta-fructosidase (2 contigs) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor were also identified from Alphonso transcriptome. These inhibitors showed differential regulation during fruit development and ripening (Supplementary Figure  SF8). Most of the inhibitors were found to be expressing throughout all the stages except for the group 4 (coding for bax inhibitor), which were abundant only during fruit ripening stages of Alphonso mango and probably played important role in ripening physiology of Alphonso mango. Spatial changes in transcriptome at 90 DAP In case of Alphonso mango, 90 DAP stage is a mature raw stage of the fruit and is considered as the right stage of fruit harvest (0 DAH) for further artificial ripening of the fruit 35. Hence transcriptome analysis of skin and pulp were separately carried out at this stage. Overall 90 DAP skin was found to be metabolically more active compared to the 90 DAP pulp with respect to differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table  ST1), unique genes (Supplementary Table  ST2) and enriched GOs (Fig.  3). In the skin, 54 transcripts were up-regulated whereas only four were down-regulated compared to the pulp. Among the up-regulated transcripts (>2-fold), isoflavone reductase, transcription and translation regulatory proteins, hydrolases, methyltransferase etc. were more prominent; whereas four down-regulated transcripts were membrane and cytoplasm related GOs. Unique transcripts upon comparison between 90 DAP pulp and skin showed carotene and xanthophylls biosynthesis related contigs, beta-carotene hydroxylase (contig_5406) and anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase, flavor related various terpene synthases and ripening related contigs such as ethylene-responsive transcription factors, pectate lyase, pectin esterase and cellulase as unique to skin compared to the pulp. Interestingly, in comparison of 5DAH stage with 90 DAP pulp few of these transcripts such as isoflavone reductase (contig_5337) and beta-carotene hydroxylase (contig_5406) were observed to be idiosyncratic to 5 DAH stage as seen in 90 DAP skin stage. Similarly, transcripts encoding enzymes involved in pectin degradation (contigs_9578, 9579, 18096 and 3603) were found to be upregulated (>2-fold) in the comparison between 10DAH vs 90 DAP pulp and 15 DAH vs 90 DAP pulp. These finding suggest progression of ripening related molecular processes in the pulp of 5 DAH and onward stages which were initiated at 90 DAP skin and highlight initiation of Alphonso ripening process from skin and its probable progress towards fruit stone. Transcriptome validation through qRT PCR Results of the transcriptomic analysis were validated by qRT PCR of 38 representative genes from various metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate metabolism (cellulose synthase: CS, chitinase: CTN, and pectate lyase: PL), fatty acid metabolism (omega 3 fatty acyl desaturase: O3FAD, omega 6 fatty acyl desaturase: O6FAD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate acyl transferase: G3PAT, alcohol dehydrogenase: ADH and long chain fatty acyl CoA ligase: LCFACL), terpene metabolism (mono-terpene synthases: MTPS, sesqui-terpene synthases: STPS and di-terpene synthases: DTPS) and proteins such as ethylene responsive factors: ERF and disease resistance proteins: DRP. Various transcript variants of these genes were selected wherever available to confirm the accuracy of assembly. qRT PCR analysis revealed similar differential expression pattern for almost all the transcripts through all the eight stages with correlation coefficient  R ranging between 0.8 and 0.99. Few transcripts showed variation in the fold change of RNAseq and qRT PCR data at few stages but still had good correlation ( R ≥ 0.7) (Figs  5– 9 and Supplementary Table  ST5). Transcript variants confirmed the accurate assembly and showed differential expression of these variants from each other through various tissues analyzed (Figs  5– 9).  Alphonso mango transcriptome Unique transcripts were assigned enzyme commission (EC) number to determine the involvement of these transcripts in various BPs. Total 4,611 ECs were assigned from oxidoreductase, transferase, hydrolase, ligase, lyase and isomerase classes; wherein, transferases were the most abundant followed by hydrolases in all the eight tissues (Fig.  1c). These assigned ECs represented 142 known pathways from the KEGG database ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) 31–  33, which are potentially functional in Alphonso mango fruit development and ripening. Most of these pathways were saturated with higher number of annotations from transcriptome data e.g. metabolism of starch, sucrose and various amino acids including methionine and biosynthesis pathway of ethylene, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids (Supplementary Figure  SF2). Alphonso mango transcriptome was screened through eight tissue samples. To map differentially expressed transcripts a merged assembly was generated from the reads of all the tissues, which reflected upon overall Alphonso mango flower and fruit transcriptome. For each tissue read numbers were more than 100 million, which were assembled using k-mers 67, 75 and 83 separately and then merged for individual tissue. Average number of unique transcripts post assembly was 76,043 and with N50 and N80 values as 1,835 and 1,008 bp, respectively (Table  1). The minimum and maximum lengths of transcript from these assemblies were 100 and 17,342 bp, respectively (Table  1). Average number of transcripts was 11,925 upon filtering for redundancy and identifying candidate coding regions with maximum 90% identity and minimum 70% coverage (Table  2).  Unique transcripts from each assembled and filtered set were subjected to BLASTx against the non-redundant dataset from NCBI ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). From a total of 20,755 unique transcripts from the merged assembly, 92.22% transcripts were annotated while 954 transcripts (4.59%) encoded hypothetical proteins and 661 (3.17%) remained unidentified. BLASTx statistics revealed maximum hits from  Citrus sinensis and  C. clementina followed by  Theobroma cacao, Jatropha curcas, Vitis venifera and  Ricinus communis (Fig.  1a). Total 74,330 GO terms related to various biological processes (BP), molecular functions (MF) and cellular components (CC) were assigned to these 20,755 unique transcripts. Metabolic, cellular and single organism processes followed by biological regulation and localization were the most abundant terms under the BP category; binding and catalytic activity related terms under MF category; while, organelle, membrane and macromolecular complex terms under the CC category, respectively (Fig.  1b, Supplementary Figure  SF1).  Glycosidases and cell wall degrading enzymes from Alphonso mango Degradation of plant cell wall components, namely cellulose, hemi-cellulose and pectin by cellulases and glucanases in ripening fruits is responsible for the fruit softness. Cellulases encoding five contigs were identified among which one coded for acidic cellulase and found to be abundant during flower and early fruit developing stages. Total 18 contigs encoding glucanase were detected of which contig_4148 was up-regulated in flower compared to 30 DAP, whereas, four transcripts (contig_9268, contig_19283, contig_9267 and contig_17145) were down-regulated (>2-fold) at 10 DAH compared to 5 DAH stage. Pectin is another component of fruit cell wall and is degraded by a set of enzymes  viz. pectate lyase (PL), pectin esterase (PE), polygalacturonase (PG) and rhamnogalacturonate lyase. In the present study 18 PL, 24 PG and 10 PE coding transcripts were detected. However, only few were differentially expressed, for example, only PL contig_7696 was down-regulated in 30 DAP fruit compared to flower and PL contig_9578 was up-regulated in 10 DAH fruit than 5 DAH fruit. PG non-catalytic subunit jp650 coding contig_9895 was down-regulated in 5 DAH pulp than in 90 DAP pulp, whereas PG contig_3471 was down regulated and PG contig_1614 was up-regulated in 10 DAH compared to 5 DAH stage. Likewise, PE contig_7997 was down-regulated and contig_9162 was up-regulated at 30 DAP stage compared to flower. Similarly, eight transcripts encoding rhamnogalacturonate lyase were detected of which two (contig_7745 and contig_7746) were distinct to the ripening stages (Supplementary Table  ST2). Glycosidases are involved in a variety of functions such as hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates (storage and structural) to mono-saccharides, removal of sugars from various glycans including glycosidically bound aroma volatiles, which serve as storage pool for the aroma compounds. In the present study, many glycosidases acting on various sugars i.e. glucose, galactose, mannose, fructose, xylose, fucose and rhamnose, were detected. Among these, class glucosidase with the highest number of contigs (51 contigs) was observed to contain 28 and 21contigs coding for glucan β-glucosidase and general β-glucosidase, respectively. Two contigs coding for α-glucosidases were identified of which one coded for glucan α-glucosidase and the other for general α-glucosidase. Among these, at 30 DAP stage contig_7442 and contig_7857 were found to be down-regulated (>3-fold) compared to those in flower stage. Contig_16888 was down-regulated whereas contig_17138 was up-regulated at 10 DAH than those at 5 DAH. At 15 DAH contig_9072 was down-regulated (1.5-fold) compared to that at 10 DAH. Among the galactosidase class, nine contigs encoding α-galactosidase and 21 contigs encoding β-galactosidase were detected. Two of these were down-regulated (contig_1095 and contig_1096) at 30 DAP compared to those in flower. Contig_3844 was down regulated in 90 DAP pulp compared to 60 DAP. Transition from 90 DAP to 5 DAH reflected in to up-regulation of contig_3844 (2.72-fold) whereas, contig_1525 coding for α-galactosidase was down-regulated in 10 DAH compared to that at 5 DAH. In the mannosidase class, five α-mannosidase and eight endo-β-mannosidase coding contigs were identified out of which two encoding for endo-beta-mannosidase (contig_15554 and contig_15558) were down-regulated at 10 DAH compared to 5 DAH, rest didn’t show differential regulation. Among two α-xylosidase and five β-xylosidase from Alphonso mango only contig_1633 showed differential regulation which was up-regulated at 60 DAP compared to 30 DAP and was further down-regulated in both the 90 DAP tissues. Two transcripts coding for the acid beta-fructofuranosidase (contig_12501 and contig_12502) were detected but did not show any differential regulation in various tissues analyzed. Also, seven contigs coding for the alpha-l-fucosidase were identified from Alphonso mango but did not show differential regulation. Genes involved in the flavor biogenesis in Alphonso mango We further analyzed the differential expression of all these flavor related genes in terms of transcript abundance in flower and fruit developing and ripening stages (Supplementary Figure  SF7). Among these the contigs encoding various TPS were abundant in flower and during early developing stages. Interestingly, many contigs encoding EH (contigs 8280, 3904, 3901, 14123 and 8281), LOX (contigs 18105, 12748, 12747 and 12385) and EO (contigs 8026, 5618, 15594, 14137 and 13600) were found to be ripening specific and might be playing crucial role in generating unique aroma volatiles during Alphonso fruit ripening. Quantitatively mono-terpenes are abundant in Alphonso followed by sesqui-terpenes 2,   35. The present data revealed six contigs encoding mono-terpene synthases ( limonene synthase1, limonene synthase2, beta ocimine synthase1, beta ocimine synthase2,  isoprene synthase1 and  isoprene synthase2), five contigs encoding sesquiterpene synthases ( germacreneD synthase1, germacreneD synthase2, nerolidol synthase1, nerolidol synthase2 and  alpha farnesene synthase) and three contigs coding for di-terpene synthases ( ent-kaurene synthase and  casbene synthase (E,E)-geranillinalool synthase). Phylogenetic analysis (Fig.  4) of these genes along with other plant terpene synthases (TPS) showed distribution of these genes in to the TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-e and TPS-f clades, respectively 36.  Furaneol and mesifuran are the two furanones from Alphonso mango and their synthesis by  enone oxidoreductase ( EO) and  O-methyltransferase ( OMTS), respectively have been described earlier 10,   11. Multiple contigs coding for  quinone oxidoreductase and  O-methyltransferases were detected in the present analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of these contigs with the characterized genes revealed another similar transcript variant for the  MiEO (Supplementary Figure  SF3), whereas none of the contigs showed similarity to the  MiOMTS (Supplementary Figure  SF4). Green grassy aroma of unripe fruits is due to the C6 volatiles formed during the lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) pathways. In the present study a single contig encoding the  hydroperoxide lyase and six contigs encoding  13-lipoxygenase were detected. Involvement of  9-lipoxygenase ( Mi9LOX) and epoxide  hydrolase 2 ( MiEH2) in the biogenesis of lactones from Alphonso mango was confirmed in our recent study 15. One more transcript encoding  9-lipoxygenase similar to that of the characterized  Mi9LOX (Supplementary Figure  SF5) and three contigs coding for  epoxide hydrolase 2 grouping with the  MiEH2 (Supplementary Figure  SF6) were additionally detected in the present study. Three more novel contigs coding for  epoxide hydrolase were also detected but neither grouped with the other  EH1or  EH2 from different plant species (Supplementary Figure  SF6).","Alphonso is known as the ""King of mangos"" due to its unique flavor, attractive color, low fiber pulp and long shelf life. We analyzed the transcriptome of Alphonso mango through Illumina sequencing from seven stages of fruit development and ripening as well as flower. Total transcriptome data from these stages ranged between 65 and 143 Mb. Importantly, 20,755 unique transcripts were annotated and 4,611 were assigned enzyme commission numbers, which encoded 142 biological pathways. These included ethylene and flavor related secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, as well as those involved in metabolism of starch, sucrose, amino acids and fatty acids. Differential regulation (p-value ≤ 0.05) of thousands of transcripts was evident in various stages of fruit development and ripening. Novel transcripts for biosynthesis of mono-terpenes, sesqui-terpenes, di-terpenes, lactones and furanones involved in flavor formation were identified. Large number of transcripts encoding cell wall modifying enzymes was found to be steady in their expression, while few were differentially regulated through these stages. Novel 79 transcripts of inhibitors of cell wall modifying enzymes were simultaneously detected throughout Alphonso fruit development and ripening, suggesting controlled activity of these enzymes involved in fruit softening.",NaN," 'DAP', 'DAP pulp', 'DAH', 'Alphonso mango', 'contig', 'Supplementary Table', 'transcripts', 'contigs', 'Alphonso', 'DAP fruit' "," down-represented GOs, UDP-glycosyltransferase, HSP, GOs, glycolipid, UDP-glycosyltransferase, hydrolase, oxidoreductase, protein-1b, ribosomal, auxin, NIN-like, rhamnogalacturonate lyase, lectin receptor kinase, gag, methionine Υ-lyase, b3 domain-containing val3, ap2 ERF domain-containing, methyltransferase, beta-galactosidase, protein phosphatase, peroxidase, sucrose synthase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Prominently, phospholipase-A LCAT3, IAA9, abscisate β-glucosyltransferase, membrane-associated kinase, aspartic proteinase nepenthesin, UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, peroxidase, sugar transporter sweet1-like, phospholipase-D, phosphate transporter, glk2, annexin d2-like, glucuronosyltransferase (, 30DAP, alpha-amylase, subtilisin inhibitor-like, contig_6593, carbonic anhydrase, contig_5377, chitinase (, contig_4907, contig_4949, homeodomain-like protein, cytochrome p450, contig_4083, heat shock cognate 70 , contig_5948, inositol-3-phosphate synthase, n-acetyltransferase, contig_1261, cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, protein reversion-to-ethylene, contig_9164, ethylene receptor 2, contig_6147, contig_6337, beta-xylosyltransferase (, contig_4150, cellulose synthase, subunits, laccases, beta-xylosyltransferase, beta-d-xylosidase, cellulose synthase, galacturonosyl transferase, homeobox, sbh1, gdsl esterase lipase, udp-rhamnose:rhamnosyl transferase, pectinesterase inhibitor, calcium-transporting ATPase, isoflavone reductase, α- amylase, bax, cysteine proteinases, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (3, serine protease, protease inhibitor, nf-kappa-b inhibitor (2, pectinesterase inhibitor (12 contigs, polygalacturonase, rho gdp-dissociation, vascular inhibitor of, beta-fructosidase (2, bax, isoflavone reductase, hydrolases, methyltransferase, beta-carotene hydroxylase, contig_5406, anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase, pectate lyase, pectin esterase, cellulase, isoflavone reductase, contig_5337, beta-carotene hydroxylase, contig_5406, pectin, contigs_9578, 10DAH, chitinase, pectate lyase, PL, O3FAD, O6FAD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate acyl, alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH, RNAseq, BPs, oxidoreductase, hydrolase, isomerase, hydrolases, 76,043, 74,330, macromolecular complex, pectin, cellulases, glucanases, cellulase, glucanase, contig_4148, contig_9268, contig_19283, contig_9267, contig_17145, Pectin, PL, pectin esterase, PE, polygalacturonase (, rhamnogalacturonate lyase, PL, PE, PL contig_7696, PL contig_9578, contig_9895, PG contig_3471, PG contig_1614, PE contig_7997, contig_9162, rhamnogalacturonate lyase, contig_7745, contig_7746, class glucosidase, 21contigs, glucan β-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, α-glucosidases, glucan α-glucosidase, α-glucosidase, contig_7442, contig_7857, contig_17138, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, contig_1095, contig_1096, Contig_3844, contig_3844, α-galactosidase, mannosidase, α-mannosidase, endo-β-mannosidase, endo-beta-mannosidase (, contig_15554, contig_15558, n’t, α-xylosidase, β-xylosidase, contig_1633, beta-fructofuranosidase, contig_12501, contig_12502, alpha-l-fucosidase, EH, LOX, sesqui-terpenes 2, synthase1, synthase2, beta ocimine synthase1, beta ocimine synthase2, synthase1, synthase2, germacreneD synthase1, germacreneD synthase2, alpha farnesene synthase, ent-kaurene synthase, E)-geranillinalool synthase, TPS-b, TPS-e, oxidoreductase (, oxidoreductase, lipoxygenase, hydroperoxide lyase, Mi9LOX, epoxide  hydrolase 2, MiEH2, epoxide hydrolase 2, hydrolase "," 'MTPS,', 'STPS', 'DTPS)', 'TPS', '(TPS)', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-e', 'TPS-f' ",  ,  ,terpene synthase
40,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC5038615/eupmc_result.json,PMC5038615,"Results and Discussion BR synthesis is conserved in Viridiplantae until synthesis of campesterol The conversion of 6-deoxotyphasterol to 6-deoxocathasterone is catalyzed by DDWF1, which is only described in pea, 209 while the corresponding gene in  A. thaliana has not been identified yet. Finally, oxidation on the C-6 by BR6ox leads to CS, the immediate precursor of BL. Br6ox (CYP85A1 and CYP85A2 in  A. thaliana) has been originally identified as an  extreme dwarf (dx) allele of the tomato  DWARF locus (D). CYP85A2 (Br6ox2), but not CYP85A1 (Br6ox1), drives the conversion of CS to BL. Expression analysis of tomato co-orthologues in different tissues showed that only one co-orthologue was expressed in both cases. For the co-orthologues of Br6ox, only moderate expression was detected in fruit ripening stages, whereas for ROT3/CYP90D1, moderate expression was observed in root, stem, and leaf ( Supplementary Table 21). As for all other phytosteriods, the biosynthesis of BR derives from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (isopentenyl PP;  Fig. 9A), which is conjugated to the triterpene squalene ( Fig. 9A). 16, 206, 207 By the action of CAS1, SMT1, CYP51, FACKEL, HYD1, DWF7, DWF5, and DWF1, campesterol is synthesized, 73 which is the direct C28 precursor of the BR specific pathway. In line with the fact that campesterol is not exclusively a precursor for BR, the pathway was conserved in all analyzed plants with the exception of FACKEL and DWF5 ( Fig. 9A,  Supplementary Tables 7 and 14). The enzyme FACKEL was only present in  Z. mays, S. tuberosum, and  A. thaliana, whereas DWF5 co-orthologues were only missing in  C. reinhardtii. In tomato, CAS1 co-orthologues showed a moderate expression at maximum and could potentially limit the rate of campesterol synthesis. In contrast, SMT1, CYP51, and DWF5 showed the tendency to be highly expressed in most of the tissues ( Supplementary Table 21). Furthermore, HYD1 orthologue was not expressed in flower tissue. The subsequent processing of BR synthesis starting from campesterol as a basic precursor is not yet fully described and the exact order of enzymatic reactions in this part of the BR pathway is still under debate. For our analysis, we depicted the two pathways described by Zhao and Li, 76 which are branching during the action of DET2, DWF4 (annotated as CYP724B2 and CYP90B3 in tomato, respectively), and CPD (annotated as CYP90A1 in  A. thaliana). Remarkably, only DET2 co-orthologues were found in the green algae and the moss included in our analysis ( Supplementary Table 14). For eudicots, the reaction catalyzed by the P450 monooxygenase DWF4 has been proposed as a rate-limiting step in BR synthesis, 208 and transcriptome profiling of tomato co-orthologues revealed only low expression in all tissues for DWF4. In contrast, CPD showed moderate or high expression in all tissues ( Supplementary Table 21). For co-orthologues in both routes, mostly no or only low expression was observed in flower tissue. The two routes lead to the production of 6-deoxotyphasterol and the only two additional enzymes identified in  A. thaliana are ROT3 (CYP90C1) and CYP90D1, but it is unknown yet whether both enzymes indeed participate in both pathways. IAA conjugation, storage, and degradation is conserved among species Irreversible oxidation of IAA is the major target for IAA inactivation and occurs on conjugated forms as well. The accumulation of oxIAA observed after IAA application indicates that this catabolic pathway is involved in the regulation of bioactive auxin levels in plants. Finally, conversion of IAA in its methyl ester form by IAMT1 and MES17 results in a nonpolar modified form of IAA, which can probably be transported independent of auxin transporters. We observed that the required enzymes, however, were only moderately expressed in tomato ( Fig. 2), and IAMT1 co-orthologues could be found only in  P. patens, eudicots and rice, but not in any other of the selected monocots or  C. reinhardtii ( Fig. 1B,  Supplementary Table 1). This might suggest that this enzyme was lost specifically in some monocots. The mechanism of stimulation of adventitious root formation by indol-3-butyric acid (IBA) is well established. Further, IBA is a naturally occurring IAA precursor in many plant species, which requires a peroxisomal β-oxidation activity and the IBA synthase 112 for its conversion to the biologically active IAA ( Fig. 1B, gray region). The compound IBA appears as reversible auxin storage form, which is transported independent of IAA. 113 In tomato, the orthologue to IBR1 and the two IBR3 co-orthologues involved in conversion of IBA to IAA were expressed in nearly all analyzed tissues at moderate levels ( Fig. 2). Both IAA and IBA are found in conjugated forms either with amino acids like alanine (Ala) or leucine (Leu) or in ester-linked conjugates with glucose. 27 Co-orthologues for IAA-specific GH3 proteins were present in all plant species, except for  C. reinhardtii ( Fig. 1B). The conjugates either serve as hydrolyzable storage forms or play a role in IAA degradation. 26 Several IAA-leucine resistant (ILR) and ILR-like (ILL) proteins, which contribute to the release of active IAA from amino acid conjugates, exist in  A. thaliana and are grouped in CLOGs containing co-orthologues of all selected plant species. Tomato co-orthologues were expressed in all analyzed tissues ( Fig. 2). Another ILL protein (ILL3) has been shown to be involved in auxin biosynthesis in  P. euphratica, 114 but was not included in the CLOG of the other ILL proteins. We observed that ILL3 co-orthologues exist in monocots and eudicots only, and the corresponding tomato gene was expressed in all tissues. General procedure for information extraction We extracted the information for the phytohormone pathways established for  A. thaliana (“Methods” section) and assigned co-orthologues to the proteins involved in these pathways in 13 photosynthetic eukaryotes including Arabidopsis ( Fig. 1A,  Supplementary Tables 1–7). In contrast to other orthologue studies in plants such as the study by Wu et al. 97, our approach was not based on a single plant clade like Euasterid but attempt coverage of the whole Viridiplantae super kingdom by using model organisms from algae, mosses, monocots, and eudicots. The orthologue search was based on proteomes, and by this, the referenced tools OrthoMCL and InParanoid allowed detection of co-orthologues and putative paralogs without being restricted to single-copy orthologous genes. 97 The approach in our study allowed the detection of CLOGs for phytohormone biosynthesis, transport, and signaling. Identified co-orthologues and co-orthologues (multiple co-orthologues of the same species) 98 in one CLOG were analyzed for the presence of conserved functional domains found in the  A. thaliana bait as it was performed in earlier studies. 88, 99 Co-orthologues containing all functional domains were assumed to be functionally related; however, we also considered proteins with additional or missing domains as relevant co-orthologues due to domain “stealing, swapping, or swiveling”. 100 Additionally, putative targeting signals for intracellular localization were predicted to verify that the proteins within a CLOG share enzyme functionality and similar intracellular localization of the  A. thaliana bait. This limited the number of co-orthologues with putative function in phytohormone pathways, because most pathways or parts of them are defined to specific organelles ( Supplementary Tables 8–14). Focusing on tomato, the expression patterns of co-orthologues in the phytohormone pathways in tissues and fruit developmental stages gave hints for rate-limiting steps and tissue-specific expression. Publically available expression values in different tissues and fruit developmental stages based on “reads per kilobase per million mapped reads” (RPKM) normalized datasets were extracted from the GEO 96 and Sol Genomics Network (SGN;  Supplementary Tables 15–21). 101 The expression data of co-orthologues in CLOGs were categorized as low expression (RPKM < 5), moderate expression (RPKM < 100), and high expression (RPKM ≥ 100). All information are deposited in a database, 102 focusing on the assignment of the recently published tomato genome. 89 ACC synthases form a diverse gene family within the ethylene pathway In contrast to the orthologue search, previous sequence analysis divided ethylene receptors into subfamily I and II. Subfamily I members tend to have higher similarity to histidine kinases, whereas subfamily II members have acquired serine kinase activities. 126 The ethylene signaling in  A. thaliana is more dependent on subfamily I members, which cannot be functionally replaced by subfamily II members. 127 In turn, reduced expression of the subfamily II receptor genes,  SlETR4 or  SlETR6, in tomato results in substantially increased ethylene sensitivity. 124 This phenotype cannot be restored to that of wild-type by overexpression of the subfamily I receptor. Thus, the subfamily II receptors might have a more important function in tomato than in  A. thaliana. The biosynthesis pathway of ethylene consists of only three enzymes ( Fig. 4).  S-adenosylmethionine is synthesized from methionine by  S-adenosyl- l-methionine synthetase (SAM1) and is converted to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) by ACC synthase (ACS). Our orthologue search shows that each selected plant species contains at least one orthologue for SAM1. More interestingly, the  A. thaliana genome encodes 12 ACS-like genes, which could be divided into three CLOGs.  ACS3 is an  A. thaliana-specific pseudogene with a short protein sequence, whereas ACS10 and ACS12 belonged to the same CLOG ( Supplementary Table 2), and it has been shown that these aminotransferases can complement the  Escherichia coli aminotransferase mutant  DL39. 119 Thus, there are nine authentic ACS genes in the  A. thaliana genome, 120 which were grouped in one CLOG containing co-orthologues from green algae, monocots, and eudicots but without co-orthologues from the moss  P. patens. In tomato, there are at least eight characterized ACS genes, 121 but we could assign 13 co-orthologues to the nine  A. thaliana ACS genes involved in ethylene synthesis ( Supplementary Table 16). In the last step of ethylene biosynthesis, ACC oxidase (ACO, four genes in  A. thaliana) converts ACC to ethylene. Remarkably, ACO2 and ACO3 build their own CLOG without other plant co-orthologues and ACO1 and ACO4 further fell in different CLOGs. Overall, our analysis revealed six genes in the tomato genome in the three CLOGs of ACOs, which has been shown in earlier results. 121 Coherent with the importance of ethylene for fruit development, the high expression of two genes (RPKM > 1000; Solyc01g095080, Solyc05g050010) was observed during ripening ( Fig. 4121). The current model considers the formation of ACC as the rate-limiting step. SAM1 and EFE/ACO co-orthologues were highly expressed in all tissues in tomato, while the ACS co-orthologues showed only moderate expression ( Fig. 4;  Supplementary Table 16). However, the activity of ACS is regulated by phosphorylation at protein level as it was documented for SlACS2 (Solyc01g095080). 122 The physical movement of EIN2 C-terminal region from the ER membrane to the nucleus allows the ethylene signal to activate the downstream transcription factors EIN3 and EIN3-like (EILs) in the nucleus. Phosphorylation at specific sites in EIN2 region regulates translocation. 39 In tomato, we identified six co-orthologues to these transcription factors (EIN4/EIL1, four co-orthologues; EIL3, two co-orthologues;  Supplementary Tables 2 and 9). The ethylene signal stabilizes EIN3 and EIL transcription factors, which are short-lived proteins in the absence of ethylene, and consequently activates ERFs, inducing various physiological responses. 129 The ethylene signaling cascade starts with binding of ethylene to ER-localized receptors with protein kinase activities. 50, 123, 124 In all monocots, eudicots, and mosses, ethylene receptors represent a gene family that is composed of ETR1, ERS1, ETR2, ERS2, and EIN4 in  A. thaliana ( Supplementary Tables 2 and 9). Our analysis revealed the presence of seven co-orthologues in  S. lycopersicum, from which five have been previously described (SlETR1, -2, -4, -5, and Never ripe), while two have not been yet tested in tomato (SlETR6 and -7 125;  Supplementary Table 16). Recent advances propose a more complex route that includes feedback-regulated transcriptional networks as well as protein and mRNA turnover regulatory modules. According to this regime, ETP1 and ETP2 control EIN2 levels, whereas EBF1 and EBF2 (EIN3-binding factor) regulate the levels of EIN3 in response to the ethylene signal. 39 Interestingly, the orthologous group including ETP1 and ETP2 contains 134 additional co-orthologues of  A. thaliana, most of them containing both or at least one F-Box and F-Box associated (FBA_1) domains ( Supplementary Table 9). Remarkably, only one representative of  B. distachyon and  S. tuberosum was detected in the same CLOG, which could be due to the fact that these F-Box proteins evolve very fast or they are species-specific in their primary sequence. Four orthologues were identified for EBF1 and EBF2 in tomato and at least three of them showed moderate or high expression in all tissues ( Supplementary Tables 2 and 16). However,  A. thaliana ETP1 and ETP2 were grouped in one CLOG containing 134 additional putative co-orthologues but only one orthologue of  B. distachyon and  S. tuberosum each. With respect to the high number of co-orthologues only in Arabidopsis and the low conservation within the super kingdom of Viridiplantae, the functional relation of all the 136 co-orthologues in the ethylene signaling pathway is unlikely. In the absence of ethylene, the receptors activate the negative regulator CTR1 (constitutive triple response1), thus repressing the activity of downstream ethylene signaling components. 39 In  A. thaliana, the Ser/Thr protein kinase CTR1 is localized at the ER membrane due to its physical interaction with the receptors 128 and directly phosphorylates the C-terminal domain of EIN2 in the absence of the ethylene signal. Our orthologue search detected co-orthologues of the two  A. thaliana CTR1 genes only in monocots and eudicots, while in line with former studies, four co-orthologues were found in tomato ( Supplementary Table 16124). Cytokinin transport, perception, and signaling Type-A ARRs do not possess a defined output domain, and most of them are transcriptionally induced in response to cytokinins ( Supplementary Table 10). Interestingly, for the six co-orthologues in tomato, we observed that each orthologue corresponded to a pair of Arabidopsis type-A ARRs except for the group containing ARR8 and ARR9. Furthermore, in tomato type-A ARRs were expressed in all analyzed tissues with two exceptions. The orthologue of ARR5/6 was not expressed in tomato fruit, while the orthologue of ARR16/17 was only expressed in flowers and fruits ( Supplementary Table 17). Altogether, the function of type-A ARRs as negative regulators of cytokinin response by interfering with the function of positive regulators in the signal transduction pathway is widely assumed. One exception so far is ARR4, which has been shown in Arabidopsis to interact positively with phytochrome B, 149 and it will be interesting to see whether this particular function is conserved in tomato and other plant species as well. tZ-ribonucleoside (tZR) is preferentially transported toward the shoot through the xylem, while the rootward transport of cytokinins occurs through the phloem. Initially, it was discussed that cytokinin receptors (AHK2, 3, and 4 in  A. thaliana), with typical domain structure of membrane-bound histidine sensor kinases, represent the extracellular recognition site for cytokinin binding. Recent studies identified most of the receptor proteins in the ER membrane, which opened the discussion whether perception of cytokinins occurs in the ER lumen rather than on the cell surface. 140– 142 AHK2, 3, and 4 are proposed to form heterodimeric receptor complexes upon cytokinin perception, while AHK1 is located in a distinct orthologous group, 143 which was confirmed by our orthologue search. Cytokinin response1 (CRE1) and Woodenleg (WOL1) are allelic to AHK4 and were identified in mutant screens for cytokinin phenotypes. 144 Cytokinin insensitive1 (CKI1) is one additional, more distantly related histidine kinase in  A. thaliana145; however, its involvement in cytokinin signaling remains to be shown. In tomato, three co-orthologues were also present in the CLOG of AHK2–4 ( Supplementary Table 17), which were expressed at high levels in all analyzed tissues. In contrast, for the tomato orthologue of CKI1, no expression was observed ( Supplementary Table 17). Binding of cytokinins triggers the activation of the histidine kinase domain of AHK on the cytosolic site, leading to its autophosphorylation. Components acting downstream in the phosphorelay signaling pathway include histidine-containing phosphotransfer proteins, named AHP in  A. thaliana. The AHP family consists of five members (AHP1–5) and one pseudo AHP considered as a negative regulator (AHP6). We detected four co-orthologues of AHP in tomato falling in four different CLOGs. One of the four co-orthologues was expressed in all tissues ( Supplementary Table 17). For the AHP4 and AHP6 co-orthologues, no expression was detected. AHP has been shown to function in the transfer of the signal to the nucleus to regulate the activity of response regulators (ARRs) acting as transcription factors. ARRs form a large family with 15 proteins in  A. thaliana, which can be divided according to their domain structure into type-A AARs acting as repressors (ARR3–9, 15–17) and type-B ARRs acting as activators (ARR1–2, 10–12). 140, 146, 147 In tomato, six type-A AAR and five type-B AAR co-orthologues exist ( Fig. 5B;  Supplementary Tables 3 and 17). For ARR16 and ARR17, only a weak response to cytokinin was reported. 148 These two AARs were found only in eudicots in our analysis, which could indicate redundant or newly developed functions in cytokinin response. The stability of some of the type-B AARs is controlled by their recruitment to specific SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes containing one of the four F-box proteins KISS ME DEADLY (KMD1–KMD4). Two co-orthologues of KMD were detected in tomato ( Fig. 5B,  Supplementary Table 3). The directional cellular auxin transport system is specific to multicellular organisms Besides long-distance phloem transport, the directed cell-to-cell transport of IAA is essential for the regulation of auxin homeostasis. 115 Key regulators are PIN-type auxin transport proteins ( Fig. 3A), which are distributed asymmetrically along the plasma membrane. As expected, these proteins could be detected in multicellular organisms only ( Fig. 3B), and most of them were not expressed in the tomato fruit ( Supplementary Table 15). The polar orientated localization of the transporter changes dynamically in response to light or physical stimuli such as gravity and defines the direction and velocity of cellular auxin transport. Release of IAA into the low pH environment of the apoplast has been shown to lead to its protonation into IAAH. AUX1/LAX1 influx carriers localized at the opposite side of the next cell facilitate uptake of the apolar IAAH by the adjacent cell. In line with its function in long-distance transport, AUX1 orthologue in tomato was only moderately expressed in roots, stem, and leaves ( Supplementary Table 15), while at least one LAX1 co-orthologue was moderately expressed in all tomato tissues. According to the chemiosmosis model, IAA is deprotonated and trapped in the neutral cytosolic compartment until exported by PIN proteins or other auxin transport mechanisms consisting of P-glycoproteins of the ABCB transporter family (ABCB/PGP). While most PIN proteins are plasma membrane proteins, PIN5, PIN8, and PIN-LIKE proteins are localized at the ER membrane and regulate the intracellular distribution of IAA. 116 Consequently, in our analysis, PIN5 and PIN8 were grouped into two distinct CLOGs containing none of the other PIN genes (PIN1–4, PIN6–7). Further, co-orthologues of PIN5 and PIN8 were found only in monocots and eudicots and tended to occur as single-copy genes ( Fig. 3A,  Supplementary Tables 1 and 8). With respect to their function in intracellular transport, co-orthologues to all other PINs and NRT1.1 existed in all plants, but not in  C. reinhardtii, and the number of co-orthologues varied between 3 and 14 ( Fig. 3B). GA perception and signaling is absent in green algae and mosses Current models for GA perception and signaling consider three key components. 196 The first is the soluble, nuclear-localized GA receptor GID1, 197 which we identified in monocots and eudicots ( Supplementary Table 6). The second are the growth repressing DELLA proteins GAI, RGA, and RGL1, 2, and 3 identified in  A. thaliana198 as well as SLR1 found in rice, 199 which form a subfamily of the plant-specific GRAS transcription regulators. All of these proteins were grouped in one CLOG also containing co-orthologues from the moss in addition to monocots and eudicots. However, in contrast to  A. thaliana that has five GRAS enzymes, many eudicots and monocots contained only one orthologue. The third are the F-box proteins SLY1 and SLY2, 200 which are called GID2 in rice ( Fig. 8B201). No co-orthologues of these factors were detected in the moss and the green algae. By this, the GA signaling pathway seems to have emerged after mosses. However, co-orthologues of SLY were not found in  V. vinifera ( Supplementary Table 6). Remarkably, SLY2 co-orthologues were not expressed in the analyzed tomato tissues under normal conditions ( Supplementary Table 20). In the absence of GA, DELLA proteins act as central repressors of GA response by suppressing the activity of PIF transcription factors (PIF3, 4), which are involved in the regulation of growth-promoting GA-responsive genes. 202, 203 Binding of GA to the receptor GID1 triggers its interaction with DELLA proteins and causes their release from repression complexes. 204 In turn, simultaneous binding of SLY1/GID2 recruits DELLA proteins for ubiquitination by the SLY1/GID2-dependent E3-ligase complex and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. 204 Furthermore, the level of DELLA proteins is also controlled by the activity of the phytochrome-interacting factor PIF1/PIL5, and the regulation of DELLA activity is done by proteins SCL3 and SPY1. 67, 205 In general, PIFs have been evolved specifically in different species, as PIF6 was present only in  A. thaliana and we observed PIF1 co-orthologues only in some eudicots ( S. tuberosum,  S. lycopersicum,  M. truncatula, and  G. max;  Supplementary Tables 6 and 13). Further, our analysis for expression in tomato revealed that most of the enzymes were expressed at low levels under normal conditions ( Supplementary Table 20). The indole-3-pyruvic acid pathway is a major, but not the only, route of auxin biosynthesis in tomato The IAM pathway also predicts two steps for the conversion of Trp to IAA with IAM as an intermediate product ( Fig. 1B). The pathway resembles the conversion of Trp to IAA found in  Agrobacterium strains. 107 In our study, only co-orthologues of AMI1, the enzyme that catalyzes the second step, 108, 109 were identified in all plants except for  P. patens. AMI co-orthologues were highly expressed in tomato leaves compared to other organs ( Fig. 2). In contrast, proteins similar to the bacterial proteins encoded by  aux1/iaaM/tms1 genes were not identified. Recently, the conversion of IAOX to IAM was suggested as an alternative route to generate IAM. 110 Two major pathways of IAA biosynthesis have been proposed so far. 26 The  tryptophan (Trp)-independent pathway derives from the plastidial Trp-biosynthesis route, which is initiated with the conversion of chorismate to anthranilate ( Fig. 1B, green region). This pathway consumes immediate precursors of Trp, ie, indole-3-glycerol phosphate or indole for the production of IAA. However, the molecular identity of the required enzyme remains unknown up to now. The  Trp-dependent IAA synthesis unifies several routes of IAA biosynthesis deriving from Trp. These routes vary in the formation of distinct intermediates leading to the names of the particular pathways, ie, the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) pathway ( Fig. 1B, blue area), the indoleacetamine (IAM) pathway ( Fig. 1B, yellow area), and the indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOX) pathway ( Fig. 1B, red area). The high number of intermediates and identified genes proposed to be involved in their enzymatic processing ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 8) provides a high complexity to auxin biosynthesis concerning different possible biosynthetic pathways, which is still under debate. 26 The IPA pathway includes two enzymatic reactions to convert Trp to IAA. 21, 103, 104 Either TAA1/TAR1 or TAR2 catalyzes the first reaction. While we could observe TAR2 co-orthologues in all plants except for green algae, TAA1/TAR1 was specific for eudicots ( Fig. 1B). Remarkably, tomato co-orthologues to TAA1/TAR1 were not expressed in any of the analyzed tissues ( Fig. 2). The second is catalyzed by YUC1 and YUC2, two proteins encoded by the YUCCA gene family of flavin monooxygenases. Co-orthologues of all these genes were found in all species with the exception of  C. reinhardtii ( Fig. 1B,  Supplementary Tables 1, 8, and 15). Again, the expression of tomato YUC1, 2 co-orthologues, was low in most of the tissues (RPKM < 5) compared to other genes of the synthesis pathway ( Fig. 2). This might point to conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAD) by an indole-3-caboxylase, an enzymatic activity described for IAA synthesis in plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria species, which has not been identified in plants yet. Co-orthologues of AAO1, the proposed aldehyde oxidase activity required for the subsequent conversion of IAD to IAA, were detected by our analysis in all plants, and their moderate expression in tomato exceeded that of YUC co-orthologues (RPKM > 5;  Fig. 2). Nevertheless, it needs to be mentioned that broad substrate specificity was observed for the AAO1 multigene family that might link its activity to ABA synthesis as well, which is still discussed. 105, 106 The activity of YUCCA enzymes is assigned to the IAOX pathway for converting tryptamine (TAM) into IAOX ( Fig. 1B). However, we detected neither tomato co-orthologues to  A. thaliana NIT1, 2 enzymes converting tryptophan to TAM nor to enzymes converting indole-3-acetonitril (IAN) to IAA ( Fig. 1B). This observation stands in line with discussion that the IAOX pathway is present in Brassicaceae only. 111 Furthermore, the identified co-orthologues of the cytochrome P450 oxidases CYP79B2/B3 involved in IAOX production in  A. thaliana110 were also not expressed in the examined tissues in tomato ( Fig. 2,  Supplementary Table 15). This supports the current model that the IPA pathway is the major route of auxin biosynthesis in tomato. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that several Trp-dependent auxin biosynthesis pathways may coexist and operate in different tissues. 103 Auxin perception is tightly linked to the regulation of auxin-responsive gene Two classes of interacting transcription factors are involved in the control of auxin-regulated gene expression ( Fig. 3C115– 117). AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors were found to be present in all monocots and eudicots and were represented by a single CLOG ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 8) with varying numbers of co-orthologues ranging from 5 in tomato to 15 in  A. thaliana. Remarkably, one tomato orthologue was found to be highly expressed only in fruits (Solyc09g065850), while all others were not expressed in this tissue ( Supplementary Table 15). AUX/IAAs generally consist of four functional domains. The “N-terminal domain I” harbors an ethylene response factor (ERF)-associated amphiphilic repressor (EAR) motif required for recruitment of TOPLESS (TPL), which is acting as a transcriptional corepressor in the absence of auxin. Interestingly, co-orthologues to TPL were identified in all analyzed plant genomes except in  C. reinhardtii. For  P. patens, we could identify two TPL co-orthologues but no co-orthologues to AUX/IAA ( Supplementary Table 1). Domain II of AUX/IAA proteins is required for the control of their auxin-stimulated degradation, and domains III and IV participate in the formation of homo- and hetero- oligomeric complexes including interactions with members of the second class of transcription regulators, the auxin- responsive factors (ARFs). ARFs recognize and bind through their B3 DNA-binding domain-specific auxin-response elements and act as either transcriptional repressors or activators. 118 In  A. thaliana, the ARF subfamily consists of 15 members while we identified only six ARF co-orthologues in the genome of tomato ( Supplementary Table 15). In the presence of auxin, the activation of ARFs is controlled by degradation of AUX/IAAs and release of TPL-mediated repression of DNA-binding and transcriptional activation ( Fig. 3C). Degradation of AUX/IAAs is triggered by binding of auxin to one of the F-box proteins TIR1/AFB1–5, the substrate recognition subunit in the SCF TIR/AFB E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which per se is acting as an intracellular auxin receptor in plants. The stability of the E3 complex is regulated by modification of the scaffold subunit Cullin1 (CUL1) through covalent binding of the ubiquitin-related small protein RUB1. Our results suggest that the regulatory regime of auxin signaling can be transferred to all phototrophic eukaryotes containing co-orthologues with the exception for  C. reinhardtii ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 8) in which, if present, auxin signaling must be differently perceived. Although all components of the basic SCF complex were also present in the green algae co-orthologues of the TIR/AFB, F-Box proteins were not present. Jasmonate response co-orthologues show differences between tomato and Arabidopsis Impairment of JA signaling leads to severe phenotypes like male sterility in  A. thaliana, while in the tomato mutant,  jai1-1 female sterility was observed. 191 In line with the essential role of JAI1, the tomato orthologue was expressed in all tissues. Interestingly, expression of the COI1 orthologue was not observed in tomato flowers ( Supplementary Table 19), 165 although it is interacting with JAI1. The main components of JA response are transcription factors of the JA-ZIM-domain (JAZ) repressor family, calcium-related signaling molecules, and JA-related transcription activators. Ca 2+-dependent phosphorylation and MAPK cascades are also involved in the regulation of JA biosynthesis. 61 Among the targets of JA signaling are JA biosynthesis genes that form a positive feedback system. 182 We observed that the regulation of transcriptional changes triggered by JA synthesis was conserved in eudicots and monocots ( Fig. 7B;  Supplementary Tables 5 and 12). 183– 185 The primary regulators are MYC transcription factors and JAZ repressors are associated in corepressor complexes with NINJA and TPL (Topless;  Fig. 7B). None of the eight JAZ repressors in  A. thaliana were represented in green algae and moss, and JAZ5, 6, and 9 occurred only in eudicots or were found specifically in  A. thaliana ( Supplementary Table 5). Degradation of JAZ repressors is mediated by binding of JA-Ile to the F-box protein coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1) bound to the SCF Col1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex ( Fig. 7B), which in turn allows the expression of early JA response genes. 186– 188 JAZ proteins also bind to MYB21 and MYB24, two transcription factors encoded by genes strongly induced by JA in flower tissues that control stamen development and pollen maturation in  A. thaliana. 189, 190 For tomato, only three JAZ co-orthologues were identified in two distinct CLOGs, showing the same domain architecture containing a TIFY (transcription factor domain) and a CCT_2 (short plant protein motif) domain ( Supplementary Table 12). For two co-orthologues (Solyc07g042170 and Solyc03g118540), high expression levels were found in roots and Solyc07g042170 was at least moderately expressed in all other tissues ( Supplementary Table 19). Putative rate limitations in biosynthesis of ABA in tomato The final two steps of ABA synthesis occur in the cytoplasm and include the conversion of xanthoxin to ABA aldehyde catalyzed by SDR1/ABA2 and the formation of the carboxyl group mainly by abscisic acid oxidase 3 (AAO3), which is one of the three AAOs in  A. thaliana. 152 All three enzymes depend on a molybdenum cofactor. 153 Consequently, a mutant of the sulfurase in  A. thaliana that produces the functional cofactor was named  aba3, because strong ABA deficiency phenotypes were caused due to abolishing all AAO activities. 154 In tomato, we identified two co-orthologues of ABA2, six of AAO3, and one of ABA3 ( Fig. 6A;  Supplementary Tables 4 and 18). However, not all co-orthologues of AAO3 might be involved in ABA synthesis. On the one hand, three of them showed only moderate expression ( Fig. 6A), while on the other hand, it has been shown that Arabidopsis AAO3 is the major AAO in ABA biosynthesis. 152, 153 ABA synthesis is initiated in plastids and derives from the metabolism of carotenoids. 17, 150 Moreover, ABA-specific defects are connected to mutations in genes acting downstream of zeaxanthin synthesis. Zeatin epoxidase (ZEP), also called ABA1, catalyzes the formation of violaxanthin, and this step is reversed by the action of violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE;  Fig. 6A). The process known as xanthophyll cycle is assumed to provide sufficient amounts of zeaxanthin for an increased photo-oxidative protection under high-light conditions. Each of the two enzymes is encoded by a single gene in Arabidopsis and has one orthologue in tomato, whereas VDE1 was not found in  C. reinhardtii ( Supplementary Tables 4 and 11). In contrast to ZEP1, which was at least moderately expressed in all tissues ( Supplementary Table 18), VDE1 was not expressed in roots, flowers, and ripe fruits. Formation of 9-cis-violaxanthin and 9-cis-neoxanthin via its intermediate trans-neoxanthin are the last steps occurring in plastids before cleavage by 9-cis-epoxicarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED; five genes in  A. thaliana151) and releasing of xanthoxin from the C40 precursor into the cytosol. While the enzyme-encoding genes are known for the ABA4-dependent formation (ABA4, AT1G67080) of trans-neoxanthin, the activities required for the isomerization to the 9-cis derivatives remain to be identified. Two co-orthologues of ABA4 were identified in tomato, which are globally expressed ( Fig. 6A;  Supplementary Table 18). The subsequent cleavage of xanthophyll by NCED is the rate-limiting step in ABA synthesis, 17 and expression of NCED is tightly regulated in response to stress and developmental signals. In contrast to previous results, 151 we observed a localization signal for only three (NCED 2, 3, 5) NCEDs in  A. thaliana. The number of co-orthologues in the 13 plant species ranges from none in  C. reinhardtii to nine in  Z. mays, all containing the carotenoid oxygenase-specific domain (retinal pigment epithelial membrane (RPE) 66,  Supplementary Tables 4 and 11). In tomato, three NCED co-orthologues were present and one appeared to be globally expressed ( Fig. 6A;  Supplementary Table 18). ABA catabolism plays an important role in the regulation of ABA homeostasis, and currently, two pathways have been described. 17 The first is initiated by 8′-hydroxylation of ABA, which leads to the isomerization of the intermediate 8′-OH-ABA to phaseic acid (PA) and the subsequent degradation via conversion to dihydrophaseic acid ( Fig. 6A17). Four P450-type monooxygenases CYP707A were identified to catalyze the initial step in  A. thaliana. 155 All of them were present in the same CLOG together with four co-orthologues of tomato ( Supplementary Tables 4 and 11; Solyc08g005610, Solyc08g075320, Solyc04g078900, and Solyc01g108210). The expression patterns showed spatial and temporal differences, indicating that individual members might have different importance during growth and development ( Fig. 6A;  Supplementary Table 18). The second pathway leads to the formation of glycose ester conjugates (ABA-GE) by the activity of several glycosyltransferases (UGT71Bs 17). ABA-GE is considered as storage or transport form of ABA, which accumulates in vacuoles and the apoplast. Translocation to the ER and rapid reactivation of ABA by cleaving the glycose ester conjugates by β-glucosidases (BG1 and BG2) is assumed to occur in response to dehydration. The five tomato co-orthologues to UGT71B and the one to BG1 were found to be expressed in most tissues. BG2, which was assumed to catalyze the conversion of vacuolar stored ABA conjugates, was expressed at very low level ( Fig. 6A;  Supplementary Table 18). Cytokinin biosynthesis seems to be specific for mono-cots and eudicots Conjugation to glucose and irreversible cleavage are the two major reactions efficiently reducing the levels of bioactive cytokinins ( Fig. 5A18).  N-glycosyltransferases catalyze the glycosylation of nitrogen residues in the purine ring, while  O-glycosylation occurs on the oxygen in the side chain of tZ or dihydrozeatin (dhZ). The latter reaction likely produces storage forms that can be rapidly reactivated by β-glucosidases. 138 Removal of the unsaturated side chains of tZ and iP by the activity of cytokinin oxidases (CKX) leads to their irreversible inactivation and is important for the regulation of active cytokinin levels and limitation of cytokinin effects. The members of both IPT and CKX gene families show remarkably distinct expression patterns in  A. thaliana and expression of several CKX genes can be stimulated upon cytokinin application. 139 For tomato, only one orthologue of IPT5 and another of IPT9 were found to be expressed in all tissues, while transcripts of the other IPT co-orthologues were absent in most of the tissues. None of the co-orthologues of the tomato CKX gene family was expressed in all tissues, and a high variance in the expression patterns was observed as it was shown for  A. thaliana in previous studies ( Supplementary Table 17). 139 Interestingly, with the exception of the CKX family, we could show that always one gene of each enzyme family of the cytokinin biosynthesis path in tomato was expressed in every tissue. In summary, for the green algae  C. reinhardtii and the moss  P. patens, no co-orthologues were identified for cytokinin trans-hydroxylases and glucosyltransferases, while  C. reinhardtii also lacked the CKX family. Furthermore, only the tRNA-IPT (IPT9) and a small set of LOG family genes were found to be present in the unicellular algae. Enzymes encoded by isopentenyltransferase (IPT) genes catalyze the initial step of cytokinin biosynthesis. Earlier work based on sequence alignments by ClustalW 130 proposed that IPTs likely evolved in plants, although similar sequences exist in some cyanobacteria. 45 In contrast, our orthologue search approach (see “Methods” section) confirmed the occurrence of IPT genes in all monocots and eudicots, but not in mosses or algae. The only exception was tRNA-IPT (IPT9), which was detected in all selected plant species. Nevertheless, functional equivalent enzymes for IPT in species like green algae are expected, because cytokinin has been detected in the green alga  Chara globularis and putative cytokinin receptors have been found in different green algae. 131, 132 We identified six co-orthologues in tomato for the nine  A. thaliana IPTs, from which only one showed high expression in all tissues ( Supplementary Table 17). IPT utilizes adenosine tri- or diphosphate (ATP/ADP) and dimethylallyl-diphosphate (DAMPP), the reactive isomer of isopentenyl diphosphate, to synthesize N 6-(Δ 2-isopentenyl) adenosine-5′-triphosphate and -diphosphate ribonucleotides iPRTP and iPRDP, respectively ( Fig. 5A133). Both compounds are converted subsequently into the corresponding trans-zeatin ribonucleotides (tZRTP/tZRDP) by cytokinin trans-hydroxylases, such as the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases CYP735A1 and CYP735A2. Both enzymes were identified in  A. thaliana and found to be conserved in monocots and eudicots. In tomato, two co-orthologues were detected in one CLOG, which showed different expression patterns in tissues and developmental stages ( Supplementary Table 17). Only CYP735A1 showed moderate expression in root, flower, and mature fruit, whereas CYP735A2 was not expressed in any of these tissues. The formation of cytokinin ribonucleosides and the free bases iP and tZ has been originally assumed to be catalyzed by 5′ ribonucleotide phosphohydrolases and adenosine nucleosidases. 134, 135 However, the identification of the LONELY GUY (LOG) family of enzymes in rice and  A. thaliana suggests the direct conversion into the bioactive forms of the two cytokinins. Interestingly, one CLOG containing LOG1, LOG3, and LOG4 was found to be conserved in all plant species but the remaining six  A. thaliana LOG genes were clustered in different CLOGs and could be divided into Arabidopsis specific (LOG2, LOG6, and LOG9), eudicot specific (LOG7), or monocot/eudicot specific (LOG5 and LOG8). In summary, we identified four co-orthologues of the LOG family in tomato ( Supplementary Table 10). Remarkably, almost all co-orthologues of IPT, CYP735A, and LOG showed low expression in fruit ripening stages ( Supplementary Table 17), which on the one hand suggests that cytokinins are not produced in fruits at high levels, but on the other hand, studies on the metabolite cytokinin showed that it has an unclear influence on fruit development. 136 Although found in substantial amounts, cis-zeatin (cZ) has no biological hormone activity and cannot be converted sufficiently into trans-zeatin (tZ). 137 Moreover, the synthesis of cZ seems to be completely independent of the tZ synthesis pathway because two of the nine IPT genes in  A. thaliana (IPT2 and IPT9) are specifically involved in the formation of cZRMP by utilizing AMP and DMA-PP. 45 We were able to assign one specific tomato orthologue for both enzymes (IPT2: Solyc11g066960; IPT9: Solyc12g014190), suggesting that this pathway is also present in tomato. cZRMP is mainly derived from the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway of IPP synthesis, while the tZ pathway preferentially consumes IPP derived from the plastidial methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Alternative modes of BR signaling in monocots and moss Besides controlling the expression of growth-promoting genes, BZR1 and BZR2 also feedback the expression of upstream signaling components and genes involved in BR biosynthesis. Among these, SBI1 mediates the methylation of PP2A, which in turn is translocated to the plasma membrane and promotes the inactivation of the internalized BRI1 receptor by dephosphorylation ( Fig. 9B). In contrast to PP2A, SBI1 was not identified in the eudicot  S. tuberosum, which could be related to the incomplete genome draft or an analogous redundant function. Because long-distance transport is not shown for BR or derivatives so far, it is widely assumed that they act in close vicinity to the places of synthesis. 210 Binding of BRs to the extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain of the serine/threonine receptor kinase BRI1 initiates the release of the inhibitor protein BKI1 and formation of heterodimers with BAK1 ( Fig. 9B211, 212). While we detected co-orthologues of BAK1 and BRI1 in all plants except the green algae  C. reinhardtii, the inhibitor BKI1 was identified only in eudicots, which suggests an alternative mode of regulation in monocots ( Supplementary Table 7). Interestingly, the CLOG of BAK1 contained seven to 30 co-orthologues per species in eudicots and monocots. However, the identified co-orthologues showed a large heterogeneity in their domain architecture ( Supplementary Table 14). Autophosphorylation and sequential transphosphorylation of the cytoplasmic kinase domains fully activate the receptor complex and triggers the downstream signal transduction by activating BSK1, which in turn phosphorylates BSU1. Interestingly, BSK1 was low expressed during fruit ripening and in the mature fruit ( Supplementary Table 21). BSU1 acts as a protein phosphatase and inactivates the serine/threonine kinase BIN2 by dephosphorylation. In the absence of BR, BIN2 is constitutively active and controls the phosphorylation of BZR1 and BES1/BZR2, two transcription factors involved in the regulation of BR-responsive genes. We observed that this regulatory network was mainly conserved in all plants except for green algae. Both transcription factors are kept inactive by either rapid proteasomal degradation or cytoplasmic retention through interaction with 14-3-3. 74 Only BZR1 and BES1/BZR2 were not identified in  P. patens, which suggests that species-specific transcription factors might exist in moss ( Supplementary Table 7). Transport of ABA needs functional assignment within orthologous groups Three ABA-specific receptor types associated with distinct cellular localizations have been described ( Fig. 6C). 17, 48, 162 One type is localized to the ER, Golgi, and peripheral plasma membranes and consists of the G protein coupled receptor proteins GTG1, GTG2, and GCR2. Interaction with the G-alpha subunit GPA1 regulates the binding of ABA. Signal transduction from these receptors mainly targets the regulation of membrane channels involved in Ca 2+ transport and control of water permeability, eg, in guard cells. We identified three tomato co-orthologues of GCR2, and one for GTG1 and GTG2. Interestingly, the latter was only expressed in flower and fruit tissues ( Supplementary Table 18). Several transporters encoded by distinct transporter gene families are involved in the transport of ABA or ABA conjugates across the various membranes ( Fig. 6B). 156 The members of the subfamily G of the large ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family are one group of these transporters (ABCG). 157 In  A. thaliana, ABCG25 was the first ABA efflux carrier identified in the plasma membrane. It is expressed mainly in vascular tissues. 158, 159 ABCG22 and ABCG40 reside in guard cells and contribute to enhanced import of ABA into stomatal cells. 160 The CLOGs of ABCG22 and ABCG40 contained five additional co-orthologues to Arabidopsis ABCG22/25 and 14 co-orthologues to ABCG40, for which the functional assignment remains to be elaborated. In total 31 ABCG co-orthologues have been detected in tomato ( Supplementary Table 18). The third class of ABA receptors consists of soluble proteins seen as entrance components of the “core ABA signaling pathway” ( Fig. 6C48). These receptors belong to a gene family (14 genes in  A. thaliana) known as pyrobactin resistant (PYR), PYR-like (PYL), or regulatory component of ABA receptor (RCAR) which was represented in our study by eight co-orthologues in  S. lycopersicum ( Supplementary Table 4). The proteins control the activity of downstream components of the signaling pathway by the interaction with protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), which acts as a negative regulator of ABA response. This inhibition is maintained by the interaction with the active ABI1, 2 enzymes containing the PP2C domain (conserved in all 13 species,  Supplementary Table 11). Further, SNF1-related kinases (SnRKs; seven co-orthologues in tomato) regulate the ABA signaling in the absence of ABA or at low concentrations of ABA. This interaction prevents the phosphorylation and activation of numerous transcription factors, ion channels, and other mediators of ABA responses. Alternating binding of PYR/PYL/RCAR to ABI1, 2 controls release and activity of the SnRKs and thereby the activation of a transcription factor cascade cooperating in the regulation of numerous ABA response genes. 164 The ABA-importing transporter 1 (AIT1), originally characterized as nitrate transporter (NRT1.2), is involved in cellular import of ABA in the vascular tissues of inflorescence stems, leaves, and roots. 7 In the genome of tomato, four co-orthologues to AIT1 were identified ( Supplementary Table 18). DTX50 is an ABC transporter of the detoxification efflux carriers/multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (DTX/MATE) family shown to function in efficient ABA export after drought stress. 161 DTX50 plays an important role in the removal of excess ABA levels to prevent hyperaccumulation of the hormone. 157 Again, four co-orthologues were detected in the genome of tomato ( Supplementary Table 18). Finally, two members of the ABCC subfamily in  A. thaliana, AtABCC1/MRT1 and AtABCC2/MRT2 (multidrug resistance–associated protein), have been shown to transport ABA-GE across the tonoplast into the vacuole. Both belong to the same CLOG in which 14 tomato genes were also clustered. The subunit H of the Mg 2+ chelatase complex (CCH) localized in plastids was proposed as an additional ABA receptor. 163 The tomato orthologue of CCH was found to be highly expressed in all tissues ( Fig. 6C;  Supplementary Table 18). Binding of ABA enhances the interaction of subunit H on the cytosolic side with a group of transcription factors from the WRKY family, thereby preventing their translocation to the nucleus. In the absence of ABA, the transcription factors act as negative regulators of ABA response genes. Low-expressed enzymes in tomato influence GA bio-synthetic pathway Oxidization and conversion of GAs into their epoxides by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases as well as formation of GA methyl esters by the activity of GA methyl transferases (GAMTs) are discussed as other mechanisms of GA deactivation. 66 However, these mechanisms appear to be species-specific as co-orthologues to the  A. thaliana GAMT were not identified by our approach in any of the selected species except for  V. vinifera ( Supplementary Table 6). GAs derive from the diterpene geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) synthesized in plastids from the isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl pyrophosphate, which is provided mainly by the plastid-resident MEP pathway, but also by the cytosolic MVA pathway ( Fig. 8A). 192 Our analysis showed that both pathways were conserved in mosses, monocots, and eudicots, but the MVA pathway was missing in the green algae  C. reinhardtii. 193, 194 Remarkably, the co-orthologues from the MEP and MVA pathway showed moderate or high expression in all tomato tissues, whereas the expression of co-orthologues catalyzing the subsequent steps of GA biosynthesis was low in tomato or even not present in some tissues ( Fig. 8A,  Supplementary Table 20). The chloroplast-localized  ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) and  ent-kaurene synthase (KS), which are involved in formation of  ent-kaurene, were detected in all plants except in the green algae ( Fig. 8A,  Supplementary Table 6). Interestingly, expression of tomato CPS and KS co-orthologues was detected if at all at low levels only ( Fig. 8A,  Supplementary Table 20). GA1 (CPS) and GA2 (KS) in  A. thaliana were discriminated on the basis of their domain architecture, which could be confirmed by our orthologue search due to the fact that they fall into two different CLOGs. Inspection of the domain architecture of co-orthologues within the two CLOGs indicated that orthologue search and functional domain architecture might differ, but it could also exemplify an interesting case of domain stealing. 100 For instance, some of the monocot co-orthologues in the CPS group contain a Prenyltrans_1 domain. This domain is absent in the CPS of  A. thaliana, but present in the KS orthologue ( Supplementary Table 13). Conversion of  ent-kaurene to GA 12 requires the transport of  ent-kaurene into the cytoplasm and several oxidation steps. The first step is catalyzed by the  ent-kaurene oxidase (KO), localized in the outer envelope of plastids, which is involved in the simultaneous transfer of  ent-kaurenoic acid to the ER. 195 Subsequent oxidization requires the ER-associated  ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO) for conversion to GA 12. However, the nature of the enzyme activity involved in the formation of GA 53 by hydroxylation on C-13 is still not clear. The subsequent hydroxylation on C-20 of GA 12 or GA 53 is catalyzed by cytoplasmic GA20 oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (GA20ox). The activity of other oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases like the GA3ox further leads to the production of bioactive GA compounds such as GA 1, GA 4, or GA 3. Deactivation of GAs by C-2 hydroxylation is catalyzed by GA2 oxidases (GA2ox). As in the case of KS, KAO1 and KAO2, co-orthologues of GA3ox and GA2ox were not found in  P. patens and  C. reinhardtii ( Supplementary Table 6), while their expression was low in most of the analyzed tissues ( Supplementary Table 20). Differences in the localization of biosynthesis enzymes from JA in tomato OPDA is transported from plastids to peroxisomes by the action of CTS, 175 and the expression of the tomato orthologue was at least low or moderate in all tissues ( Fig. 7A;  Supplementary Table 19). The OPDA reductase (OPR3) catalyzes the reduction of OPDA to 3-oxo-2-(2′(Z)-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC 176) and the orthologue in tomato showed high variance in expression from low to high levels in the tissues analyzed ( Fig. 7A). OPDA-CoA intermediate is formed in peroxisomes by 4-coumarate:CoA ligase like (4-CL-like) enzymes such as OPCL1, whose orthologue in tomato is globally expressed ( Fig. 7A). 177 The subsequent β-oxidation to synthesize JA occurs in three cycles 178 by the action of an acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX1), a multifunctional protein (MFP), and an L-3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase (KAT). 60 While two peroxisome targeted co-orthologues of ACX1 and six of MFP were identified in tomato, we could not predict a peroxisomal targeting signal in one of the two co-orthologues of KAT ( Fig. 7A;  Supplementary Table 12). Interestingly, MFP2 and AIM1 were located in one orthologous group in  A. thaliana while six co-orthologues were found in tomato of which the peroxisomal-located enzymes Solyc12g007170, Solyc12g099440, Solyc07g019670, and Solyc01g066620 were at least low expressed in all tissues except Solyc01g066620 ( Supplementary Table 19). Jasmonates are lipid-derived compounds synthesized from α-linolenic acid released from plastid membranes by one of the seven different branches of the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway. 165 Subsequently, β-oxidation occurs in peroxisomes and the final step of JA synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm. 166 Defective in anther dehiscense 1 (DAD1), phospholipase1 (PLA1), and phospholipase 2 (PLA2) are involved in α-linolenic acid production. 61 In  A. thaliana,  dad1 mutant results in a male sterile phenotype, 167 indicating that DAD1 is responsible for JA biosynthesis in flowers, while in leaves JA is synthesized by the DGL (Dongle) gene. 168, 169 Both enzyme CLOGs contained no co-orthologues from  C. reinhardtii and  P. patens; thus, it is likely that they evolved in the ancestor of monocots and eudicots ( Supplementary Table 5). We identified two co-orthologues for DGL and one orthologue for DAD1 in tomato, but none of them were expressed in the tissues and developmental stages of fruits analyzed ( Fig. 7A;  Supplementary Table 19). This suggests that another pathway for linolenic acid in tomato may exist or that the pathway is only activated under stress conditions. α-linolenic acid (18:3) acts as a fatty acid substrate for synthesis of 13( S)-hydroperoxylinolenic acid by LOXs. 170 Except in  C. reinhardtii, all plant species contained more than six co-orthologues, with a maximum of 43 co-orthologues in  G. max. In total, 18 co-orthologues were identified in tomato; however, a chloroplast targeting signal was only predicted for three of them (Solyc05g014790, Solyc03g122340, and Solyc01g006560), which most likely indicated their involvement in jasmonate synthesis ( Fig. 7A;  Supplementary Table 12). At least one of them was expressed in each tissue and Solyc01 g006560 was highly expressed in leaves. Allene oxide synthase (AOS; six co-orthologues in tomato) 171 catalyzes the dehydration of 13( S)-hydroperoxylinolenic acid to 12,13( S)-epoxylinolenic acid, which is converted to cis(+)-12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) likely by allene oxide cyclase (AOC). Interestingly, we detected only two co-orthologues of AOS containing a chloroplast targeting signal (Solyc04g079730 and Solyc11g069800) in tomato. At least one of them was expressed in all tissues, similar to the unique tomato AOC orthologue ( Fig. 7A). In  A. thaliana, transcription of AOC is induced within two hours after wounding and occurs in anthers and pollen grains, 172 while we observed moderate expression of the tomato orthologue in all tissues ( Supplementary Table 19173, 174). JA is subsequently secreted into the cytoplasm, where it can be further utilized either by  S-adenosyl- l-methionine:jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (JMT) to form the volatile JA methyl ester (methyl (+)-7-isojasmonate) or conjugated to isoleucine by the activity of JAR1, which converts JA into the biologically active jasmonyl-isoleucine. 4, 179, 180 JMT was only present in eudicots and represented by a single orthologue in tomato, which exhibited a low expression in root, stem, and leaf. In tomato, (+)-7-iso-JA-Ile is exclusively synthesized upon wounding, and in  SlJAR1-RNAi lines, JA-Ile is downregulated by 50%–75%, confirming the importance of JAR1 for the conversion of JA to JA-Ile. 181 Remarkably, we observed that the CLOG of JAR1 contained 13 tomato co-orthologues, and one of them (Solyc01g095580) was highly expressed in all tissues except of flowers and stems. Interestingly, the co-orthologue Solyc10g011660showed a high expression in flowers and stems, and by this, we could compensate Solyc01g095580 in both tissues ( Fig. 7A;  Supplementary Tables 5, 12, and 19). Thus, it needs to be experimentally proven whether Solyc01g095580 is the essential JAR1 orthologue in jasmonate signaling and whether rapid induction of the gene is caused by stress induction during the harvesting procedure.","Phytohormones control the development and growth of plants, as well as their response to biotic and abiotic stress. The seven most well-studied phytohormone classes defined today are as follows: auxins, ethylene, cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, gibberellins, and brassinosteroids. The basic principle of hormone regulation is conserved in all plants, but recent results suggest adaptations of synthesis, transport, or signaling pathways to the architecture and growth environment of different plant species. Thus, we aimed to define the extent to which information from the model plant  Arabidopsis thaliana  is transferable to other plants such as  Solanum lycopersicum.  We extracted the co-orthologues of genes coding for major pathway enzymes in  A. thaliana  from the translated genomes of 12 species from the clade Viridiplantae. Based on predicted domain architecture and localization of the identified proteins from all 13 species, we inspected the conservation of phytohormone pathways. The comparison was complemented by expression analysis of (co-) orthologous genes in  S. lycopersicum . Altogether, this information allowed the assignment of putative functional equivalents between  A. thaliana  and  S. lycopersicum  but also pointed to some variations between the pathways in eudicots, monocots, mosses, and green algae. These results provide first insights into the conservation of the various phytohormone pathways between the model system  A. thaliana  and crop plants such as tomato. We conclude that orthologue prediction in combination with analysis of functional domain architecture and intracellular localization and expression studies are sufficient tools to transfer information from model plants to other plant species. Our results support the notion that hormone synthesis, transport, and response for most part of the pathways are conserved, and species-specific variations can be found."," 'Transport', 'Signaling',

41,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC4364678/eupmc_result.json,PMC4364678,"Results CPT2 shows high affinity for IPP We showed previously that the preferred initial acceptor substrate of CPT2 is DMAPP   10 . Here we measured the  Km and  kcat values of CPT2 for the condensation of  zzFPP and IPP, the last step in the three-step reaction of synthesizing NNPP from DMAPP and 3 molecules of IPP. CPT2 showed optimal activity at pH 8.0–8.5, similar to what has been observed with other CPT enzymes ( S3 Fig.). The  Km value for IPP was determined to be 3.8 ± 0.3 μM and for  zzFPP 22.9 ± 1.1 μM, values that are lower than those of SlCPT1 (NDPS1) for its substrates ( Km value for IPP: 152 μM, DMAPP: 177 μM,   8 ) and ShCPT1 (zFPS,  Km for IPP: 16, 36 μM, DMAPP: 35, 210 μM,   9 ) ( Table 2). The measured  kcat value with CPT was similar with both IPP and  zzFPP substrates, at 2.6 x 10 −3 (s −1). Optimal transcript levels of  CPT2,  TPS21 and  CYP71BN1 are observed in leaf petiolules Because we previously looked at organ-specific expression of  CPT2,  TPS21 and  CYP71BN1 by measuring transcripts extracted from whole organs, it was possible that the overall low-level expression observed in these genes was masking high-level expression in small parts of a given organ or at different stages of development. We therefore examined transcript levels of these genes in sub-sections of the compound tomato leaf and in young vs. old organs of the plant ( Fig. 2A). There was some variation in the patterns of transcript levels among the three genes.  TPS21 transcripts were present in various parts in relatively similar levels, with the exception of fruits and roots, where the levels were quite low ( Fig. 2B).  CYP71BN1 transcript levels were highest in petiolules, the stem-like structure connecting the leaflet to the main petiole, and particularly in young petiolules, but also present in petioles, stems and flowers ( Fig. 2B). However,  CPT2 transcripts were present in young petiolules at levels that were at least 4-fold higher than in any other tissue examined ( Fig. 2B). The transcripts of all three genes were at their highest levels in young petiolules, compare with other tissues examined here. However, the relative transcript levels of the three genes were different. While the transcript levels of  CPT2 and  TPS21 were almost same, the transcript levels of  CYP71BN1 were approximately 10-fold higher than the levels of the other two genes ( Fig. 2B). We also investigated whether  CPT2,  TPS21 and  CYP71BN1 gene transcripts are present specifically in trichome. Relative levels of  CPT2,  TPS21 and  CYP71BN1 transcript in petiolules from which trichomes have been removed (see  M&M) were 1.5-, 1.3- and 1.7-fold, respectively, higher compare with their levels in whole petiolules (including trichomes), indicating that transcripts of these three genes are present mostly in non-trichome cells in this organ ( Fig. 3). Consistent with this conclusion, the relative transcript levels of the three genes in the trichomes of petiolules were respectively 22-, 21- and 40-fold lower compare with their levels in whole petiolules ( Fig. 3). CYP71BN1 is most similar to germacrene A oxidases Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductases belonging to the CYP71 clan are known to be involved in the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites such as isoprenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids and cyanogenic glucosides. Most mono-, sesqui- and diterpene-modifying P450s belong to this CYP71 clan   19 . Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that tomato CYP71BN1 was most similar to sesquiterpene oxidases, germacrene A oxidases (GAOs) from both Asteraecae and Barnadesioideae and amorpha-4, 11-diene oxidase (AMO) from Asteraecae ( Fig. 5). GAOs and AMO each catalyze three consecutive oxidations of sesquiterpenes, germacrene A to yield germacrene A acid, in the case of GAO, and amorpha-4,11-dine to yield amorpha-4, 11-dine acid in the case of AMO   20– 22 . Tomato CYP71BN1 catalyzes the two sequential oxidations of the diterpene, lycosantalene to yield lycosantalonol ( Fig. 1). Petiolules of  CPT2-overexpressing lines produce neryneryl diphosphate-derived diterpenes in non-trichomes cells Tomato trichomes have high levels of the monoterpene β-phellandrene and the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene, which are present at much lower levels in other aerial cells   10 . We analyzed hexane extracts of ground whole petiolules of transgenic plants overexpressing  CPT2 ground, hexane extracts of ground petiolules from which the terpenes in the trichomes had first been removed by dipping the sample in hexane, as well as terpenoid content of the hexane solution in which the petiolules were dipped in. We measured lycosantalene rather than lycosanatalonol since the former has a lower detection threshold. This analysis showed that petiolules without trichomes had higher ratios of lycosantalene to β-phellandrene and to β-caryophyllene than petiolules with trichomes ( Table 1), indicating that a higher proportion of lycosantalene than β-phellandrene and β-caryophyllene is present in the non-trichome petiolule tissue. The observation that the ratios of lycosantalene to β-phellandrene and to β-caryophyllene were lower in trichomes than in whole petiolules ( Table 1) is also consistent with this conclusion. Over-expressesing  CPT2 in petiolules results in detectable levels of lycosantalene and lycosantalonol Since the maximal levels of transcripts for all three genes  CPT2,  TPS21 and  CYP71BN1 occur in young petiolule, we searched for lycosantalonol or related compounds with the basic lycosantalene skeleton in this organ in wild-type plants. Petiolules were placed in a glass vial and ground with a glass stick. Volatiles were collected by SPME at 42°C for 15 min and analyzed by GC-MS. For non-volatile terpenoids analysis, compounds were extracted from the ground petiolules with hexane as a solvent and the extracts were analyzed by GC-MS. To investigate the accumulation of diterpenoid glucosides or diterpenoids that were modified by acylation, compounds were extracted from the ground petiolules with 80% methanol, and treated with either acid or base (final concentration 0.5 N HCl or 0.5 N NaOH, respectively), or dried first, then resuspended in buffer and incubated with almond recombinant β-glucosidase. After these treatments, compounds were extracted with hexane and analyzed by GC-MS. No peaks with the retention times of lycosantalene, epoxy-lycosantalene, or lycosantalonol were detected in the chromatograms of samples obtained by any of the methods described above (one such result is shown in  Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we did not detect any other peaks in which at least two of the ions of  m/z 69, 81, 93, 95, 107, 109 and 121, which are prominent in the MS of lycosantalene and/or its derivatives, constituted a significant part of their mass spectra. Since it was possible that such compounds were produced in the wild-type petiolules at such low levels as to be below the detection threshold of our methods, and that increasing the rate of synthesis of NNPP would lead to higher levels of synthesis of lycosantalene and its derivatives, we constructed transgenic tomato plants containing the  CPT2 gene under the control of the strong, non-specific 35S promoter.  CPT2 expression level of individual transgenic plants was determined by RT-PCR ( S1 Fig.). SPME analysis of transgenic leaflets of plants over-expressing  CPT2 detected lycosantalene in eight of the 13 individual transgenic plants tested. Three individual plants which had the highest lycosantalene levels were selected for further analyses. Petiolules were collected from these three individual transgenic tomato lines and diterpenoids were extracted with hexane and analyzed by GC-MS. Nerylnerol, lycosantalene and lycosantalonol were all detected in all three individual plants ( Fig. 4B-D and  S2 Fig.). To investigate the accumulation of diterpenoid glucosides or diterpenoids that were modified by acylation, compounds were extracted from ground petiolules and analyzed in the same way as described above for wild-type petiolules. However, no additional lycosantalene derivatives were found in the transgenic petiolules in any of these three lines. No differences in metabolic compounds are observed between both  CPT2 over-expressing and RNAi lines and wild-type plants The volatile and non-volatile hydrophobic compound analyses of petiolules from three individual transgenic plants in which  CPT2 transcript levels were reduced by 80% were performed by GC-MS, and no differences were observed compared with wild-type petiolules. Next, a detailed hydrophilic metabolic compounds analysis was performed by HPLC-MS. The hydrophilic compounds were extracted with 80% methanol from ground petiolules from each of five individual transgenic plants as well as from control wild-type plants. All 2,370 peaks observed on chromatograms of the five individual  CPT2 over-expression lines (#03, 07, 19, 24, and 26) and/or the five  CPT2 RNAi lines (#01, 04, 05, 12, and 18) were compared to the peaks of the wild-type plants by a global comparison software (MarkerLynx XS, MassLynx, Waters). However, no significant increases or decreases in levels of the peaks among these three groups were observed. No obvious morphological phenotypes are observed in  35S-CPT2 or  35S-CPT2-RNAi tomato lines Although we were able to detect lycosantalene and lycosantalonol in transgenic tomato plants overexpressing  CPT2 under the control of the 35S promoter, the gross morphology of the plants was similar to that of wild-type plants. We also examined the transgenic tomato plants expressing a  35S-CPT2 RNAi construct in which  CPT2 gene expression was reduced by up to 80% ( S4 Fig.), and these plants grew normally and showed no morphological differences from wild-type tomato plants at all developmental stages.","We recently reported that three genes involved in the biosynthesis of monoterpenes in trichomes, a cis-prenyltransferase named neryl diphosphate synthase 1 (NDPS1) and two terpene synthases (TPS19 and TPS20), are present in close proximity to each other at the tip of chromosome 8 in the genome of the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). This terpene gene ""cluster"" also contains a second cis-prenyltransferase gene (CPT2), three other TPS genes, including TPS21, and the cytochrome P450-oxidoreductase gene CYP71BN1. CPT2 encodes a neryneryl diphosphate synthase. Co-expression in E. coli of CPT2 and TPS21 led to the formation of the diterpene lycosantalene, and co-expression in E. coli of CPT2, TPS21 and CYP71BN1 led to the formation of lycosantalonol, an oxidation product of lycosantalene. Here we show that maximal expression of all three genes occurs in the petiolule part of the leaf, but little expression of these genes occurs in the trichomes present on the petiolules. While lycosantalene or lycosantalonol cannot be detected in the petiolules of wild-type plants (or anywhere else in the plant), lycosantalene and lycosantalonol are detected in petiolules of transgenic tomato plants expressing CPT2 under the control of the 35S CaMV promoter. These results suggest that lycosantalene and lycosantalonol are produced in the petiolules and perhaps in other tissues of wild-type plants, but that low rate of synthesis, controlled by the rate-limiting enzyme CPT2, results in product levels that are too low for detection under our current methodology. It is also possible that these compounds are further modified in the plant. The involvement of CPT2, TPS21 and CYP71BN1 in a diterpenoid biosynthetic pathway outside the trichomes, together with the involvement of other genes in the cluster in the synthesis of monoterpenes in trichomes, indicates that this cluster is further evolving into ""sub-clusters"" with unique biochemical, and likely physiological, roles.",NaN," 'petiolules', 'levels', 'transcript levels', 'Fig.', 'IPP', 'plants', 'lycosantalene', 'transcript', 'DMAPP', 'ground petiolules' "," CPT2, CPT2, CPT2, CPT2, 8.0–8.5, μM, ±, μM, SlCPT1 (, DMAPP, μM, ShCPT1, zFPS, DMAPP, μM, −1, CYP71BN1, CYP71, diterpene-modifying P450s, CYP71, Asteraecae, 11-diene oxidase, GAO, amorpha-4,11-dine, lycosantalonol, neryneryl diphosphate-derived, non-trichomes cells, lycosanatalonol, β-phellandrene, β-caryophyllene, β-phellandrene, β-caryophyllene, lycosantalonol, lycosantalonol, Petiolules, °C, almond recombinant β-glucosidase, lycosantalonol, Petiolules, Nerylnerol, lycosantalonol, lycosantalonol "," 'TPS21', 'TPS21', 'TPS21', 'TPS21', 'TPS21', 'TPS21', 'TPS21' "," 'GC-MS.', 'GC-MS.', 'GC-MS.', 'GC-MS.', 'HPLC-MS.'

DEGs Involved in Terpenoids and Menthol Biosynthesis RT-PCR was used to verify the expression levels of menthol biosynthetic genes ( Figure 8). The results indicate that the qRT-PCR expression patterns of 9 genes matched quite well with the RNA-Seq data. From the transcriptome analysis, 14 DEGs involved in the monoterpenoids biosynthetic pathway were identified. These were terpene synthases (TPSs), (−)-isopiperitenone reductases (IPR), menthol dehydrogenases (MR), cytochrome P450 (P450), neomenthol dehydrogenases (NMRs) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). The two TPSs were alpha-pinene/camphene synthase and linalool synthase. We identified 15 DEGs involved in sesquiterpenoids and triterpenoids. Excepted for the Unigene0029907 identified as (3S)-linalool synthase, the other 14 TPSs were dramatically downregulated in the dark but were then upregulated to the same expression level after regaining access to light for 24 h ( Figure 6). In mint, menthol was the most prevalent chemical compound among the monoterpenoids. In our study, orthologous genes encoding enzymes that catalyzed the biosynthesis of (−)-menthol were identified by multiple sequence alignment, using the reference genes of peppermint and spearmint. The nucleotides of these genes were cloned and sequenced in  M.canadensis ( Supplementary data). The expression profiles of six identified genes, including limonene synthase (LS), (−)-limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH), isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (iPR), isopiperitenone reductase (iPD), pulegone reductase (PR), and neomenthol dehydrogenase (MNR), showed the same patterns: they were significantly downregulated under 24 h of darkness and upregulated after returning to the light for 24 h ( Figure 7). Only the MFS gene showed the opposite expression pattern, which was upregulation under darkness and downregulation after removing the covers. Although the GPPS-l, GPPS-s, and MR genes’ expression levels were not dramatically altered by light exposure, they were all downregulated as a result of darkness ( Figure 7). 2.5. Expression of Genes Involved in the Light Signal Transduction Pathway The gene families of photoreceptors, such as phytochromes, cryptochromes, phototropins, and UVR8, were identified within the DEGs. The expression levels of PHYB (Unigene0004374) and PHOT2 (unigene0003571) were dramatically reduced in darkness and increased slightly when they re-entered light. The CRY gene (Unigene0004413) showed the opposite expression pattern: upregulated under darkness and downregulated after removing the covers. Other photoreceptors’ transcription expressions were changed similarly to those of the PHOTs, and these changes were not significant. COP1, a ring-finger type ubiquitin E3 ligase, functions as a repressor of photomorphogenesis, and was significantly downregulated in darkness and upregulated when returning to light. HY5 and PIFs are the downstream components of photoreceptor-mediated light signaling. Both of the two HY5 potential homologs, and three potential homologs, were identified. HY5 was significantly downregulated under darkness and upregulated after removing the covers. PIFs are the key regulators in shade-avoidance responses. The transcript levels of PIF1 and PIF4 were dramatically upregulated following the 24 h darkness treatment, while PIF3 was not differentially expressed after the treatment ( Figure 9). 2.3. Different Gene Expression Analysis The expression profiles of  Menthacanadensis grown in darkness and light for 24 h each were analyzed separately and were selected based on two criteria: FDR < 0.05 and|log2FC| > 1. Compared to the samples under the control conditions, a total of 10,977 DEGs, including 6296 upregulated and 4681 downregulated genes, were differentially expressed after the 24 h darkness treatment. In total, we counted 8645 DEGs, including 3745 upregulated and 4900 downregulated genes compared to under darkness, after 24 h of light exposure ( Figure 3). All DEGs were subjected to GO, KOG analysis, and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Based on the GO enrichment, “metabolic process” and “cellular process”, as well as “single-organism process”, were the three most highly represented terms in the “biological process” category. In the “cellular component” category, “cell”, “cell part” and “organelle” were the most enriched terms. In the “molecular function” category, most DEGs were enriched in the “catalytic activity”, “binding”, and “transporter activity” subcategories. The enrichment analysis showed that 1919 genes were annotated in 133 KEGG pathways. Among them, 108 genes were involved in the “metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides” pathway ( Figure 4). The expression profiles of all the DEGs adhered to two response patterns ( Figure 5A,B). Seven significant expression clusters were observed in all the DEGs under darkness treatment followed by recovery light. The DEGs in cluster 5 were upregulated under darkness and downregulated after recovery (4736 genes), and those in cluster 2 were downregulated under darkness and upregulated under light exposure (3399 genes) ( Figure 5C). 2.7. Validation of Expression Patterns of Genes To verify the reliability of the RNA-Seq data, the expression profiles of eight genes were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). These genes are listed in  Supplemental Table S3. The expression patterns of the selected genes, in terms of the RPKM results, were consistent between the qRT-PCR and RNA-seq ( Figure 10). The following validation results for qRT-PCR indicate that the RNA-Seq data are quite reliable. 2.2. Illumina HiSeq mRNA Sequencing Functional annotation of the 95,579 unigenes was carried out using five public protein databases. In total, 54,084 (56.58%) unigenes had a match in the Nr database, 32,399 (33.89%) in the swissprot protein database, 26,218 (27.43%) in the KOG database, and 46,665 (23.82%) in the KEGG database ( Supplementary Table S2). For GO annotation, 64,497 unigenes (67.48%) were classified into 53 categories, in three parts: biological process (23,331), cellular component (21,172) and molecular function (19,994). In the “biological processes” category, the transcripts were enriched with the terms “metabolic” (18,732 unigenes), “cellular” (18,680 unigenes) and “single-organism” (15,645 unigenes). In the “cellular component” category, the assignments were mostly enriched with the terms “cell” (17,137), “cell part” (17,064) and “organelle” (14,479). In the “molecular function” category, “catalytic activity” (15,129), “binding” (12,910) and “transporter activity” were the most significantly enriched terms ( Supplementary Figure S1). To investigate the underlying role of light in menthol synthesis and identify genes with significantly different expression levels under dark conditions, we explored the transcription profiles of mint leaves in the dark for 24 h and light for 24 h, using RNA-seq. The transcriptome sequencing was performed via an Illumina HiSeqTM 4000, which generated 72 million high-quality clean reads. Finally, a total of 95,579 all-unigenes with an N50 of 1260 bp were de novo assembled from the combined unigenes of three samples. The average length of the unigenes was 754bp ( Supplementary Table S1). Raw sequencing reads were reported in the SRA database Available online:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA724910 (accessed on 28 April 2021) For the functional prediction, 26,219 unigenes were classified into 25 KOG categories. Among these, “General functional prediction only” (6420) was the largest group, followed by “Signal transduction mechanisms” (4527) and “Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones”, (2872) ( Supplement Figure S2). Furthermore, 9690 unigenes were annotated in 138 KEGG pathways. “Metabolic pathways” (4150) was the most represented pathway ( Supplement Figure S3). 2.1. Low Light’s Effects on the Densities of Peltate Glandular Trichomes and Chemical Properties of Essential Oil Composition of Mint Leaves We assessed the peltate glandular trichome densities on five separate zones, from the basal to the top regions, of the abaxial leaf surface of  Mentha canadensis under different light conditions. The results showed that the peltate glandular trichome (PGTs) densities were reduced by half a percent in all five zones under the low light condition ( Figure 1C). Basal zone 1 had a maximum of 27.75 ± 0.95 glands number per mm 2, which decreased to 16.63 ± 2.67 glands per mm 2 under the low light condition ( Figure 1A,B). The top zone (zone 5) had a minimum PGT density of 11.5 ± 2.23 glands per mm 2, which was significantly reduced to 4.87 ± 0.83 per mm 2 under the low light condition ( Figure 1A,B). An abundance of wrinkled PGTs were observed under low light conditions using scanning electron microscopy, indicating low essential oil accumulation in the subcuticular cavities of peltate glandular trichomes ( Figure 1D). The organic compounds volatilized from mint leaves were collected via headspace sorption and analyzed via GC-MS. Fifteen volatile compounds were identified, accounting for 99.87% and 97.13% of the total volatile exudates in mint leaves under control and low light conditions, respectively. The changes in total volatile compounds and monoterpene compositions were investigated. The relative contents of volatile compounds were dramatically reduced compared to the internal standard substance, which was bornanone. The level of the main oxygenated monoterpene, menthol (constituting 32.02% of total volatile compounds), decreased to 12.85% following low light treatment. The proportion of pulegone increased from 0.95 to 8.70%, and that of piperitone increased from 1.23 to 28.31% ( Figure 2). The low light condition caused the accumulation of pulegone and piperitone, which are intermediate compounds in mint leaves, but had no reductive effect on the proportions of total monoterpene hydrocarbons or oxygenated monoterpenes ( Table 1). 2.6. Light-Mediated Regulation of Transcription Factors Transcription factors play important roles in the response to light, and they regulate multiple genes. Using the PlantTFDB database, 1601 TFs belonging to 57 families were identified. After analyzing the differential expression profiles, totals of 380 and 298 DEGs divided into 44 TF families were differentially expressed. The bHLH, ERF, MYB, and MYB-related, C2H2, bZIP, WRKY, NAC, HD-ZIP, and GRAS families were the top 10 most prevalent TF families. Among them, 235 TFs were upregulated and 145 TFs were downregulated following the 24 h darkness treatment. After removing the covers for 24 h, 166 TFs were upregulated and 132 TFs were downregulated. There were 67 TFs showing similar expression patterns to the terpenoids synthesis pathway genes. The expression levels of these genes were downregulated by darkness and upregulated after returning to light. The MYB family was the largest group, followed by the bHLH family. The opposite expression pattern (upregulated in darkness and downregulated in light) was displayed in 137 TFs. Among them, the ERF family was the largest group ( Supplement Figure S4). Several transcription factors belonging to the bHLH, ERF, MYB, and WRKY families have been determined to control terpenoid biosynthesis. We identified the homologs of the TFs whose functions are known, and which regulate terpenoid biosynthesis, by BLAST searching our transcriptomic data, and identified two MYC1, one MYC2, one WIN1, one ERF1, one WRKY40 and one R2R3-MYB genes. Apart from ERF1, which was significantly upregulated by the darkness treatment, all the genes were downregulated. Interestingly, not all the downregulated genes were upregulated after 24 h light exposure. The transcription levels of the four TFs belonging to the bHLH family and one WIN1 gene were not changed after returning to light for 24 h. The transcription levels of one WIN1, one WRKY40 and one R2R3-MYB were differentially expressed: the WRKY40 was upregulated back to its previous level before the darkness treatment, while the WIN1 and R2R3 MYB remained lower than their initial levels ( Figure 9).","Light is a key environmental aspect that regulates secondary metabolic synthesis. The essential oil produced in mint ( Mentha canadensis  L.) leaves is used widely in the aromatics industry and in medicine. Under low-light treatment, significant reductions in peltate glandular trichome densities were observed. GC-MS analysis showed dramatically reduced essential oil and menthol contents. Light affected the peltate glandular trichomes' development and essential oil yield production. However, the underlying mechanisms of this regulation were elusive. To identify the critical genes during light-regulated changes in oil content, following a 24 h darkness treatment and a 24 h recovery light treatment, leaves were collected for transcriptome analysis. A total of 95,579 unigenes were obtained, with an average length of 754 bp. About 56.58% of the unigenes were annotated using four public protein databases: 10,977 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be involved in the light signaling pathway and monoterpene synthesis pathway. Most of the TPs showed a similar expression pattern: downregulation after darkness treatment and upregulation after the return of light. In addition, the genes involved in the light signal transduction pathway were analyzed. A series of responsive transcription factors (TFs) were identified and could be used in metabolic engineering as an effective strategy for increasing essential oil yields."," 'GC-MS', 'Transcriptome Sequencing', 'Mentha Canadensis L.', 'Menthol Biosynthesis' "," 'Figure', 'light', 'genes', 'expression', 'darkness', 'Low Light', 'upregulated', 'downregulated', 'expression levels', 'Supplement Figure' "," 9, (−)-isopiperitenone reductases, menthol dehydrogenases, cytochrome P450, alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH, TPSs, Unigene0029907, (3S)-linalool synthase, (−)-menthol, (−)-limonene-3-hydroxylase (, L3OH, isopiperitenol dehydrogenase, pulegone reductase, neomenthol dehydrogenase, GPPS-l, GPPS-s, ’, phytochromes, cryptochromes, phototropins, UVR8, PHYB, Unigene0004374, PHOT2, unigene0003571, CRY, Unigene0004413, PHOTs, COP1, ubiquitin E3, photoreceptor-mediated, PIF1, PIF4, PIF3, and|log2FC| > 1, KOG, “, ”, ”, “, ”, “, ”, ”, “cell, ”, “organelle”, “, ”, “, ”, “binding, ”, “transporter, ”, “, ”, RNA-seq, 95,579, 26,218, “, ”, “, ”, “single-organism, ”, ”, “organelle”, “, ”, “, ”, “binding, ”, “transporter, ”, RNA-seq, 754bp, PRJNA724910, 26,219, “, ”, “Signal, ”, “Posttranslational, chaperones”, “, ”, PGTs, PGT, ±, ±, MYB, bZIP, WRKY, HD-ZIP, MYB, MYB, WRKY, MYC1, MYC2, ERF1, WRKY40, R2R3-MYB, ERF1, WIN1, WRKY40, WRKY40, WIN1, R2R3 MYB "," '(TPSs),', 'TPSs', 'TPSs' ", 'GC-MS.' ,  ,terpene synthase
43,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC4032488/eupmc_result.json,PMC4032488,"Results VEG secretions increase transcript levels of defense-related genes in tomato We used quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the transcript levels of six defense-related genes including genes encoding lipoxygenase ( LOX), allene oxide synthase ( AOS), and four genes involved in terpene biosynthesis (terpene synthase genes).  LOX and  AOS are key enzymes in the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis pathway. Most of defense-related genes were found up-regulated in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars and in MI + OSVEGI plants compared to plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars, mechanically injured (MI), MI + OSVEGA, or untreated (control) plants (Table  3). In particular, the transcript levels of the terpene synthase genes,  TPS5 (encodes monoterpene synthesis)   37 , and  TPS12 (catalyzes formation of the sesquiterpenes ( E)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene)   38 , were significantly higher in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars and MI + OSVEGI plants compared to the other treatments. VEG secretions activate defense-related enzymes in tomato The selected defense-related enzymes, peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and lipoxygenase (LOX), were expressed in significantly higher amounts in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars and MI + OSVEGI than in plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars, mechanically injured (MI) plants, MI + OSVEGA plants, and untreated (control) plants. Activity of POD was significantly higher in VEGI-damaged and MI + OSVEGI tomato plants than in VEGA-damaged, MI, MI + OSVEGA or undamaged plants, starting as early as 24 h after treatment (Figure  1A). Activity of PPO 48 h after treatment was 8.2, 9.1, 8.8 and 8.5% higher in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars than in plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars, MI, MI + OSVEGA, or undamaged plants, respectively (Figure  1B). A significant increase in LOX-specific activity levels was detected as early as 24 h after treatment in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars and MD + OSVEGI plants compared to the other treatments. Activity of LOX 72 h after treatment was 14.2, 17, 14.6 and 21.6%, higher in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars than in plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars, MI, MI + OSVEGA, or undamaged plants, respectively (Figure  1C). In general, no significant differences were recorded in enzymatic activity between plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars and MI + OSVEGI plants (Figure  1 and Table  1). VEG ablation didn’t affect  S. exigua feeding activity Before we started to assess the impact of VEG secretions on triggering plant defense, we evaluated whether VEG ablation affects feeding activity of  S. exigua caterpillars. There were no significant differences between VEGA (2.42 ± 0.44 cm 2) and VEGI (2.61 ± 1.04 cm 2) caterpillars on leaf area consumption after 24 h (P > 0.84). VEG secretions induce VOCs emission in tomato Key differences were recorded in the headspace VOC profiles of tomato plants from the different treatments (Figure  2). Increased emission of VOCs was detected in the headspace of plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars compared to plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars, mechanically injured (MI) plants, and untreated (control) plants. Specifically, green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and certain monoterpenes were emitted in higher amounts by plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars than in the other treatments (Figure  2, Table  2). In particular, the GLVs, ( E)-2-hexenal, ( Z)-3-hexenal, ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and ( Z)-2-hexenol were emitted in 7-fold, 5-fold, 7-fold and 10-fold, respectively, in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars compared to plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars (Figure  2 and Table  2). The monoterpenes, β-linalool and γ-terpinene, were emitted in significantly higher amounts by plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars compared to plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars and the other treatments (Figure  2, Table  2). However, no significant differences were recorded among the treatments in the emission of α-pinene, β-phellendrene, β-pinene and β-ocimene. The sesquiterpenes, ( E)-β-caryophyllene, α-humulene and β-elemene, were also emitted in significantly higher amounts by plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars compared to the other treatments. Furthermore, emission of the fatty acids (3-octanol, nonanal) and organic ester (methyl salicylate), was higher in VEGI-damaged plants (Figure  2 and Table  2)."," Background Plant induced defense against herbivory are generally associated with metabolic costs that result in the allocation of photosynthates from growth and reproduction to the synthesis of defense compounds. Therefore, it is essential that plants are capable of sensing and differentiating mechanical injury from herbivore injury. Studies have shown that oral secretions (OS) from caterpillars contain elicitors of induced plant responses. However, studies that shows whether these elicitors originated from salivary glands or from other organs associated with feeding, such as the ventral eversible gland (VEG) are limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the secretions from the VEG gland of Spodoptera exigua caterpillars contain elicitors that induce plant defenses by regulating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other defense-related genes. To test this hypothesis, we quantified and compared the activity of defense-related enzymes, transcript levels of defense-related genes and VOC emission in tomato plants damaged by S. exigua caterpillars with the VEG intact (VEGI) versus plants damaged by caterpillars with the VEG ablated (VEGA). Results The quantified defense-related enzymes (i.e. peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and lipoxigenase) were expressed in significantly higher amounts in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars than in plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars. Similarly, the genes that encode for the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and terpene synthase genes that regulate production of terpene VOCs, were up-regulated in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars. Moreover, the OS of VEGA caterpillars were less active in inducing the expression of defense genes in tomato plants. Increased emissions of VOCs were detected in the headspace of plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars compared to plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars. Conclusion These results suggest that the VEG of S. exigua caterpillars contains elicitors of late plant defense signaling in tomato which trigger defense-related enzymatic activity, regulate expression of defense-related genes, and induce emission of plant VOCs. These signaling cascades may have important ramifications for plant-insect and tritrophic interactions.",NaN," 'VEGI caterpillars', 'plants damaged', 'plants', 'VEGI', 'damaged', 'caterpillars', 'OSVEGI plants', 'Figure', 'VEGA', 'OSVEGI' "," lipoxygenase, LOX, VEGI, OSVEGI, VEGA, VEGI, OSVEGI, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, PPO, lipoxygenase (, LOX, VEGI, OSVEGI, VEGA, POD, PPO 48, VEGI, VEGA, LOX-specific, VEGI, LOX 72, VEGI, VEGA, VEGI, n’t, VEGA, VEGI (2.61 ± , VEGI, VEGA, VEGI, GLVs, E)-2-hexenal, Z)-2-hexenol, VEGI, VEGA, β-linalool, γ-terpinene, VEGI, VEGA, α-pinene, β-pinene, β-elemene, VEGI "," 'TPS5', 'TPS12' "," 'S.', 'S.'

44,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC8313976/eupmc_result.json,PMC8313976,"Results Endophytic fungi isolated from old-growth black poplar trees We identified 12 endophyte species from nine different genera by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron. Two species were identified from the genus  Alternaria, three from  Didymella, two from  Aureobasidium, and one each from  Arthrinium,  Cladosporium,  Fusarium,  Sordaria, and  Stemphylium ( Table 1). One unidentified species was also included in the volatile analysis. All the identified fungi belong to the Ascomycota, the largest fungal phylum. Two terpene synthases from  Cladosporium sp. are not closely related to each other To investigate the phylogenetic relationships of CxTPS1 and CxTPS2 from  Cladosporium sp. to other known terpene synthases from plant-associated Ascomycota that exhibit a pathogenic, endophytic or saprophytic lifestyle, we performed multiple sequence alignments and a subsequent dendrogram analysis. According to the tree shown in  Figure 3, CxTPS2 and CxTPS1 are not closely related to each other. While CxTPS2 forms a clade with sesquiterpene synthases of four pathogenic fungi and one endophyte, CxTPS1 is loosely related to a gene of the pathogenic fungus  Botrytis cinerea. Further, CxTPS2, which produces ( E)-β-caryophyllene ( 1), is more closely related to other sesquiterpene synthases from pathogens than to the caryophyllene synthases from the two endophytes  Hypoxylon sp. CI4A and  Hypoxylon sp. CO27. Endophytic fungi emit typical plant VOCs Altogether, we detected 77 volatile compounds in the headspaces of the 13 different endophytic species grown on agar medium. With 34 different compounds, the unidentified fungus was the endophyte emitting the most complex volatile blend. In contrast, in the headspace of both  Stemphylium sp. and  Cladosporium sp., only two volatile compounds were detected ( Table 2). All endophytic fungi, except  Cladosporium sp., produced aliphatic or aromatic alcohols like 2-methyl-1-propanol ( 7), 3-methyl-1-butanol ( 6) or 2-phenylethanol ( 3). Of 77 detected volatile compounds, 50 compounds are sesquiterpenes. Furthermore, seven out of 13 fungi produced sesquiterpenes. In general, the analyzed endophytic fungi have a species-specific volatile bouquet, and none of the endophytic species shared the same combination of volatile compounds. We had previously detected a number of these fungal volatiles in our volatile analyses of poplar leaves, including two alcohols 3-methyl-1-butanol ( 6) and 2-phenylethanol ( 3) and the two sesquiterpenes ( E)-β-caryophyllene ( 1) and α-muurolene ( 8) ( Table 2,  Figure 1)   7, 9, 57– 59 . Cladosporium sp. contains two sesquiterpene synthases that produce typical poplar volatile compounds in in vitro assays Both protein extracts containing the respective enzymes accepted the substrate GPP and produced monoterpenes ( Figure 2). CxTPS1 produced myrcene ( 9) and ( E)-β-ocimene ( 10) in similar amounts. CxTPS2 produced ( E)-β-ocimene ( 10) as the major product and minor amounts of myrcene ( 9), ( Z)-β-ocimene ( 11), and linalool ( 5) ( Figure 2). Only one sesquiterpene product was formed by each TPS: CxTPS1 produced ( E, E)-α-farnesene ( 12) and CxTPS2 produced ( E)-β-caryophyllene ( 1). With GGPP, no enzyme activity was recorded for CxTPS2, while CxTPS1 converted this substrate to ( E,E)-β-springene ( 13) as the minor compound and major amounts of ( E,E,E)-α-springene ( 14) ( Figure 2). The poplar fungal endophyte  Cladosporium sp. emitted ( E)-β-caryophyllene ( 1) in culture ( Table 2,  Figure 1). As this sesquiterpene is also a characteristic VOC in the constitutive and herbivore-induced blends of black poplar   57– 59 , we wanted to identify and characterize the responsible fungal terpene synthase, as this enzyme could contribute to the overall ( E)-β-caryophyllene emission from the tree. To identify terpene synthase genes potentially involved in volatile terpene formation in  Cladosporium, we sequenced the transcriptome and performed a de novo assembly of the obtained reads. A TBLASTN analysis with  Aspergillus terreus aristolochene synthase (pdb 20A6) as query and the de novo assembly as template revealed two genes with high similarity to other fungal  TPS genes. The genes were designated  CxTPS1 and  CxTPS2. For functional characterization, the complete open reading frames of  CxTPS1 and  CxTPS2 were amplified from cDNA, cloned, and heterologously expressed in  Escherichia coli. To determine mono-, sesqui-, and diterpene-forming activity, the bacterial raw protein extracts were assayed with the substrates GPP, FPP, and GGPP, each in the presence of the co-substrate magnesium chloride.","Plant volatiles play a major role in plant-insect interactions as defense compounds or attractants for insect herbivores. Recent studies have shown that endophytic fungi are also able to produce volatiles and this raises the question of whether these fungal volatiles influence plant-insect interactions. Here, we qualitatively investigated the volatiles released from 13 endophytic fungal species isolated from leaves of mature black poplar ( Populus nigra ) trees. The volatile blends of these endophytes grown on agar medium consist of typical fungal compounds, including aliphatic alcohols, ketones and esters, the aromatic alcohol 2-phenylethanol and various sesquiterpenes. Some of the compounds were previously reported as constituents of the poplar volatile blend .  For one endophyte, a species of  Cladosporium , we isolated and characterized two sesquiterpene synthases that can produce a number of mono- and sesquiterpenes like ( E )-β-ocimene and ( E )-β-caryophyllene, compounds that are dominant components of the herbivore-induced volatile bouquet of black poplar trees. As several of the fungus-derived volatiles like 2-phenylethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and the sesquiterpene ( E )-β-caryophyllene, are known to play a role in direct and indirect plant defense, the emission of volatiles from endophytic microbial species should be considered in future studies investigating tree-insect interactions."," 'Cladosporium', 'Ascomycota', 'Salicaceae', 'Volatile Organic Compound (Voc)', 'Terpene Synthases' "," 'RNA cistron', 'ribosomal RNA', 'Cladosporium', 'volatile compounds', 'volatile', 'Figure', 'Endophytic fungi', 'Endophytic', 'compounds', 'fungi' "," CxTPS1, CxTPS2, CxTPS2, CxTPS1, CxTPS2, CxTPS1, CxTPS2, CI4A, CO27, 9, 57– 59, CxTPS1, CxTPS2, CxTPS1, E)-α-farnesene ( 12), CxTPS2, GGPP, CxTPS2, CxTPS1, E)-β-springene ( 13), E, E)-α-springene ( 14), 20A6, GGPP "," 'CxTPS1', 'CxTPS2', 'CxTPS2', 'CxTPS1', 'CxTPS2', 'CxTPS1', 'CxTPS2,', 'CxTPS1', 'CxTPS2', 'TPS:', 'CxTPS1', 'CxTPS2', 'CxTPS2,', 'CxTPS1', 'TPS', 'CxTPS1', 'CxTPS2.', 'CxTPS1', 'CxTPS2' ",  ,  ,terpene synthase
45,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC8369990/eupmc_result.json,PMC8369990,"Results HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 Localize to the Nucleus and Exhibit Transactivation Activity Most MYB TFs specifically localize to the nucleus ( Zou et al., 2008;  Zhu et al., 2015;  Zhou et al., 2017). However, some MYB TFs localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm ( Li et al., 2006a). The nuclear localization prediction server WoLF PSORT 1 predicted that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 localize to the nucleus. To assess this prediction, we generated HcMYB1-GFP and HcMYB2-GFP constructs in which these genes were driven by the CaMV  35S promoter and used them to transform  Arabidopsis protoplasts. In HcMYB1-GFP- and HcMYB2-GFP-transformed protoplasts, observed green fluorescent protein (GFP) signals specifically in the nuclei, whereas control (GFP) protoplasts showed a ubiquitous distribution of GFP throughout the protoplasts ( Figure 5A). We included nuclear localization signal (NLS)-mCherry in each transformation as a marker for nuclear localization. These results demonstrate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 are nucleus-localized proteins, which is in keeping with their expected roles as transcription factors. Transcription factors regulate their target genes via transactivation activity. To investigate the transactivation activities of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2, we performed transient expression analysis in  Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We fused five copies of the GAL4 DNA-binding element (GAL4BD) and the minimal TATA region (5′-TATAAA-3′) of the  35S promoter to the firefly luciferase ( LUC) reporter; the Renilla luciferase ( REN) reporter gene driven by the  35S promoter as the reporter vector. The LUC/REN ratio from the reporter vector was used as an internal control. We constructed effector plasmids harboring the ORFs of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 ( Figure 5B). Unlike the GAL4BD negative control (empty vector, pBD), HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 activated the  LUC reporter gene. The LUC/REN ratios of HcMYB1, HcMYB2, and GAL4BD-VP16 were 3. 1-, 3. 7-, and 11.1-fold higher, respectively, compared to the negative control ( Figure 5C). These results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 function as transcriptional activators. Identification and Characterization of Scent-Related R2R3-MYB Family Members In a previous transcriptomic analysis, we identified a clade of genes whose expression rose throughout flower development and with increasing floral scent emissions ( Yue et al., 2015). Among these genes,  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 are specifically expressed in flowers. The full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 contain open reading frames (ORFs) of 618 and 693 bp, encoding polypeptides of 205 and 230 amino acid residues with molecular masses of 23.26 and 24.68 kDa, respectively. Analysis of the predicted protein sequences of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 revealed the presence of 2R and 3R repeat signatures at the N-termini: these features of R2R3 DNA-binding MYB proteins ( Figure 1A) are essential for their interactions with regulatory sequences in the promoters of their target genes ( Kranz et al., 1998;  Dubos et al., 2010;  Medina-Puche et al., 2014). We performed a phylogenetic analysis of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 compared to R2R3-MYBs involved in secondary metabolism in other plant species. HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 clustered into different groups ( Figure 1B). HcMYB1 belongs to Group III and shares high amino acid homology with AtMYB77 and AtMYB44 ( Aharoni et al., 2001;  Shin et al., 2007;  Jaradat et al., 2013). In contrast, HcMYB2 belongs to Group I, whose members include AmMYB305, AmMYB340 ( A. majus), AtMYB24 ( A. thaliana), AtMYB21 ( A. thaliana), PhEOBII ( Petunia ×  hybrida), FaEOBII ( Fragaria ×  ananassa) NlMYB305 ( Nicotiana langsdorffii), and PsMYB26 ( Pisum sativum) ( Uimari and Strommer, 1997;  Shin et al., 2002;  Li et al., 2006b;  Liu et al., 2009;  Spitzer-Rimon et al., 2010;  Medina-Puche et al., 2015). The two proteins clustered into different groups and may have different functions and/or operate through different pathways to take part in floral volatile production. Furthermore, to interrogate the evolutionary relationship of six HcMYB family members with Arabidopsis MYBs, a phylogenetic tree was built. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all MYB proteins can be clustered into five different groups (G A–G F). HcMYB1 was clustered into group G B, HcMYB2/6/5 belongs to group G D, while HcMYB3/4 was grouped into G A ( Supplementary Figure 1). HcMYB1 Interacts With the Auxin-Responsive Protein HcIAA4 by Y2H and BiFC Assays MYB proteins interact with many other proteins involved in hormone signal transduction, such as the jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive repressor proteins of the JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) family and the ABA signal receptor protein PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE LIKE (PYL) ( Qi et al., 2014;  Zhao et al., 2014). In a Y2H assay, HcMYB1 interacted with the auxin-responsive protein HcIAA4, whereas HcMYB2 did not ( Figure 8A). To verify the interaction between HcMYB1 and HcIAA4, we performed a BiFC assay. Expressing the N-terminal half of YFP fused to HcMYB1 (HcMYB1-YFP N) and the C-terminal half of YFP fused to HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP C) in  N. benthamiana leaves resulted in fluorescence. Moreover, the reciprocal experiment with the C-terminal half of YFP fused to HcMYB1 (HcMYB1-YFP C) and the N-terminal half of YFP fused to HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP N) also resulted in fluorescence and the control combinations of YFP C + HcMYB1-YFP N and HcIAA4-YFP C + YFP N did not result in fluorescence ( Figure 8B). To elucidate the functional significance of the interaction between HcMYB1 and HcIAA4, we co-transformed  N. benthamiana leaves with the same amounts of effectors carrying HcMYB1 and/or HcIAA4 in combination with the  HcBSMT2pro-LUC reporter constructs. The effect of HcMYB1 on  HcBSMT2pro expression was repressed in the presence of HcIAA4 ( Figure 8C). These results demonstrate that HcMYB1 directly activates  HcBSMT2 expression, which is modulated by its interacting partner HcIAA4. HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 Activate Structural Genes Involved in the Volatile Biosynthetic Pathway To confirm the binding ability of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 to the  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 promoters, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using GST-HcMYB1 and GST-HcMYB2 in  Escherichia coli. The probes used for  proHcTPS5 and  proHcBSMT2 were 49 bp, which start from (+)1168 to (+)1216 and (+)291 to (+)339, respectively. The sequences of the probes are listed in  Supplementary Table 2. Purified recombinant GST-HcMYB1 and GST-HcMYB2 fusion proteins bound to biotin-labeled probes derived from the  HcBSMT2 promoter, leading to a mobility shift, whereas no mobility shift occurred in the presence of GST alone ( Figure 7C). Next, we performed a competition assay, which showed that adding a 100-fold amount of unlabeled probe molecules (as compared to the labeled molecules) to the binding reaction reduced the intensity of the protein-DNA complex signal, and adding 500-fold unlabeled probes prevented any protein-DNA complex from being detected ( Figure 7C). We also observed binding between HcMYB2 and a biotin-labeled probe from the  HcTPS5 promoter ( Figure 7D). These results endorse the aforementioned data that HcMYB1 binds to the  HcBSMT2 promoter and HcMYB2 binds to the  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 promoters. MYB TFs transcriptionally regulate several genes by binding to the MEB  (T)(T)TGAC(C/T)  sequences in their promoters ( Rushton et al., 2010).  In silico cis-element analysis revealed the presence of MYB-binding motifs in  HcBSMTs and  HcTPSs sequences. MYB-core binding motifs were present in ten out of twelve  HcBSMTs. The number of MYB-binding motifs varies from one to thirteen. Interestingly, the number of MYB-bindings motifs in  HcBSMT2 was highest compared to other  HcBSMTs ( Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, MYB-core binding motifs were found in sixty out of sixty-two  HcTPSs. The promoter sequence analysis of  HcBSMT2 (1131 bp) and  HcTPS5 (1555 bp) revealed the presence of MYB-core binding motifs in their sequences. There were 13 and 5 copies of MYB-binding motifs in the sequences of  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5, respectively, suggesting that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 might target these genes. To determine whether HcMYB1 and/or HcMYB2 bind to the promoters of  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5, we performed a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay. Bait strains co-expressing HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 and harboring  proHcBSMT2 grew well in SD-Leu medium containing the antibiotic aureobasidin A (AbA), whereas bait strains harboring  proHcTPS5 grew well only when they expressed HcMYB2 ( Figures 7A,B). These results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 bind to the  HcBSMT2 promoter, while HcMYB2 binds to the  HcTPS5 promoter. To test the ability of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 to activate the  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 promoters, we performed a dual-luciferase assay. We individually cloned the promoter regions of  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 into reporter plasmids and the ORFs of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 into effector plasmids ( Figure 7E). HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 significantly enhanced  HcBSMT2 promoter activity (by 4.8-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively) compared to the control ( Figure 7D). Meanwhile, HcMYB2 significantly enhanced  HcTPS5 promoter activity (by 2.4-fold) compared to the control ( Figure 7F). Therefore, HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 activate the  HcBSMT2 promoter and HcMYB2 activates the  HcTPS5 promoter, indicating that these TFs have different target genes in  N. benthamiana leaves. These findings indicate that both HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 are transcriptional activators of volatile biosynthesis genes in flowers. HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 Are Expressed During Flower Development and in Response to Auxin Auxin plays a crucial role throughout flower development ( Krizek, 2011;  Ke et al., 2018). We, therefore measured total auxin levels in  H. coronarium during flower development (F1–F6). The total auxin contents were low during F1 and F2, peaked at F3–F5, dropped slightly at F4, and declined further at F6 ( Figure 2E). The emission of total floral volatiles was correlated with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) contents, suggesting that auxin might play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of these compounds. Under IAA treatment, the contents of the major floral volatiles ocimene, linalool, and methyl benzoate increased by 16, 17, and 20%, respectively, compared to those in control flowers not treated with IAA (CK) ( Figure 3A). Moreover, the expression of key structural volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS5,  HcTPS8,  HcPAL, and  HcBSMT2) was upregulated by this treatment ( Figure 3B). The accumulation of floral volatiles increases as flower development proceeds ( Yue et al., 2015;  Abbas et al., 2019). To study this process, we divided the flower development process into six stages ( Figure 2A). The emission of floral volatiles was low during the bud period (F1 and F2), substantially increased beginning at the initial flowering stage (F3), peaked during the full-bloom stage (F4 and F5), and declined at the senescence stage (F6) ( Figure 2B). We also examined the effect of p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB) (inhibit auxin action) on the floral volatile compounds ( Figure 4). In contrast to auxin, the emission of floral volatile compounds decreases. Under PCIB treatment, the contents of eucalyptol, allo-ocimene, β-ocimene, methyl benzoate, and linalool were decreased by 57, 81, 89, 100, and 42%, respectively, compared to those in control flowers not treated with PCIB ( Figure 4A). As expected, similar to IAA, the volatile contents of caryophyllene do not change significantly. We perform qRT-PCR analysis to characterize the expression level of key genes under PCIB treatment. The expression level of key volatile biosynthesis genes  HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS5,  HcTPS8,  HcPAL,  HcBSMT1,  HcBSMT2,  HcMYB1, and  HcMYB2 were downregulated by 79, 93, 64, 89, 33, 97, 96, 75, and 72%, respectively, relative to control ( Figure 4B). The data endorse the aforementioned findings that auxin plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of floral volatile compounds. To examine the relationship between  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 and key volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2) involved in floral volatile contents, we measured the expression levels of these genes.  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 transcript levels were low during early flower development and substantially increased thereafter.  HcMYB1 expression peaked at the full-bloom stage (F4–F5) and decreased at the senescence stage (F6), whereas  HcMYB2 was most strongly expressed at F6 ( Figure 2C). We detected similar expression patterns for  HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2 during flower development ( Figure 2D). Moreover, the expression levels of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 were positively correlated with the emissions of floral volatiles; this correlation was highly significant for  HcMYB1 ( Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, HcMYB1 showed a highly significant correlation with the emission of linalool contents ( Supplementary Figure 3). These results suggest that these genes play important roles in floral scent formation in  H. coronarium. Furthermore, we quantify the total hormone contents under IAA and PCIB treatment using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). The data showed that under IAA treatment, the total IAA and jasmonic acid (JA) contents were increased by 42 and 35% compared to control. Likewise, the total IAA and JA contents were decreased by 31 and 51%, respectively, while abscisic acid (ABA) contents were increased by 45% under PCIB treatment ( Figure 4C). However, the ABA contents do not change significantly under IAA treatment, suggesting that auxin might play a key role in the biosynthesis of floral volatile compounds via crosstalk with the abovementioned hormones. To characterize the expression levels of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 in response to IAA treatment, we performed qRT-PCR analysis.  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 transcript levels strongly increased after IAA treatment, reaching their highest levels at 12 h after treatment. In contrast, a rapid increase in  HcMYB2 and  HcTPS5 expression was observed at 2 h after treatment ( Figure 3C). Volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2) were also upregulated at 12 h after IAA treatment ( Figure 3D). The results suggest that the biosynthesis of floral volatiles is spatially and temporally regulated by HcMYB1 and HcMYB2, which are strongly associated with auxin-induced volatile emissions in  H. coronarium. Virus-Induced Gene Silencing of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 in Flowers Modifies the Emission Levels of Volatiles To investigate the potential involvement of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 in floral scent formation, we suppressed their expression through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in flowers ( Renner et al., 2009;  Yuan et al., 2011). We confirmed that this led to significant decreases in  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 transcript levels compared to those in unsilenced control flowers ( Figures 6A,B). The contents of the volatiles methyl benzoate and linalool in flowers decreased by approximately 57 and 21%, respectively, in response to  HcMYB1 silencing, whereas the eucalyptol and ocimene contents did not change significantly ( Figure 6C). In  HcMYB2-silenced flowers, the contents of methyl benzoate, linalool, ocimene, and eucalyptol decreased by 68, 37, 18, and 17%, respectively, compared to the control ( Figure 6C). We also analyzed the expression levels of key volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS3,  HcTPS5, and  HcBSMT2) in  H. coronarium. In  HcMYB1-silenced flowers,  HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2 were significantly downregulated, whereas  HcTPS3 did not exhibit any significant changes in expression, compared to the control. Furthermore, in  HcMYB2-silenced flowers,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS5, and  HcBSMT2 were all significantly downregulated compared to the control ( Figure 6D). These results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 play important and overlapping roles in the formation of floral volatiles in  H. coronarium.","Auxin, an important plant hormone, induces the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites by modulating the expression of auxin-responsive genes. In the ornamental plant  Hedychium coronarium , linalool and methyl benzoate are biosynthesized by the terpene synthase (TPS) HcTPS5 and the benzoic/salicylic acid methyltransferase (BSMT) HcBSMT2, respectively. However, the transcriptional regulation of this process remains unclear. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the R2R3-MYB transcription factors HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 in regulating the biosynthesis of these floral aroma compounds.  HcMYB1  and  HcMYB2  are specifically expressed in flowers, their expression is correlated with the emission of volatile compounds in flowers, and is induced by auxin. Moreover, HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 interact with the  HcBSMT2  promoter region. HcMYB2 activates the expression of the linalool synthase gene  HcTPS5 . In flowers with  HcMYB1  or  HcMYB2  silenced, the levels of floral scent compounds were significantly reduced, and  HcBSMT2  and  HcTPS5  were downregulated compared with the wild type. Moreover, HcMYB1 form protein-protein interaction with key scent-related HcIAA4 protein to regulate floral aroma production. Taken together, these results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 play crucial roles in regulating the formation of scent compounds in  Hedychium coronarium (H. coronarium)  flowers in response to auxin signaling."," 'Biosynthesis', 'MYB transcription factors', 'auxin', 'Floral Scent', 'Hedychium Coronarium' "," 'Figure', 'Supplementary Figure', 'genes', 'IAA', 'floral volatiles', 'volatile', 'IAA treatment', 'floral', 'flower development', 'promoter' "," HcMYB1, HcMYB2, MYB, MYB TFs, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1-GFP, HcMYB2-GFP, HcMYB1-GFP-, HcMYB2-GFP-transformed protoplasts, green fluorescent protein, GFP, GFP, GFP, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, GAL4, GAL4BD, firefly luciferase, LUC, LUC/REN, GAL4BD, pBD, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, LUC, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, GAL4BD-VP16, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, Scent-Related, R2R3, MYB, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, R2R3-MYBs, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, AtMYB77, AtMYB44, HcMYB2, AmMYB305, AmMYB340, A. majus, AtMYB24, AtMYB21, Petunia ×, FaEOBII, Pisum sativum, MYB, G A–G F, HcMYB1, G B, HcMYB2/6/5, G D, HcMYB3/4, G A, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, Y2H, BiFC, MYB, JAZ, ABA signal receptor, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, YFP, HcMYB1, HcMYB1-YFP N, YFP, HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP C, YFP, HcMYB1, HcMYB1-YFP C, YFP, HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP N), YFP C + HcMYB1-YFP, HcIAA4-YFP C, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, GST-HcMYB1, GST-HcMYB2, (+)1216, (+)291, (+)339, GST-HcMYB1, GST-HcMYB2, GST, protein-DNA complex, protein-DNA, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, MYB, MYB-bindings, MYB-core, MYB-core, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, Y1H, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, dual-luciferase, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, Auxin Auxin, auxin, F2, F3–F5, F4, F6 ( Figure 2E, auxin, CK, HcTPS1, F2, F5, auxin, auxin, Figure 4A, auxin, HcTPS5, F4–F5, F6 ( Figure 2C, HcMYB1, JA, abscisic acid, ABA, ABA, auxin, HcTPS5, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, auxin-induced, unsilenced, HcTPS3, HcMYB1, HcMYB2 "," 'HcTPS5', 'proHcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPSs', 'HcTPSs.', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS5,', 'proHcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS8,', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS8,', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,' ",  ,  ,NaN

Experimental Analysis of Recombinant Protein under Different Stresses The expression difference between the recombinant bacteria and the empty vector under stress conditions was observed through the drop plate test ( Figure 5), and it was found that the growth state of the empty vector (control) on the LB solid medium was consistent with the growth state of the recombinant bacteria, while under treatment with 400 mM NaCl, 800 mM D-mannitol, pH 5.0 (HCl), or pH 9.0 (NaOH), the number of recombinant bacteria was significantly higher than that of control bacteria. 3.4.1. Induced Expression Analysis of Recombinant Protein The positive prokaryotic expression strain (TransB/pET28a-PmDXS) was mixed with 0 mM, 0.5 mM, 1.0 mM IPTG, and the expression was induced by shaking at 37 °C for 4 h and 16 °C for 16 h. After SDS-PAGE analysis, the  E. coli with the pET28a empty plasmid vector was induced with different IPTG concentrations at 65–100 KDa, and no specific protein appeared. However, the  E. coli containing pET28a-PmDXS was significantly different after induction with different concentrations of IPTG compared with the control group without IPTG. Obvious thick bands were seen at 70 kDa in the whole bacterial samples and supernatant samples at 37 °C and 16 °C, indicating the appearance of specific protein bands. This result was consistent with the expected PmDXS protein size of 70.4 kDa; that is, the  PmDXS gene was expressed in  E. coli ( Figure 4). 3.2. Tissue-Specific Expression Analysis of PmDXS qRT-PCR technology was used to analyze flower (F), young leaf (NL), old leaf (OL), young stem (NS), old stem (OS), root (R), xylem (M), and phloem (P) expression. The results showed that the gene was expressed in all organs. The expression levels in the flower, xylem, and phloem were lower than those in young leaf tissues, with 24.3%, 15.6%, and 31.1% of those in young leaves, respectively. The expression level in roots was the highest among the plant tissues, being 3.2 times higher than those in other tissues ( Figure 2). Thus,  PmDXS is mainly expressed in the roots of Masson pine. 3.6. Function Analysis of PmDXS Promoter Using Masson pine genomic DNA as a template, a 1024 bp promoter sequence was obtained after PCR amplification ( Figure 7a,b). After the sequencing results were compared, and no base mutation site was found, indicating that the specific fragment cloned was a promoter sequence upstream of the transcription start site, named PmDXS-Pro. The PlantCARE online tool was used to predict and analyze the cis-acting elements of the obtained promoters. The sequence contained 10 types of cis-acting elements, with typical core elements TATA-box (22 sites) and CAAT-box (24 sites) of eukaryotic promoters, as well as elements involved in the ABA response (ABRE); a light-responsive element (G-Box); a cis-acting element related to the salicylic acid reaction (TCA-element); a cis-acting regulatory element involved in the MeJA reaction (TGACG-motif); and a cis-regulatory element of the auxin response (AuxRR-core) ( Figure 7c). It is speculated that PmDXS-Pro  expression may be regulated by the photoperiod and plant hormone signals. In addition, the presence of the MYB binding site MRE indicates that the transcription factors related to Masson pine stress resistance may play a role in regulating the expression of  PmDXS. Wild-type  N. benthamiana was used as a negative control, and  N. benthamiana infected with pBI121:GUS empty vector  Agrobacterium liquid was used as a positive control. The roots, stems, and leaves of  N. benthamiana were infected with  Agrobacterium for GUS staining. The results showed that the wild tobacco infected with the negative control was not stained and that infected with the positive control showed an obvious blue color. The tobacco infected by the test group showed a lighter blue response, indicating that the cloned  PmDXS has a promoter function and can also drive the expression of the downstream  GUS under noninducible conditions ( Figure 7d). 3.7. Chlorophyll and Carotenoid Contents and DXS Enzyme Activity in Transformed and Wild-Type A. thaliana The total chlorophyll includes chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. Compared with the wild-type control, the chlorophyll a content was highest in L12, L3, and L6 transgenic plants, increasing by 1.7, 1.56, 1.55 times, respectively, while the L4, L9, and L5 strains showed the highest chlorophyll b contents, which were 2.06, 1.77, 1.77 times that of the control, respectively. The chlorophyll a and b contents of other strains increased by more than 11% compared with the control. The carotenoid content in the transgenic line was significantly higher than that in the wild type. L2 reached 233.06 pg/mL, which was 1.60 times that of the control, while L7 had the lowest value, which was 1.22 times that of the control. The rest of the lines all increased by 12%. DXS enzyme activity analysis showed that the transgenic lines L8 and L2 had the highest expression level of 194.64 U/L, which was 1.80 times that of the control, followed by the L4 line at 184.83 U/L, which was 1.71 times that of the wild type, and the L1 line had the lowest activity at 1.16 times that of the control. The DXS enzyme activity of the other strains increased by more than 12% compared with the control ( Figure 8). 3.5. Subcellular Localization of PmDXS The  PmDXS::GFP fusion expression vector was injected into young tobacco leaves (20-day seedling age) by the transient transformation method. After culturing in dark light for 2 days in an artificial climate incubator, 0.5 × 0.5 cm tobacco leaf samples were taken and laid flat on a glass slide to be pressed. The expression was observed under a confocal laser microscope. The green fluorescence was concentrated in the chloroplasts of leaf epidermal cells and was more obvious in the guard cells ( Figure 6). Therefore, the PmDXS protein can be considered a plastid protein. 3.1. Molecular Cloning and Sequence Analysis of PmDXS According to the Masson pine transcriptome data   24 , the  DXS gene was cloned and spliced to obtain a full-length sequence of 2513 bp (GenBank accession number: MK970590), including the middle 1709 bp fragment ( Figure 1a), 5′RACE 991 bp fragment ( Figure 1b), 3′RACE 333 bp fragment ( Figure 1b), and 2223 bp ORF region ( Figure 1c). In addition, the  DXS gene can encode a 740 amino acid protein. The secondary structure of the protein predicted by SOPMA mostly includes random coils, followed by α-helices and β-turns. The physical and chemical properties of the amino acids of the  PmDXS gene were analyzed by ProtParam online software. The isoelectric point (pI) was 8.54, the number of total negatively charged residues (Asp+Glu) was 76, and the number of total positively charged residues (Arg+Lys) was 82. The numbers of 20 species and their proportions are shown in  Figure 1d. Similar to DXS proteins in other plants, the PmDXS protein is a hydrophilic protein, and it does not contain a transmembrane domain and signal peptide. A conserved domain analysis of predicted amino acids was performed on the NCBI website ( Figure 1e), and the results showed that the protein contained the core sequences of the TPP_enzyme and TPP_enzyme_PYR superfamilies. Between the 73rd and 736th amino acids, there is a multifunctional domain of PLN02582, which is a characteristic sequence of 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase. Therefore, the protein encoded by  PmDXS belongs to the family of 1-deoxyd-d-xylose-5-phosphate synthases. The PmDXS protein was analyzed and predicted with Jalview software, and it was found that it contained the ammonium disulfate binding site GDGG(X)8E(X)4A(X)11NDN (marked with red dotted line) and a transketolase domain DRAGX28PXD (marked with solid red line). After comparing the amino acid sequence of PmDXS with the DXS amino acid sequences of the other 4 plant species, it was found that the similarity was more than 90%, and the similarity reached 99% with those of  P. kesiya and  P. densiflora ( Figure 1f). TargetP1.1 Server and Cell-PLoc 2.0 online software were used to analyze the subcellular location of the DXS protein of Masson pine, and the results showed that the protein is most likely located in the chloroplast. Analysis of the DXS amino acid sequence of PmDXS and DXS proteins from 18 other species of plants showed that gymnosperm DXSs clustered together and were closely related in  P. densiflora, Simao pine ( P. kesiya), and  Picea abies ( Figure 1g). 3.3. Analysis of PmDXS Expression Pattern under Abiotic Stress Two-year-old Masson pine seedlings were treated with six abiotic stresses, and qRT-PCR analysis showed that the relative expression levels of PmDXS under the conditions of mechanical injury, 15% PEG 6000, 10 mM H 2O 2, 50 µM ETH, 10 mM MeJA, and 1 mM SA were significantly higher than those of the control group ( Figure 3a–f). The expression level of  PmDXS was significantly higher under H 2O 2 stress than that of the control group and the other stress groups ( Figure 3c). When treated with PEG 6000 (15%), MeJA (10 mM), and H 2O 2 (10 mM) for 6 h, the expression of  PmDXS was the highest, being 2.01 times ( Figure 3e), 2.08 times ( Figure 3a), and 3.31 times ( Figure 3c) that of the control, differences which were significant. Under ETH stress, the expression of  PmDXS first increased and then decreased until the highest expression level was reached at 12 h, which was 1.14 times that of the control group ( Figure 3b). When SA (1 mM) stress was applied for 3 h,  PmDXS expression was the highest, which was 3.39 times that of the control group ( Figure 3d). Under mechanical injury, the expression of  PmDXS showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing, reaching the highest values at 3 h and 6 h, which were 6.63 times and 7.3 times those of the control (0 h), respectively ( Figure 3f). The above results indicated that  PmDXS participates in the abiotic stress response mechanism and plays a role in the stress response of Masson pine.","In the methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, 1-deoxy-D-xylose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) is considered the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of terpenoids. In this study,  PmDXS  (MK970590) was isolated from  Pinus massoniana . Bioinformatics analysis revealed homology of MK970590 with DXS proteins from other species. Relative expression analysis suggested that  PmDXS  expression was higher in roots than in other plant parts, and the treatment of  P. massoniana  seedlings with mechanical injury via 15% polyethylene glycol 6000, 10 mM H 2 O 2 , 50 μM ethephon (ETH), 10 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and 1 mM salicylic acid (SA) resulted in an increased expression of  PmDXS . pET28a- PmDXS  was expressed in  Escherichia coli  TransB (DE3) cells, and stress analysis showed that the recombinant protein was involved in resistance to NaCl and drought stresses. The subcellular localization of  PmDXS  was in the chloroplast. We also cloned a full-length 1024 bp  PmDXS  promoter.  GUS  expression was observed in  Nicotiana benthamiana  roots, stems, and leaves.  PmDXS  overexpression significantly increased carotenoid, chlorophyll a, and chlorophyll b contents and DXS enzyme activity, suggesting that  DXS  is important in isoprenoid biosynthesis.

47,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6093421/eupmc_result.json,PMC6093421,"Results FhTPS genes play predominant roles in the differential emissions of volatile terpenes between the two  Freesia cultivars In plants, volatile terpenes originate from two distinct pathways, designated the MEP and the MVA pathway. In the present study, the structural genes encoding enzymes involved in both pathways were isolated, their expression levels in flowers at Stage 5 were evaluated and compared between the two cultivars ( Fig. 3), and 46 candidate genes were identified. The candidate genes involved in the MEP pathway had relatively higher expression levels than the candidate genes of the MVA pathway, which was in accordance with the larger amounts of monoterpenes detected in both cultivars. In addition, almost all the candidate genes had similar expression levels between Red River ® and Ambiance except several  TPS genes (nominated as  FhTPS genes). Consequently, it was reasonable to speculate that the differentially expressed  FhTPS genes might produce the divergent volatile compound emissions from the flowers of the two  Freesia cultivars. Based on their floral expression levels, putative  FhTPS genes were further amplified. A total of eight  FhTPS genes were obtained, designated  FhTPS1– FhTPS8. All eight  FhTPS genes were amplified from Red River ® except  FhTPS7, and they were all also obtained from Ambiance with the exception of  FhTPS5. Several variations were found between FhTPS proteins from the two cultivars, although FhTPS1 showed identical amino acid sequences ( Supplementary Figs S3–S8). As shown in  Supplementary Table S5, the  FhTPS1– FhTPS8 ORF sequences encoded 592, 595, 590, 566, 607, 566, 570, and 566 deduced amino acids, respectively, and showed high sequence identities with TPS proteins from other species. In order to obtain the genomic sequences of the eight  FhTPS genes, specific primers ( Supplementary Table S1) were designed and amplified using genomic DNA of Red River ® and Ambiance. Results showed that  FhTPS2,  FhTPS3, FhTPS4, and  FhTPS8 contained six introns,  FhTPS6 contained three introns, in both cultivars. In contrast,  FhTPS1 was found to have three introns in Red River ®, whereas no intron was present in the corresponding gene in Ambiance. Furthermore, the genome sequence of  FhTPS5, which had three introns in Red River ®, could not be isolated from Ambiance, and  FhTPS7 was obtained only from Ambiance, in which it had six introns ( Supplementary Fig. S9). FhTPS genes show different expression patterns during ﬂower development and in different tissues To compare the transcription of the  FhTPS genes with the patterns of volatile terpene release during ﬂower development, floral development was divided into five stages as described in our previous studies ( Sun   et al., 2015 ,  2016;  Li,   et al., 2016 ). qRT-PCR was performed to investigate the temporal pattern of expression levels of the eight candidate  FhTPS genes during flower development. In agreement with the patterns of volatile terpene emission, the transcript levels of most of the  FhTPS genes substantially increased and were maintained at a high level during anthesis. In addition,  FhTPS1,  FhTPS2, and  FhTPS6 were highly expressed in Red River ® ( Fig. 6A;  Supplementary Fig. S12), whereas  FhTPS1 and  FhTPS7 had higher expression levels in Ambiance ( Fig. 6B;  Supplementary Fig. S12), implying specific functions in each  Freesia cultivar. To further investigate whether the expression patterns of  FhTPS genes coincided spatially with terpene emissions, flower tissue-specific expression patterns were also assessed ( Fig. 6C,  D;  Supplementary Fig. S13). qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression level of  FhTPS1 and  FhTPS2 in Red River ®, and  FhTPS1 and  FhTPS7 in Ambiance, were significantly higher than the other  FhTPS genes in all the tested tissues. Furthermore, it was noteworthy that only  FhTPS4 showed a relatively high expression level in calyx and torus, indicating that it might be responsible for the biosynthesis and emission of terpenes in these two flower tissues. However, more detailed data are needed in order to decipher the catalytic properties of the FhTPS proteins. In addition, we found that the 18S rRNA could be used as a suitable endogenous control for qRT-PCR analysis as it is stably expressed ( Supplementary Fig. S14). Volatile terpenes are emitted differentially from the flowers of two cultivars of  Freesia x  hybrida In order to further investigate the spatial release patterns of the volatile terpenes, flowers at Stage 5 were further divided into five tissues, the torus, calyx, petal, stamen, and pistil ( Supplementary Figs S1 and  S2). Interestingly, linalool was still the most predominant volatile terpene in different floral tissues ( Fig. 2) and the unique component in calyces and toruses. Large concentrations of volatiles were released from petals and also from pistils and stamens ( Fig. 2). More detailed data are provided in  Supplementary Table S4. The volatile compounds in flowers of two  Freesia x  hybrida varieties, Red River ® and Ambiance, were analyzed temporally and spatially by headspace SPME-GC-MS analysis. Generally speaking, the volatile compounds identified in  Freesia flowers were mainly monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and carotenoid derivatives (apocarotenoids). In the course of development of  Freesia flowers, the amount of volatile compounds increased gradually and peaked when the flowers opened fully, a finding consistent with human assessment of the floral scent ( Fig. 1). A total of 31 terpenes were detected in  Freesia flowers, 19 from Red River ® and 20 from Ambiance ( Supplementary Table S3). Linalool was the most abundant terpene compound detected in flowers of both cultivars, accounting for 52.5% in Red River ® and 93.22% in Ambiance at Stage 5 ( Supplementary Table S3). However, other volatile terpene compounds showed differing emission profiles in flowers of the two cultivars. α-Pinene, β-pinene, 1,8 cineole, D-limonene,  cis-ocimene,  trans-ocimene, terpinolene, (–)-4-terpineol, α-terpineol, nerolidol, and α-cyclocitral could be detected only in flowers of Red River ®, whereas flowers of Ambiance were able to produce hotrienol, copaene, elemene, α-gurjunene, caryophyllene, α-guaiene, α-patchoulene, sativene, γ-cadinene, selinene, α-bulnesene, and vatirenene, which were not detected in Red River ® ( Supplementary Table S3). Generally, flowers of Red River ® released more monoterpenes, mainly composed of α-terpineol (25.4%),  cis-ocimene (2.1%),  trans-ocimene (1.8%), and 1,8 cineole (0.9%), while copaene (2.5%) and α-gurjunene (0.6%) contributed most to the higher abundance of sesquiterpenes in the flowers of Ambiance ( Supplementary Table S3). Functional characterization of major  FhTPS genes  in planta was consistent with production obtained  in vitro To further investigate whether the major  FhTPSs that are highly expressed in flowers of the two  Freesia cultivars yield the same terpene products  in vivo, they were transiently expressed in tobacco leaves. The major products detected in the transgenic tobacco leaves  in planta were well matched with those detected in the previous biochemical analysis  in vitro. Specifically, FhTPS1 could catalyze the formation of linalool when overexpressed, whereas transformation with  FhTPS2 caused the significant production of α-terpineol. For the sesquiterpene synthases, FhTPS6 and FhTPS7, the major components of the enzymatic products  in vitro, that is, selinene and copaene, respectively, were detected in the transgenic tobacco leaves ( Fig. 7). We also transformed  FhTPS3 and  FhTPS5 into tobacco; consistent with the biochemical analysis, no products were found to be synthesized or highly increased (data not shown), indicating that these two  FhTPS genes might be pseudofunctional or that their catalytic activities were too low to yield detectable products. Enzyme kinetic parameter analysis demonstrates that FPP is the preferred substrate for FhTPS7 in the cultivar Ambiance Regardless of linalool, more sesquiterpenes were released from flowers of Ambiance than from Red River ®, and this might be ascribed to the higher expression of  FhTPS7 in Ambiance. However, biochemical analysis showed that FhTPS7 could synthesize monoterpenes using GPP and generate sesquiterpenes in the presence of FPP. Therefore, it was reasonable to deduce that the sesquiterpene production in Ambiance might be regulated by substrate selectivity of FhTPS7. In order to investigate this possible substrate bias, kinetic parameters of FhTPS7 were examined. A range of concentrations of GPP (3–270 μM) and FPP (1–135 μM) was employed to yield hyperbolic saturation curves; the results indicated that the recombinant FhTPS7 enzyme recognized FPP more efficiently (nearly 40-fold difference of  kcat/ Km) ( Table 2), which is in accordance with the expectations suggested above. Therefore, it may reasonably be concluded that the substrate preference of FhTPS7 protein plays an important role in determining the abundance of sesquiterpenes in Ambiance. Expression of  FhTPS genes is associated with the formation of volatile terpenes in the two cultivars of  Freesia x  hybrida As the major volatile terpene components released from flowers were well matched with the catalytic products of the FhTPS proteins encoded by the highly expressed  FhTPS genes, it is reasonable to deduce that their specific expression profiles might account for levels of metabolite biosynthesis and emission. In order to verify this hypothesis, the patterns of emission of the major volatile terpenes and the expression of  FhTPS genes were compared to determine any positive relationships. The release of linalool in flowers of both  Freesia cultivars was synchronized with the expression of  FhTPS1 in three flower tissues (petal, pistil, and stamen), whereas the expression of  FhTPS4 was only consistent with the release of linalool in calyx and torus. Expression of  FhTPS2 showed a synchronous relationship with the emission of α-terpineol in Red River ®.  FhTPS6 was also expressed in the two cultivars at relatively high levels. In Red River ®, its expression coincided with the release of  cis-ocimene and  trans-ocimene, and might also be mainly responsible for the emission of selinene from Ambiance, according to its consistent expression.  FhTPS7 was the  TPS gene with the highest expression in Ambiance, and its expression was obviously consistent with the emissions of sesquiterpene, especially copaene.  FhTPS8 was expressed in Ambiance at a lower level, and its expression was found to be correlated with the release of another major sesquiterpene, α-gurjunene ( Fig. 8). Finally, in order to confirm whether the correlation between the expression of the  FhTPS genes and the release of the major volatile terpenes was significant, Pearson correlation evaluation was performed, and significant values ( P<0.01 or  P<0.05) were observed ( Supplementary Tables S6 and  S7). FhTPSs phylogenetically cluster into different subgroups with different amino acid motifs and divergent subcellular localization To further clarify the potential roles of the eight FhTPS proteins, a phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method. The results showed that TPS proteins from various species were clearly classified into six different clades, including clades TPS-c (most conserved among land plants), TPS-e/f (conserved among vascular plants), and TPS-d (gymnosperm specific), and three angiosperm-specific clades, TPS-b, TPS-g, and TPS-a ( Fig. 5). The TPS-a clade was further divided into a dicot-specific subclade and a monocot-specific subclade. All the FhTPS proteins identified in the present study clustered into angiosperm-specific clades. In particular, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, and FhTPS8 clustered into the TPS-a monocot subclade together with other TPS proteins from monocot plant species. Other FhTPS proteins, including FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS3, and FhTPS5, fell into the TPS-b clade. By contrast, FhTPS4 clustered independently into the TPS-g clade. Sequence alignment revealed that all of the FhTPS proteins contained the conserved DDXX(D/E) and (N,D)DX2(S,T,G)X3E (NSE/DTE) regions that are essential for the binding of Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ cofactors to catalyze terpene biosynthesis ( Supplementary Fig. S10). Moreover, FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS3, and FhTPS5 also shared another conserved motif, RRX 8W, which is usually found in TPSs catalyzing the cyclization of monoterpenes. The biosynthesis of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes is thought to be compartmentalized, with monoterpenes produced in the plastids, where GPP is synthesized, and sesquiterpenes formed in the cytosol, where FPP is generated ( Chen   et al., 2011 ;  Dudareva   et al., 2013 ). Bioinformatic analysis using the online ChloroP 1.1 ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/) and RaptorX ( Källberg   et al., 2012 ) software predicted that FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS4, and FhTPS5 had transit peptides positioned upstream of the RRX 8W motif and therefore had a high probability of localizing in the plastids ( Supplementary Fig. S11). This is consistent with the subcellular localization analysis, which showed that FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS4, and FhTPS5 were localized to the plastids, whereas FhTPS3, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, and FhTPS8 showed a diffuse cellular distribution ( Fig. 4). Biochemical characterization of the enzymes encoded by  FhTPS genes revealed their versatile and diverse functions Catalytic activity analysis of the eight FhTPS proteins was also performed using FPP as substrate ( Table 1;  Supplementary Fig. S17). Results showed that FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS3, and FhTPS5 did not have the ability to synthesize sesquiterpenes, whereas FhTPS4, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, and FhTPS8 had versatile roles in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes. Notably, GC-MS analysis of the products of the reactions catalyzed by FhTPS7 identified at least 24 kinds of sesquiterpenes, with copaene (37.1%), elemene (11.1%), β-maaliene (9.44%), α-gurjurene (4.4%), sativene (3.2%), α-muurolene (2.9%), γ-gurjunene (2.9%), guaia-1(10),11-diene (2.4%), γ-cadinene (1.7%), and cycloisosativene (0.33%) as the major products. FhTPS8 and FhTPS6 were also shown to be multiple-product sesquiterpene synthases, which mainly catalyzed the formation of α-gurjunene and selinene, respectively, together with other sesquiterpenes. For FhTPS4, only nerolidol could be identified as a sesquiterpene product. The predominant volatile terpenes in most flowers are monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, produced by pathways catalyzed by TPS proteins using GPP or FPP as substrate, respectively. To further confirm the enzymatic properties of the FhTPS proteins and their dominant roles in the biosynthesis of terpenes in  F. hybrida, substrate specificity analyses were conducted using both GPP and FPP. To prepare recombinant proteins for the biochemical analysis, the eight  FhTPS genes were expressed in  E. coli. FhTPS1, FhTPS2, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, and FhTPS8 were induced into the supernatant and then purified as homogenous soluble proteins, whereas FhTPS3, FhTPS4, and FhTPS5 were expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies, and so crude protein extracts were utilized in the assays of enzymatic activity ( Supplementary Fig. S15); although some FhTPS4 was detected in the supernatant, it failed to be purified. As expected, no products were detected when heat-inactivated recombinant proteins were added to reaction mixtures supplemented with both substrates. Therefore, only the crude protein extracts from the  E. coli expression system containing empty vector were used as controls in the biochemical assays. As shown in  Table 1 and  Supplementary Fig. S16, upon incubation with GPP as a substrate, both FhTPS1 and FhTPS4 exclusively catalyzed the formation of linalool, as predicted above, whereas FhTPS2, FhTPS6, and FhTPS7 were confirmed to be versatile enzymes with multiple products. Specifically, FhTPS2 mainly converted GPP into α-terpineol (78.7%) and a few other monoterpenes, such as 1.8 cineole (6.9%), D-limonene (3.9%), α-pinene (3.2%), myrcene (1.6%), and bicyclo 3.1.0 thujene (1.2%). FhTPS6 primarily catalyzed the formation of myrcene (40.1%),  cis-ocimene (22.4%),  trans-ocimene (16.1%), D-limonene (6.6%), linalool (4.9%), terpinolene (3.1%), terpinene (2.6%), isoterpinolene (2.2%), and thujene (2.1%). Similar to FhTPS6, FhTPS7 chiefly transformed GPP into the same monoterpenes with variable percentages, mainly myrcene (41.9%),  cis-ocimene (21.3%), and  trans-ocimene (16.6%). In contrast, no monoterpene was detected in assays using FhTPS3, FhTPS5, or FhTPS8 as enzymes.","The development of flower scents was a crucial event in biological evolution, providing olfactory signals by which plants can attract pollinators. In this study, bioinformatics, metabolomics, and biochemical and molecular methodologies were integrated to investigate the candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of volatile components in two cultivars of Freesia x hybrida, Red River® and Ambiance, which release different categories of compounds. We found that terpene synthase (TPS) genes were the pivotal genes determining spatiotemporal release of volatile compounds in both cultivars. Eight FhTPS genes were isolated and six were found to be functional: FhTPS1 was a single-product enzyme catalyzing the formation of linalool, whereas the other four FhTPS proteins were multi-product enzymes, among which FhTPS4, FhTPS6, and FhTPS7 could recognize geranyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate simultaneously. The FhTPS enzymatic products closely matched the volatile terpenes emitted from flowers, and significant correlations were found between release of volatile terpenes and FhTPS gene expression. Graphical models based on these results are proposed that summarize the biosynthesis of Freesia floral volatile terpenes. The characterization of FhTPS genes paves the way to decipher their roles in the speciation and fitness of Freesia, and this knowledge could also be used to introduce or enhance scent in other plants.",NaN," 'Red River', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'FhTPS genes', 'Supplementary Table', 'Fig.', 'Ambiance', 'Supplementary', 'FhTPS', 'genes', 'River' "," FhTPS, ®, Ambiance, ®, FhTPS, S5, ®, Ambiance, FhTPS4, ®, ®, ®, pistil ( Supplementary Figs S1, stamens ( Fig. 2, ®, Ambiance, ®, ®, α-terpineol, ®, Ambiance, ®, ®, α-terpineol, α-terpineol, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, FhTPS7, ®, FhTPS7, FhTPS7, 3–270 μM, FPP (, FhTPS7 enzyme, FhTPS7, FhTPS proteins, α-terpineol, ®, ®, Ambiance, Ambiance, FhTPS, TPS-g, TPS-a ( Fig. 5, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, FhTPS8, FhTPS, FhTPS2, FhTPS3, FhTPS proteins, DDXX(D/E, (N, G)X3E, Mg 2, FhTPS2, FhTPS3, RaptorX, Källberg   , FhTPS2, FhTPS4, FhTPS2, FhTPS4, FhTPS3, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, FhTPS8, FhTPS, FhTPS2, FhTPS3, FhTPS4, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, FhTPS8, FhTPS7, cycloisosativene, FhTPS8, FhTPS6, FhTPS4, FhTPS proteins, FhTPS2, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, FhTPS8, FhTPS3, FhTPS4, FhTPS4, FhTPS4, FhTPS2, FhTPS6, FhTPS7, FhTPS2, α-terpineol, α-pinene (3.2%, bicyclo 3.1.0 thujene (1.2, FhTPS6, FhTPS3, FhTPS8 "," 'FhTPS', 'TPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS1–', 'FhTPS8.', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS7,', 'FhTPS5.', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS1', 'FhTPS1–', 'FhTPS8', 'TPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS2,', 'FhTPS3,', 'FhTPS4,', 'FhTPS8', 'FhTPS6', 'FhTPS1', 'FhTPS5,', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS1,', 'FhTPS2,', 'FhTPS6', 'FhTPS1', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS1', 'FhTPS2', 'FhTPS1', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS4', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPSs', 'FhTPS1', 'FhTPS2', 'FhTPS6', 'FhTPS7,', 'FhTPS3', 'FhTPS5', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS7.', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS1', 'FhTPS4', 'FhTPS2', 'FhTPS6', 'FhTPS7', 'TPS', 'FhTPS8', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPSs', 'FhTPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-c', 'TPS-e/f', 'TPS-d', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-g,', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS6,', 'FhTPS7,', 'FhTPS8', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS1,', 'FhTPS2,', 'FhTPS3,', 'FhTPS5,', 'TPS-b', 'FhTPS4', 'TPS-g', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS1,', 'FhTPS2,', 'FhTPS3,', 'FhTPS5', 'TPSs', 'FhTPS1,', 'FhTPS2,', 'FhTPS4,', 'FhTPS5', 'FhTPS1,', 'FhTPS2,', 'FhTPS4,', 'FhTPS5', 'FhTPS3,', 'FhTPS6,', 'FhTPS7,', 'FhTPS8', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS1,', 'FhTPS2,', 'FhTPS3,', 'FhTPS5', 'FhTPS4,', 'FhTPS6,', 'FhTPS7,', 'FhTPS8', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS8', 'FhTPS6', 'FhTPS4,', 'TPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS', 'FhTPS1,', 'FhTPS2,', 'FhTPS6,', 'FhTPS7,', 'FhTPS8', 'FhTPS3,', 'FhTPS4,', 'FhTPS5', 'FhTPS4', 'FhTPS1', 'FhTPS4', 'FhTPS2,', 'FhTPS6,', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS2', 'FhTPS6', 'FhTPS6,', 'FhTPS7', 'FhTPS3,', 'FhTPS5,', 'FhTPS8' ",  ,  ,terpene synthase
48,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7793759/eupmc_result.json,PMC7793759,"Results Single and Combined Effects of TSWV and Thrips on Defense-Related and Primary Metabolic Processes Inferred From Gene Expression Defense Signaling Pathways We examined the microarray hybridization data for possible interaction between SA and JA pathways. The magnitude and direction of differential expression of all known phytohormone genes in the Tomato GeneChip are shown in  Supplementary Table 6. TSWV infection alone significantly up-regulated the majority (59%) of signature SA-responsive genes compared to mock-inoculated plants ( Figure 4A). These include genes involved both upstream and downstream of SA synthesis such as chorismate mutase and pathogenesis-related proteins, respectively. Genes encoding the proteins NPR1 and NPR3 that have been shown to interact with SA were also up-regulated in virus-infected plants. We observed suppression of JA-genes in response to virus treatment; 29% suppression and 18% up-regulation in virus-infected plants ( Figure 4B). This suggests that the strength of the SA-induced suppression of JA-genes was not as widespread. Moreover, most of the down-regulated JA genes belonged to the protease inhibitor category, specifically wound-induced proteinase inhibitors. A large percentage (60%) of ET-associated genes including those involved in ET synthesis such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase and ET signaling such as ethylene-responsive transcription factor 5 were up-regulated in TSWV-infected plants ( Supplementary Table 6). Feeding by thrips alone resulted in up-regulation of JA-related genes (70%), but no major impact was observed on ET genes ( Figure 4B and  Supplementary Table 6). Interestingly, genes in all three signaling pathways were significantly up-regulated in TSWV and thrips dual treatment ( Supplementary Table 6). In addition to signaling pathways, genes involved in general stress responses such as heat shock proteins, GSTs, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were differentially-regulated in TSWV-infected tomato, and in most cases up-regulation occurred regardless of the presence of thrips ( Supplementary Table 6). We also found transcription factors such as WRKYs, Myb family, bZIP family and Mitogen-activated kinase 6 that initiate defense responses to be up-regulated in response to virus infection. We analyzed other phytohormones that are known to interact with SA and JA/ET, namely ABA and auxin and that were differentially-expressed in our microarray analysis. Virus infection alone did not significantly impact ABA-related genes (66% showed similar expression to mock) and 33% ABA-related genes were down-regulated ( Supplementary Table 6). Thrips alone and the dual treatment did not differ significantly in the expression from mock (83 and 60% similarity, respectively) ( Supplementary Table 6). With regards to auxin, TSWV infection alone and in combination with thrips down-regulated 40 and 60% of auxin genes, whereas thrips activity had similar percentage of up-regulated and down-regulated genes (40% for both) ( Supplementary Table 6). Photosynthesis-Related Processes Genes involved in photosynthesis were largely down-regulated in all three treatments ( Figure 5A and  Supplementary Table 7). Virus infection, both alone and in combination with thrips feeding, had a greater impact on photosynthesis-related genes with 54 and 70% of the genes being suppressed compared to mock-inoculated plants, respectively ( Supplementary Table 7). These include ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, ATP binding protein, chaperone, and chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins. Plants challenged with thrips also repressed 37% of photosynthesis-related genes compared to the control. Protein Synthesis and Degradation A majority of genes involved in protein synthesis such as constituents of 40S, 50S, and 60S ribosomal subunits and genes associated with protein degradation such as those that encode 26S proteasome and involved in ubiquitination were induced in response to TSWV and the combination treatment (64 and 70%, respectively;  Figure 5C and  Supplementary Table 8). The presence of thrips alone did not have an impact on expression of protein metabolism genes compared to mock-inoculated plants ( Figure 5C). Cell Wall Organization Virus infection altered gene expression in both upward and downward direction. Among the up-regulated genes (29%), cell wall degradation genes such as expansin, some cellulases and beta-1, 4-glucanases that are also involved in the SA-pathway ( Figure 5B and  Supplementary Table 7). In contrast, cell wall-related genes that were significantly down-regulated (25%) were cell wall modification enzymes as xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases and pectinesterase. In contrast, thrips feeding alone and combined treatment resulted in up-regulation of a large percentage of cell wall genes (37% for both;  Supplementary Table 7). This perturbation of cell wall gene expression shows that thrips feeding has a major impact on cell wall genes even in the absence of virus infection in host tissues. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis Focusing on the 369 DE genes associated with pathways of interest, the cluster analysis revealed more similar global gene expression patterns between TSWV infection alone and TSWV + thrips, and likewise, mock-inoculated and thrips alone treatments produced similar patterns ( Figure 6 and  Supplementary Table 8). Genes that were consistently up-regulated by virus alone or the dual treatment were protein metabolism genes such as E3 ubiquitin-ligase, 40S, 50S, and 60S ribosomal subunits (clusters 1, 5, and 6), but also involved genes with broad function in defense and phytohormone pathways, such as NPR1, PR-5 and EDS1 ( Supplementary Table 8). In contrast, virus alone and the dual treatment consistently down-regulated photosynthesis and cell wall functional categories such as chlorophyll a-b binding proteins, rhodanese-like domain-containing proteins and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases, respectively (clusters 2, 3, and 4). Interestingly, TSWV alone and the mock treatment showed similar trends in expression (down-regulation) of the genes in cluster 7, which was predominantly comprised of JA and ET pathway genes ( Figure 6). Moreover, in this cluster of genes, thrips activity alone resulted in an expression pattern (up-regulation) that was more similar to that of the dual treatment, which included defense and phytohormone related genes. Thrips activity largely down-regulated genes related to protein metabolism, photosynthesis and cell wall functional categories (clusters 1, 4, and 5). These results provide insights into correlation between biochemical pathways, including photosynthesis, protein metabolism, cell wall biogenesis and defense during single and dual attack by TSWV and the thrips vector. Reverse Transcription-Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) Validation of Microarray Hybridization Data Six genes associated with the SA, JA, and antiviral small-RNA-mediated gene silencing pathways that were determined to be differentially-expressed by the microarray hybridization experiment were further validated by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) ( Table 3). We included RNA-directed RNA polymerase 1 (RDR1), a key siRNA-pathway gene involved in the amplification of virus derived siRNAs that target viral dsRNAs for degradation, to examine antiviral defense. Overall, the average relative expression ratios of SA and JA marker genes, and RDR1 in response to virus infection alone or in combination with thrips mirrored the direction (positive or negative) of expression for the microarray analyses ( Table 3). Furthermore, pairwise comparisons of treatment averages obtained for the microarray and real-time RT-qPCR analyses revealed similar patterns among treatments ( Table 3). The normalized abundance (NA) of TSWV nucleocapsid (N) and silencing suppressor (NSs) RNA relative to leEF1 was also determined to estimate virus titer in leaf tissue. For virus infected plants (± thrips), there was a significant correlation (Pearson) ( r = 0.996,  P < 0.0001) between normalized abundance of N RNA and NSs RNA. Analysis of variance revealed significantly lower virus titers in leaves from TSWV-infected plants infested with  F. occidentalis compared to plants infected with TSWV alone ( Figure 7) (NSs RNA:  P = 0.006; N RNA:  P = 0.067), indicating that thrips infestation on infected leaves for 1 week significantly influenced virus accumulation. There were significant correlations ( n = 6) between TSWV titer and Log 2RER for NPR1 (NSs:  r = 0.941,  P = 0.005; N:  r = 0.935,  P = 0.006), and Cathepsin D (CI) inhibitor protein (NSs:  r = −0.877,  P = 0.022; N:  r = −0.897,  P = 0.015), an indication that expression of SA- and JA-associated transcripts may be quantitatively associated with the extent of TSWV infection (see  Supplementary Table 11 for log2RER values for plant RNA expression (OPR3, AOS, CI, NPR1, BGL, and RDR1) and normalized abundance values for viral RNAs (N, NSs) and the corresponding correlation matrix). Performance and Settling Behavior of Thrips The effect of TSWV infection of tomato plants on thrips performance (number of offspring) was evaluated 7-days after adult females were released onto individual plants. Our data revealed significant differences in the number of offspring (first and second instar larvae) produced on virus-infected plants compared to mock-inoculated plants ( F = 11.78, df = 1,  P = 0.003) ( Figure 1A). There was no impact of time or biological replication ( F = 1.73, df = 2,  P = 0.21) and the interaction between number of offspring and biological replication ( F = 0.03, df = 2,  P = 0.97) on thrips population. On average, there were twofold more thrips offspring on virus-infected plants compared to mock-inoculated plants (Mean ±  SE: 25.75 ± 2.02 and 13.50 ± 2.67, respectively). Leaf damage caused by thrips was quantified and no apparent differences were detected between thrips on healthy or virus-infected plants (leaf damage index:  P = 0.34; number of lesions:  P = 0.48, Kruskal–Wallis test;  Supplementary Table 1). In Petri dish assays, thrips adults were given a choice between TSWV-infected and mock-inoculated leaflets harvested from the greenhouse experiments. By 3 to 4-h post-release, there were significantly more thrips adults ( Z = 10.0,  P = 0.03 and  Z = 3.0,  P = 0.02, respectively) associated with TSWV-infected leaflets compared to mock-inoculated leaflets ( Figure 1B). This trend persisted over the course of the 72-h experiment. There were no apparent differences between the numbers of thrips observed between leaflets in the non-choice situation ( P > 0.2 for all time-points, data not shown). Gene Co-expression Network Analysis Network analysis was performed on WGCNA-generated modules of co-expressed genes ( Supplementary Table 10) to visualize connections among functional categories of interest (color coded) and differentially-expressed, annotated genes ( Supplementary Figure 1), with the knowledge that the modular structure of complex networks plays a critical role in their functionality. The result of our network analysis indicated that the gene co-expression network contains five tightly connected groups of gene sequences, whose expression is highly correlated. While photosynthesis is the predominant functional category in all of the modules, each of the groups contain genes from other functional categories, such as plant hormone-related (ABA, AUX, ET, JA, and SA), protein metabolism, cell wall organization and defense functions, thus illustrating the interconnectedness among primary biological processes significantly perturbed by the virus and vector, and co-regulation of genes involved in primary metabolism (photosynthesis, cell wall organization, and protein synthesis) and defense responses. TSWV Infection Increased Total Free Amino Acid Content As a measure of plant quality to the insect vector, we measured total free amino acid content to determine if TSWV infection altered the nutritional status of the host. There was a significant effect of time (biological replicate) ( F = 10.87, df = 2,  P = 0.0002) and treatment ( F = 4.25, df = 3,  P = 0.01) but not the interaction term ( F = 1.11, df = 6,  P = 0.37) on the total free amino acid content. Overall, TSWV infection alone and in combination with thrips feeding harbored greater total free amino acid content (Mean ±  SE: 288.64 ± 110.87 and 290.12 ± 64.85, respectively) compared to mock-inoculated and thrips –fed plants (Mean ±  SE: 164.03 ± 20.56 and 181.55 ± 25.23, respectively) ( Figure 8). Pathway Analysis Pathway analysis was performed on the microarray data to determine relative activities of five different phytohormone signaling pathways in modulating the TSWV-thrips interaction as per  Studham and MacIntosh (2012). The pathway analysis uses  q-values for each gene, magnitude and direction of fold change and assigns a role score based on Blast2GO and KEGG functional categories, then sums up their contributions to get the cumulative pathway score. Hence, it differs from an ANOVA that compares log2 (normalized hybridization intensity) of individual genes in the treatment relative to the control ( Supplementary Table 6). Four of the five pathways (SA, JA, ABA, and AUX) appeared to be modulated by TSWV-infection alone or in combination with thrips ( Table 2), however, plants infected with TSWV alone exhibited an overall negative effect (pathway score = −58.28) on the JA pathway. Thrips infestation on both non-infected and TSWV-infected plants activated the JA pathway, indication that the negative effect of TSWV alone on JA gene expression ( Figure 4B) was neutralized by the large positive effect of thrips feeding and/or oviposition on the JA pathway (pathway score = 40.02 and 56.99). Tomato plants singly-challenged by pathogen or pest exhibited an apparent negative co-regulation or cross-talk between the SA and JA pathways, however, under dual challenge, both SA and JA pathways were generally up-regulated, suggesting that other factors, possibly the large ABA effect in the dual treatment (pathway score = 76.36), modulated the SA-JA crosstalk. It was also apparent that virus infection, regardless of thrips infestation, stimulated the ABA pathway and suppressed AUX pathway-associated genes, and had a moderate effect on the ET pathway even after infestation with thrips, indication that the observed thrips-only effect on the ET pathway ( Table 2, pathway score = 40.01) was neutralized by TSWV infection (pathway score = 0.64) in the dual treatment. In total, our analysis revealed reciprocal modulation of key phytohormone pathways under dual attack. The phytohormone related genes used for this analysis are listed in  Supplementary Table 9. TSWV Infection Altered Phytohormone Levels To determine single and combined effects of virus infection and thrips activity on the levels of the signal molecules (i.e., phytohormones), we quantified the levels of SA, JA, JA-Ile, and OPDA in leaf tissues 7-days post thrips release. Same-age leaflets that were immediately basal (older) to the leaves harvested for microarray analysis were used for phytohormone analysis. TSWV infection alone or in combination with thrips enhanced SA content in tomato leaves ( Table 4). Thrips feeding had no apparent effect on any of the phytohormones at the time of sampling; however, the combined effect of TSWV and thrips resulted in significantly higher leaf contents of JA. There were no apparent differences among treatments with regards to JA-Ile or OPDA at the time of sampling ( Table 4). Single and Combined Effects of TSWV and Thrips on Tomato Global Gene Expression Profiles Tomato microarray hybridizations were performed to describe and quantify single and combined effects of virus and vector feeding on transcription-level expression. Collectively, of the 10,209 probe sets (i.e., 9,200 unique coding sequences) represented on the Tomato GeneChip, 1,722 sequences were differentially-expressed in plants challenged by the various treatments compared to mock-inoculated, healthy plants ( P < 0.05, regardless of magnitude of fold change). Of these sequences, 307, 171, and 424 genes were significantly expressed by at least twofold and  P ≤ 0.05 in TSWV, thrips, and TSWV + thrips challenged plants compared to the mock-inoculated controls ( Supplementary Tables 2– 4, respectively). Venn diagrams depicting the number of unique and shared genes that were differentially-expressed among treatments revealed several patterns ( Figures 2A,B and  Supplementary Table 5). First, only a small proportion of genes were unique to individual challengers. Second, systemic infection of tomato plants by TSWV contributed the most to global gene expression changes in both the positive (up-regulation) and negative (down-regulation) direction as compared to changes induced by thrips feeding. Third, the majority of genes differentially-expressed in response to thrips alone were down-regulated (64%). Fourth, the combined effect of TSWV and thrips resulted in a greater proportion of down-regulated genes that were unique to dual challenger (i.e., 32% down vs. 16% up) ( Figures 2A,B). The differentially-expressed genes were functionally-classified by Gene Ontology (GO) terms into biological process, cellular component and molecular function with relevance to plant health and responses. Overall, a greater proportion of genes responded to TSWV infection alone and combined treatment compared to thrips feeding alone in all three GO categories ( Figures 3A–C). The GO-biological process most represented by the differential expression was in response to stimulus, including biotic and abiotic stimulus ( Figure 3A). Within this category, a large percentage of genes were up-regulated in response to virus infection alone (74%) and the combination treatment (64%), whereas thrips feeding down-regulated a larger percentage of stress-related genes (63%). The second largest category was photosynthesis, and a majority of photosynthesis-associated genes (90%) were down-regulated in all three treatments. This trend is also reflected in GO cellular component category where chloroplast-associated genes were over-represented, and a large percentage (95%) were down-regulated across all three treatments ( Figure 3B). Another category of potential interest was cell wall organization, which was overrepresented in GO-cellular component and GO- biological process as well ( Figures 3A,B). Virus infection down-regulated 25% of cell wall related genes, but some genes were also up-regulated (14%). With regards to GO-molecular function, ATP binding genes were over-expressed, which agrees with the GO-CC category where cell membrane-associated genes were overrepresented ( Figure 3C). There was no trend in ATP binding genes in response to virus infection, in contrast, thrips feeding resulted in down-regulation of ATP binding genes (100%). The protein binding category was overrepresented, with virus infection in the single and combined treatment resulting in induction of protein binding genes (69 and 87%, respectively), whereas thrips feeding resulted in suppression of the genes (88%).","Several plant viruses modulate vector fitness and behavior in ways that may enhance virus transmission. Previous studies have documented indirect, plant-mediated effects of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) infection on the fecundity, growth and survival of its principal thrips vector,  Frankliniella occidentalis , the western flower thrips. We conducted thrips performance and preference experiments combined with plant gene expression, phytohormone and total free amino acid analyses to determine if systemically-infected tomato plants modulate primary metabolic and defense-related pathways to culminate into a more favorable environment for the vector. In a greenhouse setting, we documented a significant increase in the number of offspring produced by  F. occidentalis  on TSWV-infected tomato plants compared to mock-inoculated plants, and in choice test assays, females exhibited enhanced settling on TSWV-infected leaves. Microarray analysis combined with phytohormone signaling pathway analysis revealed reciprocal modulation of key phytohormone pathways under dual attack, possibly indicating a coordinated and dampening defense against the vector on infected plants. TSWV infection, alone or in combination with thrips, suppressed genes associated with photosynthesis and chloroplast function thereby significantly impacting primary metabolism of the host plant, and hierarchical cluster and network analyses revealed that many of these genes were co-regulated with phytohormone defense signaling genes. TSWV infection increased expression of genes related to protein synthesis and degradation which was reflected in the increased total free amino acid content in virus-infected plants that harbored higher thrips populations. These results suggest coordinated gene networks that regulate plant primary metabolism and defense responses rendering virus-infected plants more conducive for vector colonization, an outcome that is potentially beneficial to the vector and the virus when considered within the context of the complex transmission biology of TSWV. To our knowledge this is the first study to identify global transcriptional networks that underlie the TSWV-thrips interaction as compared to a single mechanistic approach. Findings of this study increase our fundamental knowledge of host plant-virus-vector interactions and identifies underlying mechanisms of induced host susceptibility to the insect vector."," 'Photosynthesis', 'Nutrition', 'phytohormones', 'Frankliniella occidentalis', 'Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus', 'Cell Wall Organization', 'Defense Crosstalk' "," 'Supplementary Table', 'TSWV infection', 'genes', 'Table', 'Thrips', 'TSWV', 'Supplementary', 'Figure', 'virus infection', 'infection' "," SA, SA, chorismate mutase, NPR1, NPR3, SA, JA-genes, JA-genes, JA, protease inhibitor, wound-induced proteinase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, ET, JA-related, heat shock proteins, GSTs, WRKYs, Myb, bZIP, Mitogen-activated kinase 6, SA, ABA, auxin, ABA-related, ABA-related, auxin, auxin, chaperone, chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins, 50S, 60S ribosomal subunits, 26S, beta-1,, 4-glucanases, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases, pectinesterase, E3 ubiquitin-ligase, 50S, 60S ribosomal subunits, NPR1, PR-5, EDS1, rhodanese-like domain-containing, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases, JA, RDR1, siRNA-pathway, SA, JA, RDR1, leEF1, NSs, Log 2RER, NPR1, NSs, Cathepsin D, −0.877, −0.897, SA-, log2RER, OPR3, AOS, CI, NPR1, BGL, RDR1, ±, ABA, JA, thrips –fed plants, 181.55 ±, JA, ABA, TSWV-infected plants, SA, JA, SA, JA, ABA, ABA, thrips-only, SA, ≤, functionally-classified, chloroplast-associated ",  ,  ,  ,NaN

Susceptible MOM and Resistant MOV Tomato Plants Display Different Volatile Chemical Composition upon Fol Infection Similarly, the analysis of the negative side of the PC1 loading plot allowed for identifying the VOCs emitted by the susceptible MOM tomato plants upon  Fol infection, showing the metabolites detailed in  Table S3 (MOV/MOM ratio < 1) and summarized in  Figure 4. Benzenoids and fatty acid derivatives were differentially over-emitted by the vulnerable plants. In the first group, methyl salicylate (MeSA) and ethyl salicylate (EtSA) were over-emitted at 7 and 14 dpi, respectively. On the other hand, the production of some aldehydes and ketones derived from the fatty acid degradation as 2-nonenal, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone, and 3-heptanone was induced during all of the infection process. However, 3-buten-2-one, butanal, and 2-butanone were emitted exclusively at the beginning of the infection process, and 2-pentanone at the end. The statistically significant and most over-emitted discriminant VOCs from the resistant MOV (MOV/MOM ratio ≥ 1.7) and the susceptible MOM (MOV/MOM ratio ≤ 0.8) tomato plants are summarized in  Figure 4. To identify the VOCs involved in the establishment of ETI, changes in the levels of these metabolites in mock-inoculated and  Fol-infected MOV and MOM tomato leaves were analyzed by GC-MS at 7 and 14 dpi. Based on the massive dataset obtained (11,505 detected peaks) from the chromatographic study, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. The first analysis revealed that both mock-inoculated isogenic lines constitutively emitted a different profile of VOCs ( Figure S2). These results could be due to the differences among both isogenic lines caused by the integration of the  I resistance gene in MOV plants. Consequently, the data set was normalized by the mean of the height ions from each mock-inoculated isogenic line to eliminate this metabolic difference, and a new analysis containing the normalized infected plants was performed ( Figure 4). The score plot of PCA clearly showed that the first component (PC1) explained changes in the chemical composition of the susceptible and resistant infected tomato plants (21% of variance), while the metabolic alteration during the time course of the experiment was clearly distinguished by the second component (PC2, 13% of variance). The analysis supported that different metabolites seem to be involved in the compatible and incompatible interaction and depending on time of infection. Analyzing the PC1 of the loading plot, the specific VOCs that strongly contributed to the separation of samples according to the interaction type were identified. The statistical volatiles differentially released during ETI establishment in resistant MOV tomato plants infected by  Fol were extracted from the positive part of PC1 and are listed in  Table S2 (MOV/MOM ratio > 1). Among them, some terpenoids were significantly emitted by resistant plants after 7 days of fungal inoculation: the monoterpene 3-carene, along with two aldehydic monoterpenoids and ( Z)-linalool oxide, two nor-isoprenoids (dihydroactinidiolide and β-ionone), and four sesquiterpenes (α-caryophyllene and three isoforms of elemene). In addition, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, 2,2-dimethyldecane, and three unknown compounds (unk 1–3) were the volatiles significantly over-emitted by the resistant tomato plants at the beginning of the infection. Interestingly, the volatile profile at 14 dpi was characterized by the emission of benzenoids and C5-fatty acid derivatives such as isobutylbenzene, benzeneacetaldehyde, methylbenzene, 5-ethyl-2-furanone, and ( E)-2-pentenal. Only the sesquiterpenes α- and β-caryophyllene were also significantly induced in the incompatible interaction together with the apocarotenoid geranylacetone, an unknown nitrogen compound (unk 2), the hydrocarbon 2,2-dimethyldecane, and the sulfur compound 2-ethylthiophene ( Figure 4). Particularly, α-caryophyllene, 2,2-dimethyldecane, and unk 2 were significantly over-emitted by MOV plants during all of the experiment. 2.1. Movione Tomato Plants Harbouring the I Resistance Gene Are Immune to Fol Infection To better quantify the differences between infected MOV and MOM plants, several morphological parameters were measured such as height, weight, the ratio between the hypocotyl length and the epicotyl length in reference to the height, as well as the water consumption per plant ( Table S1, Supplementary Materials). Infected tomato plants were classified according to their disease index   17  as a medium value out of the score of the symptoms from mild (1) to very severe (4) along the infection (see Materials and Methods). To characterize the establishment of the ETI, a symptomatology analysis of  Fol-inoculated Movione (MOV) tomato plants carrying the  I resistance gene was performed. Concurrently, Momor (MOM) tomato plants lacking the  I resistance gene were used to compare the fusarium wilt symptoms. As  Figure 1 shows, evident differences in symptom severity were observed between both isogenic lines at 14 days post-inoculation (dpi). To study the possible relationship between the observed symptoms and the presence of the pathogen,  Fol levels were analyzed in the hypocotyl of both infected isogenic lines at 7 and 14 dpi by qPCR, being statistically higher in MOM than in MOV plants at any time ( Figure S1), and correlating with the symptoms observed in  Figure 1. As  Figure 1C,D show, MOV displayed no phenotypical differences between mock- and  Fol-inoculated plants, confirming the establishment of ETI. On the contrary,  Fol-infected MOM plants were characterized by a height and weight reduction, yellowing of the leaves, browning of the xylem vessels, and even a total collapse of most plants, therefore confirming their susceptibility to  Fol ( Figure 1B). Finally, no differences between both non-inoculated isogenic lines were observed ( Figure 1A,C). As expected, a statistically significant reduction of height, weight, hypocotyl elongation, and symptom severity was observed between both isogenic lines, confirming the resistance of MOV tomato plants to  Fol infection. 2.2. Movione Tomato Plants Activate an Early JA-and ABA-Mediated Defense Response after Fol Infection The analysis of  JAZ7 (jasmonate ZIM-domain 7) ( Figure 2B), a gene related to the JA pathway   19 , showed similar results at the end of the fungal infection, while a statistically significant increase in the log(ratio) was found at 3 dpi (0.2) in the resistant MOV plants with respect to the susceptible MOM. To better characterize the infection in both isogenic lines, the activation of the main signaling defensive routes was studied. The expression levels of different marker genes corresponding to the pathways mediated by SA, JA, ET, or ABA, which are the most important phytohormones involved in plant defense, were analyzed by using RT-qPCR ( Figure 2) both in susceptible Momor (MOM) and resistant Movione (MOV) tomato plants after 3, 7, and 14 days of  Fol inoculation. To avoid possible differences between the Moneymaker isogenic lines, logarithm of the ratios (log(ratio)) of the relative expression levels between  Fol-infected and mock-inoculated plants were calculated; log(ratio) above 0 indicating a  Fol-provoked induction of the marker gene. Differences between the log(ratio) of MOM and MOV plants were observed for  LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) ( Figure 2D), a gene related to ABA   21 , with these differences being statistically significant at any time point. It should be noted that there was a significant induction of  LEA (0.5) at 3 dpi in the resistant MOV plants compared to the susceptible MOM. Nevertheless, a decrease in the expression pattern for these genes was found in MOV plants along the infection process. The expression of  PR1 (pathogenesis-related 1), which is the marker gene for SA-mediated plant response   18 , showed a statistically significant increase in the log(ratio) of the susceptible isogenic line when compared to the resistant plants, in accordance with the symptom development ( Figure 2A). Specifically, the log(ratio) of the induction of  Fol-infected MOM plants with respect to the mock MOM plants was 1-, 1.8-, and 2.2-fold at 3 dpi, 7 dpi, and 14 dpi, respectively. In contrast, MOV plants showed a log(ratio) below 0 at 3 dpi (−1.9) and 14 dpi (−0.8), thus indicating a  Fol-mediated downregulation of  PR1 in this resistant isogenic line. Our results suggest that the susceptible MOM plants activated all the main defense pathways along the infection, this response being late and insufficient to stop the disease progression in accordance with the symptom development. However, MOV plants were characterized by an early induction of the JA and ABA pathways, with an antagonistic effect on the SA and ET mediated response at 3 dpi, suggesting that the JA-and ABA-mediated responses could be effective enough to prevent the symptom development and to establish ETI. ACS2 (aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 2) expression was chosen to follow the ethylene-mediated signalling   20 . No relevant induction was found in the resistant MOV tomato plants upon fungal inoculation at any time point since the log(ratio) was negative (–0.8 at 3 dpi) or around 0 (0.1 at both 7 and 14 dpi) ( Figure 2C). However,  ACS2 was significantly induced in the  Fol-infected MOM plants during the pathogenic interaction, displaying a log(ratio) of 1.2, 0.9, and 2.2 at 3, 7, and 14 dpi, respectively. 2.3. Levels of Salicylic Acid and Abcisic Acid Are Enhanced in the Susceptible MOM Tomato Plants Infected by Fol Levels of the main defense phytohormones SA, ABA, and JA were analyzed in the MOM (susceptible) and MOV (resistant) tomato plants infected with  Fol in a time-course study.  Figure 3 represents the log(ratio) of the phytohormone accumulation between  Fol-infected and mock-inoculated plants in both MOM and MOV isogenic lines. A statistically significant accumulation of SA ( Figure 3A) and ABA ( Figure 3C) was observed in the compatible interaction at 7 dpi. At this time point, the SA and ABA log(ratio) in susceptible tomato plants was around 2.2 and 0.2, respectively, indicating that these phytohormones are involved in the plant response against  Fol. Besides, SA levels were significantly higher in the susceptible plants at the end of the fungal infection (14 dpi). According to the higher expression of  LEA observed at 3 dpi ( Figure 2D), a lower reduction of ABA levels was detected in resistant MOV plants at that time point. In contrast, an inverted pattern was detected for JA ( Figure 3B) in this interaction, observing a trend of JA accumulation at 3 dpi in the resistant MOV plants when compared to susceptible MOM. Although no statistical differences were detected in JA levels due to the high variability displayed, these results entirely agree with the  JAZ7 induction ( Figure 2B), therefore reinforcing the idea that an early activation of the JA pathway occurs in the resistant plants. On the contrary, SA accumulation is a distinctive feature of the susceptibility to  Fol, perfectly correlating with the  PR1 expression. 2.5. Fungal Infection Induces the Specific Expression of Genes Involved in VOC Biosynthesis Moreover, statistically significant differences between the log(ratio) of  TomloxC induction were measured at 7 dpi in the resistant MOV with respect to the susceptible MOM ( Figure 5A), in agreement with the further over-emission of ( E)-2-pentenal during ETI establishment at 14 dpi ( Figure 4), while no differences were found between both interactions at 3 dpi. Interestingly, the significantly higher log(ratio) of  TomloxD ( Figure 5C) and  AOS ( Figure 5F) in MOV at 3 dpi could explain the levels of JA accumulation at 3 dpi ( Figure 3B), as well as the overexpression of  JAZ7 ( Figure 2B) in this resistant isogenic line. Additionally, the differential terpene emission in the MOV immune plants was in accordance with the statistically significant higher levels of  MTS1 analyzed at 3 dpi and 7 dpi ( Figure 5G). A repression in both lines and times was observed for  SAMT1 gene, implicated in SA methylation, the downregulation being significantly lower in MOV than in MOM. To relate the differential volatile production with the transcriptional activation, the expression levels of several key genes involved in VOC biosynthesis were analyzed by RT-qPCR ( Figure 5). To study the genes involved in aldehydes, esters, and alcohols of 9-, 6-, and 5-carbons, and jasmonate biosynthesis, the possible activation pathway of fatty acid derivatives was analyzed. In this sense, the lipoxygenases (LOX) are a group of enzymes responsible for converting both linoleic and linolenic acids into 9- and 13-hydroperoxides which are cleaved by hydroperoxidelyases (HPL) to form the corresponding short-chain aldehydes and oxo-acids. Besides, the allene oxide synthase (AOS) produces jasmonate derivatives from 13-hydroperoxide   22 . Six genes which codify for lipoxygenases were described in tomatoes   23 .  TomloxA,  TomloxB, and  TomloxE codify for 9-LOX, which catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of 9C compounds, while  TomloxC,  TomloxD, and  TomloxF codify for 13-LOX involved in the formation of oxylipins. Specifically,  TomloxD is responsible for JA emission in the wound response, and  TomloxC and  TomloxF take part in the production of 5-carbon and 6-carbon volatiles, respectively. In addition to genes involved in fatty acid derivatives,  MTS1 and  SAMT1 were studied as marker genes for the biosynthesis pathways of terpenoids like monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, and benzenoids, respectively   22 . Log(ratio) of the relative expression levels of these genes between  Fol-infected and mock-inoculated plants in both MOM and MOV isogenic lines is represented in  Figure 5. A significant induction of the relative expression levels was observed for  TomloxA at 3 dpi ( Figure 5B), as well as for  TomloxF ( Figure 5D) and HPL ( Figure 5A) at 7 dpi in susceptible MOM with respect to resistant MOV plants, correlating with 2-nonenal and 2-hexanone emission in the compatible interaction at any time.","New strategies of control need to be developed with the aim of economic and environmental sustainability in plant and crop protection. Metabolomics is an excellent platform for both understanding the complex plant-pathogen interactions and unraveling new chemical control strategies. GC-MS-based metabolomics, along with a phytohormone analysis of a compatible and incompatible interaction between tomato plants and  Fusarium oxysporum  f. sp.  lycopersici,  revealed the specific volatile chemical composition and the plant signals associated with them. The susceptible tomato plants were characterized by the over-emission of methyl- and ethyl-salicylate as well as some fatty acid derivatives, along with an activation of salicylic acid and abscisic acid signaling. In contrast, terpenoids, benzenoids, and 2-ethylhexanoic acid were differentially emitted by plants undergoing an incompatible interaction, together with the activation of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway. In accordance with this response, a higher expression of several genes participating in the biosynthesis of these volatiles, such as  MTS1 ,  TomloxC,  TomloxD,  and  AOS , as well as  JAZ7 , a JA marker gene, was found to be induced by the fungus in these resistant plants. The characterized metabolome of the immune tomato plants could lead to the development of new resistance inducers against  Fusarium  wilt treatment."," 'Fusarium', 'Tomato', 'GC-MS', 'Volatiles', 'Natural products', 'Metabolomics', 'Biotic Interaction' "," 'MOV plants', 'Figure', 'Tomato Plants', 'MOV', 'Resistant MOV', 'Plants', 'MOM plants', 'MOM', 'Susceptible MOM', 'MOV Tomato' "," MOV (MOV/MOM ratio, ≤, PC2, β-ionone, 2,2-dimethyldecane, C5-fatty acid, 5-ethyl-2-furanone, β-caryophyllene, 2,2-dimethyldecane, 2,2-dimethyldecane, Momor (MOM) tomato, D, C, jasmonate ZIM-domain 7, log(ratio, SA, ABA, Momor (MOM), Movione (MOV) tomato, log(ratio, log(ratio, ABA, pathogenesis-related 1, log(ratio, log(ratio, log(ratio, −0.8, ABA, aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 2, log(ratio, –0.8, log(ratio, Abcisic Acid, ABA, JA, log(ratio, ABA, SA, ABA log(ratio, SA, ABA, JA, SA, log(ratio, log(ratio, JA, 9-, 5-carbons, LOX, 9-, hydroperoxidelyases (, Log(ratio ",  ,  ,  ,NaN

Southern blotting analysis was conducted to detect the copy number of  GmNES in the soybean genome and a single band was obtained (data not shown), suggesting that  GmNES exists as a single-copy gene. First, known monoterpene synthases (mono-TPSs) were used to screen the soybean expressed sequence tag (EST) database to identify homologous sequences. A 1106 bp EST contig for a putative mono-TPS was identified. To determine the 5′ and 3′ ends, multiple rounds of 5′ rapid identification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3′-RACE were performed, which resulted in 750 bp and 350 bp sequence fragments, respectively. Based on these two fragments and the previous partial sequence, PCR primers were then designed to amplify the full-length cDNA sequence, named  GmNES, which was deposited in GenBank (accession number JF758895).  GmNES encodes a predicted protein of 565 amino acids (aa), with a calculated molecular mass of 66 kDa and a predicted pI of 5.6. The cDNA sequence was further aligned with the soybean genome sequence ( http://www.phytozome.net), and the organization of the  GmNES gene was revealed, showing that the  GmNES gene maps to chromosome 13 and contains six exons and five introns with a total length of 3.7 kb. To characterize the sequence of  GmNES, the protein sequence of GmNES was aligned with the sequences of certain known plant monoterpene synthases. As shown in  Figure 1, GmNES contained a predicted N-terminal transit peptide-like sequence for chloroplast targeting   19  and a conserved DDxxD motif that is crucial for divalent cation (typically Mg 2+ or Mn 2+)-assisted substrate binding   20 . However, GmNES lacked the RRx 8W motif, which is characteristic of most monoterpene synthase members of the subfamily Tps-b   21  and is proposed to be involved in cyclizing monoterpene synthases. Based on recent research, the conserved RRx 8W motif is thought to be required for the use of GPP as a substrate   22 . However, this motif may not be required for the formation of acyclic monoterpenes. The Behavior of Cotton Leafworm is Influenced by Transgenic Plants Expressing GmNES Terpenes play an important role in plant defense by either attracting or repelling herbivores. In this study, GmNES exclusively used NPP as substrate to produce the monoterpene nerol, so, we overexpressed the  GmNES gene in tobacco to estimate the gene’s effect on the behavior of cotton leafworm (an important soybean pest in southern China). The preference of cotton leafworm for the detached leaves of transgenic and wild-type plants was investigated in a dual-choice assay ( Figures 7A, 7B). The results showed that over time, the cotton leafworm larvae significantly preferred the wild-type tobacco leaves to the  GmNES-expressing tobacco leaves ( Figure 7B). Subcellular Localization of GmNES Monoterpene synthesis is believed to primarily occur in plastids. GC-MS analysis revealed that GmNES acts as a monoterpene synthase. The presence of an N-terminal cTP predicted that GmNES is located in the chloroplast. To confirm the subcellular localization of GmNES, the  GmNES full-length cDNA was fused to  GFP and then transferred into tobacco by  Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. GFP expression was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( Figure 5). The GFP fluorescence of the GmNES::GFP fusion protein was observed exclusively in the chloroplast ( Figure 5A). The result confirmed the predicted plastid localization of GmNES. Transgenic Tobacco Plants Expressing the  GmNES Gene Produce Nerol To demonstrate the potential of tobacco for the heterologous expression of terpenes, a construct containing the  GmNES open reading frame under the control of the 35S promoter of  Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) was used for the transformation of tobacco. Transgenic plants were generated via the  Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method. Resistance to hygromycin was used for selecting putative transgenic plants. The hygromycin-resistant plants were further examined by PCR for the presence of the  GmNES gene ( Figure 6A) and by RT-PCR for the transcription of the  GmNES gene ( Figure 6B). Two leaves from each individual transgenic plant were screened for terpenoid emission. As expected, the leaves of wild-type tobacco did not produce any detectable nerol ( Figure 6C, wild-type tobacco); whereas, the transgenic lines showed varying levels of nerol emission ( Figure 6C, transgenic tobacco). The Growth of Cotton Leafworm is Significantly Inhibited by Feeding on Transgenic Tobacco Plants Expressing GmNES In addition to the dual-choice assay, a feeding test experiment was designed to further determine the influence of the monoterpene nerol on insects’ growth and development. The weight gain of cotton leafworm larvae feeding on the leaves of transgenic plants expressing  GmNES or wild-type plants served as the index for evaluation. The results showed that larvae feeding on transgenic tobacco plants grew less vigorously than their nontransgenic counterparts over time ( Figure 8C). The growth of cotton leafworm larvae was retarded, leading to lower weight gain ( Figure 8B). There was no significant differences between the four transgenic lines analyzed ( Figure 8C). Expression Profile Analysis of  GmNES To gain insight into the expression profile of  GmNES, we tested the expression of  GmNES in soybean leaves under different conditions, such as treatment with plant signaling molecules, mechanical wounding and feeding by cotton leafworm larvae. Transcripts of  GmNES greatly accumulated at 6 h after treatment with salicylic acid (SA) and then gradually decreased until the end of the experiment ( Figure 3A). Transcripts of  GmNES were induced at 12 h after cotton leafworm treatment ( Figure 3C). However, the expression profile induced by mechanical wounding was different, resulting in an induction of  GmNES transcription 4 h after wounding, which reached a peak of expression at 8 h, followed by a reduction ( Figure 3B). These results suggest that herbivore feeding, mechanical wounding and the application of exogenous SA stimulate the up-regulation of  GmNES expression, although with different transcript levels   16 . Functional Characterization of GmNES For the functional characterization of GmNES, a truncated cDNA fragment was subcloned into the pDEST-17 expression vector and then expressed in the  E. coli strain BL21-AI. The affinity-purified protein was assayed using three different prenyl diphosphate substrates: GPP, FPP and NPP. The products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). As shown in  Figure 4B, only assays with NPP as the substrate exclusively yielded a monoterpene hydrocarbon product, which was identified as nerol using authentic standards for the comparison of retention times ( Figures 4A, 4B) and mass spectra ( Figure 4F). In contrast, a control, which was prepared from  E. coli BL21-AI harboring pDEST-17 without the  GmNES insert, did not produce any monoterpene products ( Figure 4E). While GmNES recombinant enzyme was inactive when GPP or FPP was used as substrate ( Figures 4C, 4D), neither the vector control ( Figure 4E). Overall, these data indicate that GmNES is a monoterpene synthase that exclusively produces nerol in the presence of NPP.","Terpenes are important defensive compounds against herbivores and pathogens. Here, we report the identification of a new monoterpene synthase gene, GmNES, from soybean. The transcription of GmNES was up-regulated in soybean plants that were infested with cotton leafworm (Prodenia litura), mechanically wounded or treated with salicylic acid (SA). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that recombinant GmNES enzyme exclusively produced nerol, generated from a newly identified substrate for monoterpene synthase: neryl diphosphate (NPP). This finding indicates that GmNES is a nerol synthase gene in soybean. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions showed that GmNES localized to the chloroplasts. Transgenic tobacco overexpressing GmNES was generated. In dual-choice assays, the GmNES-expressing tobacco lines significantly repelled cotton leafworm. In feeding tests with transgenic plants, the growth and development of cotton leafworm were significantly retarded. This study confirms the ecological role of terpenoids and provides new insights into their metabolic engineering in transgenic plants.",NaN," 'GmNES', 'Figure', 'GmNES Gene', 'Cotton Leafworm', 'plants', 'Transgenic', 'tobacco', 'Transgenic Plants', 'Expressing GmNES', 'monoterpene' "," GmNES, GmNES, single-copy, 3′, 5′, 3′-RACE, JF758895, http://www.phytozome.net, GmNES, GmNES, peptide-like, Mg 2, GmNES, Tps-b  , GmNES, ’s, 7B, GmNES, GmNES, GmNES, GmNES, GFP, GFP, GmNES::GFP, GmNES, hygromycin, GmNES, SA, GmNES, GmNES, pDEST-17, affinity-purified, prenyl diphosphate, pDEST-17, GmNES recombinant enzyme, GmNES "," 'TPS-g', '(mono-TPSs)', 'mono-TPS' ", 'GmNES.' ,  ,terpene synthase
51,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7047219/eupmc_result.json,PMC7047219,"Results Composition and Abundance of Trichome Secretions on Two Chemotypes of LA2329 and on PI127826 and LA2167 Three major compounds,   1 ,   2 , and   3 , were present in  n-hexane leaf washes LA2329, chemotype A (LA2329-A) ( Figure 1). In contrast there was only one major component in washes of LA2329, chemotype B (LA2329-B) ( Figure 1). The presence of this qualitative difference in trichome secretion composition between the two chemotypes supports the idea that the synthesis of secondary metabolites is very different in the two chemotypes. Furthermore, the GC-FID tracings for trichome secretions from LA2167 and PI127826 demonstrated the presence of three compounds each having a retention time that was identical to one of the three components present in LA2329-A. This indicates that the secretion composition of PI127826 and LA2167 was more similar to that on LA2329-A than to that on LA2329-B. In terms of the quality of trichome secretions, the quality of the secretion from LA2329-A was nearly the same as the trichome secretion qualities on PI127826 and LA2167, and was very different from the quality of the secretion on LA2329-B. When data for component abundances were analyzed by ANOVA, abundance of   1  (F = 6.15, P = 0.029),   2  (F = 61.87, P < 0.0001), and   3  (F = 42.25, P = 0.0002) varied significantly among plants ( Figure 2).The abundance of   1  was highest in LA2329-A and PI127826, and lowest in LA2167. Concentration of   1  in LA2329-B was between these high and low concentrations. The abundance of   2  was highest in PI127826 and was not detected in LA2329-B. Concentrations of   2  in LA2329-A and LA2167 were significantly less than those observed on PI127826 and greater than that observed on LA2329-B. Abundance of   3  differed significantly among all four plants with concentration highest on LA2167 and not detected in LA2329-B. Based on the presence of significant differences of concentrations of   1 ,   2 , and   3  among these plants  supports the idea that metabolic differences among the four plants could lead to quantitative differences in their trichome secretions. Silica Gel Chromatography of LA2329 Chemotype A Oleoresin The three compounds were well separated by silica gel chromatography .  1  was present in fractions 3 to 6 at purities, judged by GC-FID, ranging from 90% to 98% and concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 µg/mL.   2  was present in fractions 32 to 37 at purities ranging from 78% to 86% and concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 4.5 µg/mL and   3  was present in fractions 50 to 53 at purities ranging from 83% to 87% and concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 µg/mL. Fractions for bioassay were chosen based on the purity of the fraction. This minimized the influence of the presence of non-target chemicals on the bioassay results. Thus, fractions 4 and 5 for   1 , fractions 33 and 34 for   2 , and fractions 51 and 52 for   3  were chosen for evaluation of repellency in the bridge bioassay. Repellent activity of the isolated   1  as judged by EC 50 and EC 90 values obtained with the bridge bioassay was highest of the three compounds evaluated, indicating that   1  was least repellent of the three compounds tested ( Table 3). EC 50 and EC 90 values for   2  and   3  were 5 to 10-fold less than that for   1 , indicating that these two oxygen-containing sesquiterpenoids were considerably more repellent than the hydrocarbon   1 . In other words, compared to   1 , much smaller doses of   2  or   3  were required to repel spider mites, compared to   1 . The EC 50 and EC 90 estimates from probit analysis of data had narrow fiducial limits and non-significant χ 2 values for lack of fit. Thus, the bioassays provided highly precise estimates of effective concentrations for the repellency of the tested compounds. Fiducial limits for the oxygen-containing sesquiterpenoids   2  and   3  did not overlap those for the hydrocarbon   1 , supporting the conclusion that   1  was less repellent in the bridge bioassay than the two oxygen-containing sesquiterpenoids,   2  and   3 . However, for these two sesquiterpenoids, fiducial limits did overlap, indicating that EC values and repellent activities of these two compounds,   2  and   3  were not differentiated by the bridge bioassay. In other words, the EC values and consequently the repellency of   2  and   3  were not separated statistically in this experiment. Repellent Activities of Oleoresins From LA2329 A and B Chemotypes When oleoresins obtained from the two LA2329 chemotypes, A and B, were evaluated with the bridge bioassay, EC 50 and EC 90 values for the oleoresin from the B chemotype were considerably greater than that for the A chemotype ( Table 1). In this assay, lower EC values indicate greater repellency so the EC value for the oleoresin having 3 major components from chemotype A (EC 50 = 0.00709 µg/cm²) indicated an approximately six-fold greater repellent activity than that for oleoresin from chemotype B containing a single component (EC 50 = 0.04791 µg/cm²). Identification of 7-Epi-Zingiberene, 9-Hydroxy-Zingiberene, and 9-Hydroxy, 10,11-Epoxy-Zingiberene in LA2329 Chemotype A Mass spectra of the three major compounds present in extracts of the A chemotype of LA2329 wild tomato accession showed a molecular ion (M+) at m/z 204 for   1 . For   2  the molecular ion (M+) was at m/z 220. And for   3 , the molecular ion (M+) was located at m/z 236. These outcomes were consistent with a sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (C15H24), and sesquiterpenoids having empirical formulas of C15H24O and C15H24O2, respectively ( Table 2 and  Figure 3). Identical spectra (99% match) and retention times were obtained for each of the three major compounds present in leaf washes obtained from PI127826 and LA2167. Because of a complete match of retention times and spectra among the three accessions for the three compounds, we concluded that the identities of the three peaks present in LA2329-A were 7-epi-zingiberene   1 , 9-hydroxy-zingiberene (  2 ), and 9-hydroxy-10,11-epoxy-zingiberene (  3 ).","Allelochemicals that are present in trichome secretions of wild tomato species play a major role in mediating interactions with arthropods, often conferring a high level of resistance via antibiosis and antixenosis. Many accessions of the wild tomato relative, Solanum habrochaites (S.h), possess high levels of resistance to arthropods. The monocyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, 7-epi-zingiberene, is a major defensive component found in trichome secretions of certain accessions of S.h. We have used LA2329, an S.h. accession, as a donor in a breeding program designed to introgress zingiberene into cultivated tomato. However, the composition of trichome secretions in our population of LA2329 is segregating, with some individuals producing mainly 7-epi-zingiberene in their secretions while others producing two additional, unidentified compounds in their trichome secretions. To investigate if these other compounds may also contribute to arthropod resistance, trichome secretions were collected from plants of S.h LA2329 grown under greenhouse conditions and then major compounds were isolated by silica gel column chromatography and tested for their ability to repel two spotted-spider mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae. Isolation and identification of allelochemicals were aided by use of gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The results revealed the presence of three predominate chromatographic peaks: 7-epi-zingiberene, 9-hydroxy zingiberene, and 9-hydroxy,10,11-epoxy-zingiberene. Results of testing isolated compounds for repellency to TSSM using bridge bioassays revealed that the repellent activities of 9-hydroxy zingiberene and 9-hydroxy,10,11-epoxy-zingiberene were each significantly higher than that for 7-epi-zingiberene. These results support the idea that the degree of repellency may differ among plant allelochemicals and also emphasize the potential value of introgressing the presence of 9-hydroxy zingiberene and 9-hydroxy,10,11-epoxy-zingiberene into cultivated tomato to enhance its arthropod resistance."," 'Insect resistance', 'Breeding', 'Tomato', 'Trichome', 'antixenosis', '7-Epi-zingiberene', '9-Hydroxy-zingiberene', 'Mite Repellency' "," 'Trichome Secretions', 'chemotype', 'secretion composition', 'compounds', 'Trichome', 'secretion', 'present', 'Chemotypes', 'Figure', 'concentrations' "," LA2329, LA2167, LA2329, LA2329, LA2329-B, LA2167, LA2329-A., LA2167, LA2329-B., LA2329-A, LA2167, PI127826, LA2167, LA2329-B, LA2329-B., LA2329-A, LA2167, LA2329-B., LA2167, LA2329-B., LA2329 Chemotype A, µg/mL.  , µg/mL, µg/mL., χ 2, LA2329 A, B Chemotypes When oleoresins, LA2329, B, 9-Hydroxy, 10,11-Epoxy-Zingiberene, LA2329 Chemotype A, LA2329, C15H24O, LA2167, LA2329-A ",  ,  ,  ,NaN

In this study, we focused on the immediate response to heat stress. Photosynthesis and volatile emissions were measured in the leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv.

Complete inhibition of A was observed at 49 °C, together with a simultaneous decrease in the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII, measured as the Fv/Fm ratio. A large increase in volatile emissions was observed at 52 °C. Heat stress resulted in only minor effects on the emission of monoterpenes, but volatiles associated with membrane damage such as propanal and (E)-2-hexenal+(Z)-3-hexenol were greatly increased. Heat induced changes in the levels of methanol and 2-ethylfuran that are indicative of modification of cell walls.

53,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6110934/eupmc_result.json,PMC6110934,"Results O. pratensis and  T. urticae Cause Similar Patterns of Tissue Damage To assess responses of barley (cultivar Morex) and maize (inbred B73) to specialist and generalist spider mite herbivores, we examined transcriptomic responses to  O. pratensis and  T. urticae feeding at 2 and 24 h. As the magnitude of wounding can impact interpretation of transcriptomic responses, we first assessed the extent of plant tissue damage from both mite species. For  O. pratensis and  T. urticae, and for barley and maize, macroscopic damage from mite feeding at 24 h consisted of fine white stippling ( Figure   1A and  Supplementary Figure   2). For both plant hosts and for both mite herbivores, significant plant damage was observed compared to uninfested leaves following damage quantification from leaf scans ( P < 0.05, ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD method to correct for multiple tests;  Figures   1B,C). At 24 h, areas of stippling caused by  O. pratensis and  T. urticae on barley were not significantly different ( Figure   1B). In contrast, a significant albeit modest increase in damage was observed for maize leaves infested with  T. urticae relative to those exposed to  O. pratensis ( Figure   1C). It should be noted, however, that the sample size, and hence power to detect an effect, was larger for maize; this was a function of performing maize studies in a large greenhouse as opposed to a growth chamber as was used for barley (see the section “Materials and Methods”). We also examined the microscopic pattern of damage caused by  O. pratensis and  T. urticae on barley leaves, for which the even epidermis is straightforward to image with differential interference contrast and fluorescence microscopy in cleared tissue. For both mite species, clusters of mesophyll cells were empty at feeding sites (or minimally, were devoid of chloroplasts that are dark in appearance;  Figure   1D). The overlying epidermis, in which cells lack chloroplasts, nonetheless appeared to be intact as assessed by the presence of propidium iodide stained nuclei in pavement cells. Spider Mite Herbivores Induce Similar Transcriptomic Responses on Barley and Maize We used DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014) to detect DEGs – as assessed with a FDR-adjusted  P-value of 0.01 and an absolute value log 2 fold change cutoff of 1 – between treatments and controls for barley and maize ( Figures   2C,D, respectively; results of DEG analyses for all comparisons are given in  Supplementary Data Sheet   3 for barley and  Supplementary Data Sheet   4 for maize). In response to feeding by both  O. pratensis and  T. urticae, hundreds and thousands of DEGs were detected in both barley and maize at 2 and 24 h, respectively. In contrast to the 2-h time point, for which nearly all expression changes involved upregulation, both up- and downregulation were observed at 24 h. To examine transcriptomic responses to herbivory by  O. pratensis and  T. urticae, we collected plant tissue from within leaf enclosures at 2 and 24 h after mite infestation. Quantification of gene expression from alignments of the resultant RNA-seq reads from four biological replicates for controls and treatments revealed that 21,472 of 26,066 (82.4%) high-quality barley genes were expressed (i.e., had non-zero read counts), as were 30,279 of 39,625 (76.4%) high-quality genes in maize (see the section “Materials and Methods”). Nonetheless, at the quantitative level,  O. pratensis induced modestly stronger transcriptomic responses than did  T. urticae, as assessed by the magnitude of fold changes, in barley at 24 h ( Figure   3B). Likewise, in maize at the 2-h time point, a similar pattern was observed for the grass specialist ( Figure   3C). These trends were also apparent in measurements of the activity of peroxidase, which has been reported to increase in response to  T. urticae herbivory in several dicots ( Hildebrand et al., 1986;  Liang et al., 2017). In both barley and maize at 24 h, herbivory by both  O. pratensis and  T. urticae elevated peroxidase activity relative to control leaves ( P < 0.05, ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test;  Figure   4). Paralleling the difference in the relative magnitude observed for gene expression responses in barley ( Figure   3B), including for genes encoding peroxidase enzymes ( Supplementary Figure   4),  O. pratensis induced significantly greater peroxidase activity compared to  T. urticae at 24 h ( Figure   4A). As assessed with a principal component analysis (PCA) using controls and all treatments, biological replicates were tightly clustered ( Figures   2A,B). For the 2-h time point, replicates for both  O. pratensis and  T. urticae clustered nearby but were separate from controls in both barley and maize. A similar but more distinct pattern was observed at 24 h. Although dramatic differences in plant responses to the two mite species were not readily apparent for most contrasts,  O. pratensis replicates at 24 h clustered farther away from control samples in barley than did those for  T. urticae, albeit along the same PCA axis. The partial overlap of DEGs between mite treatments ( Figures   2C,D) raised the possibility that components of plant defense responses to the generalist and specialist mites differed. To investigate this further, we generated scatter plots of log 2 fold changes for genes responding to mite herbivory at the 2- and 24-h time points for combinations of plant and mite species ( Figure   3). Consistent with the PCAs ( Figures   2A,B), transcriptomic responses to feeding by  O. pratensis and  T. urticae were highly correlated at both time points in each species ( R2-values between 0.8 and 0.9, all  P-values < 10 -16;  Figure   3). Our findings, therefore, revealed no compelling evidence for large-scale, qualitative differences in plant gene expression responses between the specialist and generalist mites. Upregulation of Defensive Proteins Expression of protease inhibitors and chitinases has been shown to retard the growth of insects, spider mites, or both ( Lawrence and Novak, 2006;  Carrillo et al., 2011;  Santamaría et al., 2012), and about half of cysteine protease inhibitors (cystatins) and serine protease inhibitors were expressed in barley or maize leaves in controls or treatments ( Supplementary Data Sheets   3,  4, respectively). In barley, no cystatin genes changed in expression in response to herbivory by  O. pratensis or  T. urticae, although two genes were moderately upregulated in response to wounding at 2 h ( Supplementary Figure   9A). In contrast, eight maize cystatin genes were modestly upregulated, primarily at 24 h, in response to  O. pratensis or  T. urticae herbivory ( Supplementary Figure   9A). Most of these were also upregulated at either 2 or 24 h in response to wounding. As opposed to the pattern observed for cystatins, higher-fold upregulation of serine protease inhibitors was observed in leaves of both plant hosts in response to feeding by  O. pratensis and  T. urticae. Among the upregulated genes were several previously reported to be responsive to wounding or JA signaling, including  WOUND INDUCED PROTEIN1 ( WPI) and  MAIZE PROTEASE INHIBITOR ( MPI) ( Eckelkamp et al., 1993;  Rohrmeier and Lehle, 1993;  Tamayo et al., 2000) ( Supplementary Figure   9B). A pattern shared with the cystatins in maize was that serine protease inhibitor genes were upregulated at the 24-h time point (or if they were significantly induced at 2 h, induction was higher at 24 h). Most serine protease inhibitors induced by mite herbivory were upregulated by wounding at 2 or 24 h. Twenty-one chitinase genes changed in expression in response to herbivory by  O. pratensis or  T. urticae, or wounding, in maize ( Supplementary Figure   10A). The majority of genes were upregulated, many at 24 h only, although  GRMZM2G129189,  GRMZM2G145461, and  GRMZM2G162359 were induced at both time points. The upregulated genes belonged to several glycoside hydrolase families that hydrolyze chitin (GH-18 and GH-19) ( Hawkins et al., 2015). A similar pattern of dynamic responses of chitinase genes to mite herbivory and wounding was also apparent for barley ( Supplementary Figure   10B). Genes Required for the Production of Volatile Plant Compounds Are Induced by Mite Herbivory In addition to green leaf volatiles and methyl salicylate (MeSA) – volatile organic compounds whose biosynthesis genes were either constitutively expressed or induced by mite herbivory ( Figure   6 and  Supplementary Figure   8) – terpenes are well-characterized herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that mediate plant responses to herbivory, including indirect defenses ( Kessler and Baldwin, 2002;  Singh and Sharma, 2015). In maize, the  TERPENE SYNTHASE ( TPS) genes  TPS10,  TPS2, and  TPS3 were highly induced at 2 h in response to  O. pratensis and  T. urticae, as well as by wounding (each gene remained induced at 24 h;  Supplementary Figure   11). Additionally, 14 other putative maize  TPS genes were induced with lesser fold changes, primarily at 24 h, in response to mite herbivory, or at 2 h in response to wounding. Patterns were similar for barley  TPS genes including  MLOC_56812 and  MLOC_76989, which were strongly induced by  O. pratensis and  T. urticae herbivory at both time points, and  MLOC_13618 at 24 h. In maize, TPS2 and TPS10 synthesize multiple products. For TPS2, two products are (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-geranyllinalool, which are subsequently converted to the homoterpenes (E)-3,8-dimethyl-1,4,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT), respectively. Recently,  Richter et al. (2016) implicated the cytochrome P450 genes  CYP92C5 and  CYP92C6 in the final step for the production of DMNT and TMTT. Both genes were induced in response to mite herbivory at 2 or 24 h, and  CYP92C5 was upregulated by wounding at 2 h ( Supplementary Figure   11). In maize,  IGL is responsible for volatile indole, which is inducible by an insect trigger, and was recently shown to prime defenses within and between maize plants ( Erb et al., 2015). In response to herbivory by  O. pratensis and  T. urticae in maize,  IGL was modestly upregulated at 24 h (log 2 fold changes ∼2) but not at 2 h; in the wounding treatment,  IGL was upregulated by a similar fold change at 2 h, but was not significantly changed in expression at 24 h ( Supplementary Data Sheet   4). A Functional Benzoxazinoid Pathway Deters the Generalist but Not the Specialist Mite Herbivore In the W22 maize inbred,  Ds transposon insertions have been recovered in three genes responsible for DIMBOA-Glc synthesis –  BX1,  BX2, and  BX6 ( Tzin et al., 2015a). For  O. pratensis, reproductive performance, as assessed by the number of progeny per female, did not differ significantly following infestation of wild-type and  bx mutant plants (ANOVA,  P = 0.313;  Figure   7C). In contrast, for  T. urticae stark differences were observed (ANOVA,  P < 10 -7;  Figure   7D). While the number of  T. urticae progeny did not differ between wild-type (W22) and  bx6::Ds plants, significantly more progeny were observed on both  bx1::Ds and  bx2::Ds plants compared to wild-type, and significantly more progeny were observed on  bx2::Ds compared to  bx1::Ds plants ( P < 0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons with Tukey’s HSD method). Domesticated varieties of barley, including the cultivar Morex used in our study, lack benzoxazinoids ( Glawischnig et al., 1999;  Niemeyer, 2009). In maize, however, at least 14 genes are involved in the benzoxazinoid biosynthesis pathway, and several participate at multiple steps, as shown in  Figure   7A (the schematic of the pathway is after  Tzin et al., 2017). In B73, the  BX12 gene is disrupted, although HDMBOA-Glc can still be produced ( Meihls et al., 2013). In all cases, genes for the synthesis of DIMBOA-Glc were expressed in control B73 tissue, with  BX1 and  BX2 having the lowest expression levels ( Figure   7B). In response to herbivory by either  O. pratensis or  T. urticae, six of the genes needed for synthesis of DIMBOA-Glc were induced weakly at 24 h ( Figure   7B;  BX6 was also differentially expressed at 2 h in response to  O. pratensis, albeit with a small fold change). Seven of these genes were also induced weakly by wounding at 2 h, but none remained upregulated at 24 h post-wounding. In contrast to genes needed for DIMBOA-Glc synthesis, those for the modification of DIMBOA-Glc to produce HDMBOA-Glc and HDM2BOA-Glc had very low basal expression levels in control tissue ( Figure   7B). However, two genes involved in the production of HDMBOA-Glc,  BX10 and  BX11, were dramatically upregulated in response to  O. pratensis and  T. urticae herbivory as well as wounding at 2 h, and remained strongly induced at 24 h. Two other genes,  BX13 and  BX14 that are needed for the production of HDM2BOA-Glc, were also induced by mite herbivory, but with upregulation only observed at 24 h; in response to wounding,  BX13 was also upregulated at 24 h, albeit only moderately. We also compared the relative upregulation of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis genes in response to spider mite herbivory at 24 h to those reported for  S. exigua feeding at the same time point ( Tzin et al., 2017). Although different stage plants were used (see the section “Discussion”), genes for the synthesis of DIMBOA-Glc (e.g.,  BX1 and  BX2) were less strongly induced by spider mites, while those for the conversion of DIMBOA-Glu to HDMBOA-Glc and HDM2BOA-Glc (especially  BX10 and  BX11) were induced strongly by both mites as well as the caterpillar herbivore ( Supplementary Table   4). Defense Pathways That Respond to Mite Herbivory in Barley and Maize We also examined whether the composition of analogous clusters between barley and maize was enriched in orthologous genes, which would suggest common response pathways. To do this, we identified 14,087 genes as orthologs between barley and maize as assessed with a reciprocal best BLASTP hit analysis. For each of clusters 1–6, orthologous gene pairs were enriched between barley and maize (all  P-values < 10 -12 as determined with hypergeometric tests;  Supplementary Table   3). To further characterize gene expression changes across treatments, time points, and plant hosts, we performed  k-means clustering in barley and maize using expression levels for all genes significantly differentially expressed in at least one treatment. For  k = 6, and as assessed subsequently with hierarchical clustering ( Figure   5A), analogous clusters with similar patterns of RNA abundances were readily observed between barley and maize ( Figure   5B). Clusters 1–5 contain genes that were mostly upregulated in response to either herbivory or wounding, whereas genes in cluster 6 were mostly downregulated ( Figures   5A,B; clusters 4 and 5, which contain genes with relatively modest fold changes, are shown in  Supplementary Figure   6). To relate genes in clusters to biological functions, we performed a GO enrichment analysis for BPs as implemented in the topGO package ( Alexa et al., 2006). Significantly enriched GO terms for all clusters for both barley and maize are given in  Supplementary Tables   1,  2, respectively. This analysis revealed that herbivory by  O. pratensis and  T. urticae, as well as wounding, led to a general switch in transcriptomic programs from processes such as development to those associated with response to the environment. For example, cluster 6, representing mostly downregulated genes in the treatments, was enriched for GO terms related to photosynthesis and development. In contrast, clusters with genes upregulated in response to mite herbivory or wounding, such as clusters 1 and 2, were enriched for GO terms associated with abiotic or biotic defense responses in barley, maize, or both. These included ontology terms such as “JA biosynthetic process,” “response to JA,” “response to SA,” “response to fungus,” “response to wounding,” and “hyperosmotic salinity response.” Of the genes in the six clusters, fold changes for those in cluster 1 were most dramatic with respect to mite feeding across the time course (strong upregulation at 2 h, and even greater upregulation at 24 h). Genes in this cluster were also highly upregulated in response to wounding, especially at 2 h. A reduced correspondence between the magnitude of gene expression changes to mite feeding and wounding was observed in other clusters (e.g., clusters 2 and 3). Genes for JA Biosynthesis and Signaling Respond Rapidly to Mite Herbivores and Wounding Lipoxygenases (LOXs) catalyze the production of oxylipins, which are involved in multiple aspects of plant defense ( Borrego and Kolomiets, 2016). The first step in the JA biosynthesis pathway is the production of the oxylipin 13( S)-hydroperoxylinolenate (13-HPOT) from α-linolenic acid. Putative LOXs for catalyzing this reaction belong to the 13-LOX group, of which maize has five ( LOX7,  8,  9,  10,  11,  13) ( Borrego and Kolomiets, 2016). Of these, all but  LOX11 were induced at one or more time points, albeit with modest fold changes. As assessed by normalized expression values (FPKMs), basal levels of  LOX10 were ∼90-fold higher than for other 13-LOX genes, consistent with its role in the production of green leaf volatiles ( Christensen et al., 2013), which are abundant in grasses. The next two steps in JA synthesis involve the conversion of 13-HPOT to 12,13( S)-epoxylinolenic acid (12,13-EOT), followed by cyclization to yield 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (12-OPDA) ( Borrego and Kolomiets, 2016). Differential expression was also observed for putative genes mediating these steps, including the upregulation of four  ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE ( AOS) genes and two  ALLENE OXIDE CYCLASE ( AOC) genes, respectively. As compared to  13-LOX and  AOC genes, the  AOS genes were more highly upregulated at both 2- and 24-h time points. This included genes in the  AOS1 clade, but also genes in clade 2 for which a role in JA biosynthesis is uncertain ( Borrego and Kolomiets, 2016). The next step in JA synthesis involves the conversion of 12-OPDA to 3-oxo-2-( cis-2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC-8:0), which is mediated by oxophytodienoate reductase (OPR). In maize, this step requires the products of  OPR7 and  OPR8, for which JA levels are dramatically reduced in tissues of the double mutant, including in leaves ( Yan et al., 2012). One of these genes,  OPR7, was modestly upregulated at 24 h in response to mite herbivory. The conjugation of JA to isoleucine, which is carried out by the JASMONATE RESISTANT1 (JAR1) protein in  A. thaliana ( Staswick, 2002), produces JA-Ile, the most biologically active form of JA in plants ( Koo and Howe, 2012). One maize gene encoding a JAR protein,  JAR2a, was weakly downregulated at 24 h after  T. urticae feeding, mirroring its downregulation in response to  S. exigua herbivory ( Tzin et al., 2017). The GO enrichment analysis suggested a prominent role for phytohormone signaling in responses to both mite herbivores and wounding. Therefore, we adapted the Hormonometer tool ( Volodarsky et al., 2009) to relate mite- and wounding-induced changes in gene expression to those induced by diverse phytohormones. As displayed in dendrograms for both plant hosts ( Figures   6A,B), changes in most phytohormone response pathways were readily apparent by 2 h in response to herbivory by  O. pratensis and  T. urticae, as well as wounding. In general, patterns of up- or downregulation for plant hormone responsive genes were similar between barley and maize, and at 24 h responses were generally attenuated. Response genes for JA, SA, ABA, and auxin were most dramatically upregulated, while response genes associated with ethylene, GA, cytokinin, and brassinosteroid signaling were either downregulated, variable, or largely unaffected. Collectively, gene expression changes for JA biosynthesis and downstream responses were induced similarly between  O. pratensis and  T. urticae, with patterns at 2 and 24 h essentially identical where strong differential gene expression was observed (e.g., for most  LOX,  AOS, and  JAZ genes). Further, responses to wounding at 2 h closely mirrored those of responses to mite herbivory ( Figure   6C). While we focused on the JA pathway in maize, for which more is known, an analysis of putative orthologs in barley revealed similar responses ( Supplementary Figure   7). Finally, mirroring our analysis of genes involved in JA signaling, we performed a similar one for SA, another key plant hormone mediating biotic interactions. Many candidate genes for SA biosynthesis ( Martel et al., 2015;  Tzin et al., 2015a) were upregulated in response to mite herbivory and wounding at both the 2- and 24-h time points. Examples from maize included genes encoding putative prephenate dehydratases ( GRMZM2G437912 and  GRMZM2G125923), Phe ammonia-lyase  (GRMZM2G063917), and  trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenases ( GRMZM2G147245 and  GRMZM2G010468) ( Supplementary Figure   8). Because of the strong JA responses, and functional-genetic studies demonstrating a role for JA signaling in deterring  T. urticae feeding on  A. thaliana and tomato ( Zhurov et al., 2014;  Martel et al., 2015), we characterized transcriptomic responses of this pathway further. While the JA pathway is well characterized in dicots, less about it is known in monocots. However, candidate genes for JA biosynthesis, signal transduction, and mediation of transcriptional changes have been identified in maize ( Borrego and Kolomiets, 2016), and genetic studies provide functional evidence for the involvement of several of these genes in JA biosynthesis and signaling ( Yan et al., 2012;  Tzin et al., 2017). Initially, we focused our analysis on the JA pathway in maize ( Figure   6C), describing general patterns of responses to both mite species as induced gene expression is highly correlated between them ( Figure   3). To assess JA signaling, we examined expression changes for genes downstream of JA-Ile, including ones that were identified as not being inducible (or being less induced) in response to wounding in  OPR7/ 8 double mutant maize plants ( Yan et al., 2012;  Borrego and Kolomiets, 2016). Many of these genes increased in expression in response to mite feeding, albeit moderately (i.e., the transcriptional regulators  MYC7,  WRKY14, and  WRKY46). Nevertheless, genes in several families showed dramatic upregulation. For instance,  JAZ3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8, and  12 were strongly upregulated at both the 2- and 24-h time points. Further, members of the 9-LOX clade, including  LOX3,  4, and  5, were also upregulated at both time points, with  LOX3 and  5 exhibiting strong upregulation at 24 h.  LOX1, which encodes a dual activity lipoxygenase (13-LOX and 9-LOX) of unknown function ( Borrego and Kolomiets, 2016), was also upregulated at both time points. Comparison of Plant Responses Induced by Mites to Those Induced by Mechanical Wounding While mechanical wounding cannot fully replicate the intricacies of physical damage caused by herbivores ( Howe and Jander, 2008), our wounding treatment, which consisted of gently pressing leaf blades with sandpaper, mimicked the dispersed nature of spider mite damage to plant leaves ( Figure   1A and  Supplementary Figure   2). As assessed by PCAs, at 2 h wounding treatments in both barley and maize clustered separately and further from controls compared to the mite treatments, and more genes were differentially regulated ( Figure   2). In contrast, at 24 h, biological replicates for wounding treatments clustered nearer control samples in both barley and maize, and fewer genes were detected as differentially expressed compared to wounding at 2 h, or to  O. pratensis and  T. urticae feeding at 24 h ( Figure   2). However, despite differences in the number of DEGs between the wounding and mite feeding treatments, the direction of changes in gene expression and their fold-induction were correlated in both barley and maize between wounding and mite feeding at 2 as well as 24 h ( R2-values between 0.12 and 0.52, with all  P-values < 10 -15;  Supplementary Figure   5).","While substantial progress has been made in understanding defense responses of cereals to insect herbivores, comparatively little is known about responses to feeding by spider mites. Nevertheless, several spider mite species, including the generalist  Tetranychus urticae  and the grass specialist  Oligonychus pratensis , cause damage on cereals such as maize and wheat, especially during drought stress. To understand defense responses of cereals to spider mites, we characterized the transcriptomic responses of maize and barley to herbivory by both mite species, and included a wounding control against which modulation of defenses could be tested.  T. urticae  and  O. pratensis  induced highly correlated changes in gene expression on both maize and barley. Within 2 h, hundreds of genes were upregulated, and thousands of genes were up- or downregulated after 24 h. In general, expression changes were similar to those induced by wounding, including for genes associated with jasmonic acid biosynthesis and signaling. Many genes encoding proteins involved in direct defenses, or those required for herbivore-induced plant volatiles, were strongly upregulated in response to mite herbivory. Further, biosynthesis genes for benzoxazinoids, which are specialized compounds of Poaceae with known roles in deterring insect herbivores, were induced in maize. Compared to chewing insects, spider mites are cell content feeders and cause grossly different patterns of tissue damage. Nonetheless, the gene expression responses of maize to both mite herbivores, including for phytohormone signaling pathways and for the synthesis of the benzoxazinoid 2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside, a known defensive metabolite against caterpillars, resembled those reported for a generalist chewing insect,  Spodoptera exigua . On maize plants harboring mutations in several benzoxazinoid biosynthesis genes,  T. urticae  performance dramatically increased compared to wild-type plants. In contrast, no difference in performance was observed between mutant and wild-type plants for the specialist  O. pratensis . Collectively, our data provide little evidence that maize and barley defense responses differentiate herbivory between  T. urticae  and  O. pratensis . Further, our work suggests that the likely route to specialization for  O. pratensis  involved the evolution of a robust mechanism to cope with the benzoxazinoid defenses of its cereal hosts."," 'Hordeum vulgare', 'Maize (Zea mays L.)', 'Tetranychus urticae', 'Herbivore', 'Hdmboa', 'Spider Mite', 'Benzoxazinoid', 'Oligonychus Pratensis' "," 'Supplementary Figure', 'Figure', 'genes', 'mite herbivory', 'response', 'maize', 'mite', 'Supplementary', 'barley', 'responses' "," Tukey’s HSD, C, “, ”, DESeq2, D, DEG, RNA-seq, 39,625, “, ”, peroxidase, peroxidase, Tukey’s HSD, peroxidase enzymes, peroxidase, protease inhibitors, cystatins, serine protease, cystatin, cystatin, cystatins, higher-fold, serine protease, cystatins, serine protease inhibitor genes, serine protease, chitinase, glycoside hydrolase, chitin, GH-19, chitinase, MeSA) –, TPS10, (E)-nerolidol, (E, E)-geranyllinalool, cytochrome P450, Erb, ∼2, 2015a, Tukey’s HSD, HDM2BOA-Glc, HDM2BOA-Glc, “, ”, HDM2BOA-Glc, -12, BPs, 2, “JA, ” “, ” “, SA, ” “, ”, “hyperosmotic salinity, ”, LOXs, S)-hydroperoxylinolenate (13-HPOT, LOXs, LOX7, LOX11, ∼90-fold, cis-2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid, oxophytodienoate reductase, JAR1, JA, mite-, wounding-induced, SA, ABA, auxin, GA, cytokinin, JA, SA, 2015a, prephenate dehydratases, GRMZM2G437912, GRMZM2G063917, GRMZM2G147245, lipoxygenase ( "," 'TPS)', 'TPS10,', 'TPS2,', 'TPS3', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS2', 'TPS10', 'TPS2,' "," 'S.', 'S.'

It encodes an enzyme that uses neryl diphosphate to produce beta-phellandrene as the major product as well as a variety of other monoterpenes. The profile of monoterpenes produced by PHS1 is identical with the monoterpenes found in type VI glands. PHS1 and NDPS1 map to chromosome 8, and the presence of a segment of chromosome 8 derived from Solanum pennellii LA0716 causes conversion from the M82 gland monoterpene pattern to that characteristic of LA0716 plants.

55,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6437863/eupmc_result.json,PMC6437863,"Results Elevated antioxidant enzyme activity under multiple stress treatments The phytohormones JA and SA play crucial roles in regulating the defensive signaling network by elevating the levels of ROS   51,  52 . Moreover, the mechanism by which terpenes alleviate abiotic stress suggests a general antioxidant mechanism by which harmful ROS can be quenched by reacting with unsaturated isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes   38 . In our study, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a key contributor in the conversion of O − to H 2O 2 in the presence of elevated levels of ROS, increased significantly under all treatments, except for a decrease in leaves exposed to 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity (approx. 250 μmol m − 2 s − 1) (Fig.  9a). Catalase (CAT) plays an important role in the antioxidant system because it enables plants to eliminate H 2O 2 by converting H 2O 2 into O 2 and H 2O (Miller et al., 2008). CAT activity was strongly elevated by these two elicitors. When the three tissues were exposed to temperature and light stresses, CAT activity was upregulated, the only exception being a slight decreased in leaves in response to high light intensity (Fig.  9b). Similarly, peroxidase (POD), which detoxifies H 2O 2 in the chloroplasts and cytosol of plant cells, also constitutes the main H 2O 2-scavenging system in cells   53 . POD activity increased in all treatments and roots had two-fold higher POD activity than leaves (Fig.  9c). Conversely, SOD and CAT activities were relatively higher in leaves than in stems and roots, independent of whether they were treated or untreated, suggesting differential endogenous activities of SOD, CAT or POD among different tissues. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) plays a key role in protecting plants against oxidative stress by scavenging H 2O 2 in different cell compartments   54 . As shown in Fig.  9d, APX activity increased significantly in most tissues under MeJA, SA, cold, heat and high light intensity treatments. Thus, the increase in SOD, CAT, POD and APX activities indicate that  S. album seedlings respond to external stresses to protect cellular membranes against oxidative stress, suggesting that these enzymes play roles in tolerance to elicitors and environmental stresses in  S. album. In addition, the effect of different adverse stresses on antioxidant enzyme activities will vary among tissues. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of three SaTPSs Three predicted proteins encoded by  SaTPS1 to  3 with a range of 564 to 604 amino acids had predicted  pIs of 6.01, 5.02 and 5.03, respectively (Additional file  1: Table S4). As shown in Fig.  2, SaTPS1 to 3 contain the arginine-tryptophan motif, R(R) X8W, which is conserved in most mono-TPSs and in some sesqui-TPSs near the N-terminus. The highly conserved aspartate-rich motif (DDXXD) and NSE/DTE motif, which are crucial for chelating divalent cations, typically Mg 2+, in the C-terminal domain   49 , were present in these three SaTPSs. One of the distinguishing structural features between mono- and sesqui-TPSs is the presence of an N-terminal plastid transit peptide sequence. Using the signal sequence analysis program ChloroP ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP), a putative N-terminal plastid transit peptide (Tp) sequence of 44 amino acids for SaTPS1 was predicted, indicating that it is likely a mono-TPS. However, SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 did not contain a plastid Tp sequence, suggesting that they are sesqui-TPSs (Additional file  1: Table S4). A phylogenetic tree based on the deduced amino acid of sandalwood TPSs and other plant species showed that all  Santalum TPSs clustered in the TPS-b clade, with the exception of SasesquiTPS and sesquiTPSs in  S. spicatum (SspicsesquiTPS) and  S. austrocaledonicum (SaustsesquiTPS) (Fig.  3; Additional file  1: Table S5), among which the majority of angiospermous monoterpene synthases reside   15 . The most similar TPS sequence to SaTPS1 is that of (−)-α-terpineol synthase from  V. vinifera with 63% identity (Additional file  1: Figure S3; Additional file  1: Table S6) (Martin and Bohlmann, 2004). SaTPS2 clustered most closely to SaSSY, SspicSSY and SaustSSY, with a 100% bootstrap (Jones et al., 2011), and its amino acid sequence had highest identity with SaspiSSY (72%). SaTPS3 formed a clade with several previously characterized TPSs from  Santalum species, including SaMonoTPS, SaSQS1, SaSQS2, SaBS, SspicBS and Sspicsesquisabinene   42,  45,  50 . Bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses suggests that SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 might be involved in the production of essential oil in  S. album. Identification of new terpene synthases in  S. album We combined transcriptome sets downloaded from NCBI, including transcripts from leaves, stems and roots as described in the Methods. D e novo assembly yielded 164,548 unigenes from the three tissues (Additional file  1: Figure S1, Additional file  1: Table S2). Many unigenes were identified as  SaTPS genes, including 38 core terpene synthase genes and nine triterpene-specific synthase genes (Additional file  1: Table S3). Of these, six unigene sequences were completely aligned with those of  S. album submitted to NCBI   40,  42,  45 . Three unigenes contained full-length ORFs encoding TPSs, designated as  SaTPS1 to  3. In order to confirm that the assembled unigenes generated using the Trinity assembler were accurate, we designed primers to anneal around the predicted start and stop codons of unigenes to amplify ORFs of the three predicted  SaTPS genes (Fig. S2). Subsequent sequencing of these nucleotides demonstrated that they were exactly as predicted by the unigene assembly. Functional characterization of the enzymes encoded by  SaTPS1 to  3 SaTPS3 converts FPP and GPP substrates to sesqui- and monoterpene products, respectively. When assayed with FPP and Mg 2+, recombinant SaTPS3 catalyzed the synthesis of seven compounds, including ( E)-β-farnesene (20.7%), ( E)-nerolidol (29.8%) and ( E,E)-farnesol (21.3%) as the three major products, while a high proportion of γ-bisabolene (13.8%) was also produced (Fig.  8a, Additional file  1: Table S7). In the presence of Mn 2+, SaTPS3 recombination enzyme showed no activity, suggesting that SaTPS3 prefers Mg 2+ in the reaction with FPP. Analysis of the reaction products formed after incubation of SaTPS3 with GPP showed that the main product linalool (44.8–53.3%) was formed with Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ in considerable yield (Fig.  8b, Additional file  1: Figure S9, Additional file  1: Table S7). For the three SaTPSs tested in this study, extracts prepared from  E. coli transformed with PET28a lacking a cDNA insert and heat-denatured enzyme preparations served as controls, and no terpene products were observed. In all cases, expressed proteins incubated with GGPP did not produce detectable products. All cDNAs subcloned into pET28a vector with 6His-tagged were successfully expressed in  E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) competent cells and recombinant proteins were then purified with a Ni-NTA agarose affinity column (Additional file  1 :Figure S5). We found that this cDNA without the transit peptide sequence could improve the expression of  SaTPS1 in  E. coli. Following an in vitro enzyme activity assay,  SaTPS1 was confirmed to encode a mono-TPS enzyme that catalyzed the formation of mostly α-terpineol (45.7%), while sabinene (14.9%), linalool (11.7%) and myrcene (10.8%), as well as a few minor monoterpenes, were also produced with GPP as the substrate and Mg 2+, as detected by GC-MS analysis (Fig.  6a, Additional file  1: Table S7). Although the same compounds were produced when Mg 2+ was replaced by Mn 2+, levels of product formation were 5-fold lower and the three major compounds, linalool (35.8%), α-terpineol (25.7%), and geraniol (12.9%) were formed (Additional file  1: Figure S6, Additional file  1: Table S7). No terpene product was observed in the reaction of SaTPS1 with FPP as a substrate and Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ (Fig.  6b). This enzyme was designated as α-terpineol synthase because it is a major monoterpene product and due to its preference for the metal ion, Mg 2+. GC-MS analysis of the reaction products catalyzed by SaTPS2 with FPP as a substrate in the presence of Mg 2+ identified at least 15 sesquiterpenoids, with ( E)-α-bergamotene (24.8%) and sesquisabinene (33.0%) as the two major products, β-bisabolene (9.0%), γ-bisabolene isomer (7.9%), and minor compounds, 7- epi-sesquithujene, ( E)-β-farnesene, α-zingiberene, and others at relative proportions less than 5% (Fig.  7a; Additional file  1: Table S7). A similar product profile comprising the major compounds, ( E)-α-bergamotene (22.4%) and sesquisabinene (35.6%), were detected when Mg 2+ was replaced with Mn 2+, but overall yield was relatively lower (Additional file  1: Figure S7, Additional file  1: Table S7). Incubation of SaTPS2 with GPP as a substrate and Mg 2+ ion led to the production of nine monoterpenes (Fig.  7b; Additional file  1: Table S7). The most abundant compound was linalool (64.9%). Likewise, assays with Mn 2+ instead of Mg 2+ showed that almost the same compounds were observed, but overall yield was 5-fold lower (Additional file  1: Figure S8, Additional file  1: Table S7). Taken together, these results indicate that SaTPS2 is a multifunctional sesqui-TPS producing major ( E)-α-bergamotene and sesquisabinene in the cytosol. The  Km value of purified SaTPS1 with GPP was 9.08 ± 1.26 μM and the  Kcat/ Km value was 0.0171 (Table  1; Additional file  1 :Figure S10). The SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 enzymes not only accept substrate FPP but also accept the precursor of monoterpenes, GPP, as analyzed above. Enzyme kinetic properties of SaTPS2 showed that catalysis with FPP and GPP resulted in a similar  Km and  Kcat/ Km. The  Km value of the recombination SaTPS3 with FPP was 16.29 ± 1.48 μM, which was slightly higher than with GPP. The  Kcat/ Km with FPP was relatively lower than with GPP, indicating that the efficiency of this sesqui-TPS catalysis is higher when incubated with GPP. Differences in content and composition of volatiles among four tissues To understand the distribution pattern and differences in components of  S. album volatiles, we examined the metabolic compounds from pentane extracts of young leaves (YL), sapwood (SW) and HW from mature trees and immature wood (IW) from immature trees by GC-MS. There were significant differences in the volatile content among the four tissues. As shown in Fig.  1, the most abundant volatile was detected in HW (Fig.  1a-d). Major sesquiterpenols, α- and β-santalol, were detected in these four tissues, and sesquiterpenes, α- and β-santalene, and  epi-β-santalene were identified in YL and HW, but not in IW and SW (Fig.  1e-i, Additional file  1: Table S1). It was curious that trace amounts of α- and β-santalene,  epi-β-santalene and α-santalol (peaks 1, 3, 5 and 8, respectively) were found in almost the same proportion in YL (Fig.  1e). Of these, the distribution of the first three compounds matched that in HW (Fig.  1h, peaks 1, 3 and 5). Moreover, ( E)-α-bergamotene, ( E)-β-farnesene, and β-bisabolene were also detected from leaf extracts of  S. album. Almost the same distribution of sesquiterpenols as those in SW and HW was observed in IH (Fig.  1 f, g and i, peaks 8–15), indicating that the accumulation of sandalwood oil occurs at an early developmental stage of the stems and that more essential oil is biosynthesized in HW as the sandalwood tree grows older. Subcellular localization of SaTPSs To elucidate the function of SaTPS1 to 3, subcellular localization of each SaTPS-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) fusion protein provided preliminary evidence. Phylogenetic and bioinformatics-based analyses in an attempt to classify TPSs indicated that SaTPS1-YFP, which has the N-terminal plastid transit peptide sequence, was localized in chloroplasts, whereas SaTPS2-YFP and SaTPS3-YFP were distributed throughout the cytosol (Fig.  5). Based on the results of subcellular localization, it was concluded that SaTPS1 is likely involved in monoterpene biosynthesis in plastids, whereas SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 might produce sesquiterpenes in the cytosol. Activation of  SaTPS1 to  3 gene expression in response to MeJA and SA To explore the responses of the three  SaTPS genes under elicitors as well as temperature and high light intensity treatments, transcript levels for  SaTPS1 to  3 and  SaSSY were determined by qRT-PCR.  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 exhibited similar expression patterns in response to the two elicitors. As shown in Fig.  10a and b, exogenous MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 genes in leaves at 24 h, with more than a 170- and 130-fold increase, respectively, when compared with the controls.  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 transcripts also increased significantly in stems and roots after the application of MeJA.  SaTPS3 expression was activated in leaves, stems and roots with an approximately 5-, 3-, and 4-fold increase, respectively compared to the corresponding controls (Fig.  10c). In contrast,  SaTPS3 was significantly up-regulated in leaves by SA, but decreased in stems and roots. Moreover, the accumulation of  SaSSY transcript were similar to that of  SaTPS3 in leaves under MeJA and SA treatments. However, the two exogenous hormones led to a decrease in  SaSSY expression in roots compared with the control (Fig.  10d). Expression patterns of three  SaTPS genes differ from  SaSSY The tissue-specific expression of  SaTPS1 to  3 genes was determined by qRT-PCR in four key tissues, i.e., YL, IW, SW and HW. The transcript abundance of  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 genes showed a similar expression pattern, with highest expression in YL (Fig.  4).  SaTPS3 showed three-fold higher expression in IW than in YL, SW and HW. In contrast,  SaSSY was 100- and 250-fold higher in SW and HW, respectively. Additionally, comparisons of the expression levels among these  SaTPSs in specific tissues showed that  SaTPS3 showed higher expression than  SaTPS1 and Sa TPS2 in the four corresponding tissues (Additional file  1 :Figure S4). Of note, the level of  SaSSY transcript showed a 200- and 1200-fold increase relative to  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 in SW and HW, respectively. These results suggest that  SaTPS3 might play a role in the accumulation of HW essential oil whereas  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 play a minor role in the formation of terpenoids in  S. album HW. Adverse temperature and high light induced differential accumulation of  SaTPS1,  SaTPS2 and  SaTPS3 SaTPS1 to  3 expression levels were inhibited in leaves at 4°C and 38°C, but were significantly activated in roots when compared to the controls (Fig.  10e-g), suggesting that oxidative damage in leaves was more severe than in stems and roots. When exposed to high light intensity,  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 transcripts showed higher expression in stems and roots than in leaves, particularly  SaTPS1, with a 25-fold increase in stems. The level of  SaTPS3 transcripts was highest in roots under 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity stresses, with approximately 2-, 6-, and 8-fold increases, respectively, compared to the control. Conversely,  SaSSY transcript only increased by about 2-fold in roots at 4°C compared to the control. In all other cases, the expression level of  SaSSY was down-regulated to some extent in all tissues examined (Fig.  10h)."," Background It is well known that aromatic essential oils extracted from the heartwood of Santalum album L. have wide economic value. However, little is known about the role of terpenoids in response to various adverse environmental stresses as other plants do in the form of signals during plant-environment interactions. Results In this study, trace amounts of volatiles consisting of α-santalene, epi-β-santalene, β-santalene, α-santalol, β-santalol, (E)-α-bergamotene, (E)-β-farnesene and β-bisabolene were found in the leaves of mature S. album trees. We identified more than 40 candidate terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes by mining publicly-available RNA-seq data and characterized the enzymes encoded by three cDNAs: one mono-TPS catalyzes the formation of mostly α-terpineol, and two multifunctional sesqui-TPSs, one of which produces (E)-α-bergamotene and sesquisabinene as major products and another which catalyzes the formation of (E)-β-farnesene, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol as main products. Metabolite signatures and gene expression studies confirmed that santalol content is closely related with santalene synthase (SaSSY) transcripts in heartwood, which is key enzyme responsible for santalol biosynthesis. However, the expression of three new SaTPS genes differed significantly from SaSSY in the essential oil-producing heartwood. Increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, were detected in different tissues of S. album plants after applying 1 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 1 mM salicylic acid (SA), or exposure to 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity. MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of SaTPS1 and SaTPS2 in leaves. SaTPS1 to 3 transcripts were differentially activated among different tissues under adverse temperature and light stresses. In contrast, almost all SaSSY transcripts decreased in response to these environmental stresses, unlike SaTPS1 to 3. Conclusions Multifunctional enzymes were biochemically characterized, including one chloroplastic mono-TPS and two cytosolic sesqui-TPSs in sandalwood. Our results suggest the ecological importance of these three new SaTPS genes in defensive response to biotic attack and abiotic stresses in S. album."," 'Salicylic acid', 'Sesquiterpene', 'Methyl jasmonate', 'Abiotic stress', 'Santalum album', 'Terpene synthase' "," 'Additional file', 'Fig.', 'Additional', 'Table', 'file', 'GPP', 'expression', 'Figure', 'FPP', 'leaves' "," SA, superoxide dismutase, O −, °C, °C, − 2 , − 1, Catalase, CAT, O 2, CAT, CAT, peroxidase, CAT, CAT, POD, APX, APX, SA, CAT, POD, APX, SaTPSs, SaTPS1, X8W, sesqui-TPSs, Mg 2, SaTPSs, sesqui-TPSs, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP, N-terminal plastid, SaTPS1, SaTPS2, SaTPS3, SasesquiTPS, sesquiTPSs, SspicsesquiTPS, SaustsesquiTPS, S5, SaTPS1, (−)-α-terpineol synthase, SspicSSY, SaustSSY, SaspiSSY, SaMonoTPS, SaSQS1, SaSQS2, SaBS, SspicBS, SaTPS2, SaTPS3, NCBI, 164,548, triterpene-specific synthase, TPSs, Mg 2, SaTPS3, E)-nerolidol, E, E)-farnesol, Mn 2, SaTPS3, Mg 2, SaTPS3, 44.8–53.3, Mg 2, SaTPSs, PET28a, GGPP, pET28a, 6His-tagged, S5, α-terpineol, Mg 2, Mg 2, Mn 2, α-terpineol, SaTPS1, Mg 2, α-terpineol synthase, Mg 2, SaTPS2, Mg 2, Mg 2, SaTPS2, Mg 2, Mg 2, SaTPS2, SaTPS1, SaTPS2, SaTPS3 enzymes, SaTPS2, α-, β-santalol, α-, α-, α-santalol, HW, 8–15, SaTPSs, SaTPS1, yellow fluorescent protein, SaTPS1-YFP, SaTPS2-YFP, SaTPS3-YFP, SaTPS1, SaTPS2, SaTPS3, SA, b, SA, SA, SA, °C, °C "," 'SaTPSs', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS1', 'mono-TPSs', 'sesqui-TPSs', 'SaTPSs.', 'sesqui-TPSs', 'SaTPS1', 'mono-TPS.', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'sesqui-TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS-b', 'SasesquiTPS', 'sesquiTPSs', '(SspicsesquiTPS)', '(SaustsesquiTPS)', 'TPS', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'TPSs', 'SaMonoTPS,', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS', 'TPSs,', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPSs', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS1', 'mono-TPS', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS2', 'sesqui-TPS', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'sesqui-TPS', 'SaTPSs', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS-YFP', 'TPSs', 'SaTPS1-YFP,', 'SaTPS2-YFP', 'SaTPS3-YFP', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPSs', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS1', 'TPS2', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS1,', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS1,', 'SaTPS3' "," 'S.', 'S.', 'mono-TPS.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'GC-MS.', 'S.', 'S.'

56,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC4574478/eupmc_result.json,PMC4574478,"Results and Discussion Over three seasons, 19 blueberry genotypes were assayed for overall liking, texture liking, perceived sweetness, sourness, and flavor intensities by 217 panelists in 30 sensory panels, and for the biochemical measures of sucrose, glucose, fructose, soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), pH, and 52 volatiles ( S2 Table). A PLS model was constructed to determine the most relevant biochemical effectors of liking, intensity of sweetness, sourness, and blueberry flavor to be used for breeding selection. Six of these 19 genotypes (‘Emerald,’ ‘Endura,’ ‘Farthing,’ ‘Meadowlark,’ ‘Primadonna,’ and ‘Scintilla’) were sampled three times a season for three years in three locations to quantitate the biochemical variation due to environmental effects, and whether these differences were perceivable by humans. G×E Effects Seven biochemical measures had significant G×L×Y interaction effects, including fructose and TA ( Table 3). Glucose varied most based on berry genotype (19%) and year of harvest (16%). Fructose had a higher contribution of genetics at nearly a third. pH varied simply by location (30%) and year (6%) with no interaction effects. 1-Hexanol (CAS#111-27-3) and  E-2-Hexenal were the compounds most variable from year to year.  E-2-Hexenal has also been reported as having strong environmental effects in peach   28 . These compounds would make poor breeding targets due to their susceptibility to environmental variation. Although β-caryophyllene oxide exhibited L×G effects, 71% of its variation can be accounted for through genotypic effects alone ( Table 3). This oxidized sesquiterpenoid is the main product of a terpene synthase, which produces a number of volatile sesquiterpenes. Badoc and Lamarti   69  indicated that tropical climates favor the formation of oxidized forms of volatiles in dill ( Anethum graveolens L.), and in agreement, β-caryophyllene oxide concentrations increase as latitudes decrease in this study, although further studies would have to be conducted to confirm this correlation. 2-Heptanone also exhibited interaction effects of L, G, and Y, yet 54% of variation in its emission appears to be controlled genetically. Conversely, neral emission is less genetically controlled (18%) and is equally affected by L×G interaction effects (15%). These analyses suggest the potential to focus breeding resources on upregulating β-caryophyllene oxide and 2-heptanone rather than compounds such as neral. To further develop a realistic set of breeding targets for improved flavor, a G×E study was conducted to quantify the variation exhibited by these target compounds and to indicate which were most available to manipulate genetically. Six of the genotypes (‘Emerald,’ ‘Endura,’ ‘Farthing,’ ‘Meadowlark,’ ‘Primadonna,’ and ‘Scintilla’) used to sample biochemical and sensory variance were grown in three locations and harvested over the course of three years to determine the effects of genotype and environmental variables on taste and flavor compounds. Volatile emission has previously been shown to vary by location in strawberry, ginger ( Zingiber officinale Roscoe), thyme ( Thymus daenensis Celak and  Thymus vulgaris L.), and peaches   28, 61– 64  and between open field and protected structures in strawberry, raspberry, and tomato   10, 61, 65 . Geographical and climactic differences of the locations in this study are listed in  S4 Table. Blueberry plants grown at the Waldo location were grown under high tunnels while plants at UFPSREU and Haines City were open field. To determine the source of variance for the biochemical effectors of flavor ( Table 2), a linear model in which E was broken down into Location (L) and Year (Y) was constructed. The significance and percent variance for each term in the model are listed in  Table 3. All compounds besides hexanoic acid were significant for genotypic variation ( P<0.0001). In contrast, methyl hexanoate (CAS#106-70-7) and linalool exhibited only effects of G ( P<0.01). 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one (CAS#110-93-0) had the highest amount of variation sourced from genetics (89%). 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one has been shown to be a conversion product from the terpenoid citral (isomeric mixture of neral and geranial) by citral lyase in  Penicillium digitatum spores   66 , and does indeed have a significant negative pair-wise relationship to both neral and geranial in this blueberry biochemical study ( P = 0.03,  P<0.0001, respectively). Other compounds that had large genetic influence were 2-undecanone (82%), 2-nonanone (CAS#821-55-6) (80%), linalool (70%), and 1,8-cineole (51%). Formation of 2-undecanone is mediated by 3-oxolaurate decarboxylase   67 . Like 2-undecanone, linalool and 1,8-cineole also come from the terpenoid pathway and are both preceded by substrate geranyl diphosphate   68 . The high degree of genetic control over these compounds makes them ideal targets for breeding for improved blueberry flavor, and knowledge of their enzymatic and genetic regulation opens the potential for marker development. After focusing on compound performance across locations and years, we determined the significant variability of compounds for each genotype ( P<0.01) in the event that less predictable compounds could be prone to tighter biochemical regulation in a particular genetic background ( Table 4). ‘Emerald’ and ‘Scintilla’ had significant variability in the least number of compounds. ‘Endura’ was significantly variable for the highest number of compounds. ‘Endura’ was the only genotype to significantly vary for fructose concentration. Glucose was not variable in ‘Farthing’ and ‘Scintilla.’ ‘Scintilla’ also did not vary for pH or TA. All other genotypes had significant genotypic effects on pH. Based on these results, ‘Scintilla’ would be a good individual to use in crosses aimed at incorporating genetically regulated flavor compounds into new progeny because compounds tend to be predictable regardless of year and location, coupled with high sensory scores for the cultivar. This model could be used to target up- and downregulation of particular compounds in blueberries for increased consumer favor. To develop a better tasting berry based on this model, breeders may want to consider targeting pH between 3.2 and 3.5, increasing sugars, particularly fructose, β-caryophyllene oxide, 2-heptanone, neral, 2-undecanone, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and decreasing linalool, 1,8-cineole, and  E-2-hexenal. However, also of consideration to the breeder is the reliability of biochemical production of these compounds in fruit, as determined by genetics, environment, and their interaction effects. Relating the human experience to biochemical makeup Flavor had a strong relationship with fructose and pH, in addition to several volatiles also implicated in contributing to sweetness and sourness in this dataset ( Table 2). The influence of pH and fructose on the olfactory-mediated response of flavor may be due to difficultly for untrained consumer panelists to isolate flavor from taste. However, this could also be due to the integration of aromatics with taste in the fruit matrix and the brain; for example, pH can affect volatile emission in fruit tissue   42 , and relative concentrations of compounds in solution can dramatically change their associated olfactory responses   43 . Interactions between taste and retronasal olfaction are also known to occur. For example, sweetness and other aromas have been shown to be enhanced depending on the combination of taste molecules and volatile molecules present in an ingested sample   6, 22, 23 . In the discussion of volatile compounds and their contribution to flavor, it should be noted that the specific aromatic descriptors of volatiles in the literature are limited in that concentration and interaction with the fruit matrix may alter sensory perception   43– 45 . Since overall enjoyment of blueberries has been highly correlated with sweetness, flavor acceptability and blueberry-like flavor intensity ( Fig 4)   14 , and the sensory experience is influenced by numerous compounds released upon blueberry mastication, an appropriate model to detect complex connections between these disciplines was sought. In this study we used a PLS model to explain the hedonic and sensory components associated with eating blueberries using biochemical measurements   33– 37 . Texture liking, for which no physical measure was made, was included in the explanatory variables, along with glucose, fructose, sucrose, TA, pH, and 52 volatile compounds, to explain the sensory components of overall liking, sweetness, sourness, and flavor. When texture liking was included, the model explained 70% of variation in the sensory measures. Upon removing texture liking from the model, 64% of the variation in sensory components was explained ( Table 2). The 6% increase in variation explained accounted for by texture is expected by the large contribution of texture liking to overall liking and flavor of blueberry fruit ( Fig 4A). Another pervasive compound, neral (CAS#106-26-3), is positively associated with liking and sweetness, but negatively associated with sourness. Neral is a geometric isomer of geranial, which together are recognized as ‘citral,’ and characteristic of lemon ( Citrus × limon L.)   52 . Although geranial is also found in these blueberry samples, it was not identified as contributing to the sensory experience, highlighting the point that enantiomers may have significantly different sensory qualities. Two volatiles that were unique to explaining increases in blueberry flavor intensity were 2-undecanone (CAS#112-12-9) and 3-methyl-1-butanol (CAS#123-51-3). 2-Undecanone was characteristic of the variety ‘Scintilla.’ It has been previously reported in red raspberries ( Rubus idaeus L.) and blackberries ( Rubus spp.  hyb), and has been described orthonasally as floral and citrusy   56, 57 . 3-Methyl-1-butanol–a sweet, fruity, brandy-like compound found in tequila ( Agave tequilana Weber), and grape ( Vitis vinifera L.) and apple wines–was produced in the largest quantities by ‘Farthing’ and ‘Scintilla’   58– 60 . Increasing these two volatile compounds in the breeding germplasm could result in increased flavor intensity, as desired by blueberry consumers. The variation of each sensory aspect explained by the six highest and lowest biochemical effectors is shown in  Table 2. The sensory parameter with the most variation explained by biochemical measures was sourness, with 78% accounted for. The monosaccharide fructose was the most impactful effector of overall liking, sweetness and flavor, and detractor from sourness ( Table 2). Its structural isomer glucose was also important in overall liking, sweetness, and flavor, but did not act to decrease sourness in this model. Fructose has been shown to be perceivably sweeter than glucose at equivalent concentrations   38– 40 . It is known that the human sweetness receptor on the tongue undergoes varying conformational changes depending on the structure of the ligand that binds (e.g. fructose vs. glucose vs. artificial sweeteners), resulting in different degrees of perceived sweetness   41 . In the present study, sucrose did not contribute significantly to sweetness as it only accounts for approximately 1–2% of total blueberry sugars. Acidity as determined by pH also appeared to be important in all four sensory components assayed. TA was not associated with flavor but is a strong factor in the other three sensory components. The favorability of the fruit was negatively associated with several volatile compounds in this study, including two compounds that have often been associated with typical blueberry flavor in literature, linalool (CAS#78-70-6) and 1,8-cineole (CAS#470-82-6)   19,  53– 55 . In this PLS model, linalool and 1,8-cineole detracted from overall liking, sweetness and flavor. 1,8-Cineole also contributed to sourness. 1,8-Cineole was highest in samples which were harvested in the earliest part of the season (late March). Interestingly, linalool was highest in samples which were all harvested from the Waldo location (high tunnel production).  E-2-Hexenal (CAS#6728-26-3), which has been described orthonasally as fresh, leafy green, floral, sweet, and pungent   44 , also reduced liking and sweetness in the model, and was a positive effector of sourness. This compound constituted the largest proportion of total volatile emission, and was especially high in early season selections during 2014. Some of the volatiles included in the PLS model contribute to the explanation of more than one sensory descriptor as rated by the panelists. Volatile compounds β-caryophyllene oxide (CAS#1139-30-6) and 2-heptanone (CAS#110-43-0) are linked to an increase in overall liking, sweetness, and flavor in blueberries. β-Caryophyllene oxide has been identified in black currant ( Ribes nigrum L.), black ground pepper ( Piper nigrum L.), and hops ( Humulus lupulus L.) and has been described orthonasally as “spicy”   46– 48 . ‘Meadowlark’ constitutes samples with the highest concentrations of 2-heptanone, distributed across all years (2012–2014) and all locations (UFPSREU, Haines City, Waldo). 2-Heptanone has also been reported in strawberry, apple ( Malus domestica Borkh.), and passion fruit ( Passiflora edulis Sims)   49– 51 . Overall liking of blueberries is strongly related to favorable texture, intensities of sweetness, flavor and sourness The relationship between flavor intensity (X) and texture liking (Y) was also linear (R 2 = 0.73,  P<0.0001,  Fig 4F). It is common for interaction to occur between olfaction and somatosensation   4 . A significant relationship between blueberry flavor intensity and juiciness has been previously reported   27 . These correlations may be a result of optimally ripe samples, where texture is ideal and flavor compounds are at a maximum   15 . In a peach ( Prunus persica L.) QTL mapping and fruit quality study, a locus controlling peach melting, firmness and several volatiles was found, suggesting either pleiotropic effects of a single gene upon these traits or an additional linkage locus   28 . However, the relationship between flavor and texture may be created post-fruit consumption. Differences have been found between whey protein gels of varying texture and their perceived flavor intensity, despite the fact that release of flavor compounds from the matrix was not changed due to gel texture differences   29 , demonstrating the potential integration of these two discrete senses upon each other in the brain   4 . To determine which sensory predictors measured in this study influenced the overall blueberry eating experience, pair-wise correlations between each panelists’ scores of overall liking, favorability of texture, and the sensory intensity measures of sweetness, sourness, and flavor were individually fitted ( S3 Table;  Fig 4A–4F shown are select significant relationships). These four measures were all individually significant contributors to the response overall liking of blueberry fruit ( P<0.001) with the best fit indicated by sweetness intensity (R 2 = 0.70), followed by liking of berry texture (R 2 = 0.68), and flavor intensity (R 2 = 0.63). Sourness intensity had a significantly negative relationship with overall liking (R 2 = 0.55). Overall liking increased as the texture was perceived as better, and as the fruit was more intensely sweet and flavorful. The relationship between overall liking and texture liking is a reasonable finding, as these are both rated on hedonic scales. If a panelist likes the berry, it is partially because they like that berry’s texture: the somatosensory experience of texture is inseparable from the rest of the sensory components   4 . That texture is such a strong sensory component of overall liking is at odds with our previously published blueberry perception study, in which flavor attributes were most indicative of purchase   3 . In the perception study, descriptions of poor blueberry texture, such as mealiness, seediness, and toughness, were the most powerful in decreasing blueberry purchase likelihood, but positive texture attributes (firmness, crispness) were generally perceived as neutral. This highlights a potential downside to consumer perception surveys: it is difficult to cognate the mechanical value of texture until it is experienced firsthand. Even then, texture is a complex experience that is difficult to parcel from other sensory components   4  which is the reasoning behind the use of the hedonic scale rather than some assemblage of descriptive intensity factors such as juiciness, firmness, and mealiness   24 . However, more sugar does not always equate to more sweetness. Of the top five sweetest samples, none of these is in the top five for total sugar concentration ( S2 Table). In fact, ‘Primadonna’ (2014 H1—first harvest from Haines City in 2014) was the fourth sweetest berry among all thirty panels, and had a below average concentration total sugars. Conversely, ‘Emerald,’ (2013, H2), which had the highest total sugar concentration of all samples assayed (140.4 mg gFW -1 vs. average = 100.5 mg gFW -1), scored below average for sweetness intensity (21 vs. average 23) and liking (20 vs. average 22), underscoring the sensory importance of many other compounds in the fruit matrix. This ‘Emerald’ sample was very acidic (pH = 3.0, average = 3.5; TA = 0.91, average = 0.41), while the ‘Primadonna’ sample was sub-acid (pH = 3.6; TA = 0.18). Additionally, in both strawberry and tomato fruits, aromatic volatile compounds have been discovered to contribute to sweetness beyond the effects of sugars   22, 23 . This introduces the possibility of breeding for a biochemical recipe that does not exclusively involve increasing sugar content and lowering acidity. As the sourness of blueberry samples was perceived as more intense, the pleasure derived from the fruit decreased ( Fig 4C). Blueberry sweetness (Y) and sourness (X) were negatively correlated with each other (R 2 = 0.70,  P<0.0001,  Fig 4E) as expected due to mixture suppression of sweet and sour tastes   25, 26 . When the panel means (as opposed to individual panelist scores) of sensory measures were fit against each other, fits for texture, sourness, and flavor against overall liking went down (R 2 = 0.14, R 2 = 0.35, R 2 = 0.22, respectively,  P<0.0001) while the fit for sweetness went up (R 2 = 0.81,  P<0.0001). Changes in fit may be due to the elimination of personal bias for these sensory parameters when averages were used rather than individuals’ associations between ratings. This may also be due to the large range of the gLMS scales, and the variation in range use of the scales among panelists, which is accounted for when each panelist can be treated as a random effect. From these results, it is clear that panelists can discern genotypic variation in blueberry sensory components. However, delivering and marketing a blueberry product of premium quality, as defined by excellent texture, increased sweetness and flavor, and a balance of sourness, would necessitate identifying biochemical quality measures to benchmark specially marketed products such that they would consistently meet consumer expectations of a higher quality berry. This would only be realistic if certain genotypes could be identified where these biochemical components do not suffer from high variation due to environmental effects, thereby yielding reliable fruit quality. In considering primary biochemical drivers of the sensory experiences, it is known that sugars and acids are principal contributors to taste   30 . A commonly used indicator of fruit quality has been the ratio of soluble solids to titratable acidity of fruit. While SSC/TA was significantly correlated to overall liking, sweetness, and sourness in linear pairwise regressions, the individual measures SSC and TA explained more of the variance in sensory ratings than did the ratio ( S3 Table). Overall liking was significantly positively correlated to concentrations of all sugars (best fit was Total Sugars, R 2 = 0.20,  P<0.001,  Fig 4G) and negatively with increasing TA (R 2 = 0.14,  P<0.001,  Fig 4H). Perceived sweetness is best explained by measures of sugars, including Fructose (R 2 = 0.27,  P<0.0001  Fig 4I), Total Sugars (R 2 = 0.26,  P<0.0001), SSC (R 2 = 0.25,  P<0.0001), and Glucose (R 2 = 0.20,  P<0.0001). Although still significant, measures of Sucrose are much less suitable as a predictor of sweetness (R 2 = 0.08,  P = 0.0004). As in previous reports   31, 32 , Sucrose was present in very low amounts in the blueberry fruit surveyed, accounting for 1.6% of total sugars on average ( S2 Table). Sweetness was negatively correlated with TA (R 2 = 0.27,  P<0.0001,  Fig 4J), while TA explained over half of perceived sourness (R 2 = 0.56,  P<0.0001,  Fig 4K). An even better explanatory variable of perceived sourness was pH (R 2 = 0.59,  P<0.0001,  Fig 4L). Of the top five best liked samples, pH measures ranged from 3.3 to 3.6, compared to the study range of 2.8 to 4.4 ( S2 Table). Blueberry genotypes vary significantly in scores for liking and perceived sensory intensities On average, sourness was the lowest intensity experienced, but exhibited the most variation between berries among the three sensory intensities rated ( Table 1,  Fig 3B). The sourest berry, ‘Vireo,’ was twice the ideal sourness (36). ‘Chickadee’ came closest to having the ideal intensity of sourness for blueberries according to this group of panelists, and was rated just above average in overall liking. The genotype with the highest overall liking score, ‘Scintilla,’ was close to the ideal indicated sourness intensity (15;  S2 Table). The congruence with overall liking, measured sourness intensity, and ideal sourness intensity suggests that panelists are indeed able to numerically express ideal sourness intensity. Genotypic relatedness based on pedigree and biochemical profiles were compared using hierarchical cluster analyses ( Fig 1). The dendrograms between the two analyses do not pair the same genotypes together in any instance, demonstrating the diversity of biochemistry that exists regardless of genotypic relatedness. This is likely due to the highly heterozygous nature of this autotetraploid species that extends beyond pedigree information. A cluster analysis based on molecular genetic relatedness between these individuals may show more similarity to biochemical clusters, and may be considered in future investigations. The discrepancy between consumer ideals and actual products highlights the potential for breeding blueberry sensory attributes that exceed consumer expectations, ideally leading to increased repeat purchases, and expanded market potential for the crop. The perceivable sensory differences among blueberry genotypes indicate that the previously reported diversity in biochemical makeup   12– 19  is sufficiently variable to extract meaningful information relating to the sensory experience. Of 153 blueberry samples assayed in sensory panels, every sample scored in the positive region of the hedonic scales (-100,+100) for overall liking and texture liking ( S2 Table,  Fig 2). Panelists scored berry texture on the hedonic gLMS scale to reduce artificially low scores in other scales in the incidence of poor texture. They then rated the individual sensory experiences of sweetness, sourness, and blueberry flavor on an intensity gLMS scale (0,+100) ( Table 1,  Fig 3). Additionally, panelists were asked to assign intensities of these sensory experiences with regard to an ideal blueberry. No genotype met panelists’ ideal sweetness intensity ( Table 1,  Fig 3A). In previous sensory studies with tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum L.) and strawberry ( Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne), panelists rated actual samples using the same scales and also indicated ideal sensory intensities for these fruits   22, 23 . This hypothetical blueberry value fell between the ideal sweetness scores (intensity gLMS scale) given for strawberry (42) and tomato (33)   22, 23 . This expectation that blueberry be sweeter than tomato is understandable given tomatoes’ savory role in culinary preparation. However, the expectation that a strawberry be sweeter than a blueberry is curious given their similar uses as fresh fruit and dessert, and blueberry’s typically higher sugar content compared to strawberry. Intensity of blueberry flavor exhibited the least variation in sample scores compared to perceived sweetness and sourness (1.5-fold variation;  Table 1), and like sweetness, also fell short of the panelists’ ideal flavor intensity ( Table 1,  Fig 3C). The lack of variation in flavor intensity among the 19 genotypes assessed may be due to poor panelist understanding of flavor (as opposed to taste), limited genetic diversity in flavor in the germplasm, or a combination of the two. Panel favorite ‘Scintilla’ had an above average flavor intensity (29;  S2 Table), second only to ‘Kestrel’ (32), which was also highly rated by panelists (24). In comparison, the ideal flavor intensities desired for strawberry and tomato were higher (45)   22, 23 . Given the quantities of volatiles reported in the literature for these three fruits via comparable collection methods and expressed in in ng gFW -1 h -1, blueberry emits fifteen times the volatiles compared to tomato, and about a third the volatiles emitted by strawberry   22, 23 . While this might explain why the panelists would expect an ideal strawberry to be more flavorful, it draws into question why the flavor intensity of an ideal tomato be higher than an ideal blueberry.","Breeding for a subjective goal such as flavor is challenging, as many blueberry cultivars are grown worldwide, and identifying breeding targets relating to blueberry flavor biochemistry that have a high degree of genetic control and low environmental variability are priorities. A variety of biochemical compounds and physical characters induce the sensory responses of taste, olfaction, and somatosensation, all of which interact to create what is perceived flavor. The goal of this study was to identify the flavor compounds with a larger genetic versus environmental component regulating their expression over an array of cultivars, locations, and years. Over the course of three years, consumer panelists rated overall liking, texture, sweetness, sourness, and flavor intensity of 19 southern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum hybrids) genotypes in 30 sensory panels. Significant positive correlations to overall liking of blueberry fruit (P<0.001) were found with sweetness (R2 = 0.70), texture (R2 = 0.68), and flavor (R2 = 0.63). Sourness had a significantly negative relationship with overall liking (R2 = 0.55). The relationship between flavor and texture liking was also linear (R2 = 0.73, P<0.0001) demonstrating interaction between olfaction and somatosensation. Partial least squares analysis was used to identify sugars, acids, and volatile compounds contributing to liking and sensory intensities, and revealed strong effects of fructose, pH, and several volatile compounds upon all sensory parameters measured. To assess the feasibility of breeding for flavor components, a three year study was conducted to compare genetic and environmental influences on flavor biochemistry. Panelists could discern genotypic variation in blueberry sensory components, and many of the compounds affecting consumer favor of blueberries, such as fructose, pH, β-caryophyllene oxide and 2-heptanone, were sufficiently genetically controlled that allocating resources for their breeding is worthwhile.",NaN," 'flavor', 'Table', 'liking', 'sensory', 'flavor intensity', 'blueberry', 'sweetness', 'Fig', 'compounds', 'sourness' "," ‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’, G×L×, TA ( Table 3, Badoc, Lamarti   69 , ‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’, UFPSREU, P<0.0001, CAS#106-70-7, G ( P<0.01, CAS#110-93, CAS#821-55-6, 3-oxolaurate decarboxylase   67, ’, ‘Endura, ’, ‘Endura, ’, ‘, ’, ’ ‘Scintilla’, TA, CAS#106, ’, CAS#112-12-9, CAS#123-51-3, ’, ‘, ’, 58– 60, CAS#78-70, CAS#470, CAS#110-43, “spicy”, 46–, ‘, ’, UFPSREU, 4F, whey protein, ’, 4A–4F, P<0.001, ‘, ’ (, ‘, ’ (2013, H2, ‘, TA, ‘, ’, TA (R 2, Fructose (R 2, Glucose (R 2, TA (R 2, ’, ‘, ’, ’, ’, ’, ‘ ",  ,  , 'lycopersicum' ,terpene synthase
57,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC5361166/eupmc_result.json,PMC5361166,"Results Global Analysis of the Fruit Transcriptome Global mRNA sequencing of the receptacle and achenes of red-fruited  F. vesca RdV variety, and both white-fruited  F. vesca YW and HW4 varieties was performed to investigate the differential accumulation of transcripts. RNA was pooled from receptacles and achenes of ten fruits per sample to ensure high reliability regarding the stage of fruit ripening ( Supplementary Table S1). Sequencing yielded 249,582,360 reads of 100 bp in length ( Supplementary Table S2), giving ~25 billion nucleotides of total sequence data. After quality clipping, 245,603,827 reads were selected. The mapping of the selected reads to the  F. vesca reference genome resulted in a total pool of 204,888,523 transcript counts (greater than 83% overall mapping rate,  Supplementary Table S3). Subsequently, the read counts were normalized by DESeq2 size factors, and scaled to per million range (rpm: r eads per million). Genes with fewer than 20 normalized counts summed across samples were considered as not expressed. Out of 33673 annotated  F. vesca genes, 19208 were expressed above this threshold. To investigate global gene expression relationships, we performed a principle component analysis (PCA), and visualized the correlations also by dendrograms of the achenes and receptacle data sets ( Fig. 4). When the 500 most highly expressed transcripts were employed for PCA analysis, the receptacles and achenes were clearly set apart (left and right), as well as the green and ripe developmental stages (top and bottom,  Fig. 4A). The receptacles and achenes of the intermediate ripening stage of YW and HW4 grouped with the green tissues, whereas the receptacle and achenes of intermediately ripened RdV clustered with the ripe tissues of all varieties. Thus, gene expression of the white genotypes at the intermediate stage is more closely related to green unripe tissue, and the intermediate stage of the red genotype RdV to the ripe tissues. This observation was also confirmed by hierarchical clustering of the achenes and receptacle data ( Fig. 4B and C). Transcript level profiles of known anthocyanin and flavonoid pathway genes during strawberry fruit development Next, we analyzed the transcript level profiles of anthocyanin and flavonoid pathway genes, whose encoded proteins have already been biochemically characterized. Gene expression levels in achenes and receptacle of RdV, YW, and HW4 of three developmental stages (green, intermediate and ripe) were compared ( Fig. 5). Four groups of genes could be clearly distinguished by means of their transcript profiles. Early anthocyanin and flavonoid pathway genes such as  PAL, CA4H, 4CL, FLS, and a flavonoid glucosyltransferase (FGT) gene show high expression levels in green achenes of RdV, YW, and HW4 as well as in achenes of YW and HW4 of the intermediate ripening stage ( Fig. 5,  Supplementary Figures S1 and S2).  CHS, CHI, F3H, DFR, and  ANS formed the second group. Transcript abundance of these genes was high in achenes and receptacles of RdV of all developmental stages but low in fruit of YW and HW4, except for green achenes and receptacle, and intermediate receptacle. Gene transcript levels of the first two groups differed considerably between the red- and white-fruited genotypes in achenes and receptacle at the intermediate (and ripe) developmental stage. However, the most significant difference was observed for the mRNA abundance of the anthocyanidin glucosyltransferase gene  FaGT1 and an uncharacterized glutathione S-transferase gene. Both were exclusively expressed in fruit of RdV at the intermediate and ripe developmental stage.  F3′ H, ANR, and  LAR formed the fourth group. They were primarily expressed in the green fruit of the three genotypes, and in intermediate receptacle of HW4. The transcript profiles of  F3′ H, ANR, and  LAR in fruit of HW4 was clearly different from that of RdV and YW. Thus, gene expression perturbation of flavonoid pathway genes in HW4 occurs already in the green developmental stage. The glucosyltransferase gene  FaGT2 was mainly expressed in green achenes of the three genotypes, and ripe receptacles of RdV. Expression levels of genes involved in fruit softening and flavor formation Finally, we wanted to know whether the impaired anthocyanin pathway in YW and HW4 affects the expression of genes involved in fruit flavor formation, and fruit softening. Transcript levels of well-characterized genes associated with volatile terpene (pinene synthase and hydroxylase), ester (acyltransferases FcAAT1, and SAAT), furaneol (FaQR), and eugenol (eugenol synthase) formation, as well as genes affecting fruit softening (pectin esterase, pectate lyase, polygalacturonase and beta-galactosidase) were analyzed in the data sets of RdV, YW, and HW4 ( Fig. 6). The genes showed a similar ripening-related expression profile in the receptacles of the three genotypes, peaking at the ripe stage. It seems that the ripening process is slowed down in the white-fruited genotypes in comparison to RdV, because transcripts of genes involved in fruit flavor production, and degradation of cell wall polysaccharides are already abundant in receptacle of RdV at the intermediate stage, whereas these genes are almost solely expressed in ripe receptacle of YW and HW4. Analysis of differentially expressed genes between RdV and both white genotypes YW and HW4 To find candidate genes that might explain the loss-of-color phenotype in YW and HW4, differential expression between genotypes was assessed. Thirty-three genes were significantly down-regulated in white genotypes (YW, HW4) compared to the red genotype RdV ( Table 1). Five genes encode enzymes with confirmed biochemical functions in  F. vesca or  F. ×  ananassa. Transcript levels of early (chalcone synthase  FaCHS2–2: gene26826, chalcone isomerase  FaCHI: gene 21346, and flavanone 3-hydroxylase  FHT: gene14611), and late (dihydroflavonol reductase  DFR: gene15176, anthocyanin synthase  ANS: gene32347, and anthocyanin 3- O-glucosyltransferase  FaGT1: gene12591) anthocyanin biosynthesis genes were equally reduced. Furthermore, gene31672 a predicted glutathione S-transferase is among the genes showing highest differential expression (logFC = −7.2), with transcripts accumulating almost exclusively in ripe and intermediate tissues of the red genotype RdV ( Supplementary data File S1). On the contrary, 31 genes were significantly up-regulated in both white genotypes ( Table 2). Many candidates currently lack a functional prediction but show remarkable differences between the genotypes. For example candidate gene20847 (logFC = 10.7), almost not expressed in any tissues of RdV exhibits very high expression (up to 1,785 RPM) in tissues of HW4, and lower but considerable expression in tissues of YW. Furthermore, gene27422 a predicted transcription factor ORG2-like of the bHLH class is exclusively expressed in the white genotypes. Metabolite Analysis Untargeted and targeted metabolite analyses of phenols, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins were performed by LC-MS in receptacles and achenes of green, intermediate and ripe fruits of  F. vesca RdV, YW and HW4 ( Figs 2 and  3). 271 untargeted metabolites showed variance between the three genotypes (p-value ≤ 0.01). Their analysis uncovered much lower variance in the data sets of the metabolites found in the achenes of RdV, YW, and HW4 than in the data of the receptacles ( Fig. 2). The receptacles of the three  F. vesca varieties clustered according to their developmental stages. Thus, metabolites that confer the red color to ripe RdV fruits did not strongly contribute to the variance in the data. Overall, according to the untargeted analysis, the major metabolites were similar in the three genotypes at the identical ripening stage. However, the targeted metabolite analysis showed, in line with the color change of the receptacle and achenes of RdV ( Fig. 1), high levels of anthocyanins such as pelargonidin glucoside, pelargonidin glucoside malonate, and cyanidin glucoside in ripe receptacle and achenes of RdV, but not in fruits of YW and HW4 ( Fig. 3). Each developmental stage and fruit tissue is dominated by a certain group of phenolic compounds. For instance, phenols such as gallic acid, gallic acid glucose ester and ellagic acid were major metabolites in green achenes of RdV, whereas flavonoids were abundant in intermediate achenes of RdV, and anthocyanins and phenylpropanoids dominated in the late developmental stage. In most cases, the levels of secondary metabolites in achenes and receptacle of the white-fruited genotypes differed considerably from the concentrations determined in the respective tissues of RdV. Although, gallic and ellagic acid accumulated in green achenes of YW to levels found in green achenes of RdV, the concentrations of flavonoids were significantly reduced. In contrast, in green receptacles of YW, the levels of flavonoids even exceeded the concentrations detected in the same tissue of RdV. Thus, the differential metabolite levels suggest that changes in secondary metabolism reflect organ and developmental specificities.","Strawberry fruits (Fragaria vesca) are valued for their sweet fruity flavor, juicy texture, and characteristic red color caused by anthocyanin pigments. To gain a deeper insight into the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis, we performed comparative metabolite profiling and transcriptome analyses of one red-fruited and two natural white-fruited strawberry varieties in two tissues and three ripening stages. Developing fruit of the three genotypes showed a distinctive pattern of polyphenol accumulation already in green receptacle and achenes. Global analysis of the transcriptomes revealed that the ripening process in the white-fruited varieties is already affected at an early developmental stage. Key polyphenol genes showed considerably lower transcript levels in the receptacle and achenes of both white genotypes, compared to the red genotype. The expression of the anthocyanidin glucosyltransferase gene and a glutathione S-transferase, putatively involved in the vacuolar transport of the anthocyanins, seemed to be critical for anthocyanin formation. A bHLH transcription factor is among the differentially expressed genes as well. Furthermore, genes associated with flavor formation and fruit softening appear to be coordinately regulated and seem to interact with the polyphenol biosynthesis pathway. This study provides new information about polyphenol biosynthesis regulators in strawberry, and reveals genes unknown to affect anthocyanin formation.",NaN," 'achenes', 'RdV', 'Supplementary Table', 'Genes', 'green achenes', 'receptacle', 'Fig.', 'genotypes', 'Transcriptome Global', 'stage' "," HW4, 245,603,827, 204,888,523, DESeq2 size factors, HW4, C, HW4, CA4H, 4CL, FLS, green achenes, HW4, HW4, CHI, HW4, green achenes, anthocyanidin glucosyltransferase, glutathione S-transferase, green fruit, HW4, HW4, HW4, glucosyltransferase, green achenes, RdV., HW4, hydroxylase, SAAT, FaQR, pectin esterase, pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, beta-galactosidase, HW4 ( Fig. 6, HW4, HW4, loss-of-color, HW4, HW4, chalcone synthase, gene26826, chalcone isomerase, 21346, flavanone 3-hydroxylase, gene14611, dihydroflavonol reductase, gene15176, anthocyanin synthase, gene32347, anthocyanin 3-, gene12591, gene31672, glutathione S-transferase, gene20847, HW4, gene27422, HW4, HW4, HW4 ( Fig. 3, green achenes, RdV., green achenes, green achenes, RdV.

Differently from the majority of insect herbivores, large larvae of L. dispar rapidly consume leaf area, and can also bite through tough tissues, including secondary and primary leaf veins. Given the rapid and devastating feeding responses, we hypothesized that infection of Q. robur leaves by L. dispar leads to disproportionate scaling of leaf photosynthesis and constitutive isoprene emissions with damaged leaf area, and to less prominent enhancements of induced volatile release. Leaves with 0% (control) to 50% of leaf area removed by larvae were studied. Across this range of infection severity, all physiological characteristics were quantitatively correlated with the degree of damage, but all these traits changed disproportionately with the degree of damage. The net assimilation rate was reduced by almost 10-fold and constitutive isoprene emissions by more than 7-fold, whereas the emissions of green leaf volatiles, monoterpenes, methyl salicylate and the homoterpene (3E)-4,8-dimethy-1,3,7-nonatriene scaled negatively and almost linearly with net assimilation rate through damage treatments. This study demonstrates that feeding by large insect herbivores disproportionately alters photosynthetic rate and constitutive isoprene emissions. Furthermore, the leaves have a surprisingly large capacity for enhancement of induced emissions even when foliage photosynthetic function is severely impaired."," 'Photosynthesis', 'volatile organic compounds', 'Green Leaf Volatiles', 'Isoprene Emission', 'Monoterpene Emission', 'Induced Emissions', 'Quantitative Responses', 'Large Insect Herbivores' ",  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,NaN

60,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7305226/eupmc_result.json,PMC7305226,"Experimental Results Diverse colored root cultivars exhibit distinct volatile terpene profiles Carrot cultivars of different color can be distinguished by distinct sensory qualities. To determine whether these differences correlate with modifications in terpene profiles, we performed a random forest analysis (see Methods for details) of 14 major monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds in the colored cultivars P7262 (purple), R6637 (red), Y9244A (yellow) and B493B (orange) (Supplementary Fig.  S15). This analysis revealed a strong separation of the colored genotypes (Fig.  6). Variable selection, using the R package Boruta, identified nine terpene factors as important in distinguishing the colored varieties (Table  S5). We found that orange carrot roots in this study (cv. B493B) accumulated significantly higher levels of ( E)-β-caryophyllene (ANOVA; p = 2.95e-05), α-humulene (ANOVA; p = 1.03e-04) and bornyl acetate (ANOVA; p = 4.23e-04) compared to red, purple and yellow cultivars (Fig.  7). In addition, yellow carrots (cv. Y9244A), accumulated high levels of β-bisabolene (ANOVA; p = 2.02e-03) and ( E)-γ-bisabolene (ANOVA; p = 7.51e-03) in comparison to the other tested cultivars (Fig.  7). Although α-terpinolene significantly contributed to cultivar differences (Table  S5; ANOVA; p = 0.046), no significant pairwise differences were detected among cultivars (Fig.  7). To determine if the observed cultivar specific terpene differences correlated with the expression of particular TPS genes, we analyzed TPS transcript levels from RNA-seq data of all cultivars using the Bioconducter package Limma (Fig. S2). We found that the cultivar-specific transcript profile of  DcTPS01 with highest levels in the orange cultivar overlapped with the metabolite profile of ( E)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene supporting the function of  DcTPS01 as an ( E)-β-caryophyllene in planta. In addition, increased α-terpinolene levels in yellow and orange carrots correlated with the transcript profiles of the α-terpinolene synthase  DcTPS03. Several TPS genes exhibited highest transcript levels in the yellow cultivar (Fig. S2). Of these genes,  DcTPS26 may contribute to the formation of β-bisabolene in yellow rooted carrots since the DcTPS26 protein lacks a plastidial transit peptide and might make β-bisabolene from ( E, E)-FDP in the cytosol (Fig.  4). Three other genes ( DcTPS03,  DcTPS04, DcTPS54) may have similar roles since their corresponding enzymes are targeted to plastids, where they may contribute to synthesizing γ-bisabolenes and β-bisabolene from ( Z, Z)-FDP (Fig. S11). Proteins encoded by other TPS genes with highest expression in the yellow cultivar either did not make bisabolenes or have not been functionally characterized ( DcTPS10,  DcTPS16,  DcTPS33,  DcTPS42). No additional correlations between TPS genes expression and profiles of other terpenes were found due to multiple enzymes being involved in the formation of several terpenes (e.g. α-pinene, β-pinene, β-farnesene) or unknown biochemical origin of the compound (bornyl acetate). Gene candidate selection Gene candidates for biochemical characterization were first screened by tissue specific RNA-seq analysis of DH1 and root specific RNA-seq analysis of colored carrots (Supplementary Figs.  S2 and  S3). TPS gene candidates with high in silico transcript levels were further selected based on the ability to obtain full-length transcripts and real time qRT-PCR amplicons across multiple tissues (Fig.  3; Supplementary Fig.  S10). Full-length cDNAs or cDNAs with truncated plastidial transit peptides (19 in total) were constructed for all root-expressed TPS genes ( DcTPS03,  DcTPS10,  DcTPS11,  DcTPS14,  DcTPS15,  DcTPS25,  DcTPS26,  DcTPS28 and  DcTPS30), genes with high expression in above ground tissues ( DcTPS04,  DcTPS07,  DcTPS19,  DcTPS23,  DcTPS42,  DcTPS48,  DcTPS53) and any additional TPS genes associated with QTLs ( DcTPS27,  DcTPS54 and  DcTPS55) identified by Keilwagen,  et al. 19.  In vitro TPS assays with the recombinant partially purified TPS proteins were performed using common TPS substrates (GDP, NDP, ( E, E)-FDP, ( Z, Z)-FDP and GGDP) and terpene products were analyzed by headspace SPME-GC-MS. DcTPS28 in an  ent-Kaurene Synthase in the TPS-e/f Subfamily Of the three TPS-e/f type genes identified by RNA-seq analysis ( DcTPS28, DcTPS29 and  DcTPS56), we focused on  DcTPS28 based on its expression in roots (Fig.  3). When the recombinant  DcTPS28 was tested for class I diterpene synthase activity with GGDP as substrate, no product was detected. However, when co-expressed with a pGGeC plasmid carrying a  GGDPS gene from  Abies grandis and a  CPS gene from  Arabidopsis thaliana23,  DcTPS28 converted  ent-CDP into  ent-kaurene (Fig.  5b).  ent-Kaurene could also be produced by co-incubating partially purified  DcTPS25 and  DcTPS28 with GGDP confirming the enzymatic activities of both enzymes (Fig.  5b). Production of  ent-kaurene was verified by mass spectral comparison to products from a known  ent-kaurene synthase of  Bradyrhizobium japonicum. DcTPS25 Belongs to the TPS-c Clade The plant TPS-c subfamily comprises enzymes with an N-terminal  \documentclass 12pt {minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\gamma $$\end{document}γ-domain characteristic of diterpene synthases involved in primary and secondary metabolism. In carrot, we identified three TPS genes in the TPS-c subfamily, of which  DcTPS25 was expressed in above and belowground tissues in contrast to low expression of genes  DcTPS57 and  DcTPS59 (Fig.  3; Supplementary Fig.  S10). The recombinant  DcTPS25 protein was found to function as a class II diterpene cyclase converting GGDP into  ent-copalyl diphosphate (CDP) based on mass spectral comparison of the acid hydrolyzed product  ent-copalol (Fig.  5a) with  ent-copalol derived from the  Arabidopsis thaliana copalyl diphosphate synthase. No enzymatic activity was detected with any other substrate tested.

DcTPS11 was found to be most highly expressed in aboveground tissues including young leaves, matures leaves and petioles (Fig.  3). The recombinant DcTPS11 protein converted ( E,E)-FDP into germacrene D as one of its major enzymatic products (Fig.  4). Similarly,  DcTPS07, which showed highest transcript abundance in petioles (Fig.  3), encodes a protein that exclusively formed germacrene D from ( E,E)-FDP (Fig.  4). As germacrene D is a major component of the carrot essential oil in aboveground tissues, it is likely that both  DcTPS11 and  DcTPS07 contribute to the formation of this compound  in vivo. Another member of the TPS-a subfamily,  DcTPS53, was expressed in mature leaves and the petiole and its recombinant protein was found to convert ( E,E) -FDP to δ-elemene as a major product and constituent of DH1 leaf terpenes (Figs.  3 and  4). The recombinant protein of the root-expressed gene  DcTPS15 had limited activity with all tested substrates (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). Enzyme assays with recombinant  DcTPS42 demonstrated that the enzyme produced several putative sesquiterpene products from ( E,E)-FDP including germacrene D (Fig.  4). Additional members of the TPS-a clade were not tested based on previous characterization ( DcTPS0117), low levels of constitutive expression, or inability to amplify a full-length transcript ( DcTPS13 and  DcTPS38). We also examined all characterized TPS-a type proteins for their ability to accept GDP and GGDP as well as the  cis-prenyl diphosphates NDP and ( Z, Z)-FDP as substrates.  DcTPS11 catalyzed the formation of monoterpenes (limonene, α-terpinolene) from GDP and made a γ-bisabolene isomer from ( Z,Z)-FDP (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). Interestingly,  DcTPS11 did also convert GGDP into a cembrene-like diterpene (Supplementary Fig.  S14).  DcTPS53 converted ( Z, Z)-FDP into bisabolenes and another putative sesquiterpene, and accepted GDP and NDP to make β-myrcene, limonene, γ-terpinene, and α-terpinolene (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11).  DcTPS42 converted GDP, NDP and ( Z, Z)-FDP to the monoterpene products β-myrcene and β-ocimene, limonene and α-terpinolene, and an α-bisabolene isomer, respectively (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). Several terpenes produced by the TPS-a type proteins from these alternative substrates are components of the DH1 terpene blends (Fig.  1). However, it remains unclear whether these enzymatic reactions occur  in vivo given the predicted cytosolic localization of the TPS-a enzymes and presumed limited availability of GDP, NDP, ( Z, Z)-FDP, and GGDP in this compartment. DcTPS19 and  DcTPS23 are Members of the TPS-g Subfamily Based on sequence similarity to characterized genes in the TPS-g subfamily 22, and the presence of a putative plastidial transit peptide, we predicted the recombinant protein of gene  DcTPS19 to function as a mono-TPS (Supplementary Fig.  S6).  DcTPS19 was found to be expressed at low levels in all tested tissues except young leaves (Fig.  3). The  DcTPS19 protein converted GDP (and NDP) into linalool but also accepted ( E,E)-FDP (and ( Z, Z)-FDP) as substrates to make nerolidol (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). Linalool could only be detected at low levels in leaves and may be further modified  in vivo to non-volatile derivatives, e.g. by glycosylation. Another gene in the TPS-g family,  DcTPS23, showed low expression in all tissues with highest transcript levels in petioles and roots (Fig.  3). Enzymatic activity of the recombinant  DcTPS23 protein was limited with all substrates (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). The remaining genes in the TPS-g subfamily ( DcTPS45,  DcTPS46, and  DcTPS60) were not characterized based on low levels of expression in roots or inability to amplify full-length cDNAs. Identification of TPS Gene Models in the Carrot Genome The carrot reference genome (Phytozome  v12,  Daucus carota v2.0, DH1), and publically available RNA-seq data sets (SRA SAMN03216637, cv. DH1) were queried for TPS genes using NCBI TBLASTX. We identified 52 putative TPS gene models including the 36 TPS genes previously predicted from DH1 by Iorizzo,  et al. 18. Although Iorizzo,  et al. 18 previously generated a TPS nomenclature based on chromosomal positioning, we adopted the most recent TPS naming system for  D. carota proposed by Keilwagen,  et al. 19. Comparisons of the 52 TPS gene models against the reference genome revealed 43 unique full-length open reading frames (Table  1). Several TPS genes are located in biochemical gene clusters on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, including a dense five gene cluster on chromosome 4 (Table  1, Supplementary Fig.  S1). Additional TPS gene models predicted by Keilwagen,  et al. 19 in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) were not pursued further due to low transcript levels in roots, inability to amplify a full-length transcript, or identity with previously annotated TPSs (Supplementary Figs.  S2 and  S3). Amino acid alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the 43 TPS proteins indicated that carrot TPSs are organized in six TPS sub-families according to the classification by Chen,  et al. 11 (Fig.  2; Supplementary Figs.  S4,  S5,  S6,  S7,  S8, and S9). We found that eight members cluster in the TPS-a sub-family ( DcTPS01,  DcTPS07,  DcTPS11,  DcTPS13,  DcTPS15,  DcTPS38,  DcTPS42 and  DcTPS53) including the previously characterized ( E)- \documentclass 12pt {minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\beta $$\end{document}β-caryophyllene synthase  DcTPS01 17. ChloroP analysis of subcellular localization indicated no putative transit peptides across the TPS-a clade, suggesting putative activity as sesqui-TPSs converting ( E,E) -FDP in the cytosol (Supplementary Table  S2). The TPS-b clade spans 22 members, of which 12 were predicted to carry plastidial transit peptide sequences ( DcTPS02 , DcTPS03 , DcTPS04,  DcTPS09 , DcTPS10,  DcTPS27 , DcTPS30,  DcTPS33,  DcTPS48 , DcTPS52 , DcTPS54 , DcTPS55) suggesting these proteins are targeted to plastids where they convert GDP into monoterpenes (Fig.  2; Supplementary Table  S2). We identified five type-g TPSs ( DcTPS19,  DcTPS23,  DcTPS45,  DcTPS46 and  DcTPS60), of which only  DcTPS19 was predicted to function as a mono-TPS based on a putative plastidic transit peptide (Fig.  2 and Supplementary Table  S2). The three members of the TPS-c clade ( DcTPS25 , DcTPS57, and  DcTPS59) were predicted to encode class II diterpene synthases based on the presence of the conserved DxDD motif required for the protonation-initiated cyclization of GGDP into bicyclic prenyl diphosphates including copalyl diphosphate 21. The TPS-e/f subfamily contains 3 members ( DcTPS28 , DcTPS29, and  DcTPS56) and generally includes predicted class I di-TPSs and mono-/sesqui-TPSs. Analysis of terpene volatiles in DH1 carrot leaves, petioles and roots Volatile terpenes were extracted from leaves, petioles, and roots of the doubled-haploid carrot DH1 and qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using GC-MS and GC-FID, respectively. We found that the tissues contained a diverse blend of terpene compounds including 18 major monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (Fig.  1). Leaf tissues contained high levels of the monoterpenes α-pinene, β-myrcene and ( E)-β-ocimene, and the sesquiterpenes δ-elemene, ( E)-β-caryophyllene and germacrene D (Fig.  1; Supplementary Table  S1). Comparable profiles were obtained from petioles with the exception of lower levels of β-myrcene and germacrene D (Fig.  1; Supplementary Table  S1). Root tissues showed reduced levels of α-pinene, and increased levels of γ-terpinene and α-terpinolene compared to above ground tissues (Fig.  1; Supplementary Table  S1). Other putative sesquiterpene volatiles were not reported due to low levels of abundance and lack of authentic standards or oils for verification. Characterization of TPS-b Clade Genes Five genes in the TPS-b clade ( DcTPS04,  DcTPS26,  DcTPS27,  DcTPS54 and  DcTPS55) were previously reported to reside in a dense TPS gene cluster on chromosome 4 and correlate with a QTL for sabinene and terpinen-4-ol production in roots (Table  1, Supplementary Fig.  S1) 19.  DcTPS04 and  DcTPS26 share ~88% sequence identity with a major difference attributed to the presence of a putative 44 amino acid plastidial transit peptide in  DcTPS04 (Supplementary Fig.  S5). Truncated  DcTPS04 and full-length  DcTPS26 produced similar volatile profiles with sabinene, limonene, β-myrcene, α-pinene, and α-terpineol from GDP (and NDP) (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). The same compounds were made by recombinant  DcTPS54 and  DcTPS55 from GDP (and NDP) (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). A full-length cDNA was obtained for  DcTPS27; however, the presence of an unspliced ~1 kb intron downstream of the first exon introduced a premature stop codon and the gene was therefore not further tested. It is possible that the plastid-targeted  DcTPS04,  DcTPS54 and  DcTPS55 proteins synthesize sabinene in roots although we did not detect this monoterpene as a major compound in DH1 tissues and found  DcTPS04 to be most highly expressed in the petiole (Figs.  1 and  3). Of the 22 genes in the TPS-b subfamily,  DcTPS02 was previously identified as a monoterpene synthase converting GDP into β-myrcene and geraniol 17. We further functionally characterized ten TPS b-type proteins ( DcTPS03,  DcTPS04,  DcTPS10,  DcTPS14,  DcTPS26,  DcTPS27,  DcTPS30,  DcTPS48,  DcTPS54 and  DcTPS55), of which all except  DcTPS14 and  DcTPS26 carry putative plastidial transit peptides (Supplementary Table  S2). Several of the characterized recombinant TPS-b type proteins also converted C 15 and C 20 prenyl diphosphate substrates under  in vitro conditions; however, the contribution of these reactions to sesquiterpene and diterpene formation in planta remains unclear based on the plastidial localization of the proteins, limited substrate availability, or absence of the enzymatic product in planta. Recombinant  DcTPS03 and  DcTPS48 showed limited sesquiterpene production with ( E,E) -FDP but made several bisabolene isomers from ( Z,Z)-FDP (Supplementary Fig.  S11).  DcTPS04 and  DcTPS26 produced several sesquiterpenes from ( E,E) -FDP (and ( Z,Z)-FDP) including α-bergamotenes ( DcTPS04) and β-bisabolene ( DcTPS26) (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). In addition,  DcTPS26 did convert GGDP into an unidentified diterpene hydrocarbon product (Supplementary Fig.  S14). DcTPS03, predicted to encode a root expressed mono-TPS based on transcriptome analysis, was found to be expressed at low levels in all tested tissues (Fig.  3). The truncated recombinant  DcTPS03 protein converted GDP into α-terpinolene, which is a dominant component of carrot root essential oil (Fig.  1). In addition,  DcTPS03 produced the monoterpenes α-phellandrene and limonene from GDP (and NDP) (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). In vitro enzyme assays with a truncated  DcTPS30 protein led to the conversion of GDP (and NDP) into  \documentclass 12pt {minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\gamma $$\end{document}γ-terpinene as the major product (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). Because of the predominant expression of the  DcTPS30 gene in DH1 roots it is likely that this gene is responsible for the accumulation of high levels of  \documentclass 12pt {minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\gamma $$\end{document}γ-terpinene in this tissue (Figs.  1 and  3). Expression of the gene  DcTPS48 was only detected in aboveground tissues and transcripts were highly enriched in mature leaves and petioles (Fig.  3). The partially purified  DcTPS48 enzyme converted GDP (and NDP) into linalool, which could only be found at low levels in mature leaves (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). The recombinant proteins of  DcTPS10 and  DcTPS14, although expressed in above and/or root tissues, did show only limited or no activity with any tested substrates (Figs.  3 and  4; Supplementary Fig.  S11). Other members of the TPS-b clade were not tested based on previous characterization ( DcTPS02) 17, low levels of constitutive expression, or inability to amplify a full-length transcript (Supplementary Fig.  S2;  DcTPS05,  DcTPS09,  DcTPS12,  DcTPS16,  DcTPS17,  DcTPS21,  DcTPS32,  DcTPS33,  DcTPS47,  DcTPS52, and  DcTPS62).","Carrot (Daucus carota L.) is an important root vegetable crop with high nutritional value, characteristic flavor, and benefits to human health. D. carota tissues produce an essential oil that is rich in volatile terpenes and plays a major role in carrot aroma and flavor. Although terpene composition represents a critical quality attribute of carrots, little is known about the biosynthesis of terpenes in this crop. Here, we functionally characterized 19 terpene synthase (TPS) genes in an orange carrot (genotype DH1) and compared tissue-specific expression profiles and in vitro products of their recombinant proteins with volatile terpene profiles from DH1 and four other colored carrot genotypes. In addition to the previously reported (E)-β-caryophyllene synthase (DcTPS01), we biochemically characterized several TPS proteins with direct correlations to major compounds of carrot flavor and aroma including germacrene D (DcTPS7/11), γ-terpinene (DcTPS30) and α-terpinolene (DcTPS03). Random forest analysis of volatiles from colored carrot cultivars identified nine terpenes that were clearly distinct among the cultivars and likely contribute to differences in sensory quality. Correlation of TPS gene expression and terpene metabolite profiles supported the function of DcTPS01 and DcTPS03 in these cultivars. Our findings provide a roadmap for future breeding efforts to enhance carrot flavor and aroma.",NaN," 'Supplementary Fig.', 'Fig.', 'Supplementary', 'Supplementary Table', 'TPS genes', 'TPS', 'usepackage', 'FDP', 'TPS gene', 'genes' "," B493B, Boruta, B493B, RNA-seq, carrots, DcTPS26, E, E)-FDP, DcTPS03, DcTPS54, Z)-FDP, TPS, DH1, root-expressed, DcTPS03, DcTPS04, DcTPS27, E, E)-FDP, Z)-FDP, DcTPS28, TPS-e/f type, RNA-seq, DcTPS28, DcTPS29, class I diterpene synthase, GGDP, pGGeC, GGDP, \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\gamma, \end{document}γ-domain, class II diterpene cyclase, GGDP, thaliana copalyl diphosphate synthase, TPS-a Clade, E)- \documentclass 12pt {minimal, \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym, \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb}, \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs, \usepackage{upgreek}, \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\beta, \end{document}β-caryophyllene synthase, TPS-a type, DcTPS11, DcTPS15, DcTPS42, DcTPS11, E, E)-FDP, E)-FDP (Fig.  4, root-expressed, E)-FDP, DcTPS13, TPS-a type proteins, Z)-FDP, Z)-FDP, GGDP, cembrene-like, Z)-FDP, Z)-FDP, α-terpinolene, TPS-a type, TPS-a enzymes, Z)-FDP, GGDP, E, E)-FDP, Z)-FDP, TPS-g, DH1, SRA SAMN03216637, DH1, Iorizzo, 8, DcTPS01, E)- \documentclass 12pt {minimal, \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym, \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb}, \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs, \usepackage{upgreek}, \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\beta, \end{document}β-caryophyllene synthase  DcTPS01, sesqui-TPSs converting, DcTPS02, DcTPS03, DcTPS04, DcTPS10, DcTPS30, DcTPS52, DcTPS54, type-g TPSs, DcTPS19, DcTPS57, class II diterpene, GGDP, copalyl diphosphate 21, DcTPS28, DcTPS29, class I di-TPSs, mono-/sesqui-TPSs, α-pinene, TPS-b Clade, DcTPS04, α-pinene, α-terpineol, TPS b-type, DcTPS03, TPS-b type, C, C 20, Z)-FDP, E) -FDP, Z)-FDP, α-bergamotenes, DcTPS04, GGDP, DcTPS03, α-terpinolene, \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym, \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb}, \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs, \usepackage{upgreek}, \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\gamma, \end{document}γ-terpinene, \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym, \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb}, \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs, \usepackage{upgreek}, \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\gamma, \end{document}γ-terpinene, DcTPS02 "," 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS01', 'DcTPS01', 'DcTPS03.', 'TPS', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS03,', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS54)', 'TPS', 'DcTPS10,', 'DcTPS16,', 'DcTPS33,', 'DcTPS42).', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS03,', 'DcTPS10,', 'DcTPS11,', 'DcTPS14,', 'DcTPS15,', 'DcTPS25,', 'DcTPS26,', 'DcTPS28', 'DcTPS30),', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS07,', 'DcTPS19,', 'DcTPS23,', 'DcTPS42,', 'DcTPS48,', 'DcTPS53)', 'TPS', 'DcTPS27,', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55)', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS28', 'TPS-e/f', 'TPS-e/f', 'DcTPS28,', 'DcTPS29', 'DcTPS56),', 'DcTPS28', 'DcTPS28', 'DcTPS28', 'DcTPS25', 'DcTPS28', 'DcTPS25', 'TPS-c', 'TPS-c', 'TPS', 'TPS-c', 'DcTPS25', 'DcTPS57', 'DcTPS59', 'DcTPS25', 'TPS-a', 'DcTPS01,', 'TPS-a', 'DcTPS07,', 'DcTPS11,', 'DcTPS15,', 'DcTPS42,', 'DcTPS53', 'DcTPS11', 'DcTPS11', 'DcTPS07,', 'DcTPS11', 'DcTPS07', 'TPS-a', 'DcTPS53,', 'DcTPS15', 'DcTPS42', 'TPS-a', 'DcTPS0117),', 'DcTPS13', 'DcTPS38).', 'TPS-a', 'DcTPS11', 'DcTPS11', 'DcTPS53', 'DcTPS42', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'DcTPS19', 'DcTPS23', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-g', 'DcTPS19', 'mono-TPS', 'DcTPS19', 'DcTPS19', 'TPS-g', 'DcTPS23,', 'DcTPS23', 'TPS-g', 'DcTPS45,', 'DcTPS46,', 'DcTPS60)', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'DcTPS01,', 'DcTPS07,', 'DcTPS11,', 'DcTPS13,', 'DcTPS15,', 'DcTPS38,', 'DcTPS42', 'DcTPS53)', 'DcTPS01', 'TPS-a', 'sesqui-TPSs', 'TPS-b', 'DcTPS02', 'DcTPS03', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS09', 'DcTPS10,', 'DcTPS27', 'DcTPS30,', 'DcTPS33,', 'DcTPS48', 'DcTPS52', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55)', 'TPSs', 'DcTPS19,', 'DcTPS23,', 'DcTPS45,', 'DcTPS46', 'DcTPS60),', 'DcTPS19', 'mono-TPS', 'TPS-c', 'DcTPS25', 'DcTPS57,', 'DcTPS59)', 'TPS-e/f', 'DcTPS28', 'DcTPS29,', 'DcTPS56)', 'di-TPSs', 'mono-/sesqui-TPSs.', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-b', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS26,', 'DcTPS27,', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55)', 'TPS', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55', 'DcTPS27;', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55', 'DcTPS04', 'TPS-b', 'DcTPS02', 'TPS', 'DcTPS03,', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS10,', 'DcTPS14,', 'DcTPS26,', 'DcTPS27,', 'DcTPS30,', 'DcTPS48,', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55),', 'DcTPS14', 'DcTPS26', 'TPS-b', 'DcTPS03', 'DcTPS48', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS04)', 'DcTPS26)', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS03,', 'mono-TPS', 'DcTPS03', 'DcTPS03', 'DcTPS30', 'DcTPS30', 'DcTPS48', 'DcTPS48', 'DcTPS10', 'DcTPS14,', 'TPS-b', 'DcTPS02)', 'DcTPS05,', 'DcTPS09,', 'DcTPS12,', 'DcTPS16,', 'DcTPS17,', 'DcTPS21,', 'DcTPS32,', 'DcTPS33,', 'DcTPS47,', 'DcTPS52,', 'DcTPS62).'

61,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC4798728/eupmc_result.json,PMC4798728,"Results and Discussion Analysis of  A.  lancea unigenes related to sesquiterpenoids biosynthesis The study on the biochemical properties of enzymes for sesiquiterpenes biosynthesis has made substantial progress in the past years, such as discovery of committed enzymatic steps in the biosynthesis of sesiquiterpenes   66,  67 . However, the identification and cloning of these enzymes are more challenging. Other than β-caryophyllene synthase, germacrene D synthase, E-β-farnesene synthase and germacrene A synthase, there are a few similar genes have been elucidated like tomato sesquiterpene synthase (Sst1) and Sst2   68 , aoeghum terpene synthase (SbTPS1-SbTPS7)   69 , and a Cstps1, a sesquiterpene synthase-encoding genes for citurs aroma formation   70 . In our annotation database, we could sort out a bunch of sesquiterpene synthases. But due to the structural similarity between the sesquiterpenes, the sesquiterpene synthases also come with a close homology. Future study may explain whether those sesquiterpene synthase candidates can be grouped into further subgroups of each with the specificity to one kind of sesquiterpene. Sesquiterpenoids are derived from FPP which can be cyclized to produce various structures by different types of enzymes   63 . In this study, 19 contigs/unigenes (≥200 bp) were annotated to be involved in four different types of sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis, which includes β-caryophyllene synthase, germacrene D synthase, E-β-farnesene synthase and germacrene A synthase ( Fig 1). These contigs/unigenes are CL4471.contig1_ALL, CL8689.contig1_ALL, Unigene14966_All, Unigene20711_All, Unigene20756_All, Unigene20757_All Unigene21327_All, Unigene21328_All, Unigene21329_All, Unigene21417_All, Unigene23621_All, Unigene25222_All, Unigene32673_All, Unigene33174_All, Unigene33794_All, Unigene34375_All, CL1332.Contig1_All, CL1748.Contig6_All and CL5528.Contig1_All. We noticed that, the above four sesquiterpenoid synthases share a high homology and it is difficult to separate them from each other without experimental confirmation. Furthermore, these enzymes are also homologous to sesquiterpene cyclase, β-pinene synthase, α-isocomene synthase, etc. All these enzymes are commonly grouped as sesquiterpene synthases. However, only one potential unigene (CL5528.Contig1_All) among the 19 sesquiterpene synthases is predicted to be germacrene A synthase with certainty. In another case, β-eudesmol synthase was reported for the specific sesquiterpene β-eudesmol biosynthesis   64 . But we were unable to find any candidate could match the enzyme with the current searching criteria. Previous study showed that βeudesmol was not always present in  A.  lancea samples   23,  24 , In our study β-eudesmol synthase was not detected either because the gene expression was too low to be captured or because of the poor fragmentation or enrichment during the process of RNA-Seq. It is very intriguing to pinpoint all enzymes especially for  A.  lancea sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. Previous study indicates that cytochrome P450 oxidase (CYP) plays an important role in generation of all kinds of terpenoid derivatives   65 . In a search of all possible CYPs encoded by the  A.  lancea transcriptome, a total of 3,241 CYP contigs were found in the Nr annotation. Further filtration of redundant contigs with possibly the same predicted functions, the CYP quantity was narrowed down to 369 ( S1 Table), however, it is still 1.5 times more than that of Arabidopsis thaliana   65 , indicating a more sophisticated chemical process and diversity. Besides the sesquiterpene, there are other kinds of terpenes with less content in the  A.  Lancea. It correlates with the discovery of a large number of CYP genes, of which some are predicted to be terpene modifiers. All these components lay the foundation of chemical diversity for the fact that it treats various diseases. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the leaf vs. stem, leaf vs. root and root vs. stem in  A.  lancea A major function of the transcriptome sequencing is for comparison of levels of gene expression among different samples. To check the differences in expression of gene among three libraries from the leaf, stem and root, the tag frequencies of leaf vs. stem, leaf vs. root and root vs. stem were used. Through FPKM method (fragments per kb per million reads) all-unigene expressions were calculated. Firstly fragments density measures was normalized and for judgment of significance of gene expression false discovery rate(FDR) < 0.001 were used and the total value of |log2Ratio| ≥ 1 was used as a threshold. In  Fig 6 the result shows a two-fold transcript difference among three libraries. We identified 22543, 18263 and 16370 unigenes in leaf vs. stem, leaf vs. root and root vs. stem libraries respectively that were differently expressed in all three libraries ( S2 Table). Of these 11642, 8668 and 9038 unigenes were up-regulated and 10901, 9605 and 7232 unigenes in three libraries were down-regulated regulated by the log2 ratio bigger than 2 or less than 0.5 of leaf vs. stem, leaf vs. root and root vs. stem, respectively. It also showed among these differential expression genes, most were found expressed in the root, and then the stem and leaf. One assumption is that the diverse chemical synthesis of the plant is largely processed in the root. SSR markers development in  Atractylodes lancea SSRs are used as chief molecular markers. These repetitive DNA sequences symbolize a vital section of an advanced eukaryote genome. These typically co ascendant and highly polymorphic are widely utilized for marker systems of genetic mapping, molecular breeding in a wide variety of species   71– 76 . In order to develop SSR markers in  A.  lancea and find potential microsatellites, all the 62,352 unigenes produced in current study were utilized, for all motifs they were defined as bi-hexa nucleotide SSR with at least four repeating units (except for di-nucleotide with a minimum of six repeating units, and tri-nucleotide with a minimum of five repeats). By using different primers ( S1 Table), total of 6,864 microsatellites were identified in 5,970 unigenes, 757 unigenes contained more than 1 SSR. Di-nucleotide motifs were found to be the most abundant types (3,122, 45.48%), followed by tri-nucleotide (2,307, 33.61%), hexa-nucleotide (432, 6.29%), penta-nucleotide (303, 4.41%) and tetra-nucleotide (130, 1.89%), ( Table 3). In our current study,  AG/CT repeat was found the most abundant motif among all the searched SSRs, (2252, 32.80%), followed by  AC/GT (523, 7.61%),  ACC/GGT (505, 7.35%), and  AAG/CTT (484, 7.05%) ( Fig 7). Conventional methods for SSR marker development are expensive, arduous and time-consuming. The newly discovered and developed high-throughput sequencing technique is a powerful and cheap tool for transcriptome sequencing   77 . For microsatellite mining, SSR markers are being developed by the transcriptome data, and had been utilized in many species   55,  78,  79 . Functional annotation of  A.  lancea unigenes The species distribution of the non-redundant (Nr) annotation is shown in  Fig 3. There was 23.79% of unigenes shown the highest homology to genes from grape ( Vitis vinifera), 9.5% of unigenes matched to potato ( Solanum tuberosum), 8.1% of unigenes matched to cacao ( Theobroma cacao), 6.6% of unigenes matched to tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum) and 5.8% & 5.1% of unigenes matched to populus ( Populus trichocarpa) and peach ( Prunus persica), respectively. All the  A.  lancea unigenes from different tissues were predicted via BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) with a cut-off E-value of 10 −5 in public databases such as non-redundant (NR), SWISS-PROT, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), classification of Orthologous Group (COG), and gene ontology (GO), which retrieved higher sequence similarity proteins among specific unigenes beside their functional annotations. From the BLAST results, a total of 43,049 (69.04%), 30,264 (48.53%), 26,233 (42.07%), 17,881(28.67%) and 29,057(46.60%) unigenes showed diverse similarity to well-known proteins in above mentioned databases, respectively ( Table 2). However, 44,482 unigene (71.34%) sequence orientations are still unknown, which is higher than the peanut ( A.  hypogaea) (27.8%)   44  but lower than that of Chinese tulip tree ( Liriodendron chinense) (73.60%)   53 . This is because of the lack of  A.  lancea genomic information, and few or no effective characterized protein domains of the shorter sequences for getting BLAST hits. Also, it is possible that some un-matched unigenes are the novel genes specific for  A.  lancea. Functional classification of  A.  lancea unigenes by GO, COG and KEGG For further recognition of the interaction and biological functions of genes in the  A.  lancea, KEGG was used to make canonical pathways as reference mapping of all annotated sequences   57 . KEEG was employed as a reference database of pathway networks for integration and interpretation of large scale datasets generated by high-throughput sequencing technology   58,  59 . On the fact that some unigenes were recruited in several KEGG pathways during the analysis, 26,233 unigenes were assigned to 128 KEGG pathways ( S1 Table), of which most represented by Metabolic Pathway (5971 unigenes, 22.76% of annotated to KEGG database), followed by “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” (2957 unigenes, 11.27% of annotated to KEGG database), “plant-pathogen interactions” (1608 unigenes, 6.13% of annotated to KEGG database), “Plant hormone signal transduction” (1396 unigenes, 5.32%of annotated to KEGG database) and “Ribosome” (1174 unigenes, 4.48% of annotated to KEGG database). For categorizing the function of predicted  A.  lancea unigenes gene, ontology (GO) annotation was used   54 . In total, 29,057 unigenes were selected for three main GO categories and 56 subcategories ( Fig 4). It shows that “metabolic process”, “cellular process”, “binding” and “catalytic activity” are the most dominant category involving more than 180,000 unigenes, while a small portion of genes were linked with terms such as “pigmentation”, “receptor regulator activity” and “protein tag”. It is interesting to observe that 20,169 unigenes from GO analysis had not been annotated in the Swiss-Prot database, which could be explained by the fact that the prediction quality could be significantly improved by GO annotation as the clustering of proteins determine their sub cellular locations reflection in a better way   55 . To further expose the value of annotation process and predict possible functions of unigenes, we looked for the annotated sequences for genes involved in the classification of orthologous group (COG) to classify the orthologous products of genes   56 . COG database was used for the alignment and for prediction and classification of possible function of all  A.  lancea unigenes. Results revealed that 17,881 unigenes were recognized as 25 COG classifications ( Fig 5). In 25 COG categories, the largest group represents “general function prediction (5837 unigenes)”, second cluster was ‘transcription’ (3105 unigenes) and then ‘replication, recombination & repair’ (2732 unigenes). It was also observed that just a few genes found related to the terms as “extracellular structures” and “Nuclear structures"". A.  lancea transcriptome sequencing and unigene assembly To clarify a comprehensive overview of gene expression profiles in  A.  lancea tissues, the construction of cDNA libraries were made from different samples of leaf, root and stem of  A.  lancea, respectively and sequenced by the Illumina transcriptome platform in our experiments. After removal of adaptor sequences and low quality reads, a total of 43,921,277, 37,866,604 and 40,135,278 clean reads were acquired from leaf, root and stem tissues, respectively ( Table 1). These data sizes are bigger than those from peanut ( Arachis hypogaea)   44 , yellow horn ( Xanthoceras sorbifolium)   50 , siberian apricot ( Prunus sibirica)   51  and Centella ( Centella asiatica)   52 , suggesting that the relatively complete read databases were successfully constructed from different tissues of  A.  lancea by Illumina sequencing. Subsequently, Trinity software was used for assembly of these clean reads (Trinityrnaseq_r2013_08_14) and low density and quality reads were filtered out, resulting in 64,106, 55,409 and 56,565 unigenes in the leaves, root and stem respectively. After  de novo assembly of three  A.  lancea tissues, 62,352 unigenes were finally obtained with an average length of 913 bp ( Table 1). Among these, 42127 unigenes having a length range between 300 nt to 1000 nt and 15263 unigenes having a length longer than 1 kb (>1000 nt) as shown in  Fig 2. Furthermore, we found that the sum of unigenes (62,352) in  A.  lancea is more than the identified number of unigenes 59,236 in peanut ( A.  hypogaea)   44 , 51,867 unigenes in yellow horn ( X.  sorbifolium)   50  and 46,940 unigenes in Siberian apricot ( P.  sibirica)   51 . Analysis of  A.  lancea unigenes related to terpenoid backbonebiosynthesis Based on the Nr annotation, a total of 77 Contigs/unigenes were identified as the genes of MVA pathway, that include acetyl CoA C-acetyltransferase (AACT), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase (HMGS), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR), mevalonate kinase (MK), phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase (MDC), isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPPI), geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS), farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), beta-caryophyllene synthase (QHS1), germacrene D synthase (GDS), germacrene A synthase (GAS) and E-β-farnesene synthase (β-FS). These genes produce β-caryophyllene, germacrene D, germacrene A and E-β-farnesene four different types of sesquiterpenoids   21,  60– 62 . It also has to be pointed out that due to the limitation of short reads of RNA-seq, some unigenes assembled by the software are too short to represent real transcripts. Other unigenes are long enough to cover one or two domains of usual protein size, but they are almost identical to a longer transcript except a small part of the fragments. These unigenes are likely from one gene, possibly generated with selective transcripts or assembly error. In the end, we predicted 33 unigenes that are responsible for the enzymatic synthesis of MVA pathway ( Fig 1). Nevertheless, these unigenes need to be approved by future cloning. Based on our analysis, up to 10 non-redundant unigenes were present in the plastidal MEP pathway, liable for the synthesis of the isopentenyl diphosphate that is the building block of terpenoids. These included 2 unigenes for 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS), two unigenes for 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), 1 unigene for 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyl transferase (MCT), 2 unigenes for 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (CMK), 1 unigene for 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2, 4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MECPS), 1 unigenes for 4-hydroxy-3-methyl but-2-(E)-enyl diphosphate (HDS), and 1 unigene for 4-hydroxy-3-methyl but-2-(E)-enyl diphosphate reductase (HDR). It is shown that most of candidate genes from the MEP pathway were up-regulated in leaves except DXPS and DXR. One DXPS (CL8765.Contig3_All) is up-regulated in the root and one (Unigene15742_All) is down-regulated in the stem. While in case of HDR, out of two unigene, (CL5530.Contig1_All) is up-regulated in the root ( S1 Table). We also found that the genes from MEP pathway showed higher expression in leaves than in root and stem at the transcriptional level. Only one unigene was found codifying the isopentenyl diphosphate delta-isomerase which catalyzes the alteration of isopentenyl diphosphate Dimethylallyl diphosphate. Moreover, we found that prenyl-transferases, which generates higher-order building blocks: farnesyl diphosphate synthase (2 contigs/ unigene) and geranyl diphosphate synthase (8 unigenes), are the originator of different categories of terpenoids. The protein sequences of all the transcripts are provided in  S1 Table. Discovery of simple nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) Innovating SNPs from cDNA libraries mapping revealed 91,540; 81,678 and 87,329 SNPs across 112,883; 94,663 and 101,679 contigs in leaves, root and stem of  A.  lancea, respectively ( Table 4). A total of 260,547 heterozygous SNPs were detected from all three samples and out of these 165,120 were transitions and 95,427 were transversions ( Fig 8). We also found several prospective SNP markers, which can be beneficial for the phylogenetic and population genetic studies of  A.  lancea. The identified SNP markers can be constructive to assist in genetic mark of selection for genetic association analysis in further research and also for identification of functional variations   80,  81 . The identification of huge SNPs provides affluence of potential markers to be helpful in various applications, such as linkage mapping, population genetics, and gene-based association studies and comparative genomics.","Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC., named ""Cangzhu"" in China, which belongs to the Asteraceae family. In some countries of Southeast Asia (China, Thailand, Korea, Japan etc.) its rhizome, commonly called rhizoma atractylodis, is used to treat many diseases as it contains a variety of sesquiterpenoids and other components of medicinal importance. Despite its medicinal value, the information of the sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome analysis of different tissues of non-model plant A. lancea by using short read sequencing technology (Illumina). We found 62,352 high quality unigenes with an average sequence length of 913 bp in the transcripts of A. Lancea. Among these, 43,049 (69.04%), 30,264 (48.53%), 26,233 (42.07%), 17,881 (28.67%) and 29,057(46.60%) unigenes showed significant similarity (E-value<1e(-5)) to known proteins in Nr, KEGG, SWISS-PROT, GO, and COG databases, respectively. Of the total 62,352 unigenes, 43,049 (Nr Database) open reading frames were predicted. On the basis of different bioinformatics tools we identify all the enzymes that take part in the terpenoid biosynthesis as well as five different known sesquiterpenoids via cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway and plastidal methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. In our study, 6, 864 Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were also found as great potential markers in A. lancea. This transcriptomic resource of A. lancea provides a great contribution in advancement of research for this specific medicinal plant and more specifically for the gene mining of different classes of terpenoids and other chemical compounds that have medicinal as well as economic importance.",NaN," 'unigenes', 'synthase', 'lancea unigenes', 'lancea', 'root', 'Table', 'genes', 'sesquiterpene synthases', 'unigene', 'KEGG' "," β-caryophyllene synthase, E-β-farnesene, germacrene A synthase, Sst1, Sst2   68 , aoeghum terpene synthase, Cstps1, β-caryophyllene synthase, E-β-farnesene, germacrene A synthase, CL4471.contig1_ALL, CL8689.contig1_ALL, Unigene14966_All, Unigene20711_All, Unigene20756_All, Unigene20757_All Unigene21327_All, Unigene21328_All, Unigene21329_All, Unigene21417_All, Unigene23621_All, Unigene25222_All, Unigene32673_All, Unigene33174_All, Unigene33794_All, Unigene34375_All, CL1332.Contig1_All, CL1748.Contig6_All, β-pinene synthase, β-eudesmol, β-eudesmol, βeudesmol, β-eudesmol, cytochrome P450 oxidase, CYP, CYPs, CYP, CYP, CYP, ≥ 1, 22543, 16370, 62,352, bi-hexa nucleotide, SSRs, SWISS-PROT, 30,264, 26,233, 29,057(46.60, 44,482 unigene, 26,233, “, ”, “, ” (1608, “Plant hormone, ”, 5.32%of, “, ” (1174 unigenes, “, ”, ”, “binding, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “receptor, ”, “protein, ”, Swiss-Prot, “, ‘, ’ (3105 unigenes, ‘, “extracellular structures”, “Nuclear structures, 43,921,277, 37,866,604, peanut (, Trinityrnaseq_r2013_08_14, 62,352, 62,352, peanut, 46,940, Contigs/unigenes, AACT, HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, geranyl diphosphate synthase, GPPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, FPPS, QHS1, E-β-farnesene synthase, β-FS, β-caryophyllene, E-β-farnesene, RNA-seq, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, MCT, 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2, 4-cyclodiphosphate synthase, MECPS, 4-hydroxy-3-methyl but-2-(E)-enyl diphosphate, 4-hydroxy-3-methyl but-2-(E)-enyl diphosphate reductase, DXPS, DXPS, CL8765.Contig3_All, Unigene15742_All, CL5530.Contig1_All, isopentenyl diphosphate delta-isomerase, prenyl-transferases, farnesyl diphosphate synthase (2 contigs/, geranyl diphosphate synthase (8, 91,540, 81,678, 87,329, 94,663, 101,679, 260,547, 165,120, 95,427, 8) ", '(SbTPS1-SbTPS7)' ,  , 'lycopersicum)' ,terpene synthase

In order to assess the impact of  T. harzianum T22 on tomato defense response against aphids, the transcriptome of tomato plants treated with  Trichoderma and subsequently infested by aphids (T22Aph) was analyzed. T22Aph transcriptome reprogramming involved 1527 transcripts: 602 up- and 925 down-regulated ( Supplementary Table 4).  Trichoderma colonization strongly affected GO categories involved in plant metabolism and stress response during aphid infestation ( Figure 5). The enrichment analysis was performed in order to underline significant over-represented GO categories relative to Biological Process ontological domain. Interestingly, some enriched GO term categories were associated with direct and indirect defenses, as they include genes involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis, induced systemic resistance and JA-mediated signaling pathway ( Supplementary Figure 3;  Supplementary Tables 4A,B). An example of defense-related DEGs is shown in  Table 5. Among early signals, calmodulin-binding proteins and Ca 2+ transporters were also over-represented as several classes of kinases and receptor-kinases (serine/threonine kinases, receptor-like kinases, LRR-RLKs, MAPKKK). Furthermore, transcripts related to ROS production and scavenging such as GST, peroxidases, oxidoreductases, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and detoxification protein were up-regulated. Other up-regulated genes coded for Lipoxygenases, involved in early stages of JA biosynthesis, Polyphenol oxidase (PPO), Leucine aminopeptidase (LapA), and proteinase inhibitor (MCPI) involved in later stages of defense besides several classes of defense genes-related TF (GRAS, WRKY, MYB, bZIP). Moreover, a transcript encoding for a cysteine protease inhibitor (Multicystatine), associated with aphid growth inhibition (Rahbé et al.,  2003; Emani,  2018), was up-regulated while the number of down-regulated transcripts encoding proteinase inhibitors was reduced in comparison with what observed following aphid infestation. A strong impact on hormone-controlled defense pathways was observed: ethylene biosynthesis and signaling as well as salicylic acid biosynthesis and signaling were up-regulated in T22Aph plants ( Supplementary Table 4;  Table 5). Notably, compared to T22, T22Aph were characterized by a strong down-regulation of key-steps in the phenylpropanoid pathway ( Table 5). Key Genes Regulated by the Interaction T22-Tomato-Aphid The intersection between down-regulated genes of Aph and T22Aph samples is shown through a Venn diagram representation ( Figure 6B). Common genes repressed in both conditions are listed in  Supplementary Table 5C. A large group of genes of phenylpropanoid pathways (i.e.,  phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, and others) resulted down-regulated in both conditions. Interestingly, a large number of glycosyltransferases resulted strongly repressed in both conditions, indicating that they could represent a peculiar aspect of tomato-aphid interaction, independently from  T. harzianum T22 influence ( Supplementary Table 5C). Genes specifically repressed in the bipartite interaction (Aph) are 683 ( Figure 6B;  Supplementary Table 5D) and include JA-related genes as those coding for Phospholipase, Lipoxygenases A, C and D, Leucine aminopeptidase A1 and several classes of proteinase inhibitors ( Table 5). In order to assess if  T. harzianum T22 is able to overturn the expression of aphid-repressed genes in tomato, the 683 specifically down-regulated transcripts in Aph samples were compared with genes induced by T22 (T22;  Supplementary Table 2A), underlining an overturning of the expression of three genes listed in  Table 7. The transcription factor bHLH may be associated with JA signaling (Zhou and Memelink,  2016) while the steroid dehydrogenase, involved in steroid and squalene biosynthesis, is a precursor of triterpenes. Finally, the GDSL esterase/lipase belong to a very large subfamily of lipolytic enzymes. In order to assess the contribution of  T. harzianum T22 in the priming of defenses against aphids, genes specifically regulated in the tripartite interaction were analyzed.  Supplementary Tables 5A,B list unique genes modulated in their expression during the T22-Tomato-Aphid interaction (T22Aph samples,  Figure 6A). These genes are specifically induced by aphid challenge in presence of  Trichoderma priming. Among the up-regulated ones, genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling emerge ( Table 6), as well as those associated with amino acid metabolism ( asparagine synthase 1, glutamate receptor 1.2, proline dehydrogenase). Unique down-regulated genes ( Supplementary Table 5B;  Table 6) included several members of WRKY family of transcription factors, known for their promotion of JA signaling in the negative interplay with SA pathway (Li et al.,  2004; Takatsuji,  2014). Figure 6A shows that aphid repression of tomato genes (1179 down-regulated genes in Aph) was reduced by  T. harzianum T22 colonization in T22Aph (925 down-regulated genes in T22Aph). Plant Transcriptome Reprogramming Induced by Aphids Overall, at primary metabolism level, aphid infestation strongly repressed transcripts of enzymes associated with sugar (i.e.,  Fructose-bisphosphatealdolase and  Sucrose synthase) and amino acid (i.e.,  Threonine deaminase and  Tryptophan synthase) pathways, which are involved in the plant defense responses against biotic and abiotic stresses (Conklin and Last,  1995; Brader et al.,  2001; Wilkinson et al.,  2001; Chen et al.,  2005; Tauzin and Giardina,  2014; Lv et al.,  2017). Several other down-regulated genes were involved in photosynthetic activities, chlorophyll biosynthesis, polyamine and phenylpropanoids-related metabolism ( Table 4). Studies on tomato- M. euphorbiae interaction and on the relative transcriptomic changes have been already reported, although using other tomato cultivars, different time points and diverse transcriptomic approaches (Avila et al.,  2012; Coppola et al.,  2013). Here we carried out a transcriptomic study of the SM cultivar challenged with  M. euphorbiae for 48 h, through RNA-Seq approach. Tomato plants infested by  M. euphorbiae showed 625 up-regulated and 1179 down-regulated transcripts ( Supplementary Table 3). Major GO categories associated with plant defense were “response to stress,” “response to stimulus” and “oxidation-reduction process” ( Figure 4). The distribution and the enrichment analysis of GO terms associated with DEGs induced by aphid infestation underlined the predominance of categories related to the regulation of gene expression as “RNA methylation,” “ncRNA processing,” “Ribosome assembly,” “rRNA metabolic process,” “translation,” “mRNA cleavage,” “defense response to bacterium” ( Supplementary Figure 2). The increase of several transcripts coding for kinase/phosphatase/receptor-like kinase as well as of transcripts coding for proteins involved in oxidative burst and scavenging was observed ( Supplementary Table 3A). Genes coding for several classes of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR) (PR5, PR10, Chitinase, Subtilisin), genes associated with salicylic acid and genes involved in ethylene signaling were also up-regulated upon aphid attack ( Supplementary Table 3A). A large number of DEGs were down-regulated ( Supplementary Table 3B and  Table 4), including key genes of plant immunity, such as MAP Kinases and WRKY. Interestingly, a strong down-regulation was observed for transcripts associated with JA pathway, as those coding for lipoxygenases and protease inhibitors. Other down-regulated transcripts code for glycosyltransferases and genes associated with terpene production, such as sesquiterpene synthase 1 and geranylgeranyl reductase. Metabolomic Analysis Targeted semi-polar metabolomes were used to generate a Hierarchical Clustering (HCL), applied both on columns and rows, in order to study the global relationships within leaves treated with  M. euphorbiae and/or  T. harzianumT22 ( Figure 8). Interestingly, two distinct groups were produced, with one-to-one interactions (aphid or fungus, Aph vs. CTRL and T22 vs. CTRL) on the left side, and the three-way interactions (T22Aph vs. T22) clustering alone. As expected, metabolites displaying similar trends of related accumulation over the controls grouped together like, for instance, a set of alkaloids in the initial part and one of phenylpropanoids in the central parts of the HCL. In order to analyse the downstream effects of the transcriptomic reprogramming induced by  M. euphorbiae attack, in the absence or presence of the antagonist fungus  T. harzianum T22, we performed a global metabolic profiling of the leaf semi-polar fraction by LC-ESI(+)-MS (for more details, see “Materials and methods). First of all, to gain a general overview of the metabolic changes occurring under the different experimental conditions, we carried an untargeted metabolomics analysis, using the SIEVE software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Through alignment of all mass chromatograms with the subsequent retrieval of all detected ions, we built a 3D Principal Component Analysis (PCA) diagram ( Supplementary Figure 5), which showed a clear separation of the leaves treated with  T. harzianum and, to a lower extent, infested by aphids in the presence of the fungus. To investigate the changes of known tomato leaf metabolites, we then performed a targeted metabolomic analysis in which we quantified, in a relative way, 135 metabolites involved in primary (amino acids, amines, sugars, organic acids, lipids, vitamins, etc) and secondary (alkaloids, amides, phenylpropanoids, isoprenoids) pathways. The complete metabolite dataset is reported in  Supplementary Table 7 and  Supplementary Figure 6, while the lists of the differentially accumulated metabolites (DAM) in each comparison (T22/CTRL, Aph/CTRL, and T22Aph/T22) are reported in  Supplementary Table 6. Heatmap visualization was used as first attempt to understand the real impact of the aphid and fungus treatments on the leaf metabolome ( Supplementary Figure 6). Globally, most of the alterations in leaves grown in the presence of  M. euphorbiae or  T. harzianum were of negative sign (e.g., lower levels in the treated over the control) and particularly affected secondary metabolism (alkaloids and phenylpropanoids). We used Venn diagram visualization ( Figure 7;  Supplementary Table 8) to highlight the number of common and specific DAMs in relation to the three interactions under study: interestingly, 29 metabolites resulted present in all the comparisons and 17 out of them displayed variations of the same sign. A group of metabolites was specifically highlighted in T22 plants, and included ADP, AMP, citric acid, dihydro-caffeic acid,2-hydroxyglutarate, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), coumarin, syringaldehyde and tetrahydrofolate being down-accumulated in T22 vs. CTRL and T22Aph vs. T22, and up-represented in Aph vs. CTRL; and Uroporphyrinogen III and Galactonate/Gluconate, showing an opposite trend. Interestingly, over-represented metabolites retrieved in T22 samples are precursors of salicylic acid: Salicylate β-D-glucose ester and Salicyloyl-L-aspartic acid, have a concentration three times higher than the control. Furthermore, Phenylalanine, Coumaric and chorismic acids, member of phenilpropanoids and known for their possible flow into primary steps of salicylic acid biosynthesis, in T22 samples are about 5 times higher than in control ( Supplementary Table 6). Fourteen metabolites were found to be specifically associated with the presence of  T. harzianum (T22 vs. CTRL and T22Aph vs. Aph comparisons), mostly with alterations of negative sign (indicated in  Supplementary Table 6 with a cross). Finally, 7 DAMs each were exclusive for T22Aph vs. T22; among them, δ-tomatine (an alkaloid), N-isovalerylglycine and threonine/homoserine (amino acids) and protoporphyrinogen IX, an isoprenoid associated with tissue necrosis, were detected at lower levels over the control. At the opposite, the amino acid glutamic acid, the sugar phosphate glycerate-2-P/glycerate-3-Pand the lipid CDP-choline displayed a higher accumulation in T22Aph leaves over the CTRL. T22 and T22Aph were found to share 32 metabolites: interestingly, most of them varied differently between the two comparisons, with the exception of shikimic acid and dihydrokaempferol-7-O-glucoside, and raffinose/melezitose, respectively, down- and over-accumulated in both T22 and T22Aph. In the group of compounds showing higher accumulation in T22Aph, two relevant alkaloids were found (α-/β-tomatine), together with other compounds (indicated in  Supplementary Table 6 with a hash mark). On the contrary, a group comprising the amide feruloylputrescine and other compounds (indicated in  Supplementary Table 6 with an asterisk), resulted more abundant in T22 vs. CTRL than T22Aph vs. T22. Notably, no common compounds were found between T22Aph and Aph. Finally, we exploited the untargeted metabolomes to retrieve new ions not included in our targeted database and specific for the four conditions under investigation ( Supplementary Table 9). Twenty-two ions were found, which were subjected to metabolomics database interrogation, and isotopic pattern ratio, literature search and standard (where available) validations. For nine of them, an identification already reported in tomato was found: this group of metabolites included three acids (5-amino-levulinic acid, hydroxypipecolic acid and glutaric acid) and one phenylpropanoid (caffeic acid hexose II), over-accumulated in T22Aph vs. T22. In addition, one ester-like (2-Amino-2-methylbutanoate), two lipids (CDP-DG(16:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)), LysoPE  22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/0:0) , and one alkaloid (C33H57NO8 (Jurubine-like), showing an opposite trend. Thirteen additional molecular ions were detected, which could not be identified as any of the known tomato metabolites, and were tentatively assigned according other metabolite identifications: four of them (2 acids: 3-hydroxybutyric acid-like, citric acid-like; an amine: N-methyl ethanolamine phosphate-like; a flavonoid: 6-hydroxy-4′-methoxyflavone-like; and an alkaloid: O-acetylnitraraine-like) and 3 ions (a flavonoid: 3′,4′-dihydroxychalcone-like; an alkaloid: beta-obscurine-like; and an unknown) were found at, respectively, higher and lower levels in T22Aph vs. T22. Interestingly, most of the cited molecules displayed an inverse statistically significant accumulation in the other two comparisons (Aph vs. CTRL and T22Aph vs. T22). Trichoderma harzianum T22 Promotes Tomato Defense Against  M. euphorbiae The treatment of tomato plants with  T. harzianum T22 negatively influenced the survival rate of  M. euphorbiae. T22 plants showed an increased level of resistance to aphid infestation, as indicated by the significant difference registered between the T22 survival curve and that of CTRL (LogRank analysis, χ 2 = 4.72,  p = 0.030,  df = 1) ( Figure 1). Plant Transcriptome Reprogramming Induced by  Trichoderma harzianum T22 Root Colonization T22 plants showed a total of 978 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of which 515 were up-regulated and 463 were down-regulated ( Supplementary Tables 2A,B). The principal defense-related categories that may be linked to the induction in T22 treated plants of a precursor state of defense against insect attack are represented by “response to stress,” “transport” and “response to stimulus” ( Figure 2). The most abundant enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the ontological category “Biological Process” were associated with metabolic processes, photosynthesis-related mechanisms, oxidation-reduction processes and response to stress ( Supplementary Figure 1). In order to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant response to the combined action of  Trichoderma infection and aphid infestation, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses ofthe tomato cultivar “Dwarf San Marzano” were conducted by comparing  Trichoderma treated and untreated plants, with and without aphid infestation. As expected, the up-regulation of markers of SA (i.e., chitinase and1,3-B glucanase) and JA pathways (i e., metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor and, Type I serine protease inhibitor;  Supplementary Table 2A) were also observed. Overall, these data show that  Trichoderma colonization of tomato plants positively affects several metabolic pathways, consistently with previous observations in tomato and other plant species (Alexandru et al.,  2013; Mohapatra and Mittra,  2016; Ban et al.,  2018). Since phenylpropanoids contribute to plant defenses (both direct and indirect) to insect herbivores, genes encoding for key-enzymes associated with phenylpropanoids biosynthesis were searched by using DEGs in a query to a KEGG database; in addition, a manual curation to enrich the aforementioned list was performed. Transcripts coding for 10 enzymes were retrieved among the DEGs that were up-regulated and the correspondence found between the enzymes and the gene identifiers is listed in  Table 3. As shown in  Figure 3, the enzymes act in different stages of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, catalyzing key-steps as phenylalanine conversion in cinnamic acid ( Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and  Caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase), or catalyzing final branches for lignin production (i.e.,  Peroxiredoxin) and anthocyanin synthesis and modification ( Anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyl transferase and  Anthocyanidin reductase). Interestingly, a transcript coding for  PAL is greatly up-regulated in T22 samples. In addition, a series of genes coding for enzymes involved in early phenylpropanoid or flavonoid synthesis resulted down-regulated ( Table 2). Overall, these data show that T22 colonization strongly affects and remodels phenylpropanoid pathway. Table 1 provides a general summary of differentially expressed genes for each treatment. Several genes included in these categories were up-regulated. A short list of these genes is reported in  Table 2. Among them, the induction of genes associated with photosynthesis, chlorophyll biosynthesis and sequestration and biosynthetic processes, may be linked with T22 beneficial effects on tomato plant physiology The up-regulation of plant genes involved in early signals of defense responses against environmental cues as, for example, Serine/threonine-protein kinase, Leucine-rich repeat protein kinase, LRKs, Glutathione S-transferase, and others (listed in  Supplementary Table 2A) was also observed. Similarly, the up-regulation of genes coding for transcription factors (TF), such as Ethylene responsive transcription factors (ERF), WRKY, MYB, and bZIP TF ( Supplementary Table 2A), was registered. These genes are likely involved in plant defense priming (Conrath et al.,  2015).","Beneficial fungi in the genus  Trichoderma  are among the most widespread biocontrol agents of plant pathogens. Their role in triggering plant defenses against pathogens has been intensely investigated, while, in contrast, very limited information is available on induced barriers active against insects. The growing experimental evidence on this latter topic looks promising, and paves the way toward the development of  Trichoderma  strains and/or consortia active against multiple targets. However, the predictability and reproducibility of the effects that these beneficial fungi is still somewhat limited by the lack of an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the specificity of their interaction with different crop varieties, and on how the environmental factors modulate this interaction. To fill this research gap, here we studied the transcriptome changes in tomato plants (cultivar ""Dwarf San Marzano"") induced by  Trichoderma harzianum  (strain T22) colonization and subsequent infestation by the aphid  Macrosiphum euphorbiae . A wide transcriptome reprogramming, related to metabolic processes, regulation of gene expression and defense responses, was induced both by separate experimental treatments, which showed a synergistic interaction when concurrently applied. The most evident expression changes of defense genes were associated with the multitrophic interaction  Trichoderma -tomato-aphid. Early and late genes involved in direct defense against insects were induced (i.e.,  peroxidase, GST, kinases and polyphenol oxidase, miraculin, chitinase ), along with indirect defense genes, such as  sesquiterpene synthase  and  geranylgeranyl phosphate synthase . Targeted and untargeted semi-polar metabolome analysis revealed a wide metabolome alteration showing an increased accumulation of isoprenoids in  Trichoderma  treated plants. The wide array of transcriptomic and metabolomics changes nicely fit with the higher mortality of aphids when feeding on  Trichoderma  treated plants, herein reported, and with the previously observed attractiveness of these latter toward the aphid parasitoid  Aphidius ervi . Moreover,  Trichoderma  treated plants showed the over-expression of transcripts coding for several families of defense-related transcription factors (bZIP, MYB, NAC, AP2-ERF, WRKY), suggesting that the fungus contributes to the priming of plant responses against pest insects. Collectively, our data indicate that  Trichoderma  treatment of tomato plants induces transcriptomic and metabolomic changes, which underpin both direct and indirect defense responses."," 'Defense', 'aphid', 'Rna-seq', 'San Marzano', 'Semi-polarmetabolome' "," 'Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Table', 'Supplementary', 'genes', 'Figure', 'CTRL', 'Aphid Infestation', 'Transcriptome Reprogramming', 'Aphid' "," T22Aph, T22Aph, calmodulin-binding proteins, Ca 2+, receptor-kinases (serine/threonine kinases, receptor-like kinases, LRR-RLKs, MAPKKK, GST, peroxidases, catalase, superoxide dismutase, Polyphenol oxidase, PPO, Leucine aminopeptidase, LapA, proteinase inhibitor, genes-related TF, WRKY, MYB, bZIP, Rahbé, proteinase, hormone-controlled, T22Aph, T22Aph, T22Aph, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, tomato-aphid, JA-related, Phospholipase, Lipoxygenases A, C, D, Leucine aminopeptidase A1, proteinase inhibitors, aphid-repressed, GDSL esterase/lipase, B, T22Aph, asparagine synthase 1, glutamate receptor, WRKY, JA, T22Aph (925 down-regulated, T22Aph, Lv et, phenylpropanoids-related, “, ” “, ”, “, ”, “, ” “, ” “, ” “, ”, pathogenesis-related proteins, PR5, PR10, Chitinase, MAP Kinases, WRKY, protease inhibitors, geranylgeranyl reductase, T22Aph, “, Aph/CTRL, T22Aph/T22, Venn, 8), dihydro-caffeic acid,2-hydroxyglutarate, tetrahydrofolate, T22Aph, up-represented, Uroporphyrinogen III, Galactonate/Gluconate, phenilpropanoids, T22Aph, T22Aph, δ-tomatine, N-isovalerylglycine, threonine/homoserine (, protoporphyrinogen IX, T22Aph, raffinose/melezitose, T22Aph, T22Aph, α-/β-tomatine, T22Aph, T22Aph, hydroxypipecolic acid, T22Aph, 6-hydroxy-4′-methoxyflavone-like, beta-obscurine-like, T22Aph, T22Aph, χ 2, 2A, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, ”, chitinase and1,3-B glucanase, Type I serine protease, Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, O-methyltransferase, Anthocyanin 5-aromatic, Serine/threonine-protein kinase, Leucine-rich repeat protein kinase, LRKs, Glutathione S-transferase, WRKY, MYB, bZIP TF ",  ,  ,  ,terpene synthase
63,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC3861047/eupmc_result.json,PMC3861047,"Results The Wound-Response Phenotype of  spr8Results from a Defect in the  TomLoxD Gene Lipoxygenases are nonheme iron-containing fatty acid dioxygenases that catalyze the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid   47 . Based on the positional specificity of linoleic acid oxygenation, they are classified as 9-lipoxygenases (oxygenation occurs at carbon 9 of the hydrocarbon backbone) and 13-lipoxygenases (oxygenation occurs at carbon 13 of the hydrocarbon backbone). 13-lipoxygenases can be further divided as types 1 and 2 based on the presence of a putative chloroplast transit peptide (cTP)   47 . ChloroP ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/)-based analysis predicted that the deduced amino acid sequence of TomLoxD contains a putative cTP (TomLoxD 1–77), a small N-terminal PLAT/LH2 domain (TomLoxD 78–213) that forms a β-barrel, and a C-terminal domain (TomLoxD 222–892) that forms α-helices ( Figure 4D). It is generally believed that the N-terminal β-barrel domain is involved in membrane or substrate binding, whereas the C-terminal domain harbors the catalytic site of the enzyme   48 . This primary protein structure suggests that TomLoxD is a member of the type 2 plastid-localized 13-lipoxygenases   47 . This prediction is supported by our phylogenetic analysis of plant lipoxygenases, which places TomLoxD in a clade including functionally characterized and predicted type 2 13-lipoxygenases ( Figure 4E). To confirm the chloroplast localization of the TomLoxD protein, full-length of the  TomLoxD cDNA was fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene and subsequently transformed into  Arabidopsis leaf protoplast cells. As shown in  Figure S6, the GFP fluorescence was co-localized with the red chlorophyll autofluorescence, suggesting that TomLoxD is a chloroplast-localized protein. Notably, in our phylogenetic analysis, TomLoxD was most similar to the  Arabidopsis LOX3 and LOX4 (71.7% and 71.3% amino acid identity, respectively) ( Figure 4E), which has recently been shown to be type 2 chloroplast-localized 13-lipoxygenases that are involved in JA biosynthesis   49 . It is noteworthy that the TomLoxD P598L mutation in  spr8 occurs in the C-terminal α-helices domain, presumably impairs the catalytic activity of the enzyme ( Figure 4D). Genetic analysis revealed that  spr8 is a semi-dominant mutant, given that the wound-response phenotype of the heterozygous ( Spr8/spr8) plants was intermediate between those of the homozygous  spr8 plants and their WT counterparts ( Figure 1A and  Figure S3). The deficiency in wound-induced PI-II protein accumulation of  spr8 provides a facile assay for map-based cloning studies to determine the genetic basis of this defect. A combination of cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was used to localize  Spr8 to a region on the long arm of chromosome 3 between SSR markers TES0023 and TES1203 ( Figure 4A). Fine mapping using 354 backcrossed (BC 1) individuals showing a WT wound response delimited the  Spr8 locus to a region between the markers SSR601 and M140 in the scaffold SL2.40sc03701 of the sequenced tomato genome   44 ,   45 . Among the genes predicted by the International Tomato Annotation Group (ITAG2.3 release,  http://solgenomics.net) in this interval,  Solyc03g122340, which encodes TomLoxD (tomato lipoxygenase D), a wound-inducible lipoxygenase   46 , is considered to be a strong candidate of  Spr8. DNA sequencing revealed that  spr8-derived  TomLoxD complementary DNA (cDNA) contains a single C-to-T mutation ( Figure 4B). This C-to-T mutation, which was confirmed by sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA from  spr8 plants, destroys a  BamHI restriction site, and a CAPS marker was developed to detect the  spr8 mutant allele ( Figure 4C). The single base pair change in the  TomLoxD gene is predicted to replace a highly conserved (i.e., invariant among plant and animal lipoxygenases) Pro residue at position 598 with an Leu ( Figure 4D and  Figure S4). Considering that  spr8 is a semi-dominant mutation, we performed the following experiments to show that the missense mutation in  TomLoxD accounts for the wound response phenotype of  spr8. First, transgenic plants overexpressing a WT allele of  TomLoxD ( TomLoxD-OE) showed increased wound response in term of wound-induced defense gene expression (See below). Second, similar to  spr8 plants, transgenic plants expressing a  TomLoxD RNA interference (RNAi) construct ( TomLoxD-RNAi) were defective in wound-induced expression of  PI-II ( Figure S5A and S5B). Third, the wound response phenotype of transgenic plants overexpressing a mutant allele of  TomLoxD ( TomLoxD  P598L-OE ) was intermediate between that of the homozygous  spr8 plants and their WT counterparts ( Figure S5A and S5B). Finally, overexpression of a WT allele of  TomLoxD in the  spr8 background failed to fully rescue the wound response defects of the mutant ( Figure S5C and S5D). Collectively, these results support that the identified C-to-T mutation in the  TomLoxD gene is responsible for the wound response phenotype of  spr8 plants and that the  spr8 allele of  TomLoxD (i.e.,  TomLoxD  P598L) acts as a dominant negative regulator of the tomato wound response pathway. The Wound-Induced Expression of  TomLoxD Is Directly Regulated by the MYC Transcription Factor SlMYC2 In the model plant of  Arabidopsis, much of our understanding of the JA signaling has come from the recent elucidation of the molecular details of JA-regulated gene transcription through the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcription factor MYC2, a master regulator of JA responses   50 –  54 . Considering that in  Arabidopsis MYC2 directly regulates the expression of several JA biosynthetic genes including  LOX2 55 , it is reasonable to speculate that SlMYC2, the tomato homolog of MYC2, may directly regulate the expression of  TomLoxD. Indeed, several lines of evidence lends support to this hypothesis. First, wound-induced expression levels of  TomLoxD were substantially reduced in  SlMYC2-RNAi plants as compared to those in WT plants ( Figure 6A, 6B and  Figure S7), indicating that SlMYC2 positively regulates the wound-induced expression of  TomLoxD; Second, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using  35S  pro:SlMYC2-4myc  plants indicated that SlMYC2 associates with a G-box-like motif (CCATGTG) in the promoter region of  TomLoxD ( Figure 6C and 6D); Third, DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) indicated that a maltose binding protein (MBP)-SlMYC2 fusion protein binds the promoter of  TomLoxD in a G-box-like motif-dependent manner ( Figure 6E). Finally, using the transient expression assay of  Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, we verified the activation effect of SlMYC2 on the expression of a reporter containing the  TomLoxD promoter fused with the firefly luciferase gene (LUC) ( Figure 6F and 6G). Together, these data demonstrate that the wound-induced expression of  TomLoxD is under the direct regulation of SlMYC2. spr8 Impairs Wound-Induced Expression of Defensive Genes spr8 is one of the newly identified mutants that can block the constitutively high activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in the  35S::PS plants   29 . Further characterization of  spr8 was carried out using a  spr8/spr8 homozygous line in which the  35S::PS transgene was removed by five successive backcrosses to the WT cv. Castlemart (CM). The overall plant morphology, flower development and pollen viability of  spr8 plants were indistinguishable from those of WT plants ( Figure S1). The wound response of  spr8 was compared with that of WT using the classical radial immunodiffusion assay for the measurement of wound-induced accumulation of proteinase inhibitor II (PI-II)   11 ,   29 ,   36 . For these experiments, 16-day-old seedlings containing two fully expanded leaves were wounded and the accumulation of PI-II protein was quantified. Wounding the lower leaves of WT caused the well-known accumulation of PI-II both in the wounded leaves (local response) and in the upper unwounded leaves (systemic response) ( Figure 1A). In contrast,  spr8 seedlings accumulated no detectable PI-II protein in the wounded leaves and the upper unwounded leaves ( Figure 1A). Consistent with the PI-II protein data, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays indicated that the  PI-II transcripts were expressed very weakly in wounded  spr8 leaves as compared to those in WT leaves ( Figure 1B). It has been shown that, similar to the  PI genes   37 , protein products of the tomato wound-responsive genes  threonine deaminase ( TD)   16  and  leucine amino peptidase A ( LapA)   38  have a direct role in deterring insect performance. Our parallel experiments indicated that the wound-induced expression levels of  TD ( Figure S2A) and  LapA ( Figure S2B) were also largely reduced in  spr8 plants compared to those in WT plants. These results demonstrate that the  spr8 mutation impairs wound-induced expression of defensive genes. To gain additional insight into the wound response phenotype of  spr8, we examined the capacity of the mutant to respond to various PI-inducing compounds. As previously reported   28 , exogenous application of systemin led to strong expression of  PI-II transcripts in WT plants ( Figure 1C). But  spr8 plants failed to express significant levels of  PI-II transcripts in response to the same concentrations of systemin ( Figure 1C), indicating that  spr8 plants are insensitive to systemin. These results are consistent with the fact that  spr8 was identified as a  suppressor of prosystemin- mediated responses. We then examined the response of  spr8 to the methyl ester of JA, MeJA, which is a potent elicitor of  PI-II expression in WT plants ( Figure 1D). As shown in  Figure 1D, exogenous application of MeJA readily restored the  PI-II expression of  spr8 mutants to levels comparable to those of WT plants. These results led us to classify  spr8 into the group of wounding/systemin-insensitive, but JA-sensitive mutants. It is most likely that the  spr8 mutant defines a signaling step that couples the perception of systemin to activation of the JA pathway. Overexpression of  TomLoxD Leads to Increased Plant Immunity to Insects and Necrotrophic Pathogens The ability of  TomLoxD overexpresser lines to accumulate higher levels of JA and to express increased levels of defensive genes in response to mechanical wounding suggested that these transgenic plants may be more resistant to herbivorous insects. To test this possibility, five-week-old  OE-5 and WT plants were challenged with  Helicoverpa armigera larvae. After termination of the feeding trial, we examined the weight of the larvae to assess the resistance of plants. The average weight of larvae reared on  OE-5 plants was only 32.5% of that of larvae reared on WT plants ( Figure 6F–6H), demonstrating that overexpression of  TomLoxD leads to enhanced plant resistance to herbivorous insects. Our findings that  TomLoxD is required for wound-induced JA biosynthesis and defense gene expression raised the possibility that overexpression of this gene could enhance wound-induced JA biosynthesis, which, in turn, leads to increased plant resistance. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic tomato plants overexpressing the  TomLoxD cDNA driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter ( OE plants). Increased expression of  TomLoxD in transgenic lines including  OE-1,  OE-3 and  OE-5 was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis ( Figure 7A). Under normal growth conditions, the overall growth and morphology of these  OE plants was essentially similar to those of WT plants ( Figure S1). We then compared the expression levels of defensive genes between these  OE plants and WT plants. Similar steady-state levels of  PI-II,  TD and  LapA transcripts were detected between the noninduced  OE plants and WT plants ( Figure 7B–7D). A marked increase in the accumulation levels of these transcripts was, however, observed in the  TomLoxD overexpression plants in response to mechanical wounding ( Figure 7B–7D). These results demonstrate that overexpression of  TomLoxD leads to enhanced wound-induced activation of  PI-II and other defense-related genes. To test that the increased wound-induced defense gene expression in these  OE lines may be resulted from enhanced wound-induced accumulation levels of JA, we examined wound-induced JA accumulation between  OE-5 and WT plants. Similar steady-state levels of JA were detected between  OE-5 and WT plants ( Figure 7E), indicating that overexpression of  TomLoxD does not lead to constant accumulation of high levels of JA. In response to mechanical wounding, however, a substantial increase in the accumulation of JA was observed in  OE-5 plants ( Figure 7E), indicating that overexpression of  TomLoxD leads to enhanced wound-induced accumulation of the defense hormone JA. Considering that the JA-signaled plant resistance is also effective to the necrotrophic pathogen  Botrytis cinerea 50 ,   51 ,   56 –  58 , we examined the performance of  OE-5 plants to the Hy2-1 strain of  B. cinerea. For these experiments, detached leaves from five-week-old tomato plants were inoculated with 5 µL 5×10 5 per mL spore suspension and disease development was analyzed 3 days after inoculation (DAI). As measured by the size of necrotic lesions, whereas  spr8 plants were more susceptible than WT plants to  B. cinerea infection,  OE-5 plants were more resistant than WT plants to this pathogen ( Figure 7I and 7J). In another pathogen infection assay, 16-day-old seedlings were inoculated  in planta with spore suspensions of  B. cinerea and the expression levels of the pathogenesis-related (PR) gene  PR1b1 59  was examined with qRT-PCR. As shown in  Figure 7K, whereas  B.cinerea-induced expression levels of  PR1b1 were reduced in  spr8 plants than those in WT plants, expression levels of  PR1b1 were much higher in  OE-5 plants than those in WT plants, suggesting that the resistance of plants to pathogen is correlated with the expression levels of defense-related genes. spr8 Affects Glandular Trichome Development Trichome density and volatile emissions of glandular trichomes provide a formidable protective barrier to invasion by herbivores and pathogens   39 –  41 . Cultivated tomato contains two morphologically distinct types of glandular trichomes. Type I trichomes have an elongated multicellular stalk with a small unicellular vesicle at the tip ( Figure 2A and 2B). Type VI trichomes have a unicellular stalk with a four-celled glandular head ( Figure 2A and 2B)   42 ,   43 . In order to determine whether  spr8 affects trichome development, we used scanning electron microscopy to observe the adaxial leaf surface to compare trichome morphology and density between WT and  spr8 plants. A striking feature of  spr8 leaves is the significant reduction of trichome number of both types ( Figure 2A and 2B). Quantification of trichomes of five-week-old WT plants (containing at least five leaves) showed that the density of type VI trichome was ∼10 trichomes/mm 2 on the base region of the third leaflet. Analysis of comparable  spr8 leaflets showed that, type VI trichome density of the mutant was about 70% of that of WT leaflets ( Figure 2C). Next, we used gas chromatography analysis to determine whether  spr8 affects the production of compounds that are synthesized in trichome glands. For these experiments, type VI glandular trichomes were selectively collected by using a stretched-glass pipette and were extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (see method). Trichome exudates were then analyzed by gas chromatography to measure the terpene composition. From 1, 000 type VI glands collected from the adaxial surface of WT leaves, six monoterpenes (α-pinene, β-myrecene, 2-carene, α-phellandrene, β-phellandrene and limonene;  Figure 2F) and three sesquiterpenes (δ-elemene, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene;  Figure 2G) were identified. Comparison of terpene profiles revealed that, all of these compounds were also detected in exudates from the same number of type VI glandular trichomes of  spr8 leaflets, but their accumulation levels were significantly decreased in the mutant ( Figure 2F and 2G). In  spr8 glandular trichomes, the accumulation levels of total monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were reduced to 19.5% and 15.2%, respectively, of those of their WT counterparts ( Figure 2D and 2E). These results support the hypothesis that the  spr8 mutation affects the terpene metabolic pathway that mainly operates in type VI trichome glands. The  spr8 Mutation Impairs Wound-Induced JA Biosynthesis Taken together, our data support that, even though the expression of  TomLoxD  P598L is still responsive to mechanical wounding ( Figure 5A), this mutant version of TomLoxD impairs wound-induced JA biosynthesis ( Figure 5B). The above-described results point to a possibility that TomLoxD is a functional 13-lipoxygenase involved in wound-induced JA biosynthesis and that the  spr8 allele of  TomLoxD (hereafter referred to as  TomLoxD  P598L) impairs wound-induced JA biosynthesis. As the first step to prove this, we examined the expression of  TomLoxD or  TomLoxD  P598L in response to wounding. Consistent with a previous investigation   46 , the levels of  TomLoxD transcripts were induced by wounding within 30 min and peaked at 1 h after wounding,  TomLoxD transcripts then showed a tendency of decline and returned to control levels within 8 h ( Figure 5A), indicating that  TomLoxD is an early wound-inducible gene. Interestingly, the wound-induced expression kinetics of  TomLoxD  P598L was essentially similar to that of  TomLoxD, albeit its expression levels were somehow reduced as compared to that of the latter ( Figure 5A). These results indicate that  TomLoxD  P598L is still responsive to wounding. To determine the contribution of TomLoxD and TomLoxD P598L in wound-induced JA biosynthesis, we used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure endogenous JA levels in WT and  spr8 plants in response to wounding. We consistently observed that the JA levels in unwounded WT and mutant leaves were below the detection limit ( Figure 5B). One hour after wounding, the average JA level was increased to 31.7±1.1 pg per milligram of fresh weight (pg/mg FW) in WT leaves, whereas the average JA level in mutant leaves was only 7.9±0.3 pg/mg FW (P<0.0001, Student's t test) ( Figure 5B), confirming that  spr8 plants are defective in wound-induced JA biosynthesis. These results indicate that TomLoxD is required for wound-induced JA biosynthesis and that the TomLoxD P598L mutant allele largely impairs this capability. spr8 Plants Are Compromised in Resistance against Chewing Insects The inability of  spr8 plants to express significant levels of defensive genes in response to mechanical wounding and systemin ( Figure 1 and  Figure S2) suggests that this mutant is compromised in resistance to herbivorous insects. To test this hypothesis, newly hatched cotton bollworm ( Helicoverpa armigera) larvae were placed on leaves of 5-week-old plants to initiate a feeding trial. Sustaining long-term feeding by insects,  spr8 plants were severely damaged ( Figure 3A, right), while WT plants showed relatively few signs of macroscopic damage during the period of the feeding trial ( Figure 3A, left). After termination of the feeding trial, PI-II protein accumulation in the remaining leaf tissues was measured, as was the weight gain of larvae reared on both of the host genotypes. In contrast with high levels of PI-II accumulation in herbivore-damaged WT leaves, very little or no PI-II protein accumulation was detected in hornworm-challenged  spr8 plants ( Figure 3B). These results indicate that WT plants have relatively high levels of natural resistance to the cotton bollworm larvae and that this resistance is severely compromised by the  spr8 mutation. Consistently, the average weight of larvae reared on the mutant was 2.0-fold greater than that of larvae reared on WT plants ( Figure 3C and 3D). These results demonstrate that  Spr8 is required for the resistance of tomato plants to attacking hornworm larvae.","In response to insect attack and mechanical wounding, plants activate the expression of genes involved in various defense-related processes. A fascinating feature of these inducible defenses is their occurrence both locally at the wounding site and systemically in undamaged leaves throughout the plant. Wound-inducible proteinase inhibitors (PIs) in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) provide an attractive model to understand the signal transduction events leading from localized injury to the systemic expression of defense-related genes. Among the identified intercellular molecules in regulating systemic wound response of tomato are the peptide signal systemin and the oxylipin signal jasmonic acid (JA). The systemin/JA signaling pathway provides a unique opportunity to investigate, in a single experimental system, the mechanism by which peptide and oxylipin signals interact to coordinate plant systemic immunity. Here we describe the characterization of the tomato suppressor of prosystemin-mediated responses8 (spr8) mutant, which was isolated as a suppressor of (pro)systemin-mediated signaling. spr8 plants exhibit a series of JA-dependent immune deficiencies, including the inability to express wound-responsive genes, abnormal development of glandular trichomes, and severely compromised resistance to cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) and Botrytis cinerea. Map-based cloning studies demonstrate that the spr8 mutant phenotype results from a point mutation in the catalytic domain of TomLoxD, a chloroplast-localized lipoxygenase involved in JA biosynthesis. We present evidence that overexpression of TomLoxD leads to elevated wound-induced JA biosynthesis, increased expression of wound-responsive genes and, therefore, enhanced resistance to insect herbivory attack and necrotrophic pathogen infection. These results indicate that TomLoxD is involved in wound-induced JA biosynthesis and highlight the application potential of this gene for crop protection against insects and pathogens.",NaN," 'Figure', 'plants', 'TomLoxD', 'expression', 'wound-induced expression', 'expression levels', 'wound-induced', 'levels', 'response', 'TomLoxD Gene' "," α-linolenic acid, β-barrel, α-helices, green fluorescent protein, GFP, S6, GFP, LOX4, type 2 chloroplast-localized, C-terminal α-helices, wound-response, wound-induced PI-II, CAPS, TES0023, TES1203 ( Figure 4A, SL2.40sc03701, tomato lipoxygenase D, wound-inducible lipoxygenase, C-to-T, PCR-amplified, CAPS, TomLoxD-OE, wound-induced, TomLoxD-RNAi, wound-induced, S5A, S5B, S5A, S5B, S5C, S5D, Wound-Induced, MYC, SlMYC2, JA-regulated, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type, MYC2, JA, MYC2, SlMYC2, MYC2, wound-induced, SlMYC2, wound-induced, SlMYC2-4myc  , SlMYC2, CCATGTG, maltose binding protein (MBP)-SlMYC2, SlMYC2, firefly luciferase, LUC, 6G, wound-induced, SlMYC2, spr8, spr8, polyphenol oxidase, PPO, wound-induced, proteinase inhibitor II, PI-II, PI-II, PI-II, PI-II, amino peptidase A, LapA, wound-induced, S2A, wound-induced, systemin, systemin, systemin, prosystemin-, JA, wounding/systemin-insensitive, systemin, JA, wound-induced JA, wound-induced, wound-induced, wound-induced, wound-induced, JA, wound-induced JA, JA, JA, JA, wound-induced, cinerea 50, µL 5×, spr8, Type VI trichomes, type VI trichome, ∼10 trichomes/mm 2, type VI trichome, type VI glandular trichomes, stretched-glass, α-pinene, β-caryophyllene, 2G, type VI trichome, wound-induced JA, wound-induced, wound-induced, wound-induced, wound-induced, JA, P<0.0001, wound-induced, wound-induced JA, spr8, systemin, WT, PI-II, PI-II, PI-II ",  ,  ,  ,NaN
64,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC5761147/eupmc_result.json,PMC5761147,"Results Analysis of the plant terpenome The newly identified TPS sequences were subjected to clustering, genome wide mapping and KEGG pathway analysis for understanding their evolution and also for assignment of substrate specificity, as described in Methods. Following GO assignment, the sequences with GO annotations were subjected to EC (Enzyme code) mapping and novel TPSs were mapped onto KEGG pathways, in order to assign putative catalytic roles. In this manner, 539 TPSs were assigned to specific enzymatic categories as shown in Table  9. These included 140 monoterpene synthases, 311 diterpene synthases and 88 sesquiterpene synthases. As can be seen from this table, ent-kaurene synthases were found in the highest number, followed by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases, both DiTPSs. One each of bornyl-diphosphate synthase, levopimaradiene synthase and germacrene A synthase were predicted, these three representing one each of a MonoTPS, DiTPS and SesquiTPS respectively. Detailed information on accession IDs and substrate preferences for each of these 539 putative TPS sequences is provided in Additional file  3: Table 3. The IGMAP tool   25  was used for clustering the TPSs mapped to 19 plant genomes. Figure  3 depicts the genome-wide terpenome maps for selected monocots and a unicellular green alga, while Fig.  4 depicts the corresponding maps for selected dicotyledonous species. TPSs in both taxa can be observed in clusters often as large as 15 genes, with a tendency to be located towards the centromeres, as in case of rice and Arabidopsis, or towards the edges of the chromosomes, as in sorghum, maize, Brachypodium and most dicots. In  Zea mays, TPS clusters map both towards center and towards the end of chromosomes. Statistical tests reinforced the trend observed in the map images, viz., a significant number of sequences representing TPS genes are located in clusters within the genomes analyzed, based on an unranked independent samples  T-test at the 99% confidence level ( P value = 5.52E−08). Clustering data is presented in Table  10, it shows positive correlation bewteen TPS gene family size and the corresponding number of gene clusters.  Novel terpenome identification Gene ontology analysis for the newly identified TPS genes was carried out in order to further validate our predictions for the plant kingdom, as well as to improve the resolution of functional role prediction, in terms of molecular function or subcellular localization. As described in methods, a total of 2040 TPSs were subjected to ontological analysis and as anticipated, the novel TPSs were found to be enriched in biological process terms like ‘response to stress’, ‘lipid metabolic pathway’ and ‘secondary metabolic process’. More than 900 TPSs were found to be enriched for primary metabolism, although this class of genes is mostly known for secondary/ specialized metabolism. An assessment of these TPSs revealed that they belong to the mono/bifunctional CPS of TPSc and highly divergent TPSe_f gene families. Among molecular function categories, highest enrichment was found for terpene synthase activity, catalytic activity and magnesium ion binding activity, as expected, but in few cases, the GO terms were able to resolve the exact catalytic function for a given TPSs, as in case of hydrolases (37 cases), transferases (65 cases) or protein binding activities. In eight cases, nucleic acid binding was found to be an enriched term and we looked at these cases in more detail in order to understand how TPSs may bind to DNA/RNA to carry out their function. It was interesting to note that nucleic acid binding term was found mainly in case of sesquiterpene synthases in response towards oxidative stress. It may be noted that some TPS genes have previously been known to show single-stranded DNA endo-deoxyribonuclease activity or DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity, and take part in double strand break repair via homologues recombination. Thus, the present eight cases may form part of purine or pyrimidine nucleobase metabolic process. In the sub-cellular compartmentalization category, a majority of mono- and di-TPSs were found to be localized in plastids, as expected, since these are synthesized by the methyl erythritol (MEP) pathway, which is plastidial in nature. In contrast, the sesquiterpene synthases were predominantly found to be located in cytoplasm, the site of occurrence of the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway that is known to synthesize sesquiterpene and triterpenes. 134 cases did not follow the expected localization trend, wherein a sesqui-TPS was localized to the plastid and, conversely a mono- or di-TPS was predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm, supporting the notion of crosstalk that has been previously hypothesized between MVA and MEP pathways   7 . In summary, the GO analysis further supports Terzyme predictions and the huge repertoire of new TPSs thus identified provides an opportunity for further functional characterization. Further analyses, as presented in the next section were performed to shed light on the roles and identities of these new TPSs. Encouraged by this superior accuracy of prediction, we automated the TPS and PT search pipeline to design and develop the Terzyme interactive online server, available freely without any login requirement at  www.nipgr.res.in/terzyme.html. Figure  1 shows the query submission protocol of Terzyme. It has been configured to accept multiple fasta sequences to search for TPSs, and does not require download on local machines for processing. The Terzyme HMM pipeline was used to search for novel TPS and PT gene family members in the entire PSG dataset (containing 1,573,395 protein sequences from 42 plant genomes, as described in Methods), and the resulting identifications have been incorporated into the online web resource for browsing, download and further exploration. Figure  2 shows a few screenshots of the Terzyme prediction server including the browse-able terpenome database. In all, Terzyme identified a total of 3312 unique TPS sequences and 873 unique prenyl transferases. Some of the TPS sequences, as expected, were predicted by both function-based and gene-family based HMMs. These 3312 TPSs and 873 PTs are available for browsing, both by species name and taxonomic class, through the ‘Plant Genome Predictions’ menu of Terzyme website, as shown in panels B of Fig.  2. For each TPS, users can view or download the corresponding sequence in FASTA format, its alignment with the respective sub-family profile HMM, as well as the predicted secondary structure.  A total of 2040 TPSs were identified by the functional class based profile HMMs and these included 613 monoterpene synthases, 468 diterpene synthases and 959 sesquiterpene synthases. Similarly, 2987 TPSs were identified by gene family based profile HMMs which included 1797 TPSa, 432 TPSb, 218 TPSc, 81 TPSd, 270 TPSe_f and 189 TPSg gene family sequences. A complete list of these identifications along with sub-family assignment for each species, including PTs is provided in Tables  5,  6 and  7 respectively. Interestingly, our data shows identification of putative TPSs in three chlorophyte genomes even though none of the profile HMMs were trained on these species. A manual inspection of each sequence shows them to have sufficient length and presence of the requisite TPS motifs. From a functional point of view, all chlorophyte TPSs appear to be Diterpene synthases, the ancient TPS containing family, known previously to consist of both gymnosperm and angiosperm members. A detailed analysis of some of these DiTPSs indicated them to be closely related to Cycloartenol synthase and some were found to contain Squalene cyclase (SQCY) found in class II TPSs. Among bryophytes,  Physcomitrella patens shows only one known bifunctional TPSs with both CPS/KS activity has been reported till date   24 . The present analysis reveals the additional presence of at least nine bifunctional TPSs, and we have identified 15 prenyl transferases in the moss genome, suggesting a reasonably large terpenome family with more than 30 members, majority of these being previously unreported diterpene synthases. The gene family profiles assign most of these sequences to the TPSa and TPSc subfamilies. As anticipated, 64 of the 72 putative TPSs identified in the gymnosperm genome ( Picea abies) were assigned to TPSd subfamily, supporting the existing view that gymnosperm TPSs belong to a distinct clade   19 . Tables  5 and  6 also depict five gymnosperm TPS sequences representing the most ancient TPSc gene family, with mono/bifunctional CPSs, although we did not observe any bias of representation in case of functional class assignment; all three classes namely monoTPS, diTPS and sesqui-TPS are roughly equally present in this gymnosperm. It may be noted that Terzyme enables a distinction between Class II Copalyl diphosphate synthases (CPS) and the Class-I Kaurene synthases (KSL) also. Under the Plant Genome Predictions Tab, apart from the Diterpene TPS classification, for each genome, Terzyme shows the exact number of matches found for TPSc and TPSe_f classes, both of which represent largely, the CPS and KSL respectively. We believe this is a very useful feature that enables users to breakdown Di-TPS data for detecting better-resolved functional annotations. In general monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases outnumber the diterpene synthases in all seed plant domains. This may be due to the general mono functional activity of the former compared to bifunctional activity of latter enzymes. Terpenes are known to play significant roles defence responses against herbivores by emissions of several volatile blends, and volatile emissions are mainly composed of monoterpenes and sesquiterpene lactones owing to their low molecular weights (C 10 and C 15 respectively). It may also be noted that the identified TPS gene family size increases from lower plants (chlorophytes, bryophytes and pteridophytes) to land plants, suggesting expansion of the family during course of evolution. An average of 30–50 TPS sequences were identified across higher plants, with the maximum number of sequences detected in  Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), along with commercial fruit bearing dicot species like apple, grape and papaya. The Eucalyptus genome also contains over one hundred TPS sequences and it would be interesting to study these TPSs further and characterize their roles in the respective genomes. Present knowledge of completely characterized TPSs is limited to only few plant species and their classification based on functional roles or gene family is still an emerging field. Our data on the other hand opens up a huge repertoire of putative TPSs candidates throughout the plant kingdom, together with their functional, and gene family based classification. For example, the tomato terpenome was recently characterized with about 40 TPS   15 , whereas our analysis reveals at least 60–100 TPSs in the  S. lycopersicum genome along with more than 20 PTs. In addition, Diterpene TPS classification has been performed based on class I (Aspartate rich motif (DDXXD/E) or Non-aspartate rich consensus motif of ( N, D)D(L,I,V)X( S, T)XXX E also called as ‘NSE/DTE’ motif and class II (DXDD) signature motifs present in the respective sequences. In house perl script were used to scan all the DiTPS annotations to assess the presence of these signature motifs for Class I and Class II TPSs. Accordingly, TERZYME classifies DiTPSs into the following four classes: (1) Class I DiTPS—If either Aspartate rich motif (DDXXD/E) or Non-aspartate rich consensus motif of ( N, D)D(L,I,V)X( S, T)XXX E, (2) Class II Diterpene synthases—If DXDD motif was present, (3) bifunctional—If both Class I and Class II motifs are present and (4) Noncanonical : If none are present. Details can be seen in Table  8. The presence of these sub-classes in available plants can also be assessed on the Terzyme database under the Plant Genomes Predictions tab. These examples reflect how a rigorous scientific pursuit can lead to new annotations and gene discovery for previously unknown, and even well-known families of conserved sequences.  Annotated terpenome data The curated terpenome data was compiled as described in methods, involving retrieval of sequences from the NCBI Protein Database via keyword specific search for prenyl transferases (PTs) as well as all TPS functional classes (mono-, di- and sesqui-TPSs) as well as the sequence homology based gene-family classes, namely TPSa to TPSg   19 . The function-based (FB dataset) consisted of 401 representatives sequences, including 154 monoterpene synthases, 71 diterpene synthases and 176 sesquiterpene synthases, as shown in Table  1. These sequences represent diverse taxonomic classes of green plants, including land plants, which further include seed plants, with the exception of chlorophytes. For prenyl transferases, a total of 301 PT sequences were compiled as shown in the last column of Table  1, and this data was called the PT dataset. Mosses have not been reported to have any prenyl transferases at all. Additional file  1: Table 1 provides a detailed list of accession IDs for each sequence used in the FB and PT datasets. The gene-family based GB dataset was also compiled as described in methods and Table  2 shows the 326 sequences retrieved for this dataset. A detailed list of accession IDs for each sequence, along with species and sub-class information has been provided in Additional file  2: Table 2. As can be seen in Table  2, this dataset contains 113 TPSa, 49 TPSb, 35 TPSc, 48 TPSd, 50 TPSe_f and 31 TPSg sequences, mainly present in seed plants. No TPS has been annotated to date in chlorophytes. Lower plants like ferns and mosses also have very few PTs or TPSs. Similarly, genomes of ancient land plants like the magnoliales also appear to lack PTs or TPSs as per their current annotations. As expected, only gymnosperm sequences are present in the TPSd subfamily, known to be specific to this clade. In all, the FB, GB and the PT datasets consist of 116, 74 and 112 species respectively, the majority being monocots or dicots.  Profile hidden Markov models and predictive accuracy Profile HMMs were built for the prenyl transferase family and all 12 classes of TPS subfamilies, as described in methods. For TPSs, analysis was divided into two parts, function based analysis and gene family based analysis. In function-based analysis the input sequence is classified into a monoterpene, diterpene or sesquiterpene synthase using the six profile HMMs specific to function based (FB) dataset. In gene family based (GB) analysis, the test sequence is assigned to one of the six gene families described earlier from TPSa to g, with HMMs being generated from the GB dataset. In order to test the predictive accuracy of the program, benchmarking was done as described in methods, and this revealed a sensitivity of 100% in all cases, albeit with a relatively low accuracy range of 51–61%. This indicates that although each individual sub-family search profile is able to successfully identify true positives, the twelve HMMs also have a tendency towards false positives, i.e. acquisition of TPS sequences from other sub-families. The high rate of false positives severely affects sub-family annotation towards prediction of substrate specificity and may be ascribed to the strong homology between various TPS sub-classes, both at sequence and structural levels. Table  3 provides a sense of this overlap through an inter-family sequence and structural fold comparison. The various TPS sub-family representatives used for structural superimposition included the 1,8-cineole synthase from  Salvia fruticosa for Monoterpene synthases (PDBID 25JC), the Taxadiene synthase from Pacific yew for Di-TPSs (PDB ID 3P5P) and the 5-epi aristolochene synthase from  Nicotiana tabacum (PDBID 3M00) representing sesqui-TPSs. As a result, correct annotation and classification of newly identified TPSs becomes a significant challenge in view of conservation between the different TPS superfamilies. In order to overcome this challenge posed by high false positives without losing out the perfect sensitivity achieved by each sub-family profile, we developed a pipeline wherein all twelve profile HMMs would be allowed to scan a new sequence in parallel. We then based the final sub-family assignment on the premise that high sensitivity of the true sub-family profile would overshadow the false positive scores of the remaining eleven non-self HMMs. In this manner, even though a given test sequence may be identified by multiple sub-family HMMs, the highest scoring hit would still remain the true sub-family profile. In order to test the veracity of our selection premise, all 12 HMMs were combined into a pipeline for scanning the test set dataset, followed by sorting based on highest score obtained by each sub-family profile. As expected, benchmarking of the program in this manner significantly enhanced the accuracy of the search algorithm as can be seen in Table  4. This table shows the results of predictive performance of HMMs calculated using the statistical concepts of sensitivity and accuracy as discussed in methodology section, before and after the parallel-scan strategy. As can be seen from Table  4, the final accuracy of the search algorithm increases to 100% for a majority of sub-families, with the exception of dicot-specific profiles for Mono- and Sesqui-TPSs, both of which show accuracy above 85%.  Encouraged by the superior predictive power of the search algorithm, we proceeded to assess its performance in context with other online web resources. To our knowledge, there is no search tool specific to any category of phytochemicals, but we expected the global annotation databases, (such as Pfam, PANTHER and Interpro) to be able to identify terpene synthase family, and therefore adequate for a comparative performance test. However, we found that none of the currently existing programs could classify TPSs either based on their function i.e. into monoterpene, diterpene or sesquiterpene synthases, nor on the basis of gene family (TPSa-TPSe/f). The Terzyme hidden markov models, in contrast, achieve taxon-based distinction between identified TPSs. One reason for the failure of general annotation databases may be that available programs like Pfam identify TPSs by detecting either the N-terminal domain naming them as Terpene_synth (PF01397) or the metal binding domain designating it as Terpene_synth_C (PF03936) or both. Similarly PANTHER detects N-terminal domain designating it as PTHR31376, other Terpenoid synthase as PTHR31225, PTHR11439 or PTHR31739. Interpro also detects Terpenoid synthase, N terminal domain as IPR001906 and C-terminal metal binding domain as Terpene_synth_C (IPR005630). Hence, from a predictive viewpoint, it can be inferred that our search algorithm performs better than existing programs for TPS gene family identification in the plant kingdom.","Background:Terpenoid hydrocarbons represent the largest and most ancient group of phytochemicals, such that the entire chemical library of a plant is often referred to as its 'terpenome'. Besides having numerous pharmacological properties, terpenes contribute to the scent of the rose, the flavors of cinnamon and the yellow of sunflowers. Rapidly increasing -omics datasets provide an unprecedented opportunity for terpenome detection, paving the way for automated web resources dedicated to phytochemical predictions in genomic data. Results:We have developed Terzyme, a predictive algorithm for identification, classification and assignment of broad substrate unit to terpene synthase (TPS) and prenyl transferase (PT) enzymes, known to generate the enormous structural and functional diversity of terpenoid compounds across the plant kingdom. Terzyme uses sequence information, plant taxonomy and machine learning methods for predicting TPSs and PTs in genome and proteome datasets. We demonstrate a significant enrichment of the currently identified terpenome by running Terzyme on more than 40 plants. Conclusions:Terzyme is the result of a rigorous analysis of evolutionary relationships between hundreds of characterized sequences of TPSs and PTs with known specificities, followed by analysis of genome-wide gene distribution patterns, ontology based clustering and optimization of various parameters for building accurate profile Hidden Markov Models. The predictive webserver and database is freely available at http://nipgr.res.in/terzyme.html and would serve as a useful tool for deciphering the species-specific phytochemical potential of plant genomes."," 'Pathway Mapping', 'Phytochemicals', 'Terpene Synthase (Tps)', 'Go Clustering', 'Prenyl Transferase (Pt)', 'Terpenome', 'Hidden Markov Models (Hmm)' "," 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS sequences', 'gene family', 'sequences', 'synthases', 'diterpene synthases', 'TPS genes', 'TPS gene', 'Table' "," DiTPSs, bornyl-diphosphate synthase, germacrene A synthase, MonoTPS, DiTPS, SesquiTPS, IGMAP, ‘, ’, ’, ‘, ’, mono/bifunctional CPS, TPSe_f, hydrolases (37 cases, single-stranded DNA, sesqui-TPS, Terzyme, Terzyme, Terzyme, Terzyme, 1,573,395, Terzyme, browse-able terpenome, Terzyme, prenyl transferases, ‘, ’, Terzyme, HMMs, HMMs, TPSa, TPSb, TPSd, PTs, HMMs, DiTPSs, Cycloartenol synthase, SQCY, class II TPSs, CPS/KS, prenyl transferases, TPSa, TPSd, mono/bifunctional CPSs, Terzyme, Class II Copalyl diphosphate, CPS, Class-I, Terzyme, TPSe_f, CPS, C, 30–50, class I, V)X, T)XXX E, ‘NSE/DTE, class II, Class I, Class II TPSs, TERZYME, DiTPSs, Class I DiTPS—, Aspartate rich motif (DDXXD/E, Non-aspartate, V)X, T)XXX E, Class II, Class I, Class II, Terzyme, prenyl transferases, sesqui-TPSs, TPSa, prenyl transferases, prenyl transferases, TPSa, TPSb, TPSd, TPSe_f, PTs, PTs, TPSs, TPSd, HMMs, prenyl transferase, HMMs, TPSa, HMMs, HMMs, PDBID 25JC, Di-TPSs (PDB ID 3P5P, PDBID 3M00, sesqui-TPSs, HMMs, HMMs, HMMs, parallel-scan, Sesqui-TPSs, PANTHER, Terzyme, TPSs, Terpene_synth, Terpene_synth_C, PTHR31376, Terpenoid synthase, PTHR31225, PTHR11439, PTHR31739, Terpenoid synthase, N terminal domain, C-terminal metal binding domain, Terpene_synth_C ( "," 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'DiTPSs.', 'MonoTPS,', 'DiTPS', 'SesquiTPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSc', 'TPSe_f', 'TPSs,', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'di-TPSs', 'sesqui-TPS', 'di-TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs.', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS,', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSa,', 'TPSb,', 'TPSc,', 'TPSd,', 'TPSe_f', 'TPSg', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'DiTPSs', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPSs,', 'TPSa', 'TPSc', 'TPSs', 'TPSd', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSc', 'monoTPS,', 'diTPS', 'sesqui-TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSc', 'TPSe_f', 'Di-TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'DiTPS', 'TPSs.', 'DiTPSs', 'DiTPS—If', 'TPS', 'sesqui-TPSs)', 'TPSa', 'TPSg', 'TPSa,', 'TPSb,', 'TPSc,', 'TPSd,', 'TPSe_f', 'TPSg', 'TPS', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPSd', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPSa', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'Di-TPSs', 'sesqui-TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'Sesqui-TPSs,', 'TPSs', '(TPSa-TPSe/f).', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPS' ", 'S.' , 'lycopersicum' ,terpene synthase
65,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6023221/eupmc_result.json,PMC6023221,"Results Gene annotation, classification and phylogeny Comparison of P450 family sizes between species ( S2 Fig) allowed us to identify families that expanded in grapevine and might have a role in the production of species-specific specialized metabolites. An expansion of the CYP75 family, involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, is already well documented   74 , whereas the function of CYP82, the largest P450 family in grapevine with 25 members, is currently unknown in this species. Other families that are larger in grapevine than in most other species are: CYP76, CYP79, CYP80, CYP81, CYP87, CYP89 and CYP716. A similarity search of the  V.  vinifera PN40024 genome with known P450 sequences revealed 579 putative P450 sequences ( S1 File). We manually curated the sequences obtained with a gene prediction algorithm, and validated the annotation with grapevine unigenes and RNAseq reads (see  Material and methods). We distributed them into four categories: genes, partial genes, putative pseudogenes and pseudogenes. This led to the identification of 279 full-length genes, which is fewer than the 315 genes reported for the heterozygous Pinot Noir genome on the Cytochrome P450 homepage ( http://drnelson.uthsc.edu/CytochromeP450.html), and suggests that some sequences previously annotated as different genes are probably allelic variants. The number of cytochromes P450 in grapevine is comparable to their number in other plants (e.g. 242 in  Arabidopsis thaliana, 272 in  Solanum lycopersicum and 309 in  Oryza sativa). Twenty sequences were annotated as partial genes, lacking a segment of the sequence due to gaps in the genome assembly. Eleven putative pseudogenes only contain one nonsense mutation or frame shift, which could originate from sequencing errors or be genuine but still exist as functional genes in some varieties. Finally, the 269 pseudogenes are fragments, either containing multiple stop codons or frameshift mutations, or sequences not aligning to the whole length of homologous P450 genes. Grapevine P450s can be assigned to 48 families based on sequence identities. A phylogenetic analysis either of the full-length sequences or of a subset of conserved P450 sites confirmed this classification for most of the families. One exception is CYP90B, which is clustered with CYP720 and CYP724 as previously observed   73 . Other exceptions are the families CYP76 and CYP80, which form a monophyletic group ( Fig 1, see  Material and methods). We thus investigated the phylogeny of these two families in the broader context of selected angiosperm species ( S1 Fig). CYP80 clearly groups with CYP76 sequences, but forms an independent clade between CYP76A/G and the rest of CYP76 sequences (labeled core CYP76). Within the CYP76A/G clade, a eudicot duplication gave rise to the two subfamilies CYP76A and CYP76G. Within the large “core CYP76” clade the uncertain position of both the monocot and  Amborella trichopoda CYP76s could be due to a problem of long-branch attraction. A specific core eudicot duplication gave rise to CYP76F/B/X on one side and CYP76T/C/E on the other side. These tree topologies were obtained both with the full-length alignment and the partial alignment of conserved sites. Although species-specific “blooms” appeared in the whole CYP76/80 family, they are particularly abundant in the “core CYP76” clade. Different subfamilies expanded in different species. Expression profiles of grapevine P450s We analyzed the expression patterns by clustering the expression profiles of the 457 expressed cytochrome P450 sequences. A Pearsons’ correlation coefficient cut-off of 0.656 resulted in eight expression clusters, shown in  Fig 5. Only twenty-seven P450 sequences (6%, grouped in expression cluster G) are expressed constitutively, that means expressed at similar levels over the six categories, but the vast majority of the P450 genes are expressed in specific organs or under particular conditions. Among constitutively expressed genes, the CYP76 family was significantly enriched (chi 2 test, p-value = 3E-7). To identify P450 genes with potential roles in pathogen resistance or biosynthesis of berry metabolites we analyzed the expression of the 579 P450 sequences. Pseudogenes were included in the analysis of expression to account for recently pseudogenized sequences that may still be expressed to some extent. We used 59 RNA-Seq datasets ( S2 Table), which describe gene expression in different tissues (flowers, berries, leaves), different stages of berry development, and pathogen infection (downy and powdery mildews). To enable a meaningful comparison of gene expression between different experiments we calculated fragment number per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) for each P450 sequence ( S1 File). The majority of P450 sequences (457 or 79%) were expressed in at least two experiments. Of the remaining 122 non-expressed P450 sequences, only seven were complete genes. Out of the expressed P450 sequences, complete genes showed higher expression (mean FPKM = 10.6, median FPKM = 0.4) compared to pseudogenes and putative pseudogenes (mean FPKM = 2.4, median FPKM = 0) or partial genes (mean FPKM = 1.7, median = 0.1). The analysis of gene expression on multiple organs of grapevine also highlighted some P450 sequences with potential role in biotic stress response. Indeed, cluster D (59 sequences) and cluster C (35 sequences) grouped P450 sequences preferentially expressed during powdery and downy mildew infections, respectively. Among the large CYP families, CYP82, CYP87 and CYP736 were significantly enriched in cluster D whereas CYP72 was significantly enriched in cluster C. To simplify the dataset, we grouped the 59 experiments in six categories: leaves, downy mildew ( Plasmopara viticola) infected leaves, powdery mildew ( Erysiphe necator) infected leaves, flowers, young berries and ripe berries. “Flowers”, “young” and “ripe berries” categories were significantly enriched in expressed P450 sequences whereas “leaves” and “downy mildew” categories were depleted (chi 2 test, p-value = 1E-15). In addition, we grouped the expression levels into four classes (no, low, medium or high expression). The “powdery mildew” category was found to be significantly enriched for highly expressed P450 sequences whereas the “leaves” category was depleted (chi 2 test, p-value = 9E-16). Altogether, these results indicate a significant induction of P450 expression caused by biotic stress, especially powdery mildew infection, and in grapevine organs synthesizing aromas and volatile compounds. We more thoroughly investigated co-expression of cytochrome P450 sequences within the physical clusters. We found that 245 out of the 343 expressed P450 sequences that are part of a physical cluster (71%) show an expression profile similar to at least one member of the same physical cluster. This level of co-expression is highly significant (bootstrap test, p-value<0.0001), which means that P450 physical clusters are highly enriched in co-expressed sequences. The co-expression was analyzed further in the seven largest physical clusters to check whether tandem duplicated genes observed in the previous section maintained similar expression profiles ( Table 1). Especially, we identified four large clusters with high similarity, not only among the coding, but also the non-coding regions. These non-coding regions presumably include promoter sequences, so the genes in these clusters are expected to have the same expression pattern. Indeed, the 30 kb duplicated block within cluster 92 ( Fig 4) retained the same expression profile after the segmental duplication. The duplicated segment consists of four P450 sequences: two genes and two pseudogenes. The two pseudogenes in both blocks were not expressed, whereas the two complete genes in both blocks (CYP82D15 and CYP82D18; CYP82D17 and CYP82D20v2) were co-expressed in ripe berries (cluster A) and downy mildew infected leaves (cluster C), respectively. Six out of sixteen expressed sequences in this cluster show induction in powdery mildew infected leaves (cluster D), whereas five other P450 sequences in the same cluster were up-regulated in ripe berries (cluster A). Interestingly, cluster 138 is also composed of CYP82 sequences, but these sequences were preferentially expressed in young berries (cluster H). Eight out of nine expressed CYP76 sequences in the physical cluster 190, on the other hand, were co-expressed in flowers (cluster F). In cluster 71, five out of fourteen expressed CYP89 genes were specifically expressed in leaves (cluster B). Cluster 182 grouped ten out of fifteen expressed CYP81 sequences specifically expressed in berries (5 sequences in cluster A and 5 sequences in cluster H). A major shift in P450 expression pattern occurs during berry development. Indeed, the three largest expression clusters F (97 sequences), A (88 sequences) and H (76 sequences) grouped P450 sequences preferentially expressed in flowers, ripe berries and young berries, respectively. Among the large CYP families, CYP76, CYP716 and CYP714 were significantly enriched in cluster F whereas CYP72 was significantly depleted. CYP716 was also enriched in cluster H. CYP78 and CYP80 were significantly enriched in cluster A. In addition, this cluster featured the P450 gene with the highest expression in all experiments: CYP78A41 with an average FPKM value in ripe berries of 1292. Beside this expression analysis on multiple organs of the plant, an analysis of differentially expressed genes during berries development (four stages) for four grapevine varieties was performed using previously published data   70 . Two hundred and forty five P450 genes were significantly differentially expressed for at least one variety ( S6 Fig). Notably, CYP76, CYP82, CYP71, CYP72, CYP75, CYP81 and CYP89 families that are enlarged in the grapevine genome and/or that are involved in secondary metabolism showed the greatest number of differentially expressed genes (20, 19, 19, 18, 18, 14 and 13, respectively). This result strengthens the hypothesis that these cytochrome P450 gene families play a major role in the biosynthesis of aroma compounds and especially the varietal-specific aromas. Structural organization of the P450s in the PN40024 genome Cytochrome P450 families group genes with higher sequence similarity (≥40% protein sequence identity) and often a similar function. A majority of physical clusters are composed of members of only one P450 family (63 clusters, 74%) and the remaining clusters are composed of up to three P450 families. The four largest clusters are composed of several P450 families, whereas the clusters with single P450 families are smaller ( Fig 2 and  S4 Fig). Most of the largest P450 families (CYP82, CYP71, CYP81, CYP76, CYP72 and others) are organized in clusters ( S1 Table). The 579 cytochrome P450 sequences are distributed on all the 19 chromosomes. Some chromosomes, namely 18, 19 and 6, carry a large number of P450s (77, 57 and 51 sequences, respectively), whereas others, for example chromosome 5, carry very few (8 sequences) ( S3 Fig). Twenty-four P450 sequences (7 genes, 6 partial genes, 11 pseudogenes) are located on the “Unknown” chromosome, which is composed of scaffolds that could not be anchored on any of the 19 chromosomes. Since the genome is not completely homozygous (estimated homozygosity is 93%   9 ), the “Unknown” chromosome may also contain allelic variants of genes that are placed on the 19 chromosomes. We further investigated the distribution of cytochrome P450 sequences in clusters or groups in close physical proximity (separated by less than 200 kb and eight non-P450 genes   50, 51 ). Our results show that P450 sequences are organized in clusters and not randomly distributed in the genome (bootstrap test,  p-value < 0.0001). A large majority of cytochrome P450 sequences (452 or 78%) are part of one of the 85 clusters and only 22% (127 P450 sequences) are isolated in the grape genome. The largest number of clusters (40%) are only composed of two P450 sequences, whereas the largest cluster counts thirty-five P450 sequences. On average, there are five P450s per cluster and the median is three P450s per cluster ( S4 Fig). The clusters are not enriched neither in complete genes nor pseudogenes, compared to isolated annotations (data not shown). Some chromosomes, such as 16 and 18, are enriched in clustered P450s, whereas others, such as chromosomes 4 and 11, are enriched in isolated P450 ( Fig 2 and  S3 Fig). Clustering by P450 family already indicates that more similar P450 sequences cluster in closer physical proximity. But many P450 families are dispersed among several clusters. We thus wished to explore whether the closest paralogs belong to the same or different clusters ( Fig 3). The majority of clustered P450 genes (86%) have their closest paralog (the best BLAST hit) in the same cluster. The second and third closest paralogs (second and third best BLAST hit) are in the same cluster for 58% and 49% of the clustered P450 genes. The sequence similarities within the same cluster are thus higher than between clusters. Large P450 clusters in  V.  vinifera genome formed  via different mechanisms To investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of large groups of physically close cytochrome P450 genes (hereafter called physical clusters), we further analyzed the sequence similarity within clusters, taking into account not only the coding P450 sequences, but also the surrounding non-coding-sequences. This allowed us to infer the mechanism of cluster formation. We focused on the seven largest physical clusters, which comprises between eleven to thirty-five P450 sequences ( Table 1). Together, these seven clusters contain 23% of all P450 genes, and a similar fraction of total P450 sequences. Most of the sequences in these clusters are part of “clan 71”, which is a large clade of plant cytochromes P450 often involved in the biosynthesis of species-specific adaptative metabolites ( Fig 1). Analysis of similarity blocks within these clusters showed they differ remarkably in their structures ( S5 Fig). One of the largest physical clusters, cluster 65, is characterized by low similarities, both among the P450 sequences and surrounding non-coding regions. The similarity blocks of two other large physical clusters, 71 and 171, are restricted to P450 sequences and do not extend to the intergenic regions. Single gene duplications were thus probably the main mechanism of formation of these two clusters. The similarity blocks of physical clusters 138 and 182 extend to the non-coding regions around the cytochromes P450 annotations. This suggests the duplication events leading to formation of these clusters happened relatively recently. High similarity between the non-coding regions, which include the promoter regions, should result in similar expression profiles. Cluster 138 has the highest fraction (73%) of pseudogenes of all the seven large clusters. In physical clusters 92 and 190, the similarity blocks extend over even longer regions that include three to four cytochrome P450 sequences and their intergenic regions ( Fig 4). In addition, the type of annotation (gene or pseudogene) was also maintained in the same order between duplicated blocks. This suggests these two clusters formed through very recent proximal segmental duplications.","Cytochromes P450 are enzymes that participate in a wide range of functions in plants, from hormonal signaling and biosynthesis of structural polymers, to defense or communication with other organisms. They represent one of the largest gene/protein families in the plant kingdom. The manual annotation of cytochrome P450 genes in the genome of Vitis vinifera PN40024 revealed 579 P450 sequences, including 279 complete genes. Most of the P450 sequences in grapevine genome are organized in physical clusters, resulting from tandem or segmental duplications. Although most of these clusters are small (2 to 35, median = 3), some P450 families, such as CYP76 and CYP82, underwent multiple duplications and form large clusters of homologous sequences. Analysis of gene expression revealed highly specific expression patterns, which are often the same within the genes in large physical clusters. Some of these genes are induced upon biotic stress, which points to their role in plant defense, whereas others are specifically activated during grape berry ripening and might be responsible for the production of berry-specific metabolites, such as aroma compounds. Our work provides an exhaustive and robust annotation including clear identification, structural organization, evolutionary dynamics and expression patterns for the grapevine cytochrome P450 families, paving the way to efficient functional characterization of genes involved in grapevine defense pathways and aroma biosynthesis.",NaN," 'sequences', 'cluster', 'clusters', 'genes', 'Fig', 'physical clusters', 'expressed', 'Expression', 'families', 'physical' "," P450, CYP75, CYP82, P450, CYP76, CYP79, CYP80, CYP81, CYP87, CYP89, P450, P450, RNAseq, Cytochrome P450, http://drnelson.uthsc.edu/CytochromeP450.html, cytochromes P450, P450, CYP90B, CYP724, CYP76, CYP80, CYP80, CYP76, CYP76A/G, CYP76, CYP76, CYP76A/G, CYP76A, CYP76G, “, CYP76s, CYP76F/B/X, CYP76T/C/E, “blooms, CYP76/80, “, cytochrome P450, ’, P450, CYP76, P450, P450, P450, P450, P450, CYP, CYP82, CYP87, CYP736, CYP72, “, “, ”, “ripe berries”, P450, “leaves”, “downy mildew, ”, “powdery mildew, ”, P450, 9E-16, P450, cytochrome P450, P450, p-value<0.0001, P450, P450, CYP82D15, CYP82D18, CYP82D17, CYP82D20v2, P450, CYP82, CYP76, CYP89, CYP81, P450, P450, CYP, CYP76, CYP714, CYP80, A., P450, CYP78A41, P450, CYP76, CYP82, CYP71, CYP75, CYP81, CYP89, cytochrome P450, P450s, Cytochrome P450, ≥40, P450, P450, P450, P450, CYP82, CYP71, CYP81, CYP76, cytochrome P450, P450s, P450, “, ”, “, ”, cytochrome P450, non-P450, P450, cytochrome P450, P450, P450, P450s, P450s, P450s, P450, P450, P450, P450, P450, P450, cytochrome P450, P450, non-coding-sequences, P450, P450, P450, “, ”, cytochromes P450, S5, P450, P450, cytochromes P450, cytochrome P450 ",  ,  , 'lycopersicum' ,NaN
66,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC4232691/eupmc_result.json,PMC4232691,"Results and discussion Overview of expression profile of spearmint PGT To characterize biological processes specific for PGT, GO term was determined for all differentially expressed unigenes. Additionally, we identified unigenes whose expression was reduced in PGT by comparing leaf-PGT and PGT. These unigenes showed a minimum of 4 times reduction in expression level in PGT when compared to leaf-PGT. GO term was determined for them as well. Figure  4 shows the top 30 GO terms for the more abundant and less abundant unigenes. GO terms associated with ribosome biogenesis, ribosome structural genes and translation are highly represented in PGT, which could reflect the high protein biosynthetic activity of PGTs. Other terms included terpene metabolism and most of the primary energy producing terms like glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Furthermore, pentose phosphate related term (oxidative) was also enriched in PGT. This term provides NADPH for biosynthetic processes such as fatty acid synthesis, cytochrome P450 mediated hydroxylation and the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen   26 . These results indicate that the GO functions that provide energy equivalents and redox cofactors are very active in PGT. Secretory trichomes are biosynthetically very active, and hence, there is a high energy requirement in these cells. Unigenes from the GO terms of photosynthesis, chlorophyll biosynthesis and starch biosynthesis were among the less abundant ones. This shows that our PGT sample preparation was pure and not contaminated with leaf tissues as mint PGTs are non-photosynthetic. From the RNA seq data about 25,000 unigenes were observed to be expressed in spearmint PGT. The heat map in Figure  3 exhibits some specific expression patterns to PGT. Among this specific pattern for PGT we found transcripts for terpene biosynthesis, lipid transfer proteins and interesting transcription factors like MYBs and WRKYs. Comparison of PGT and leaf-PGT showed that 3,919 unigenes were differentially expressed in PGT (Additional file  3). These unigenes showed a minimum of 4 times increase in expression level in PGT as compared to leaf-PGT. About 30% of these unigenes encoded either hypothetical proteins or remained unannotated. Many of these unannotated unigenes showed none or minimal expression in leaf-PGT. They might represent novel genes that are unique to PGTs development and divergent from other plants, whose genomes have been sequenced. Data from proteomic analysis of spearmint PGT also showed that the largest functional category of the identified proteins was “unclear classification” and included proteins with unknown functions   11 . The absence or low levels of some PGT-specific transcripts from leaf RNA seq data indicated the dilution of PGT-specific RNAs among the total leaf RNAs and reaffirms the importance of isolating these organs for analysis. Among the top 1000 differentially expressed unigenes, we identified 16 TPSs, 18 cytochrome P450s, 5 lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), 20 transcription factors, 2 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and several transcripts associated with cell wall. Cytochrome P450s are involved in the hydroxylation of terpenes   23  and LTPs have been suggested to be involved in intracellular transport and secretion of lipids and terpenes   9, 24 . LTPs were among the most abundant unigenes in PGT and were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). The abundance of these LTPs suggests their importance in PGTs metabolic function and development. ABC transporters are also proposed to be involved in the active transport of secondary metabolites   11, 25 . The spearmint PGT is presumed to undergo cell wall modification to form subcuticular storage space   12 . Among the differentially expressed unigenes there were few that were related to cell wall synthesis or modifications and a subset of these were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Additional files  4 and  5). Whether they play a role in modification of cell wall layers to form the storage space remains to be investigated. Mint PGTs being non- photosynthetic and metabolically very active would presumably rely on exogenous supply of sucrose from underlying leaf tissues to use as carbon source for energy production. We found several transcripts encoding enzymes for sucrose catabolism expressed more in PGT like sucrose synthase and neutral/alkaline invertases that are important for channelling carbon from sucrose in non-photosynthetic tissues   27 . These enzymes convert sucrose to hexose phosphates. Plastids in the PGTs are the main sites of secondary metabolism. In contrast to chloroplasts, plastids of heterotrophic tissues have to rely on the import of ATP and carbon to drive their metabolic processes. We checked our set of differentially expressed unigenes to see if any known transporters are present. In most plants glucose 6-phosphate seems to be the preferred hexose phosphate taken up by nongreen plastids. The transporter proteins responsible for this import of carbon into plastids are known as Glc6P–phosphate translocator (GPT) and transcript similar to GPT was seen enriched in PGT (about 30 times more in PGT). This carbon can be used for starch biosynthesis or for the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in plastids   28 . GO terms for oxidative pentose phosphate pathways were seen enriched in PGT. Additionally transcript similar to plastidic Phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator was found to be expressed more in PGT. They are involved in the transport of phosphoenolpyruvate, an energy rich glycolytic intermediate from the cytoplasm into the plastids   29 . Further, ATP generated either by glycolysis or by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria can be imported into non- green plastids by plastidic nucleotide transporter (NTT). Transcript similar to NTT was also observed to be more abundant in PGT   29 . Monoterpene production is enriched in spearmint PGT Subsequent condensation reactions between IPP and DMAPP are catalysed by GPP synthases (GPPS) that leads to the formation of geranyl diphosphate (GPP; C10) the precursor for monoterpenes. The conversion of IPP to DMAPP and its equilibrium is maintained by IPP isomerase (IPPI). In most plant species this enzyme is encoded by a single gene whereas Arabidopsis has two IPPI genes   33 . We found 2 IPPI unigenes in spearmint both enriched in PGT. Peppermint GPPS (Mp GPPS) is a two-component heteromeric enzyme consisting of a large and a small subunit, and both the subunits are catalytically inactive by themselves   48, 49 . In spearmint too, we found unigenes for both the small and large subunits of GPP synthase that showed high expression in PGT. The major constituent of spearmint essential oil is (−) carvone which is synthesised from GPP in a three step reaction. Transcripts for all the three enzymes involved in above reaction, Limonene synthase (LS), Limonene-6-hydroxylase (L6OH) and carveol dehydrogenase (CD) were highly expressed in PGT and verified by q-RT-PCR (Figure  6 and Additional file  4). Interestingly, the precursor for menthol in peppermint and (−) carvone in spearmint is the same limonene. In peppermint it is oxygenated by (2)-4S-limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH) to form (2)-trans-isopiperitenol and it enters the menthol pathway whereas in spearmint limonene is oxygenated by (2)-4S-limonene- 6-hydroxylase (L6OH) to form (2)-trans-carveol. Both these enzymes show a 70% identity at the amino acid level with major differences localized to the presumptive active sites   50 . The spearmint L6OH transcript is highly expressed in PGT as expected but the full set of downstream redox enzymes isopiperitenone reductase, (+)-pulegone reductase, and menthone reductase involved in menthol pathway were also found but poorly expressed in PGT. A previous study has shown that (−) carvone is not an efficient substrate for the initial double-bond reductase, therefore (−) carvone accumulates in spearmint even though the downstream redox enzymes are present   11, 51 . Hence, the abundance of a single enzyme L6OH instead of L3OH changes the final monoterpene produced. This shows how simple changes in the production of a single intermediate can result in drastic changes in the metabolic profiles. When compared to heterodimeric GPP synthase, transcripts for farnesyl diphosphate synthase which is responsible for the formation of farnesyl diphosphate precursor for sesquiterpenes, is expressed around 4 times less in PGT. Apart from low MVA pathway, low levels of FPP synthase transcripts might also contribute to the reduced sesquiterpene production in mint PGT. Spearmint PGTs as plants chemical defense organs Many of the secondary metabolites produced by glandular trichomes play a role in plant defence. Majority of them fall into the category of terpenes, phenylpropenes, flavonoids, methyl ketones, acyl sugars and defensive proteins. Apart from having a rich terpene pathway, spearmint PGT also shows presence of transcripts that are involved in the production of different secondary metabolites that may have a role in plant defense. Transcripts encoding enzymes for phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumarate CoA-ligase were seen expressed in PGT. These enzymes are involved in phenylpropanoid production. Presence of a variety of small molecular weight phenylpropanoids like caffeic, rosmarinic and ferulic acids has been detected in leaves of different mint germplasm   56 . Transcripts similar to Caffeate O-methyltransferase, an enzyme required for the conversion of caffeic acid into ferulic acid was preferentially expressed in PGT. Chalcone flavanone isomerase an enzyme in the flavonoid pathway in plants was also preferentially expressed in PGT. Unigenes encoding transcripts similar to plant invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitors were highly expressed in PGT which are important to defend against plant pathogens   57, 58 . All the above transcripts were verified by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). Oxylipins are large family of biologically active oxidized fatty acid-derivatives that are important for plant defense responses. They are produced mainly by the combined action of lipases, lipoxygenases (LOXs) and members of cytochrome P450 (CYP74) family specialized in metabolizing fatty acids hydroperoxides (HPs). HPs form the initial substrates for different branches of the oxylipin pathway   59- 62 . We found enzymes involved in oxidation of fatty acids expressed more in PGTs. Transcripts similar to phospholipase A, lipoxygenase and allene oxide synthase and allene oxide cyclase were enriched in PGT. Allene oxide synthase and allene oxide cyclase are members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP74) family and are involved in the LOX pathways   63, 64 . All the above mentioned transcripts showed a minimum of 8 times enrichment in PGT and were confirmed by qRT-PCR. However to understand the role of these enzymes in plant defence and exact nature of oxylipins formed by them, further characterization is essential, especially in terms of their positional specificity and substrate specificity. Plants possess both basal and inducible mechanisms to defend themselves against pathogens. The transcriptome data reflects the basal or constitutive state of defense mechanism existing in spearmint PGT. The changes in transcript abundance in all the above mentioned genes on stress induction will provide a better understanding of how PGT act as chemical defence organs. The MEP (2-Cmethyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate) pathway is more abundant in spearmint PGT than the MVA (mevalonate) pathway The building blocks for all different classes of terpenes produced by plants are C5 units of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). They are generated either by plastidial MEP or cytoplasmic MVA pathway. The MEP pathway requires seven enzymes to synthesize IPP and DMAPP from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates which feed the monoterpene pathway   33 . From peppermint EST studies it has been proposed that the active pathway for the formation of IPP/DMAPP in the PGT is the MEP pathway. This is consistent with our analysis too where MEP pathway transcripts were more abundant in PGT than MVA. High expression of MEP pathway transcripts correlates well with the production of monoterpenes in PGT. It has been reported that 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), the first enzyme of this pathway is important for the overall regulation of the pathway   34 . Multiple  DXS genes have been found in plants like  Zea mays,  Medicago truncatula, Oryza sativa, Ginkgo biloba and  Pinus densiflora and  Picea abies   35- 40 . In all these plants, two or three candidate  DXS genes have been reported. From our data we were able to identify 2 different 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) unigenes showing different levels of abundance in PGT. The number of genes coding for each MEP pathway enzyme varies from plant to plant   33, 41 . Presence of multiple genes with differential tissue-specific expression levels might contribute towards the regulation of the MEP pathway, in different organs of the plant. Figure  5 shows the number of unigenes identified for each enzyme of the MEP pathway and their RNA seq expression levels. In cases of enzymes with more than one unigene, the unigene with the highest abundance in PGT was taken into consideration. Their expression was further validated by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). From our RNA seq data and qRT-PCR analysis, DXR and MCT transcript levels were low when compared to levels of other enzymes in MEP pathway. This might suggest that possibly these two enzymes are the rate limiting steps of this pathway. A possible option to explore in future will be to enhance the expression level of various rate limiting steps to enhance the production of terpenes. In contrast to the MEP pathway, the transcript levels of MVA enzymes were very low. For RNA seq expression levels of unigenes involved in this pathway refer Additional file  6. Their expression was validated by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). MVA pathway derived IPP is generally believed to be used for the production of cytosolic sesquiterpenes, triterpenes and mitochondrial terpenes. In addition to monoterpenes, mint produces a few sesquiterpenes although at much lower quantities than monoterpenes   9, 42 . Lower level of MVA pathway can be one of the reasons. Interestingly, the transcripts of genes involved in the MEP pathway are also enriched in  Artemisia annua trichomes, glandular trichomes of Hops and in Snapdragon flowers where sesquiterpene metabolism dominates   43- 45  suggesting that the MEP pathway can also feed sesquiterpene production. Studies with labelled substrate predict exchange of metabolites between the MVA and MEP pathways   46, 47 . How the IPP/DMAPP formed by MEP pathway is utilized to synthesize sesquiterpenes in mint remains to be investigated. Functional characterization of Terpene Synthases (TPS) from spearmint Sesquiterpene synthesis is thought to take place in the cytoplasm while monoterpene synthesis is believed to occur in plastids. Since our biochemical characterization shows that  MsTPS1 and  MsTPS2 are sesquiterpene synthases, we examined subcellular localization of these proteins in transient studies in tobacco leaves. YFP-tagged MsTPSs were transiently expressed in  N. benthamiana leaf cells by  Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration and visualized 3 dpi using the YFP channel of a confocal microscope. Both the MsTPSs showed cytoplasmic localization (Additional file  9) and their sequence analysis also showed lack of plastid targeting sequences which further affirms that these TPSs are sesquiterpene synthases. Therefore, either by sequence similarity or by functional characterization we were able to identify all the major terpene synthases that are responsible for the formation of major spearmint essential oil components. In plants, specific TPSs are responsible for the synthesis of various terpene molecules from the common precursors. Our transcriptome data provides a rich resource for identifying and functionally characterizing new TPSs from spearmint. From our enriched unigenes, we found 16 that were identified as terpene synthases; all of them were more than 1 kb and 10 of them were encoding full-length open reading frames (ORFs). We found TPSs annotated as limonene synthase, (E)-β-farnesene synthase, bicyclogermacrene synthase and cis muuroladiene synthase being preferentially expressed in PGT. However, the exact functional annotation of a new TPS requires activity characterization of the recombinant protein. In mint species, to our knowledge limonene synthase from spearmint   52 , ( E)-β-farnesene synthase from peppermint   42  and cis-muuroladiene synthase from black peppermint   53  have been previously characterised with respect to their functions. From our RNA seq data we chose to characterize two unannotated full-length TPS. Phylogenetic comparison (Additional file  7) showed that both MsTPS1 and MsTPS2 belonged to the TPS-a subfamily of angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases. The main sesquiterpenes identified by GC-MS analysis in our spearmint variety were (E)-β-farnesene, β-caryophyllene, α-caryophyllene (Humulene), cis murola-3-5 diene, β-copaene, bicyclogermacrene and bicyclosesquiphellandrene. To determine MsTPS1 and MsTPS2 enzymatic activities, the full-length open reading frame encoding these enzymes were overexpressed in  E.coli, purified and used for in vitro assays with GPP or FPP as substrate. In the presence of FPP MsTPS1 catalysed the formation of β-caryophyllene in vitro (Figure  7A) whereas MsTPS2 produced a peak from FPP that was identified as one of β-cubebene/Germacrene D/β-copaene by GCMS (Figure  7B). β-copaene was observed in our mint leaf GC-MS data suggesting that MsTPS2 is most likely to be β-copaene synthase. Both the TPSs failed to produce a peak with GPP as substrate (Figure  7A and B). Thus, our in vitro studies identified them to be sesquiterpene synthases. Furthermore, transient  Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated plant expression   54  was used to investigate the terpenes produced by  MsTPS1 and  MsTPS2 in planta. Both  MsTPS1 and  MSTPS2 under the control of a 35S promoter were transiently expressed in  N. benthamiana leaves by  Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration. The compounds were analysed 3 dpi (days post-infiltration) by GC-MS. Both TPSs failed to form any new peak when observed by GC-MS. Studies have shown that overexpressing enzyme 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase (HMGR), a rate limiting step of the mevalonate pathway increases heterologous plant sesquiterpene production   55 . Accordingly, both the TPSs were coexpressed with HMGR  in planta to observe the production of sesquiterpenes. MsTPS1 with HMGR produced β-caryophyllene as the major peak and α-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide as minor peaks Additional file  8. MsTPS2 even with HMGR failed to produce any new peaks  in planta suggesting that the compound formed by MsTPS2 might be further metabolised endogenously by the plant (data not shown). Sequencing,  de novo assembly and annotation of transcriptome Three RNA libraries were prepared and sequenced by Illumina technology. More than 100 million high quality reads of 101 base pairs (bp) were generated from PGT, leaf-PGT and leaf (Additional file  2). Using the Trinity method   20  the sequence reads were finally assembled into 40,587 non-redundant unigenes, spanning a total of 101 Mb of sequence with a GC content of 43.14%. All unigenes were longer than 200 bp. The N50 of the final assembled transcripts was 1,774 bp. The unigenes were annotated by performing BLASTX search against various protein databases. Among the 40,587 non-redundant unigenes, 27,025 (67%) had at least one hit in BLASTX search with E-value < = 1e-3. Functional classifications of Gene Ontology (GO) term of all unigenes were performed using Trinotate   20 . In order to calculate the expression level for assembled transcripts, we first mapped reads onto them using bowtie   21 . RSEM (RNA-seq by Expectation-Maximization) was used to estimate the abundance of assembled transcripts and to measure the expression level   22 . Analysis of spearmint PGT transcription factors Although the cloning and functional characterization of enzymes involved in terpene biosynthesis has been quite successful in various plants, knowledge about regulation of these secretory trichome specific pathways is very rudimentary. Studies in peppermint show a close association between enzyme activity and transcript abundance for all gene/enzyme pairs, suggesting that, essential oil biosynthesis is primarily influenced at the transcriptional level   12, 17, 18, 30 . Hence, identification of transcription factors that globally control metabolic pathway will provide an attractive strategy for engineering terpene production. Similarly, knowledge about the development of secretory glandular trichomes, the so-called factories of important terpenoid production, is very limited. Most of the transcription factors involved with trichome development have been isolated from Arabidopsis, which lacks secretory trichomes. Studies in tobacco and tomato are beginning to show that multicellular secretory trichomes and unicellular trichomes of Arabidopsis are not homologous structures, and they likely develop under different regulatory conditions   31 . Our analysis of transcriptome data of young leaves or PGT did not uncover any transcripts that matched those of the major known trichome initiating gene transcripts from Arabidopsis, like  TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1, GLABRA1, GLABRA3   32 . Either these genes are not expressed or are expressed at a different developmental stage of leaves or PGT than the stage used in this study. Table  1 shows the top 20 transcription factors that were significantly more abundant in PGT when compared to leaf-PGT. Spearmint PGT and their development Spearmint leaves produce three different types of trichomes on their surfaces: non-glandular multicellular hair like, capitate glandular trichomes with a single secretory head cell and PGTs whose secretory head is composed of eight-cells with a single stalk and basal cell (Figure  1A). These PGT glands possess a large subcuticular storage space that is formed by the separation of the cuticle from the apical cells and the essential oil is secreted into this cavity   12  (Figure  1B). It is known that new glands keep initiating on the leaf till expansion ceases and the monoterpene content and compositions change with the age of the leaf   13- 16 . Different studies have indicated that monoterpene biosynthesis is most active in young 12–20 day old leaves of peppermint after which the rate of synthesis slowly declines   17- 19 . We performed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on young spearmint leaves (about 1–2 cm in length) and found abundance of both limonene and carvone monoterpenes (Figure  2). Limonene is the first committed step towards carvone pathway. In addition to these monoterpenes, the presence of sesquiterpenes was also observed. This indicated the dynamic terpene biosynthetic activity of leaves at this stage of development. PGT were purified from leaves of this stage and RNA isolated. The leaves of the same stage were brushed to remove all trichomes and RNA extracted from them as controls (Additional file  1)."," Background Plant glandular trichomes are chemical factories with specialized metabolic capabilities to produce diverse compounds. Aromatic mint plants produce valuable essential oil in specialised glandular trichomes known as peltate glandular trichomes (PGT). Here, we performed next generation transcriptome sequencing of different tissues of Mentha spicata (spearmint) to identify differentially expressed transcripts specific to PGT. Our results provide a comprehensive overview of PGT's dynamic metabolic activities which will help towards pathway engineering. Results Spearmint RNAs from 3 different tissues: PGT, leaf and leaf stripped of PGTs (leaf-PGT) were sequenced by Illumina paired end sequencing. The sequences were assembled de novo into 40,587 non-redundant unigenes; spanning a total of 101 Mb. Functions could be assigned to 27,025 (67%) unigenes and among these 3,919 unigenes were differentially expressed in PGT relative to leaf - PGT. Lack of photosynthetic transcripts in PGT transcriptome indicated the high levels of purity of isolated PGT, as mint PGT are non-photosynthetic. A significant number of these unigenes remained unannotated or encoded hypothetical proteins. We found 16 terpene synthases (TPS), 18 cytochrome P450s, 5 lipid transfer proteins and several transcription factors that were preferentially expressed in PGT.

67,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6703867/eupmc_result.json,PMC6703867,"RESULTS βC1 alters WRKY20-regulated GS biosynthesis in a vascular-specific manner Since  AtWRKY20 expression is strongest in vascular tissue and is also JA responsive, we collected vein and nonvein sections of the leaf separately after MeJA treatment and performed GS analysis. At least 50% increase of AGS content in nonvein leaf tissues of  wrky20 mutants and βC1-3/At plants could explain the bioassay results for these lines, which had enhanced resistance against CBM ( Fig. 4O and fig. S7A). Conversely, a significant 35% reduction of IGS content in the leaf veins of  wrky20 mutants and β C1-expressing plants could explain why begomovirus infection promotes whitefly performance ( Fig. 4O and fig. S7B). Both the GS amounts and related gene expression results suggest that WRKY20 may act as a dual-function regulator of host defense mechanisms against two herbivores with different feeding patterns. WRKY20 deficiency would make the host sensitive to whitefly but resistant to CBM. If this hypothesis is correct, then  WRKY20 overexpression should produce the opposite result. This was indeed the case in  Arabidopsis ( Fig. 2, F and I, and fig. S7C). Overexpressing  WRKY20 in  Arabidopsis plants increased whitefly resistance and reduced CBM resistance ( Fig. 2, F and I). These findings are well explained by the enhanced GS levels in leaf veins and reduced GS levels in nonvein leaf tissue in plants overexpressing  AtWRKY20 (fig. S7C). Together, the results demonstrate that βC1-WRKY20 interaction specifically promotes begomovirus-whitefly mutualism by modulating the tissue-specific biosynthesis of GSs in  Arabidopsis. As whitefly is a phloem-feeding insect and CBM is a leaf-chewing herbivore, each has its own unique ecological niche, although both feed on the leaf. Thus, we hypothesized that the asymmetric effect of begomoviruses on whitefly and CBM is due to WRKY20-mediated tissue-specific immunity. To test this, we generated  AtWRKY20 promoter:  GUS (β-glucuronidase) reporter lines to determine the spatiotemporal expression pattern of  AtWRKY20. The reporter gene was expressed exclusively in  Arabidopsis vascular tissue, which is the site of TYLCCNV β C1 expression and whitefly vector feeding ( Fig. 4, A to H) ( 21,  22). After  Arabidopsis had transitioned to the adult vegetative phase (6 weeks old), the expression of the reporter gene could not be detected in leaves under normal conditions, but methyl JA (MeJA) treatment could strongly induce its expression in a vascular-specific manner ( Fig. 4, I and J). Therefore, we speculated that WRKY20 regulates the spatiotemporal production of plant secondary metabolites during begomovirus-plant-herbivore interactions in a manner similar to other transcription factors when exposed to biotic stresses ( 23,  24). In Brassicaceae plants, some secondary metabolites such as indole and aliphatic GSs (IGS and AGS, respectively) are readily loaded into and transported through the vascular tissues ( 25). The  AtWRKY20 expression pattern is highly similar to that reported for a number of transcription factor genes functioning in the GS pathway that gives rise to both IGS and AGS ( 26). Gene expression analysis showed that WRKY20 positively regulated IGS-related genes ( AtMYB51,  AtMYB122,  AtCYP79B2, and  AtCYP83B1) but negatively regulated AGS-related genes ( AtMYB29,  AtMYB76, and  AtCYP79F1) ( Fig. 4K and fig. S5). ChIP-qPCR analysis demonstrated that AtWRKY20 directly binds to the promoters of most IGS-related genes and one AGS-related gene ( Fig. 4, L and M, and fig. S6). These results indicate that plant WRKY20 is a dual-function transcription factor controlling GS biosynthesis. The interaction between WRKY20 and βC1 blocked the ability of WRKY20 to bind the promoter of  MYB122 ( Fig. 4N), an IGS-related gene, and thereby possibly decreased the accumulation of IGS in vascular tissues of  Arabidopsis. The βC1 interaction partners WRKY20 and MYC2 form a negative regulation feedback loop To further understand the epistatic relationship between MYCs and WRKY20 in  Arabidopsis resistant to CBM, we crossed the  myc234 triple mutant with the  wrky20-2 mutant. MYC2 and two homologs, MYC3 and MYC4, redundantly induce the production of toxic metabolites, such as GSs, which protect the plant against chewing herbivores ( 20). Unlike the  myc234 triple mutant, which is almost completely devoid of GSs, the total GS content in the  wrky20-2 mutant was significantly higher than that in Col-0 plants ( Fig. 3G), which explains the enhanced resistance to CBM in plants lacking  WRKY20. The  wrky20-2/myc234 quadruple mutant has the same GS level and CBM insensitivity as the  wrky20-2 mutant, in stark contrast to the near-null deficiency of GSs and CBM sensitivity in the myc234 mutant ( Fig. 3, G and H). These results suggest that WRKY20 functions downstream of the MYCs in controlling the accumulation of GSs, which affect the  Arabidopsis-CBM interaction. We next examined how WRKY20 integrates into the known signaling transduction networks controlling plant-herbivore interactions.  MYC2 is a well-known early JA-responsive gene and a positive regulator of plant immunity against herbivores including CBM and whitefly ( 8,  18). We have previously shown that MYC2 interacts with TYLCCNV βC1 and affects host plant-mediated begomovirus-whitefly mutualism by regulating terpene synthase genes ( 8). Consistent with previous reports, more CBM feeding was observed on  myc2-1 leaves than on wild-type Col-0 leaves ( Fig. 3, A and B). Since both MYC2 and WRKY20 are targets of βC1, we next examined how  Arabidopsis spatiotemporally fine tunes this antiherbivore network. First, we found that  AtWRKY20 is a later JA-responsive gene ( Fig. 3C). Second, we found that  WRKY20 and  MYC2 form a negative regulation feedback loop, as  AtWRKY20 expression levels in the  myc2-1 mutant were higher than those in Col-0 plants and there was higher expression of  AtMYC2 and its homologs  AtMYC3 and  AtMYC4 in the  wrky20-1 knockdown mutant ( Fig. 3, D and E). It appears that WRKY20 and MYC2 are directly negatively transregulated vice versa by their transcription regulation activity. WRKY20 belongs to the WRKY transcription factor family, which specifically binds to the W-box (TTGAC and TTGACC/T) or W-box–like (TGACC/T) elements containing the TGAC core sequence ( 19). Promoter analysis using the plant cis-acting regulatory DNA elements (PLACE) database ( www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/?action=newplace) revealed that five W-box and three W-box–like elements are distributed in the 2.0-kb promoter of  AtMYC2 (fig. S4A). One additional W-box–like element was in the 5′ untranslated region of  AtMYC2. To test whether WRKY20 specifically binds to these elements in vivo, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using a transgenic line expressing 35 S:YFP-AtWRKY20 in the Col-0 background. Using a line expressing 35 S:YFP as a negative control, we performed a ChIP-qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) analysis, which showed that 35 S:YFP-AtWRKY20 lines significantly enriched immunoprecipitation on regions II, IV, and V of the  AtMYC2 promoter, suggesting that AtWRKY20 directly binds to the  AtMYC2 promoter (fig. S4B). Furthermore, we detected the transcriptional repression activity of AtWRKY20 by using two transient expression systems. Leaves expressing  YFP-AtWRKY20 significantly suppressed the promoter activity of  AtMYC2 compared to leaves expressing only  YFP ( Fig. 3F and fig. S4, C to E). Besides the direct repressive role of WRKY20 on the transcription of  MYC2, we found that MYC2 also directly suppressed the transcription of the  WRKY20 in a similar set of experiments ( Fig. 3F and fig. S4, F to H). These results further support that WRKY20 and MYC2 form a negative regulation feedback loop. βC1 suppresses WRKY20 activity by interfering with its dimerization A previous study reported that ORA59 binds to GCC-box elements of the  PDF1.2 promoter and transactivates the  PDF1.2 promoter ( 29). In addition, there are three W-box–like elements in the  AtPDF1.2 promoter (fig. S8B). Further ChIP analysis demonstrated that AtWRKY20 directly binds to the  AtPDF1.2 promoter (fig. S8C). In transient assays, the cotransfection of AtWRKY20 and AtORA59 promoted activation of the  AtPDF1.2 promoter compared with that observed in the presence of  AtPDF1.2 reporter by AtWRKY20 or AtORA59 alone (fig. S8D). In addition, reduction of  ORA59 expression or knockdown of  PDF1.2 expression in  Arabidopsis led to increased whitefly oviposition compared with wild-type Col-0 plants (fig. S8E). Moreover, coexpression of the βC1 protein with AtWRKY20-cEYFP and nEYFP-AtWRKY20 reduced the intensity of EYFP fluorescence in  Nb leaves, indicating that βC1 and WRKY20 forms a complex that interferes with WRKY20 homodimerization (fig. S8, F to I). As expected, βC1 severely repressed the transactivation activity of WRKY20 on  PDF1.2 transcription (fig. S8J). In addition to inducing the production of antiherbivory metabolites against CBM, begomovirus infection may influence other defensive mechanisms mediated by phytohormone-regulated biosynthesis and the release of toxic polypeptides, such as mechanisms involving the ethylene- and JA-responsive defensin gene  PDF1.2 ( plant defensin 1.2) and the salicylic acid (SA)–regulated gene  PR1 ( pathogenesis-related 1) ( 14,  27). Here, we demonstrated that AtWRKY20 is also involved in the ERF branch of JA signaling and that the JA responsiveness of both  PDF1.2 and  ORA59 ( octadecanoid-responsive arabidopsis AP2/ERF 59), the major regulators of the ERF branch, was strongly suppressed in  wrky20 mutants and βC1-3/At plants compared with wild-type Col-0 plants ( Fig. 5, A and B). To understand the exact mechanism through which WRKY20 is involved in JA signaling, we next tested whether WRKY20 directly interacts with one or more key regulators in the JA pathway. In vitro pull-down and BiFC assays jointly demonstrated that AtWRKY20 directly interacts with ERF-AtORA59 ( Fig. 5, C and D). In addition, there was a positive correlation between the expression of  AtWRKY20 and  AtORA59 in  Arabidopsis (fig. S8A). These results suggest that WRKY20 is a key regulator in the ERF branch of JA signaling. Because of WRKY20 interaction with either βC1 or ORA59, we raised a possibility that βC1 competes with ORA59 for interaction with WRKY20. To test this hypothesis, we performed a modified BiFC assay, as in a previous report ( 28). In the presence of coexpressing βC1, the interaction signal strength of AtWRKY20-AtORA59 indicated by enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) fluorescence intensity markedly decreased ( Fig. 5, E and F). A negative control of GUS coexpression did not affect the interaction between AtWRKY20 and AtORA59. Moreover, in vitro competitive pull-down assays also showed that βC1 interferes with the interaction between WRKY20 and ORA59 ( Fig. 5G). The interaction between βC1 and host transcription factor WRKY20 alters plant-mediated interactions with herbivores Higher eudicot plants seem to have evolved at least two interconnecting antiherbivory immunity pathways, MYC2 branch and ERF (ethylene responsive factor) branch in JA signaling. We hypothesized that begomoviruses might hijack this interconnecting point to achieve asymmetrical effects on different types of herbivores. To identify how βC1 controls this asymmetric effect on the plant-herbivore community, we sought to identify βC1-targeted host factors by screening an  Arabidopsis complementary DNA yeast two-hybrid library. We identified AtWRKY20, a transcription factor with unknown function that interacts with βC1.  Arabidopsis WRKY20 belongs to the WRKY group I subfamily. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WRKY20 is highly conserved in higher core eudicots, with likely orthologs from rosids and asterids species such as  Brassica napus,  Gossypium hirsutum, and  S. lycopersicum (tomato), which are major hosts of begomoviruses (fig. S2A). We confirmed that CLCuMuV βC1 (βC1-C) interacts with GhWRKY20 homologs (GhWRKY20-1 and GhWRKY20-2) and that TYLCCNV βC1 interacts with AtWRKY20 by a yeast cotransformation assay. BD (binding domain)–βC1-C and AD (activation domain)–GhWRKY20 yeast transformants or BD-βC1 and AD-AtWRKY20 yeast transformants were able to grow on an SD-Leu-Trp-His selection plate with 2 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), whereas yeast transformants carrying AD– and BD–βC1-C or AD- and BD-βC1 control constructs were unable to do so ( Fig. 2A). Next, we performed pull-down assays to examine the interaction between βC1 and WRKY20 in vitro. GST (glutathione  S-transferase)–βC1 could be pulled down by MBP (maltose binding protein)–AtWRKY20, but no signal was observed when the negative control protein GST replaced GST-βC1 (fig. S2B). To further confirm the interaction between plant WRKY20 and begomovirus-encoded βC1 in vivo, we performed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay on  Nb leaves. Direct interactions between βC1 and WRKY20 proteins from tomato, cotton, and  Arabidopsis were observed in nuclei and confirmed by colocalization with a signal from 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining ( Fig. 2B and fig. S2C). Together, these results consistently prove that βC1 interacts with plant WRKY20 proteins. To elucidate the possible roles of WRKY20 in plant-herbivore interactions, we performed whitefly and CBM bioassays on  WRKY20–down-regulated plants and  AtWRKY20-overexpressing plants. We obtained three species of  WRKY20–down-regulated plants,  Arabidopsis transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutants, and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) tomato and cotton (fig. S3). Whiteflies laid more eggs on  GhWRKY20 VIGS cotton and  SlWRKY20-1 VIGS tomato than on vector control plants ( Fig. 2C and fig. S3C). We further conducted bioassays on stable  WRKY20 mutants of  Arabidopsis, which is a host for both whitefly and begomoviruses. The whiteflies laid more eggs and exhibited faster pupa development on  wrky20 mutants than on  Arabidopsis Col-0 plants ( Fig. 2, D and E). The complemented  wrky20-1 mutant had the same effect on whitefly oviposition as wild-type Col-0 plants, whereas overexpressing  AtWRKY20 in Col-0 plants resulted in resistance to whitefly ( Fig. 2F and fig. S3H). However, CBM larvae feeding on  GhWRKY20 VIGS cotton and  Arabidopsis wrky20 mutants grew slower than those on control plants ( Fig. 2, G and H), similar to the repressive effects of begomovirus infection and TYLCCNV β C1 transgenic plants on CBM growth traits ( Fig. 1, D to G). CBM larvae feeding on plants overexpressing  AtWRKY20 grew faster than those on wild-type Col-0 plants ( Fig. 2I). Consistently, all of the lines with down-regulated  WRKY20 expression had the same asymmetric effect as the begomovirus-infected and β C1-expressing plants ( Fig. 2, C to E, G, and H, and fig. S3C). These results suggest that β C1 expression phenocopies plant mutants with down-regulated  WRKY20 expression and asymmetrically regulates tripartite begomovirus-plant-herbivore interactions. Whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses enhance plant resistance to a nonvector insect, cotton bollworm We next examined whether the single protein βC1 encoded by β-satellite controls the asymmetric tripartite interactions among plants, viruses, and insects. A β-satellite mutant (mβ) of the βC1 protein was used as a control ( 17). The mutant virus with a nonfunctional βC1 protein did not deter CBM growth, as there was no significant difference in the larval weight of CBM feeding on TYLCCNV and nonfunctional βC1 mutant (TA + mβ)–infected  Nb compared to healthy  Nb plants ( Fig. 1E). To further confirm this newly identified function for the βC1 protein, we measured the larval weights of CBM feeding on transgenic  Nb or  Arabidopsis lines ectopically expressing TYLCCNV β C1 (βC1-1/Nb, βC1-1/At, or βC1-3/At). CBM feeding on plants overexpressing β C1 weighed significantly less than those feeding on wild-type plants ( Fig. 1, F and G). By contrast, whiteflies laid more eggs and exhibited faster pupa development on β C1-expressing lines than on the control  Arabidopsis Col-0 plants ( Fig. 1, H and I). These results demonstrate that βC1 protein triggers these asymmetric effects on the vector whitefly and nonvector CBM. To examine whether and how CLCuMuV alters host plant interactions with the vector whitefly and local nonvector herbivores during an invasion, we first examined the interaction between whitefly and cotton bollworm (CBM;  Helicoverpa armigera), a nonvector herbivore on cotton plants. CBM is a major generalist lepidopteran leaf-chewing pest that can live on a wide range of plants including cotton,  Solanum lycopersicum,  Nicotiana benthamiana ( Nb), and  Arabidopsis thaliana. When we placed CBM and whitefly together on noninfected control cotton plants, both herbivores had reduced performance on cotton compared to when either insect was present alone, suggesting that CBM is a native competitor of whitefly on cotton (fig. S1, A and B). Next, to assess whether the begomovirus alters competition between whitefly and CBM, we tested the performance of whitefly and CBM on cotton infected with CLCuMuV and its associated β-satellite (hereafter referred to as CA + β) (fig. S1, C and D). Since begomoviruses can disable the JA signaling pathway to promote whitefly performance, we expected begomoviruses to benefit herbivores including CBM. The whiteflies indeed performed better on plants infected with the CLCuMuV complex, as indicated that CA + β–infected cotton showed significantly higher densities of whitefly than noninfected cotton ( Fig. 1, A and B). The virus complex conferred strong resistance to CBM, as evident from the reduced feeding, reduced body weight, and higher mortality ( Fig. 1, A, C, and D, and fig. S1, E and F). The superior inhibitory effects on CBM by begomovirus infection were as good as that of a widely used commercial transgenic cotton cultivar engineered to produce insecticidal toxins from  Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt) ( Fig. 1, C and D) ( 16). As most monopartite begomoviruses are associated with β-satellite, we next tested whether this asymmetric tripartite interaction also occurs in other β-satellite–associated begomoviruses.  Nb plants infected with tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) and its associated β-satellite (TA + β), another begomovirus, had a similar asymmetric effect on the vector whitefly and the nonvector herbivore CBM ( Fig. 1E) ( 8). The hijacking of WRKY20 by viral βC1 promotes plant resistance to aphid by activating SA signaling So far, we have demonstrated that WRKY20 may confer plant tissue-specific immunity against two different herbivores that have unique ecological niches on the same plant. Given these observations, we next expected that the reduction of indole GSs in both β C1-expressing plants and  wrky20 mutant plants would also benefit other piercing insects such as aphids. Like whiteflies, aphids are another key insect vector for many types of plant viruses including potyvirus and cucumovirus ( 30). Unexpectedly,  wrky20 mutants and β C1-expressing plants exhibited resistance to the green peach aphid ( Myzus persicae) ( Fig. 6A), suggesting that there are different mechanisms for WRKY20-mediated immunity against this species, which is not a begomovirus vector. Our above results demonstrated that WRKY20 physically and functionally interacts with ORA59 ( Fig. 5, C and D), which has been shown to be a key intersection point of pathways involving defensive phytohormones, i.e., JA, ethylene, and SA. It has been established that plant SA-mediated resistance is the major phytohormone-mediated defense against aphids ( 31). SA signaling negatively regulates resistance against whitefly nymphal development, but it is a prerequisite for the plant to build immunity toward infestation by aphids, another phloem sap-feeding local insect ( 32). This led us to examine the role of WRKY20 in SA signaling. We found that increased expression of SA synthesis and SA-responsive genes ( AtPAL1,  AtSID2,  AtPAD4,  AtEDS5, and  AtPR1) in  Arabidopsis plants with down-regulated  WRKY20 expression or transgenic β C1 expression ( Fig. 6, B to F) promoted tolerance to green peach aphid. Meanwhile, overexpressing  AtWRKY20 in  Arabidopsis reduced resistance to aphids by suppressing SA signaling (fig. S9, A and B). Furthermore, we demonstrated that AtWRKY20 could bind to some of the W-boxes in the promoter of  AtPR1, which is a marker gene for the SA signaling pathway (fig. S9, C and D). Therefore, the interaction of between βC1 and WRKY20 activates plant SA signaling and enhances plant resistance to a nonvector aphid. We also investigated how the begomovirus itself benefits from interfering with WRKY20. Because TYLCCNV replicates weakly in  Arabidopsis, we used cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV), a bipartite begomovirus, to infect  Arabidopsis ( 8). The  wrky20-1 mutant plants had more severe viral infection symptoms and higher virus accumulation than the wild-type Col-0 control ( Fig. 6, G to I). These results suggest that WRKY20 mediates plant immunity against begomoviruses and that the suppression of WRKY20 activity by begomoviruses not only benefits the whitefly vector but also facilitates the multiplication of begomovirus in the host plant.","A parasite-infected host may promote performance of associated insect vectors; but possible parasite effects on nonvector insects have been largely unexplored. Here, we show that  Begomovirus , the largest genus of plant viruses and transmitted exclusively by whitefly, reprogram plant immunity to promote the fitness of the vector and suppress performance of nonvector insects (i.e., cotton bollworm and aphid). Infected plants accumulated begomoviral βC1 proteins in the phloem where they were bound to the plant transcription factor WRKY20. This viral hijacking of WRKY20 spatiotemporally redeployed plant chemical immunity within the leaf and had the asymmetrical benefiting effects on the begomoviruses and its whitefly vectors while negatively affecting two nonvector competitors. This type of interaction between a parasite and two types of herbivores, i.e., vectors and nonvectors, occurs widely in various natural and agricultural ecosystems; thus, our results have broad implications for the ecological significance of parasite-vector-host tripartite interactions.",NaN," 'Fig.', 'CBM', 'Arabidopsis', 'plants', 'plant', 'whitefly', 'expression', 'CBM feeding', 'interaction', 'mutant' "," βC1, GS, vascular-specific, GS, βC1-3/At, IGS, β C1-expressing, GS, WRKY20, WRKY20, CBM, GS, GS, βC1-WRKY20, begomovirus-whitefly, CBM, CBM, WRKY20-mediated, TYLCCNV β C1, vascular-specific, WRKY20, begomovirus-plant-herbivore, IGS, GS, IGS, IGS-related, AtMYB51, AtWRKY20, IGS-related, M, fig.

The survival rate, from third instar larva to pupation, was significantly lower for larvae fed on P1-treated leaves, compared to control plants ( Figure 1) (Log-Rank test, χ 2 = 9.009, df = 1,  P = 0.0027). No difference between treated or untreated plants was noted in the quantity of leaves consumed by experimental larvae. P1 treatment had a negative impact on weight gain of  S. littoralis larvae. While no statistically significant difference was registered on days 6–9, starting from day 10, the larvae feeding on P1-treated leaves were always significantly lighter than controls ( Figure 2), and this difference was constant until pupation (Student’s  t test,  P ≤ 0.0001). Trichoderma P1 Massively Manipulates Tomato Plant Transcriptome Several transcription factors (TFs) were up-regulated  ethylene responsive transcription factors (ERFs), WRKY, MYB, and bZIP TFs  ( Supplementary Table S1) as well as genes involved in VOC production (i.e., Squalene monooxygenase and terpene) that are part of the gene expression cascade triggered in the plant defense response. The up-regulation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/quinatehydroxycinnamoyl transferase suggests the activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway ( Supplementary Tables S1,  S2 and  Supplementary Figure S2), which is involved in plant direct and indirect defense ( Dixon et al., 2002;  Mumm et al., 2008). These findings are consistent with those observed in the KEGG analysis: using DEGs in a query to a KEGG database, key enzymes associated with phenylpropanoids and terpenoid biosynthesis were found ( Supplementary Figures S3,  S4), indicating that P1 plant treatment affected phenylalanine metabolism and mevalonate pathway that control the biosynthesis of terpenoids. In particular, the correspondence between enzymes and encoding transcripts was found for three enzymes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and seven enzymes implicated in terpenoid biosynthesis ( Table 2). Trichoderma P1 inoculation to “Dwarf San Marzano” induced a wide transcriptome reprogramming involving 2513 gene transcripts; among them, 1247 were up-regulated, while 1266 were down-regulated.  Figure 5 shows the Gene Ontology (GO) distribution of DEGs in tomato plants treated with  Trichoderma P1, based on the “Biological Process” ontological domain. Numerous defense-related genes are included in categories such as “Gene expression,” “Transport,” and “Response to stimulus.” The enrichment analysis underlined the up-regulation of genes included in categories specifically associated with plant defense responses, such as “spermine and spermidine biosynthetic process,” “isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthetic process,” and “arginine catabolic process” ( Supplementary Figure S2). The activation of tomato defense mechanisms associated with  Trichoderma colonization ( Tucci et al., 2011;  Hermosa et al., 2012) was clearly indicated in our experiments by the up-regulation of genes involved in early signals as Serine/threonine-protein kinase, Leucine-rich repeat protein kinase family protein, LRKs, glutathione S-transferase, calcium-binding protein, calmodulin-binding transcription activator, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase 3 ( Supplementary Table S1). In addition, a large number of up-regulated transcripts code for several classes of genes active late in the plant defense reaction, and therefore directly active against herbivores, such as proteinase inhibitors (PIs) (i.e., wound-induced PI I, Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor, and metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor). The transcription of these late genes is induced by JA, the end product of the octadecanoid pathway, which was promoted in P1-treated plants. In fact, transcripts coding for lipoxygenase and allene oxide synthase, two upstream genes of the path, were up-regulated. Other up-regulated late defense genes code for enzymes that reduce the nutritional value of the food ingested or interfere with insect digestion such as threonine deaminase, leucine aminopeptidase A1, arginase 2, and polyphenol oxidase. Interestingly, almost 20 transcripts encoding glycosyltransferases were up-regulated. As expected, the plants treated with P1 showed the up-regulation of genes involved in the salicylic acid biosynthetic pathway (i.e., S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases superfamily protein, SAM), although a number of genes under SA control (i.e., PR1, PR10, Thaumatin, and Osmotin) were noted as down-regulated. A. ervi Bioassay The parasitoid behavior was influenced by P1 inoculation in comparison to control plants. Colonization by  T. atroviride P1 resulted in a significant increase of attraction, with 75% oriented flights ( G test, χ 2 = 50.01, df = 1,  P < 0.001) and 50% landings ( G test, χ 2 = 13.21, df = 1,  P < 0.001) compared to untreated controls, where oriented flights and landings were 24 and 23%, respectively ( Figure 4). M. euphorbiae Bioassay Aphid survival was measured starting from 1st instar nymphs. Survival was significantly impaired on P1-treated plants compared to controls ( Figure 3) (Log-Rank test, χ 2 = 10.5, df = 1,  P = 0.0012). A decline in the survival rate started to be evident on day 8 and was consistent throughout the bioassay, while no difference in the times of molting (to young instars and surviving adults) was observed. VOC Analysis Gas chromatography (GC) and coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analyses of VOCs collected from treated and untreated tomato plants detected a total of 24 compounds ( Table 1), with a greater number of VOCs released by the P1 plants. In particular, the  Trichoderma treatment induced the  ex novo production of z-3-hexenol, δ-2-carene, limonene, and methyl salicylate, not present in the control, and significantly increased the quantity of emission in α-pinene and β-cymene ( Table 1). The overall difference in volatile emissions can be fully appreciated on the basis of the PCA analysis, which clearly separated control plants from those inoculated with  T. atroviride P1 ( Supplementary Figure S1). The two principal components accounted for 46 and 22% of the total variation in VOC profiles ( Supplementary Figure S1A).","Numerous microbial root symbionts are known to induce different levels of enhanced plant protection against a variety of pathogens. However, more recent studies have demonstrated that beneficial microbes are able to induce plant systemic resistance that confers some degree of protection against insects. Here, we report how treatments with the fungal biocontrol agent  Trichoderma atroviride  strain P1 in tomato plants induce responses that affect pest insects with different feeding habits: the noctuid moth  Spodoptera littoralis  (Boisduval) and the aphid  Macrosiphum euphorbiae  (Thomas). We observed that the tomato plant- Trichoderma  P1 interaction had a negative impact on the development of moth larvae and on aphid longevity. These effects were attributed to a plant response induced by  Trichoderma  that was associated with transcriptional changes of a wide array of defense-related genes. While the impact on aphids could be related to the up-regulation of genes involved in the oxidative burst reaction, which occur early in the defense reaction, the negative performance of moth larvae was associated with the enhanced expression of genes encoding for protective enzymes (i.e., Proteinase inhibitor I (PI), Threonine deaminase, Leucine aminopeptidase A1, Arginase 2, and Polyphenol oxidase) that are activated downstream in the defense cascade. In addition,  Trichoderma  P1 produced alterations in plant metabolic pathways leading to the production and release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are involved in the attraction of the aphid parasitoid  Aphidius ervi , thus reinforcing the indirect plant defense barriers. Our findings, along with the evidence available in the literature, indicate that the outcome of the tripartite interaction among plant,  Trichoderma , and pests is highly specific and only a comprehensive approach, integrating both insect phenotypic changes and plant transcriptomic alterations, can allow a reliable prediction of its potential for plant protection."," 'VOCs', 'Spodoptera Littoralis', 'Macrosiphum Euphorbiae', 'Aphidius Ervi', 'Root Symbionts', 'Plant Induced Defence' "," 'Supplementary Figure', 'Figure', 'Supplementary Table', 'plants', 'Supplementary', 'genes', 'Tomato plants', 'Table', 'control plants', 'genes involved' "," Log-Rank, χ 2, 6–9, ≤, WRKY, MYB, bZIP TFs , phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, “, ”, “, ”, “, ” “, ”, “, ”, “spermine, ” “isopentenyl diphosphate, ”, “arginine, ”, Serine/threonine-protein kinase, Leucine-rich repeat protein kinase, LRKs, glutathione S-transferase, calcium-binding protein, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase 3, proteinase inhibitors, wound-induced PI, Kunitz-type proteinase, metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor), JA, threonine deaminase, leucine aminopeptidase A1, arginase 2, polyphenol oxidase, PR1, PR10, Thaumatin, A., χ 2, χ 2, Log-Rank, χ 2, z-3-hexenol, α-pinene, β-cymene ( Table 1, S1A ",  ," 'S.', 'S.', 'S.'

69,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC4332321/eupmc_result.json,PMC4332321,"RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ANNOTATION AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION According to the COG database 11,004 proteins showed a functional annotation. The most representatives COG annotations were Serine/threonine protein kinase (COG0515) with 1,318 proteins. These kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues on target proteins by using ATP as phosphate donor, which is a way to regulate the function of the target protein ( UniProt Consortium, 2014). Followed by FOG: WD40 repeat (COG2319) with 301 proteins, which are implicated in a variety of functions that include signal transduction, regulation of transcription and cell cycle control, among others ( Stirnimann et al., 2010). And by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein (COG4886) with 190 proteins, which are proteins whose main function appears to be to provide a versatile structural framework for the formation of protein–protein interactions ( Kobe and Kajava, 2001). The annotation of assembled sequences was performed using the Swiss-Prot and NCBI non-redundant databases and the results are shown in  Figure   1. According to the Swiss-Prot database, 25,154 genes were fully annotated, 3,905 were partially annotated (Psignal, Pfam, COG, among others) and for 5,264 there was no annotation. In contrast, the results of the annotation performed with the NR database suggest that 32,560 deduced proteins (98.2%) showed significant BLASTp matches with amino acid sequences deposited in the nr database (cut-off E-value of 10 -3).  Citrus protein sequences were the most commonly matched with 36.9% (12,249 sequences) of the 33,142 proteins matched with  C. sinensis followed by 35.3% with  Citrus clementina (11,708 amino acid sequences;  Figure   2). A phylogenetic study of mango chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) reported that  C. sinensis was closely related to  M. indica ( Azim et al., 2014).  M. indica L., meanwhile only presented hits for 62 amino acid sequences, as little publicly available sequence information previously existed for this species. Fruit ripening is a complex process that involves physiological and biochemical modifications associated with metabolic pathways, like the conversion of starch to sugars, changes in the biosynthesis and accumulation of pigments, biosynthesis of flavor and aromatic volatiles and remodeling of the structure of cell wall ( Goulao and Oliveira, 2008).  Table   2 shows five major pathways associated with fruit ripening, the number of gene products involved in each and the percentage of gene products of these pathways identified from the transcriptome or the differentially expressed subset with respect to the  C. sinensis database. The metabolic pathways are: plant hormone signal transduction (Figure S4), starch and sucrose metabolism (Figure S5), galactose metabolism (Figure S6), terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (Figure S7) and carotenoid biosynthesis (Figure S8). The predicted mango genes were classified into the three Gene Ontology (GO) categories: Cellular Component, Biological Process, and Molecular Function. Based on sequence homology, 29,844 mango unigenes ( Figure   1) were categorized into 81,315 functional groups. The Cellular Component category-contained 10,999 unigenes with the most highly represented terms being “cell part” (9,002), “membrane-bounded organelle” (5,332) and “protein complex” (2,448; Figure  S1). The Biological Process category contained 16,055 unigenes with the more highly represented GO terms including “organic substance metabolic process” (10,261), “primary metabolic process” (9,805) and “cellular metabolic process” (9,557; Figure  S2). The Molecular Function category contained 21,331 unigenes with the most frequent GO terms being “organic cyclic compound binding” (7,686), “heterocyclic compound binding” (7,677), and “ion binding” (6,890; Figure  S3). In the mango leaf transcriptome ( Azim et al., 2014), similar GO terms at similar frequencies to the results of this work were observed, where the terms “cell part” for cellular component, “cellular process” for biological process and “binding” for molecular function, were their most representative GO terms. Transcripts were also analyzed in the KEGG database and a total of 7,458 unigenes ( Figure   1) were assigned to 327 KEGG pathways. Tables  S2 and  S3 show 30 metabolic pathways of genes for both the total mango transcriptome and the differentially expressed subset. The most significant pathways with regard to the number of hits from the whole transcriptome data were “biosynthesis of amino acids,” “ribosome” and “RNA transport,” different to the results of the mango “Zill” transcriptome, who reported that “metabolic pathways,” “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” and “plant-pathogen interactions” were the maps with the highest transcripts representation ( Wu et al., 2014a). In the other hand, 3,966 unigenes were annotated in all the databases, including NR, Swiss-Prot, GO, COG and KEGG ( Figure   1). qRT-PCR VALIDATION In order to validate the DE data obtained by RNA-seq, the following single unigenes were selected to experimentally determine their expression levels by qRT-PCR: 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO) comp59876, ethylene receptor 1 (ETR1) comp46286, ethylene response sensor 1 (ERS1) comp32379, ethylene insensitive 4 (EIN4) comp34039, PME comp45079, PL comp63384, expansin (EXP) comp51667, alpha-galactosidase (AGAL) comp46653, lycopene beta-cyclase (LCYB) comp42574 and carotenoid beta-hydroxylase 2 (CHYB2) comp39312. The results for gene expression ratios between ripe and mature-green mango are shown in  Figure   4A. A linear regression analysis showed an overall correlation coefficient of  R = 0.97, which indicates a high correlation between transcript abundance assayed by qRT-PCR and the transcription profile revealed by RNA-seq data ( Figure   4B). The results showed that although the exact fold changes of selected genes at the two data points (mature-green and ripe mango) varied between RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analyses, trends of gene expression by the two different approaches were consistent. The RNA-seq data reflects what is happening in the cell at the transcriptional level during mango ripening. MANGO RNA-seq AND  DE NOVO ASSEMBLY A total of 234,310,610 Illumina reads from both, mature-green and ripe conditions were obtained with a total of 16,870,363,920 bases (16 Gb). The FastQC program was used to evaluate the quality of the reads and low-quality or adapter sequences were removed. After trimming and discarding low-quality reads, 67,682,269 clean reads (4,873,123,368 pb) were used. The GenBank accession number for those reads is SRP045880. After Trinity assembly 80,969 transcripts were obtained with a mean length of 836 bp and N 50 of 1,456 bp. The largest transcript was 8,713 nucleotides long. Transcripts were assembled into 52,948 putative unigenes of which 33,142 had an open reading frame (ORF). Detailed information about the assembly statistics are presented in  Table   1. A leaf transcriptome of mango “Langra” was reported ( Azim et al., 2014) where 85,651 transcripts were obtained with a mean size of 536 bp resulting in 30,509 unigenes. In this study, we obtained 22,439 more unigenes and a significantly higher mean transcript length. The pooled transcriptomes from mango “Zill” pericarp and pulp had 124,002 transcripts with a mean size of 838 bp resulting in 54,207 unigenes ( Wu et al., 2014a) essentially similar to our results. DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION DURING MANGO RIPENING We determined if particular GO terms were enriched in the DE genes as compared to the complete transcriptome.  Figure   3 shows the significantly enriched terms ranked according to the  p-value and number of genes. Some enrichment of GO terms of up-regulated genes ( Figure   3A) are associated to fruit ripening like “cell wall” and “integral component of endoplasmic reticulum membrane,” “starch metabolic process” and “sucrose metabolism.” Similar up-regulation of genes associated with “cell wall” and the “starch metabolic process” during fruit ripening has been previously observed ( Feng et al., 2012;  Wu et al., 2014b). In addition, genes involved in other important biological processes such as “regulation of gene expression,” “carbohydrate catabolic process” and “DNA binding” were also identified. Some enrichment of GO terms for down-regulated genes ( Figure   3B) was associated to, “protein phosphorylation,” “regulation of transcription” and “protein serine/threonine kinase activity.” Using the edgeR pipeline included with the Trinity software, a total of 2,306 genes were identified as differentially expressed between the mature-green and ripe mango stages, representing 6.9% of total unigenes with a predicted ORF ( FDR < 0.05). From these, 1,178 were up-regulated and 1,128 were down-regulated (Figure S9). As was expected in a climacteric fruit, there was a wide range of genes up-regulated during mango ripening, such as carbohydrate catabolism, sucrose and ethylene biosynthesis among others. Genes encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase, PME, PG, PL, endoglucanase, expansin, β -galactosidase, α -galactosidase, rhamnogalacturonate lyase (RGL), and β -amylase among others were expressed at higher levels at ripe mango and are listed in  Table   3. These genes are generally encoded in multiple copies in plants. Family members of PGs, PLs, β -galactosidases and other unigenes identified in this transcriptome will be very helpful in future studies where their expression profiles at different developmental stages will be assayed at the transcriptional and translational level. Genes associated to color Mesocarp in mango fruit changes from green to yellow-orange color due to the accumulation of carotenoids ( Tanaka et al., 2008). It has been reported that all- trans-β-carotene, all- trans-violaxanthin and 9- cis-violaxanthin (as dibutyrates) are the principal “Ataulfo” mango carotenoids. During fruit ripening, carotenoids accumulate in an exponential manner, especially all- trans-β-carotene ( Ornelas-Paz et al., 2008). In tomato, the genes encoding enzymes of the carotenoid pathway are regulated both transcriptionally ( Klee and Giovannoni, 2011) and post-transcriptionally ( Cazzonelli and Pogson, 2010). In this study, 10 genes that encode enzymes of carotenoid metabolism in mango mesocarp were DE; a PSY (comp42694) that carry out the first committed step, was highly expressed in mango and did not changed during ripening. While two identified phytoene desaturases (PDSs; comp46184 and comp44482) and one zeta-carotene desaturase (ZDS; comp39926) did not changed during ripening. However, a lycopene isomerase ( MiCRTISO; comp42184) gene presented 4-fold change in ripe mango; similarly, a tomato  SlCRTISO was also up-regulated at the red-ripe stage of fruit development ( Smita et al., 2013). In this study, a lycopene-beta-cyclase ( LCYB; comp42574) transcript presented a -2 fold change in ripe mango.  LCYB is 83% identical to persimmon fruit  DkLCYB and relative expression levels of  DkLCYB followed a similar expression pattern of mango  LCYB. The levels of  DkLCYB decreased during ripening and correlated with the increased contents of β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene in this fruit ( Zhao et al., 2011). Two carotenoid β-hydroxylase (CHYB1 and CHYB2) genes were identified in mango.  CHYB1 (comp45152) presented a 4-fold increase in ripe mango; while  CHYB2 did not changed during ripening. Zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP; comp41313) expression level was down-regulated in ripe mango with -2 fold change. Two additional genes from the isoprenoid pathway that may be associated with color development were identified in this transcriptome, unigene farnesyl diphosphate synthase (comp 48152) and GGPS (comp48107) were differentially expressed with 2 and 8-fold change, respectively. Genes related to flavor quality During ripening the membranes and the cell wall become permeable allowing the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway to be active by sequential enzyme steps involving lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL). Substrates for lipoxygenase, such as linoleic and linolenic acids, are common constituents of plant membranes ( Riley et al., 1996). For mangos “Kensington Pride,” caprylic, capric, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids were found in the pulp of ripe fruit ( Lalel et al., 2003). Six LOX genes were found DE in this transcriptome in ripe mango; four genes (comp20603, comp47763, comp40188, comp44212) were up-regulated with 6, 5, 3, and 3-fold change, respectively. In tomato, at least five LOX genes have been reported, but there is only one ( TomloxC) associated with volatile synthesis and it is expressed during tomato ripening ( Heitz et al., 1997;  Chen et al., 2004). This  TomloxC is 47% identical with a LOX gene (comp44212) of mango. Fruit flavor is often dependent on aroma generated by volatile compounds and taste is associated with the sugar/acid ratio. Sucrose, glucose and fructose are the most abundant fruit sugars ( Chaimanee and Suntornwat, 1994). In fruit ripening, accumulation of sucrose is due to the activity of the enzyme sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and sucrose phosphate phosphatase (SPP). In this study, six SPS genes were identified and they remained constantly expressed from mature-green to ripe mango. Two SPP genes were obtained and one of them (comp47111) was highly expressed in both stages. While seven sucrose synthase (SuSy) genes were identified, one of them (comp45134) was up-regulated and the rest did not changed in ripe mango. Recently,  Islam et al. (2014) reported the presence of at least six SuSy genes in  Citrus, four of them were expressed in fruit juice sacs and mature leaves and two expressed in young leaves. They demonstrated that the  Citrus SuSy genes have different spatio-temporal expression patterns. Mango fruit has more than 300 volatile compounds identified and terpene hydrocarbons (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) are the dominant volatile components ( Pino et al., 2005). This transcriptome data set contained a total of 29 terpenoid backbone biosynthesis genes, and seven were DE ( Table   2). Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) catalyzes the synthesis of farnesyl pyrophosphate, a key intermediate in sterol and sesquiterpene biosynthesis. Recently, a  FPPS gene was identified in mango “Alphonso” and it was expressed during fruit ripening ( Kulkarni et al., 2013). An  FPPS (comp48152) transcript was identified and showed a 2-fold increase in expression in ripe mango. Another important gene for aroma is the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPS), in this study two GGPS genes were identified, one of them (comp40639) was highly expressed in both stages and the other (comp48107) was DE (8-fold change) during ripening. In orange, mono and sesquiterpenes are the major components for flavor, while in climacteric varieties of melon, volatile esters are the predominant components together with sesquiterpenes, norisoprenoids, alcohols, and aldehydes ( Sharon-Asa et al., 2003;  El Hadi et al., 2013). Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway genes Other components of the ethylene signaling pathway, such as the constitutive triple response CTR1 (comp43157), which was down-regulated (-2-fold) and eleven ethylene-responsive transcription factor (ERF) were found in this transcriptome, where one (comp27110) was up-regulated (7-fold), seven were down-regulated (comp18706, comp26333, comp34532, comp39082, comp40325, comp42703, and comp45406) in mango ripe and three did not changed (comp24020, comp41521, comp45323). In a previous report ( Wu et al., 2014b), one  ERF showed a decrease in its expression levels during orange ripening. Four genes encoding the ethylene biosynthesis enzyme (ACC) oxidase and two encoding ACC synthase were obtained in this study. Three ACC oxidase genes were up-regulated in ripe mango (comp35681, comp36021, comp59876) with 2, 4, and 7-fold changes, respectively. The expression of the two ACC synthase genes did not change. Both ACC oxidase and ACC synthase are encoded by a multigene family of five and nine members, respectively, in tomato ( Nath et al., 2006). Ethylene signaling is a plant hormone signal transduction pathway. Several ethylene response genes have been identified in  Arabidopsis ( Bleecker, 1998;  Schaller and Kieber, 2002) and tomato ( Lashbrook et al., 1998;  Tieman and Klee, 1999). In this work we have identified four ethylene receptor transcripts:  ETR1 (comp46286) and  ETR2 (comp47044), that remain constant during fruit ripening, and  ERS1 (comp32379) and  EIN4 (comp34039) that showed a decrease in their expression levels. Regulator proteins EIN2 (comp43660), EIN3 (comp47416), and EIL3 (comp41806) were also identified and their levels remained constant. EIN3 proteins are controlled by two F-box proteins (EBF1/2), which are SKP–Cullin–F-box (SCF) E3 ligases targeting EIN3 and EIL for 26S proteosome degradation ( Guo and Ecker, 2003). Two EBF (ethylene binding F-Box proteins) sequences were found in this study, EBF1 (comp45329) was up-regulated (2-fold) and EBF2 (comp44836) was down-regulated (-2-fold) in ripe mango. In this work, an increase in the expression levels of five  EXP transcripts (comp32472, comp51667, comp31446, comp32692, comp48981) was observed with 17, 5, 4, 2, and 2-fold changes, respectively. Only one mango  EXP (comp42385) showed decreased expression (-2-fold change) in ripe fruit. In mango “Dashehari” and “Zill,” expansin genes had increased expression during fruit ripening ( Sane et al., 2005;  Zheng et al., 2012).  EXPA1 of mango “Dashehari” is 71% identical to  EXP (comp51667) obtained in this study that also had increased expression levels in ripe fruit. Genes associated with firmness In mango, there is evidence that enzymatic hydrolysis of starch by α or β- amylases results in major loosening of the cell wall structure, which results in a decrease of the fruit firmness and increase of sweetness. Also, in mango “Kent” there is evidence that 90% of starch is catabolized in the early stages of fruit ripening, which is associated with fruit softening ( Yashoda et al., 2006;  Cárdenas-Coronel et al., 2012). In this work, four β-amylases encoding genes were found, two of them (comp44532, comp39992) were up-regulated (3, 2-fold changes), whereas the others did not changed in ripe mango. Meanwhile, three α-amylases were found (comp46096, comp40871, comp40434) highly expressed and did not change during ripening. In mango fruit, it has been shown that these genes have a very important role in fruit quality.  Lima et al. (2001) reported that in fruit that showed lower activities of amylase, a spongy tissue was observed, which is a physiological disorder that affects the fruit quality and therefore, the potential for marketing. Pectin, formed by galacturonic acid with α-1,4 linkages, generally is highly methyl-esterified and must be de-esterified by PME to be later processed by PG ( Brummell and Harpster, 2001). Seven  PME cDNAs were found in this transcriptome, six of them (comp45079, comp198908, comp27472, comp173846, comp37143, comp37279) were up-regulated with 8, 7, 6, 5, 3, and 2-fold changes, respectively and one (comp43676) was down-regulated (-2-fold) in ripe mango. These results suggest that PME expression is differentially regulated during mango ripening. Mango fruit ripening involves changes in cell wall structure and degradation of lamella media, which are mainly composed by pectin, as well as loss of starch, which result in loss of firmness ( Yashoda et al., 2006;  Cárdenas-Coronel et al., 2012). Gene families encoding for PGs, PMEs, PLs, RGL, α-GAL, β-GAL and β-glucosidases (β-Glu) that degrade cell wall components, as well as α and β-amylases that degrade starch were DE in this work ( FDR < 0.05). In this study, only one  RGL (comp25112) was obtained and it was DE in ripe mango (5-fold). It is known that RGL degrades pectin type rhamnogalacturonan I, but little is known about how it acts in fruit cell walls. In potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) plants transformed with fungal  RGL, the resulting tubers had cells with an altered morphology and their cell wall contents were easier to extract than those from wild-type plants, suggesting the importance of this enzyme ( Oomen et al., 2002). Recently, in strawberry ( Fragaria x ananassa) an RGL gene was reported to be up-regulated in receptacle in ripe fruit and it was related to the degree of firmness of fruit according to genetic linkage association analysis ( Molina-Hidalgo et al., 2013). This strawberry RGL enzyme is 57% identical in amino acid sequence to the mango RGL (comp25112) from this transcriptome. This enzyme could be important in softening and it will be interesting to uncover its function. Two β -Glu transcripts (comp43956, comp47526), which are involved in cellulose degradation, were up-regulated in ripe mango with 6 and 5-fold change, respectively. Expression analysis of β -Glu during ripening in fruits is very limited; most of the reports are about enzymatic analysis. In mango “Ataulfo,” the activity of this enzyme increased significantly during fruit ripening, which coincides with a dramatic decrease in firmness ( Muy-Rangel et al., 2009). In sweet cherry ( Prunus avium L.), the purification of one β-Glu has been reported and its activity increased during ripening ( Gerardi et al., 2001). In this study, nine  PG unigenes were obtained and six of them (comp28658, comp34301, comp35446, comp39571, comp39826, comp39773) were up-regulated in ripe mango, with 12, 10, 10, 9, 2, and 2-fold changes, respectively. One  PG was down-regulated (comp26280) with a -4 fold. These results suggest that PG expression is developmentally regulated and that most of the PGs act in late phase of ripening but they could act also at the beginning. In papaya ( Carica papaya),  Fabi et al. (2014), reported that  cpPG1 plays a central role during pulp softening. This  cpPG1 presented higher expression levels compared with other three papaya  PG. Comparing the amino acid sequences of cpPG1 against mango PG, those encoded in comp35446 and comp28658, were 68 and 67% identical, respectively. The up-regulation of these two PG (comp35446 and comp28658) in ripe mango could imply their role in pulp softening. In banana ( Musa acuminata), four genes encoding PG associated with fruit ripening were also reported ( Mehar and Pravendra, 2005). Comparison of amino acid sequences of these PGs and mango PGs showed a high percentage of identity (up to 62%) and their expression patterns were also similar. In mango cultivars “Alphonso” and “Dashehari,” three PG isoforms that showed an increase in their activity during fruit ripening were reported ( Prasanna et al., 2006;  Singh and Dwivedi, 2008). Two of the main pectin deglycosylating enzymes that participate in this process are α-GAL and β-GAL ( Goulao and Oliveira, 2008). In this study, four α- GAL transcripts were identified and three of them (comp38455, comp42509, comp45738) did not changed expression levels during ripening; while one of them (comp46653) was up-regulated (2-fold change). Nine β-GAL genes were identified and three (comp41701, comp41168, comp46653) were up-regulated with fold-changes of 12, 10, and 2, respectively, in ripe mango; while five β -GAL transcripts (comp42509, comp250695, comp44177, comp45738, comp44177) expression levels did not changed in ripe mango. Among the glycosidases from mango, β-GAL appeared to be the most predominant ( Ali et al., 1995;  Prasanna et al., 2005). This fact is consistent with the number of unigenes for β-GAL obtained in this study. The abundance of four  PL (comp63384, comp28245, comp49359, comp21883) transcripts increased during mango ripening with 11, 6, 5, and 2-fold changes, respectively. In a previous study with mango “Dashehari,” a PL gene associated to fruit ripening was reported and its expression levels increased in ripe mango ( Chourasia et al., 2006). This PL gene is similar to the PL gene (comp21883) reported in this transcriptome (both are 99% identical in their amino acid sequences). In banana, two different  PL (Pel I and Pel II) cDNAs associated with fruit ripening have been reported. Both  PL presented higher levels of expression in ripe bananas ( Marin-Rodriguez et al., 2003).","Fruit ripening is a physiological and biochemical process genetically programmed to regulate fruit quality parameters like firmness, flavor, odor and color, as well as production of ethylene in climacteric fruit. In this study, a transcriptomic analysis of mango (Mangifera indica L.) mesocarp cv. ""Kent"" was done to identify key genes associated with fruit ripening. Using the Illumina sequencing platform, 67,682,269 clean reads were obtained and a transcriptome of 4.8 Gb. A total of 33,142 coding sequences were predicted and after functional annotation, 25,154 protein sequences were assigned with a product according to Swiss-Prot database and 32,560 according to non-redundant database. Differential expression analysis identified 2,306 genes with significant differences in expression between mature-green and ripe mango  1,178 up-regulated and 1,128 down-regulated (FDR ≤ 0.05) . The expression of 10 genes evaluated by both qRT-PCR and RNA-seq data was highly correlated (R = 0.97), validating the differential expression data from RNA-seq alone. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, showed significantly represented terms associated to fruit ripening like ""cell wall,"" ""carbohydrate catabolic process"" and ""starch and sucrose metabolic process"" among others. Mango genes were assigned to 327 metabolic pathways according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, among them those involved in fruit ripening such as plant hormone signal transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, terpenoid backbone, and carotenoid biosynthesis. This study provides a mango transcriptome that will be very helpful to identify genes for expression studies in early and late flowering mangos during fruit ripening."," 'Ethylene', 'Fruit quality', 'Fruit ripening', 'Transcriptome', 'Mesocarp', 'Cell Wall Hydrolytic Enzymes', 'Mangifera Indica L.'

70,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC4492009/eupmc_result.json,PMC4492009,"Results Expression of unigenes Finally, one more highly expressed transcript, cl9787_2, shares significant similarity with a  HT-B gene from  S. peruvianum, a gene involved in the self-incompatibility of wild  Solanum genera and is not expressed in self compatible species like  S. lycopersicum   27 . The strong expression of the gene in  S. elaeagnifolium provides molecular evidence for the outcrossing of the species, common in wild  Solanums. S. elaeagnifolium has another probable  HT gene (cl9787_1) that is also expressed in flowers and leaves but lower than cl9787_2. Transcript abundances were estimated for  S. elaeagnifolium unigenes by the RSEM software   20 . The complete list of the 20 most expressed genes in  S. elaeagnifolium leaves and flowers is presented in Table  2. The comparison of  S. elaeagnifolium leaf and flower transcriptome expression results of the present study, produced by RSEM analysis, with other Solanaceae transcriptomes has shown that the majority of the most abundant transcripts are common inside the family. For instance, the most abundant transcripts in  S. elaeagnifolium leaves and flowers encode a putative subunit of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) protein, a Rubisco activase, putative lipid-transfer proteins, proteins involved in chlorophyl binding and photosystem I and II, a S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) etc. Most of these transcripts are universally identified as strongly expressed in  Solanum databases (tomato, potato transcriptomes)   21,  22 . Transcripts strongly expressed that code for metallothioneins (MTs) are also found. MTs are proteins that bind metal ions and are classified in four classes/types depending on the amount and the arrangement of their cysteine-rich domains   23 . MT proteins are known to respond to metal presence but also may play a role in reactive oxygen species detoxification  for a review on MT roles see   24 . An additional abundant  S. elaeagnifolium transcript encodes a putative plastidic aldolase, an enzyme  Enzyme Commission number (EC): 4.1.2.13  that catalyzes the formation of d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) from fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Two plastidic aldolases from species  N. paniculata were found in the leaves of this plant known for its tolerance in low-water conditions   25 .  S. elaeagnifolium gene shares a high homology (>90 %) with these genes both responding also to salt stress   25 . Third in abundance is a  S. elaeagnifolium transcript (unigene21118) that presents 84 % homology to a tomato pathogenesis-related (PR) protein  iTAG v2.3: Solyc09g007010 . A similar PR protein is produced by another abundant transcript (cl9785) that is highly similar to a tomato gene  Solyc01g106620  annotated as  PR1a gene. Both transcripts are significantly higher expressed in  S. elaeagnifolium than their corresponding tomato and potato putative orthologs. The potato ortholog  PR1 gene  GenBank: AJ250136.1  was isolated from  P. infestans infected leaves and is induced significantly under pathogen and elicitor attack although it is expressed under normal conditions as well. The second  S. elaeagnifolium transcript, cl9785, is highly similar to tomato  PR1 precursor  NCBI: NP_001234358  that is not expressed at all in tomato flowers or leaves while the corresponding potato gene, a  PR1-like gene  Potato genomics resource: PGSC0003DMT400013094  has low expression in potato flowers and leaves. Cl9785 deduced protein sequence shares 83 % identity with pepper PR1 precursor protein that was found to be induced under bacteria infection and possibly linked with the stimulation of ethylene synthesis   26 . Functional characterization of unigenes Among the 36,504 unigenes with one at least GO-term given, 40.6 % were annotated in the biological process, 38.9 % in the cellular component and 20.4 % in the molecular function (for the detailed classification of the unigenes in the individual GO-terms of the three GO ontology domains see Additional file  2: Figure S2). Furthermore 19,911 unigenes were classified in 25 COG functional categories. For most of the unigenes only a general function prediction is possible (6,606 unigenes) while the next most abundant categories are transcription (3,333 unigenes), replication, recombination and repair (3,192 unigenes) and signal transduction mechanisms (2,905 unigenes) (for the detailed classification of  S. elaeagnifolium unigenes according to COG see Additional file  3: Figure S3). Based on basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) searches in the non-redundant (NR) database at NCBI (download 14 April 2014), the majority of  S. elaeagnifolium unigenes (39.8 %) shares similarity with grape sequences while less than 6 % of sequences shares similarity with other Solanaceae sequences (Fig.  1). Most unigenes (66.3 %) show significant similarity above 60 % with NR entries from which 25.4 % exceeds 80 % similarity. All unigenes were employed in Blastx searches against the NR, Swiss-Prot, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), gene ontology (GO) and clusters of orthologous groups (COG) databases with an e-value of 10 −5. The information obtained was used to extract coding DNA sequence (CDS) from unigenes and translate them into amino acid sequences. The CDS of unigenes that had no Blastx hit was predicted based on the ESTScan results and their translation into amino acid sequences; these unigenes were singificantly less than those whose prediction of CDS was based on BLAST results. The predicted CDS length (predicted from both BLAST results and ESTScan) was less than 500 nt with the majority of CDS being approximately 300 nt size. Functional characterization of  S. elaeagnifolium putative  TPS genes in yeast cells The yeast strain AM94   31  was used to transform cl9841 putative monoterpene synthase together with the ERG20 (F96W-N127W) variant which shifts production towards GPP substrate   32 . For the expression of cl1310, the gene was co-expressed in AM238 cells together with copalyl diphosphate synthase from  Salvia pomifera and a variant of yeast  ERG20 (F96C) producing GGPP. For the characterization of the putative sesquiterpene cl7653, the yeast strain AM109 was used   31 . The cl7653 carrying plasmid was transformed either alone or together with a stabilised variant of HMG2(K6R) to increase substrate availability   33 . As seen in Fig.  3a, cl9841 is an active monoterpene synthase enzyme producing a range of monoterpenes with the most prominent being camphene (52.55 %), β-myrcene (11.01 %) and limonene (10.44 %) and several minor additional compounds. The cl1310 expressing cells did not produce any compounds. The cl7653 enzyme was active and less promiscuous than cl9841, producing mainly caryophyllene (86.4 %) and lesser amounts of α-humulene (Fig.  3b). The caryophyllene peak was additionally validated with the mass spectrum of a standard compound. Wounding and  TPS expression Since GC/MS analysis conducted in wounded leaves showed the rise in the synthesis of the sesquiterpene ( E)-caryophyllene, the expression of cl7653 identified as caryophyllene synthase, was studied in real-time PCR experiments. Given that no monoterpene compounds were detected in the extractions of wounded leaves, the expression of cl9841 was not studied. What was studied was the expression of cl1310 - putative  KS, of unigene2314 - putative  DXS2 and of cl1634 - putative  HMGR1 along with the  allene oxide cyclase ( AOC) gene, a gene involved in the formation of jasmonic acid (JA) and quickly induced by wounding in tomato leaves   34,  35 . Primers were designed to amplify the specific contigs of each of the clusters cl7653 and cl1310 (as analyzed above) while for cluster cl1634 primers were designed to amplify a common region of all three alleles. As shown in Fig.  5, wounding of  S. elaeagnifolium leaves induced the expression of the  S. elaeagnifolium AOC homolog gene in all time points tested, providing evidence that plants undertake responses related to the wounding stress. The expression of sesquiterpene - caryophyllene synthase gene cl7653 was increased in all wounding time points compared to the control, the unwounded leaves (leaves from three independent controls-plants). The increase in the expression of cl7653 was quickly recorded at the time point 30 min after wounding. Yet the most pronounced increase in the expression of the caryophyllene synthase cl7653 was 2 h after wounding where the gene was expressed nearly 25 times significantly more than in the control. At the last time point, 4 h after wounding, the cl7653 expression was still significantly higher than the control but less than in the 1 and 2 h time points. On the other hand, the expression of unigene2314 - putative  DXS2 gene is induced later than that of cl7653. However in its peak of expression, also at the 2 h after wounding time point, unigene2314 was expressed 50 times more significantly than in the control. Interestingly its expression fell sharply reaching the same expression as in the control unwounded leaves at 4 h after wounding. The expression of putative  HMGR1 - cl1634 and  KS - cl1310 remained unchanged (data not shown). Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of wounded leaves GC/MS qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis was carried out for collected leaves, 4 hours (h) after their mechanical wounding. Unwounded leaves were also collected. The results are given in Tables  4 and  5. In particular, each leaf extract component is cited and accompanied by its retention time and a peak area percentage calculated by the GC/MS Solution software. Table  4 shows the common compounds detected both in unwounded and wounded leaves. Wounding can significantly affect the concentration of substances which are mainly aldehydes, ketones and alcohols. The substances induced in wounded leaves are included in Table  5. What is interesting to point out is that the majority of the compounds with peak area over 0.2 % are aldehydes previously associated with wounding responses. ( E)-caryophyllene is also induced by the wounding procedure as it was detected in the GC/MS chromatogram of the wounded leaves at 23.83 min. From Fig.  4, it is obvious that the characteristic peaks of ( Z)-jasmone and ( E)-caryophyllene occur only in the chromatogram of the wounded leaves. The presence of ( E)-caryophyllene and geranyl linalool in wounded leaves was also validated by comparing both the peak retention times and mass spectra between the unknown samples and standards. The mass spectra of the later as acquired from unknown samples are illustrated in figures in Additional file  5: Figure S4 and Additional files  6: Figure S5 respectiverly, with typical mass fragments at m/z 133, 93, 69 for ( E)-caryophyllene and 69, 81, 41 for geranyl linalool respectively. High-throughput sequencing and transcriptome assembly The sequencing output of  S. elaeagnifolium flowers and leaves mRNA is shown in Table  1. Clean reads were assembled into contigs using Trinity   19 . Then the reads were mapped back to contigs. An amount of 138,604 contigs were generated with a mean length of 385 nucleotides (nt) (N50 824 nt). Contigs were re-assembled into 75,618 unigenes with mean length of 1,082 nt (N50 1,778 nt). For a detailed graph of contigs and unigenes length see Additional file  1: Figure S1. A total of 33,893 clusters (prefix cl) were created from unigenes while 41,725 unigenes remained as singletons (prefix unigene). Identification of genes involved in terpene biosynthesis in  S. elaeagnifolium Three  TPS genes (cl7653, cl1310 and cl9841), the putative  HMGR1 gene (cl1634), and the  DXS2 gene (unigene2314) were selected for further analysis. The specific  TPS genes were selected for study because they are putatively involved in the production of all three major classes of terpenes, mono-, di- and sesqui- terpenes.  HMGR and  DXS code for critical enzymes of the two terpene biosynthesis pathways   30 . According to BLAST results,  HMGR1 has three alleles; three contigs that belong to the cluster cl1634. Cl1634 contigs 1, 2 and 4 have 92, 95 and 91 % similarity with tomato  HMGR1 and all have significant FPKM values in the pooled mRNA from leaves and flowers (Table  3). On the contrary, unigene2314 is the only  S. elaeagnifolium sequence that has high homology (92 %) with a tomato characterized  DXS gene (Table  3). Plants use a number of secondary metabolites to cope with their abiotic and biotic environment and terpenes lie in the first line of plant defence against the risks posed. Not only terpenes are responsible for the biosynthesis of necessary hormones that facilitate plant responses, but oxidative and thermal stresses are also alleviated by terpene production   28 . Furthermore, some monoterpenes have been implicated in allelopathic effects   29 . Because of the importance of plant terpenes in a plethora of biological processes related to stress responses and since  S. elaeagnifolium is a resiliant species that grows even on degraded soils, emphasis was laid on this group of secondary metabolites. The alignment of cl7653 predicted protein sequence with closely related tomato proteins TPS9-sesquiterpene synthase 1  NCBI: NP_001234481 , TPS10 and TPS12 (also known as caryophyllene/α-humulene synthase - CAHS)  GenBank: AEP82783  shows a high conservation of amino acids throughout their length (Fig.  2a). TPS9 and TPS12 are known and characterized sesquiterpene synthases. The deduced cl7653 protein contains the DDxxD and NSE/DTE motifs (both boxed in Fig.  2a) that characterize TPS proteins. The third  TPS gene identified, transcript cl9841 is a cluster of 9 sequences but only one is expressed in leaves and flowers; it contains a 1,824 nt putative CDS sequence that encodes a 607 amino acid full protein. The protein shares 78 % similarity with tomato TPS3 protein, a monoterpene camphene/tricyclene synthase  GenBank: AEM05853  and a putative camphene/tricyclene synthase from potato  NCBI: XP_006351730 . Employing BLAST suite of programs on  S. elaeagnifolium unigenes, genes of the MVA and MEP pathways likely to participate in the biosynthesis of terpene precursors, as long as  TPS genes were identified. The complete list of the putative genes involved in the MVA and MEP pathways is included in Table  3. Genes for key enzymes, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR)  EC: 1.1.1.34  and DXS  EC: 2.2.1.7  have (as in tomato) multiple paralogues that are all expressed significantly in leaves and flowers. Putative  S. elaeagnifolium acetoacetyl CoA thiolase ( AACT)  Solyc07g045350 ,  HMGR1  Solyc02g082260  and  2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyl-transferase ( MCT)  Solyc01g102820  genes are present in the transcriptome as multiple alleles. Also genes involved in prenyl diphosphate synthesis, such as  farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase ( FPPS) and  geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase ( GGPPS), also have many paralogues. Finally, several putative  cis-prenyltransferase genes ( CPT) believed to be involved in the biosynthesis of long-chain polyisoprenoids were also identified in  S. elaeagnifolium. Two of them (cl6054.contig2 and cl6054.contig4) have homology to CPT5. For the complete list of the putative  S. elaeagnifolium TPS genes identified in leaves and flowers, see table in Additional file  4: Table S1. The second putative  TPS gene in study, cl1310, is a cluster of 25 sequences. However according to RSEM analysis only two of them are expressed above a FPKM threshold of 3. The two sequences differ only in a 131 nt insertion, indicating that one could correspond to an incompletely spliced transcript. The sequence of 2,801 nt that contains no intron sequence and has the highest expression in flowers and leaves, was analyzed and annotated hereafter as cl1310. Cl1310 possess a predicted CDS of 2,414 nt that codes for a 897 amino acids protein. The predicted protein shares 89 % similarity with the predicted  ent-kaurene synthase (KS) protein from potato  NCBI: XP_006346019 , 86 % similarity with tomato TPS24-KS protein  GenBank: AEP82778   EC: 4.2.3.19  and 83 % similarity with  N. attenuata KS protein  GenBank: AFA35954 . The alignment of tomato TPS24-KS protein with the predicted cl1310 amino acid sequence showed that the  S. elaeagnifolium protein also contains the aspartate-rich DDxxD and NSE/DTE motifs both identical to tomato TPS24-KS corresponding motifs (Fig.  2b). For the putative  TPS genes, transcript cl7653 is a cluster of eight sequences. Analysis of the sequences included in cl7653 indicates alternative splicing events taking place during the transcription of the corresponding gene. The different transcripts differ in three regions: in the first, four sequences have a 122 nt insertion, in the second, four sequences have a 94 nt insertion and in the last, four sequences have a 88 nt insertion. None of the inserted sequences has an open reading frame (ORF) indicative of functional proteins. Only one transcript/sequence of 2,143 nt contains a 1,653 nt putative CDS sequence that codes for a full 550 amino acid protein. The sequence, named hereafter cl7653, is the one with the highest FPKM value in flowers and leaves (see table in Additional file  4: Table S1) while the other seven transcripts/sequences have lowest FPKM values."," Background Solanum elaeagnifolium, an invasive weed of the Solanaceae family, is poorly studied although it poses a significant threat to crops. Here the analysis of the transcriptome of S. elaeagnifolium is presented, as a means to explore the biology of this species and to identify genes related to its adaptation to environmental stress. One of the basic mechanisms by which plants respond to environmental stress is through the synthesis of specific secondary metabolites that protect the plant from herbivores and microorganisms, or serve as signaling molecules. One important such group of secondary metabolites are terpenes. Results By next-generation sequencing, the flower/leaf transcriptome of S. elaeagnifolium was sequenced and de novo assembled into 75,618 unigenes. Among the unigenes identified, several corresponded to genes involved in terpene biosynthesis; these included terpene synthases (TPSs) and genes of the mevalonate (MVA) and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. Functional characterization of two of the TPSs showed that one produced the sesquiterpene (E)-caryophyllene and the second produced the monoterpene camphene. Analysis of wounded S. elaeagnifolium leaves has shown significant increase of the concentration of (E)-caryophyllene and geranyl linalool, two terpenes implicated in stress responses. The increased production of (E)-caryophyllene was matched to the induced expression of the corresponding TPS gene. Wounding also led to the increased expression of the putative 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 2 (DXS2) gene, a key enzyme of the MEP pathway, corroborating the overall increased output of terpene biosynthesis. Conclusions The reported S. elaeagnifolium de novo transcriptome provides a valuable sequence database that could facilitate study of this invasive weed and contribute to our understanding of the highly diverse Solanaceae family. Analysis of genes and pathways involved in the plant's interaction with the environment will help to elucidate the mechanisms that underly the intricate features of this unique Solanum species.",NaN," 'leaves', 'elaeagnifolium', 'gene', 'TPS genes', 'unigenes', 'Expression', 'genes', 'putative', 'protein', 'elaeagnifolium unigenes' "," cl9787_2, cl9787_1, cl9787_2, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, Rubisco, Rubisco activase, lipid-transfer, photosystem I, II, SAMDC, metallothioneins, MTs, MTs, MT, MT, plastidic aldolase, d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, GAP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, plastidic aldolases, unigene21118, Solyc09g007010, PR, AJ250136.1, cl9785, NP_001234358, PGSC0003DMT400013094, 36,504, Swiss-Prot, cl9841, ERG20, cl1310, copalyl diphosphate synthase, GGPP, HMG2(K6R, cl9841, cl1310, cl9841, cl9841, cl1310, unigene2314, cl1634, oxide cyclase, cl1310 (, cl1634, controls-plants, unigene2314, unigene2314, 75,618, 33,893, cl9841, unigene2314, cl1634, Cl1634 contigs 1, unigene2314, NP_001234481, TPS10, caryophyllene/α-humulene synthase - CAHS, AEP82783, cl9841, tomato TPS3, AEM05853, XP_006351730, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, AACT, Solyc07g045350, Solyc02g082260, MCT), prenyl diphosphate, pyrophosphate synthase, FPPS, pyrophosphate synthase, GGPPS, cl6054.contig2, cl6054.contig4, CPT5, cl1310, XP_006346019, tomato TPS24-KS protein  GenBank, AEP82778, 4.2.3.19, AFA35954, transcript/sequence, transcripts/sequences "," 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS9-sesquiterpene', 'TPS10', 'TPS12', 'TPS9', 'TPS12', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS3', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS24-KS', 'TPS24-KS', 'TPS24-KS', 'TPS' "," 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.'

71,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC4237146/eupmc_result.json,PMC4237146,"Results Priming of neighbouring plants after herbivore infestation In addition to the CPB-larvae-infested leaves, gene expression changes that might be associated to elicitation by VOCs were analysed at the same time points in the leaves of neighbouring noninfested plants. The neighbouring plants (the VOC receivers) had the same disease status (healthy, PVY NTN infected, with cv. ‘Igor’) and were of the same genotype (nontransgenic,  coi1, with cv. ‘Désirée’). Compared to the responses in the CPB-larvae-infested plants, the transcriptional changes in neighbouring plants were in general much more subtle and occurred for fewer genes. The photosynthesis-related genes  RA and  CAB4 were upregulated at 3 hpi only in the PVY NTN-infected leaves. Additionally, the SA-regulated genes  PR1b and  Glu II were significantly upregulated in healthy plants, and downregulated in PVY NTN-infected plants (Fig. 2B). Interestingly,  13-LOX and  COI1 were upregulated at 3 hpi in the  coi1 plants only (Fig. 3B). In addition, in the neighbouring  coi1 plants, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was significantly affected after infestation, whereby  PAL and  HCT were upregulated, and  C4H was downregulated (Figs 2B and  3B). PVY NTN infection attenuates herbivore-induced defences in potato leaves After 24 h of infestation, the gene expression changes in the CPB-larvae-infested plants were much more pronounced. In both the healthy and the PVY NTN-infected plants, the JA-pathway-related genes ( WIPK, 13-LOX, AOS2, COI1) were strongly and significantly upregulated, and the SA-pathway-related genes ( NPR1, TGA2) were moderately, but significantly, upregulated, when compared to their respective noninfested control plants (Fig. 2A). The  MYC2 transcription factor was upregulated to approximately twofold upon CPB larvae infestation in both healthy and PVY NTN-infected plants, although this upregulation was statistically significant ( P < 0.05) only for the healthy plants (Fig. 2A). Some genes were upregulated only in the healthy plants, namely  CTR1, ERF1, JAR1 and  RdR1, and some genes were upregulated only in the PVY NTN-infected plants, namely  RA and  CAB4 (Fig. 2A). For many of the assayed genes, the responses in the healthy and PVY NTN-infected plants were quantitatively different. These genes were either more strongly upregulated in the healthy plants ( PR1b, Glu II, PCPI, ARP; Fig. 2A) or in the PVY NTN-infected plants ( PAL, HCT, CW_INV; Fig. 2A). To examine how the PVY NTN infection affects the plant defences when exposed to herbivory, gene expression changes in the pathways associated to biotic stress were examined in potato leaves using qPCR. The genes examined were those involved in JA-Ile biosynthesis ( 13-LOX, AOS2, JAR1) and in the JA, SA and ET signalling pathways ( WIPK, NPR1, TGA2, COI1, MYC2, ETR1, ETR4, CTR1, ERF1), and also genes downstream of these pathways ( PR1b, Glu I, Glu II, PCPI). Additionally, this included an examination of genes related to auxin signalling ( ARF2, ARP), phenylpropanoid biosynthesis ( PAL, C4H, HCT), photosynthesis ( RA, CAB4), sugar metabolism ( CW_INV) and gene silencing ( RdR1). Gene expression was examined in the healthy plants and in the corresponding PVY NTN-infected plants, at 3 and 24 hpi (Table S4A, Supporting information). We also performed RNAseq to provide an overview of the transcriptome changes in the CPB-larvae-infested plants after 24 h of infestation, and this showed missing links in our understanding of the defence signalling in multi-attacker systems. The RNAseq differential expression (|logFC| > 1) correlated highly with the qPCR ( r = 0.93). Analysis at the biological process level (Table 1) showed that upregulation of photosynthesis, metabolism of phenylpropanoids and cell wall components was specific for potato plants infected with PVY NTN and exposed to the CPB larvae. In addition, PVY NTN infection showed specific upregulation of gibberellin signalling components and downregulation of auxin response transcription factors. Proteinase inhibitors were upregulated in all of the plants infested with the CPB larvae except in  coi1 plants; the induction was albeit attenuated in PVY NTN-infected plants compared to the induction in healthy plants (up to 32-fold lower induction). More detailed evaluation of the RNAseq data revealed that besides the proteinase inhibitors, other antinutritional proteins, such as α-amylase inhibitors, arginase and polyphenol oxidases, were suppressed in the PVY NTN-infected plants when compared to the induction in CPB-larvae-infested healthy plants, although to a much lower extent than in the  coi1 plants (Table S5, Supporting information). In addition, the expression of several key genes involved in ET biosynthesis and signalling ( ACS, ACO, EBF1/2, individual  ERFs) was attenuated in the PVY NTN-infected plants, which was not the case in COI1-silenced plants, while expression of main SA biosynthesis gene  ICS1 and JA methyltransferase ( JMT) was enhanced (Table S5, Supporting information). However, as both treatments were performed in different genetic backgrounds, comparison between the treatments has to be treated with caution (see Supporting Information Supplementary results for details). Three hours after CPB larvae infestation, not many significant differences in gene expression were observed in the PVY NTN infected when compared to their respective noninfested control plants. In the healthy plants, only  CW_INV was significantly upregulated, whereas  JAR1, ARF2, CTR1 and  ERF1 were significantly downregulated (Fig. 2A). In the PVY NTN-infected plants, there was significant downregulation of the SA-regulated and JA-regulated genes  PR1b, Glu II and  PCPI, and a trend towards downregulation of the photosynthesis activity marker  RA (Fig. 2A). Jasmonic acid signalling is known to be a major contributor to defence against herbivores, and thus we hypothesized that the responses observed in the potato–PVY NTN–CPB larvae interaction were the final outcome of attenuation of this pathway. To test this hypothesis, the transcriptional response to CPB larvae infestation was investigated using the same qPCR assays in the control nontransgenic and  coi1 cv. ‘Désirée’ plants. In the  coi1 plants,  COI1 expression was ∼35% of that in the control nontransgenic plants (Table S4B, Supporting information). Gene expression differences in cv. ‘Désirée’ were again relatively low at 3 hpi, while more pronounced changes were detected at 24 hpi. JA biosynthesis and signalling was induced at 24 hpi in the nontransgenic plants, and to a lesser extent also in the  coi1 plants (Fig. 3A). In the  coi1 plants, however, this did not result in induced expression of genes regulated by the JA signalling cascade, such as  PCPI and  HCT, as was seen in the nontransgenic plants. Contrary to the upregulation in the PVY NTN-infected plants, the photosynthesis genes were downregulated in these  coi1 plants. Similarly, the cell wall invertase gene ( CW_INV) that was induced in the PVY NTN-infected plants was induced to a lesser extent in the  coi1 plants than in the nontransgenic plants (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, suppression of CTR1 kinase involved in ET signalling and auxin-repressed protein ( ARP) expression was observed in the  coi1 and the PVY NTN-infected plants (Figs 2A and  3A). PVY NTN infection moderately alters the transcriptional response in the larval gut The feeding assay data suggested that PVY NTN infection attenuates the plant defence that is induced upon CPB larvae infestation. We showed that the majority of the proteinase inhibitor genes were induced to a lesser extent in the PVY NTN-infected plants (Fig. 2A, Table S5, Supporting information). To determine whether these differences were reflected in the transcriptional response in the CPB larval gut, we sampled the midgut from the last instar larvae in the feeding assays and examined the differences in the expression of the intestain family genes, and of other genes previously associated with larval response ( Gruden   et al. 2004 ;  Petek   et al. 2012 ). As expected, all of the assayed genes were significantly differentially expressed in the larval response to plant defences (Fig. 4A). Rearing larvae on PVY NTN-infected plants did not result in major changes in the expression of these genes (Fig. 4B). Slightly weaker response was detected for the genes  Ld_GH45-6 and  Ld_GH48-2 (Fig. 4B), which encode cellulases from the families of glycoside hydrolase 45 (GH45) and glycoside hydrolase 48 (GH48), respectively. The differences in larval response were more pronounced for the larvae reared on the  coi1 plants. The  intestain D, serine protease, cellulase, pectinase and  JHBP-like genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in the larvae reared on the nontransgenic plants than in the larvae reared on the  coi1 plants, whereas the  intestain C genes were regulated in the opposite direction (Fig. 4C). Rearing beetle larvae on PVY NTN-infected potato positively affects their growth The PVY NTN-infected potato plants of cv. ‘Igor’ showed systemic symptoms, including leaf mosaics, curling, senescence and stunted growth, which indicated the severe disease status of these plants. Independent feeding assays were performed to examine the effects of the PVY NTN infection of these potato plants on the growth of the CPB larvae, and to compare this to the effects of the disruption of JA signalling in the  coi1 plants of cv. ‘Désirée’. From the eighth day onwards, the larvae reared on the PVY NTN-infected plants gained significantly more weight than those reared on the healthy plants, and reached an ∼20% greater mean larval weight by 9 dpi (Fig. 1). This increase in weight of the CPB larvae feeding on the PVY NTN-infected plants suggests that PVY NTN attenuates the plant defence responses against these herbivores. The CPB larvae reared on the  coi1 plants gained ∼60% more weight by 9 dpi than those reared on the nontransgenic plants (Fig. 1). Because of the different genetic backgrounds used in our viral infection and  COI1 silencing treatments, we cannot compare the impacts of these treatments directly. With this caveat in mind, our data suggest that the PVY NTN infection may have less impact on larva weight gain improvement than the  COI1 silencing. At the same time, the control CPB larvae reared on the detached leaves, and thus with plant defences induced to minor extent ( Gruden   et al. 1998 ), gained about 35% more weight than those reared on either the PVY NTN-infected or the  coi1 plants (Fig. 1). Herbivore-induced volatile emissions in potato are to a large extent COI1 dependent In the combination of PVY NTN infection with CPB larval feeding, VOC release related to the CPB larvae dominated over that associated with the PVY NTN infection. Interestingly, β-barbatene release was induced by the CPB larval feeding and was completely abolished in the PVY NTN-infected plants, while the induction of benzyl alcohol was enhanced (Table 2). The dominance of the herbivory for the release of terpenoids was also evident from the RNAseq data, which showed that JA-pathway-responsive terpene synthase genes were induced in healthy and in PVY NTN-infected plants upon CPB larval attack (Table S5, Supporting information). After observing virus-induced and CPB-larval-induced transcriptional changes in potato defence signalling, we investigated whether VOC release was also affected in these interactions. We measured the release of 68 compounds from the potato plants of cv. ‘Igor’ and 59 compounds from the potato plants of cv. ‘Désirée’ (Table S7, Supporting information). Upon CPB larvae infestation, we detected significantly enhanced release of several VOCs that belong to different chemical groups; for example, the aliphatic undecane, several sesquiterpenoids, and the monoterpenoid shyobunol in the healthy and PVY NTN-infected potato plants of cv. ‘Igor’ (Table 2). Moreover, there was a trend to an increase in methyl salicylate (MeSA) release detected after the CPB larvae infestation (Table 2). Intriguingly, the PVY NTN infection itself significantly suppressed only the release of the sesquiterpenoid β-barbatene and induced the release of benzyl alcohol. Nevertheless, there was a clear reducing trend in the terpenoid release levels in these PVY NTN-infected plants after CPB larvae infestation (Table 2). The nontransgenic and  coi1-plants of cv. ‘Désirée’ were also analysed. Several sesquiterpenoid volatiles  ( E)-β-caryophyllene, ( E)-β-farnesene, germacrene D-4-ol  were released in significantly smaller amounts from the infested  coi1 plants than from the infested nontransgenic plants (Table 3). Supporting these data, 13 of 18 terpene synthase genes induced by infestation in the nontransgenic plants (logFC > 1) had markedly reduced expression, or were expressed below the limit of quantification in  coi1 plants (Table S5, Supporting information). A similar decrease in release was observed for MeSA, and for an unknown phenyl ester, decanal and compounds tentatively identified as dodecane, heptadecane and nonanal (Table 3).","In the field, plants are challenged by more than one biotic stressor at the same time. In this study, the molecular interactions between potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say; CPB) and Potato virus Y(NTN) (PVY(NTN) ) were investigated through analyses of gene expression in the potato leaves and the gut of the CPB larvae, and of the release of potato volatile compounds. CPB larval growth was enhanced when reared on secondary PVY(NTN) -infected plants, which was linked to decreased accumulation of transcripts associated with the antinutritional properties of potato. In PVY(NTN) -infected plants, ethylene signalling pathway induction and induction of auxin response transcription factors were attenuated, while no differences were observed in jasmonic acid (JA) signalling pathway. Similarly to rearing on virus-infected plants, CPB larvae gained more weight when reared on plants silenced in JA receptor gene (coi1). Although herbivore-induced defence mechanism is regulated predominantly by JA, response in coi1-silenced plants only partially corresponded to the one observed in PVY(NTN) -infected plants, confirming the role of other plant hormones in modulating this response. The release of β-barbatene and benzyl alcohol was different in healthy and PVY(NTN) -infected plants before CPB larvae infestation, implicating the importance of PVY(NTN) infection in plant communication with its environment. This was reflected in gene expression profiles of neighbouring plants showing different degree of defence response. This study thus contributes to our understanding of plant responses in agro-ecosystems."," 'Plant defence', 'Leptinotarsa decemlineata', 'volatile organic compounds', 'Gene Expression', 'Insect Midgut Transcriptional Response', 'Solanum Tuberosum (Potato)' "," 'PVY NTN-infected', 'PVY NTN', 'PVY', 'plants', 'NTN-infected plants', 'CPB larvae', 'Fig.', 'healthy plants', 'CPB', 'NTN infection' "," ‘, ’, ‘Désirée’, WIPK, AOS2, COI1, SA-pathway-related, NPR1, TGA2, PVY NTN-infected, CTR1, ERF1, JAR1, PVY NTN-infected, PR1b, Glu II, PCPI, PVY NTN-infected, CW_INV, AOS2, JAR1, SA, ET, WIPK, NPR1, TGA2, COI1, MYC2, ETR1, ETR4, CTR1, ERF1, PR1b, Glu I, Glu II, PCPI, auxin signalling, ARF2, C4H, CAB4, CW_INV, PVY NTN-infected, RNAseq, RNAseq, gibberellin signalling components, auxin, Proteinase, RNAseq, α-amylase, arginase, EBF1/2, COI1-silenced, JA methyltransferase, ARF2, CTR1, PVY NTN-infected, JA-regulated genes, Glu II, CW_INV, CTR1, PVY NTN-infected, proteinase inhibitor, PVY NTN-infected, Ld_GH45-6, Ld_GH48-2, glycoside hydrolase, GH45, glycoside hydrolase, GH48, cellulase, pectinase, PVY NTN-infected, ‘, ’, JA, ∼20, ∼60, COI1, RNAseq, CPB-larval-induced, ‘, ’, ‘Désirée’, shyobunol, PVY NTN-infected potato, ‘, ’ (Table 2, ’, MeSA ",  ,  ,  ,terpene synthase
72,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC5700745/eupmc_result.json,PMC5700745,"Results Analysis of DEGs in each organ Taking uniquely expressed genes as those with an expression value of zero in two organs while having expression value more than zero in the third organ, 474, 825 and 404 unique genes were found for flower, leaf and scale, respectively. Of these, approximately 70% have been annotated (Additional file  4: Table S4, Additional file  5: Table S5 and Additional file  6: Table S6) and there are twice the number of unique genes in leaf compared to flower and scale (Table  2).  Both RPKM value and false discovery rate were used for DEGs screening and original values of all transcripts are shown in Additional file  2: Table S2. Of the millions of gene sequences expressed in each biological sample, some transcripts were present in all three organs, with different expression levels but only a few thousand were significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) unique to a specific organ with undetectable expression in the other organs. We obtained 2685 DEGs in the comparison of leaf-vs-flower (L-vs-F), 2296 in leaf-vs-scale (L-vs-S), and 1709 in flower-vs-scale (F-vs-S), with a false discovery rate value <0.001   18 . From the F-vs-S comparison, there were more up-regulated genes (938) than down-regulated genes (771) in scales, taking flower as a reference organ, while with leaf as a reference organ, more genes were down-regulated in flower (1766) and scale (1534) (Fig.  1), indicating a greater number of transcripts of DEGs (65.77–66.81%) differentially expressed in leaf compared with flower and scale. There were 73 DEGs expressed in three comparisons (Additional file  3: Table S3). Thirty-six percent of these genes common had putative functions in photosynthesis and the others participated in basic processes, such as metabolism of carbohydrates, nitrogen and proteins. Two genes, CL1446.Contig13_All and Unigene6258_All, related to pathogene and defensin, were found in the three organs (Additional file  3: Table S3).  Cloning of TPS genes from cDNA Terpene synthases (TPS) are that key enzymes that catalyze the last step of the MEP pathway to produce terpenes. There are numerous terpenes and TPSs in plants and small changes in amino acid sequence generate the unique properties and diversity of these important compounds. Primers were designed based on the sequence of transcript CL4520.Contig5_All (accession number: SUB2623518), which had sequence homology with  TPS genes, and attempts were made to clone the complete cDNA sequence from petal. However, these attempts failed with three different pairs of primers. When the sequence was checked against the NCBI database it was found to be a mixed clone, part of which was highly homologous (91.17% at the cDNA level) to the complete coding sequences of  LhTPS from ‘Siberia’ (accession number: KF734591), together with a second unrelated open reading frame. Based on the  Lilium oriental ‘Sorbonne’ sequence information, new primers were designed and a putative  TPS sequence (NCBI accession: MF401556, designated  LsTPS) was acquired with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1761 nucleotides, which has 99.55% sequence homology with the TPS coding sequence of transcript CL4520.Contig5_All. Phylogenetic analysis (Additional file  12: Figure S1) based on deduced amino acid sequences showed that  LsTPS were highly homologous with CL4520.Contig5_All, and with the other two amino acid sequences from  Lilium ‘Belladonna’ and ‘Siberia’. It was clustered with  LcTPS1, which is a member of Tps-b group and was able to convert Geranyl diphosphate into  trans-ocimene   22 . KEGG pathway analysis of significantly DEGs KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Chromosomes) pathway enrichment analysis was used to identify DEGs significantly associated with specific metabolic pathways. A total of 1461 DEGs from the L-vs-F comparison were assigned to 117 KEGG pathways; for F-vs-S comparison, 885 DEGs had 109 pathway annotations; and in the L-vs-S comparison 1194 DEGs were related to 105 pathways. There were more DEGs with pathway annotations for L-vs-F than for the F-vs-S and L-vs-S comparisons. Genes for 95 pathways were expressed in all three organs and included housekeeping activities. More than 40% of the DEGs participated in metabolic pathways, and around 20% in the three comparisons were related to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. In addition, more than 10% of DEGs in three pairwise organ comparisons were involved in pathways of glycerophospholipid metabolism, endocytosis and ether lipid metabolism. Figure  3 lists 46 KEGG pathways where there were more than 10 DGEs between the three pairwise comparisons. There were no DEGs in 11 KEGG pathways in the F-vs-S comparison, and these were mainly pathways involved in photosynthesis and carbohydrate and protein metabolism. For L-vs-S comparison four KEGG pathways showed no DEGs, including nitrogen metabolism, alanine/glutamate metabolism, diterpenoid biosynthesis and galactose metabolism.  Gene ontology analysis of significantly DEGs Approximately 17% of differentially expressed genes were unannotated in the database (296 in F-vs-S, 466 in L-vs-F and 393 in L-vs-S), suggesting that at least some might be new unknown transcripts, and further work will be necessary to investigate their roles. The majority (83%) of the DEGs had annotations indicating a likely function, and the numbers and functions of genes in the three pairwise comparisons were similar (Fig.  2), with 24 functional groups classified under biology process, 9 under cellular components and 12 functional groups in molecular functions. In the biological process category, most genes were characterized as having functions in categories “cellular process” (GO: 0009987), “response to stimulus” (GO: 0050896) or “regulation of biological process” (GO: 0050789), and in the cellular component subgroup, most genes were classified as related to “cell” (GO: 0005623), “organelle” (GO: 0043226) and “membrane” (GO: 0016020). Most genes in the molecular function category encoded proteins with “catalytic activity” (GO: 0003824), “binding” (GO: 0005488) and “transporter activity” (GO: 0005215) (Fig.  2).  Construction of regulatory network of monoterpene biosynthesis To provide a system view of the regulatory network responsible for controlling monoterpene analysis, networks were extracted based on correlation analysis between 839 putative TFs and seven putative DEGs related to flower fragrance. As a result, 31 putative TFs were identified as potentially involved in regulating the seven putative genes related to production of flower volatiles (Fig.  6a and Additional file  11: Table S11) ( P < 0.01). These TFs were classified into 13 putative TF families, with the three largest TF families being the bHLH (5 Unigenes), bZIP (5 unigenes) and MYB related (4 unigenes) families (Additional file  11: Table S11). The expression profiles of these TFs potentially related to flower volatile biosynthesis were hierarchically clustered and plotted in a heatmap (Fig.  6b). Three of these (Unigene15576_All, Unigene21249_All, Unigene1921_All) with extremely high expression levels in flowers (RPKM values of 1574.3, 1514.6 and 133.1, respectively) were excluded from the heatmap, but relevant data are shown in Additional file  11: Table S11. Most of those TFs were more highly expressed in flower than in leaf and scale. The expression patterns of all 31 TFs were positively correlated with those of flower scent genes (Additional file  11: Table S11).  Mining of candidate genes related to flower color, fragrance, photosynthesis and bulb development Sixty-three DEGs involved in photosynthesis were identified as being up-regulated, in the transcriptome of mature leaves, related to photosystem, photosystem II, the cytochrome b6/f complex, photosystem electron transport and F-type ATPase (Additional file  9: Table S9). By GO and KEGG annotation, 20 up-regulated flower color genes were found with putative functions in flavonoid biosynthesis, including sequences homologous to  DFR (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase), CHS (chalcone synthase), CHI (chalcone isomerase), FLS (Flavonol synthase), F3H (flavanone 3-hidroxylase), LAR (leucoanthocyanidin reductase), HCT (shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase), LDOX (leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase), TT7 (flavonoid 3′-monooxygenase) (Additional file  7: Table S7) and some of those genes, such as  DFR and  CHS, showed more than 10 fold higher expression level in flower compared to leaf and scale. Monoterpenoids are the dominant classes of volatile compounds emitted from scented lilies   19– 21  and genes encoding TPSs (terpene synthases) (Additional file  8: Table S8) involved in monoterpenoids biosynthesis were identified in both L-vs-F and F-vs-S comparisons. From comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequence with those of known genes from  Freesia hybrid and  Litsea cubeba, these were predicted to encode linalool and ocimene synthases, respectively. These  TPSs were significantly up-regulated in flowers as were some other genes encoding enzymes participating in the 2-C-methyl-D-erythirtol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, which leads to the synthesis of monoterpenes, including  DXS (1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate), GGPP (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate) and  HDS (4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate) (Additional file  5: Table S5). We also investigated  HPL (hydroperoxide lyase) and  KAT (3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase) (Additional file  8: Table S8), which participate in the oxylipin metabolism and β-oxidation pathways, as these genes were highlighted in a recent lily floral fragrance study as being differentially expressed in lily cultivars   20 . Both  HPL and  KAT which were up-regulated in flower compared with scale and leaf. Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, especially starch and sucrose, were of particular interest in this study because of their importance for bulb function. Twenty-one DEGs, 11 in L-vs-S and 11 in F-vs-S comparisons (with one in common for both L-vs-S and F-vs-S), were predicted to participate in metabolism of starch and sucrose (Additional file  10: Table S10). Key genes homologous to  SS (sucrose synthase), INV (invertase), SPS (Sucrose phosphate synthase), SSS (starch synthase), SBE (starch branching enzyme), AGP (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) and  BAM (amylase) were identified. Most genes, putatively related to sucrose and starch hydrolysis, were down-regulated in scale relative to flower as reference. Different genes putatively related to sucrose or starch synthesis and hydrolysis were either up-regulated or down-regulated in scales with leaf as reference (Additional file  10: Table S10), presumably related to complicated metabolic differences in bulb at this developmental stage. qRT-PCR verification of DEGs identified by RNAseq The expression profile of six flower fragrance-related DEGs from lily identified by the RNA-seq approach were tested, using quantitative RT-PCR, including key genes involved in synthesis of monoterpenoids biosynthesis:  TPS, DXS, GGPP, HDS, and fatty acid derivatives and phenylpropanoid/benzenoid biosynthesis: HPL and  KAT. The comparisons of expression measured by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR in the three organs were largely in agreement (Fig.  7). The expressions of these genes was highest in flowers, although some, such as  HPL also had high expression in leaves.  Summary of gene expression profiling Three replicates for each organ were used for cDNA library construction. For one leaf sample 74.78% of the reads matched Tulip virus X (Additional file  1: Table S1) and the data for this sample were discarded. Overall, we obtained over 11 Gb data for lily flower, leaf and scale organs. From these reads, between 73.49 and 83.12% from each sample could be mapped to the reference transcriptome. There were approximately 6 Mb perfect reads for each organ, accounting for more than 67.05% of those that were mapped to the reference transcriptome (Table  1), excluding reads with more than 2 bp mismatches. Approximately 77.71% of these sequences matched to the reference transcriptome were unique matched reads, with some multi-position reads. These data, which lay a valuable cornerstone for future work, have been submitted to the NCBI SRA database (accession number: SRP084220).  Expression patterns of genes involved in monoterpene biosynthesis Flower scent production is of immense importance in plant biology and ecology. It plays a role in reproduction by promoting pollination through interactions with insects and other organisms, and it also contributes value to many commercially important horticultural flowers, such as  Lilium cv. Sorbonne. Many scents are produce from the terpenoid pathway, as are many other biology important molecules. Therefore, we investigated genes encoding enzymes involved in monoterpene biosynthesis. In this study, five DEGs encoding four putative enzymes related to monoterpene biosynthesis were identified from the transcriptome (Additional file  8: Table S8). Genes  DXS (Unigene8314_All),  HDS (CL4079.Contig1_All),  GGPP (CL1306.Contig1_All) and  TPS1 (Unigene1934_All) showed significantly higher expression in flower than in leaf and scale (Fig.  4), whereas  TPS2 showed extremely low expression in three organs.  Transcription factor analysis Transcriptome unigenes of L.-Unigene-All were searched against the Plant Transcription Factor Database and 839 unigenes identified as transcription factors (TFs) sequences belonging to 53 putative transcription factor families, with the three largest groups being bHLH (75), MYB related (60) and C3H (55). These putative transcription factor unigenes were subjected to three pairwise comparisons which identified 54, 48 and 50 TFs differentially expressed in the F-vs-S, L-vs-F and L-vs-S comparisons (Fig.  5). The bHLH transcription factors were the largest group for F-vs-S and L-vs-F comparison and ERFs were the largest group for the L-vs-S comparison (Fig.  5). These results provide a rich resource for future analysis of the role of transcription factors in lily organogenesis. "," Background Lily is an economically important plant, with leaves and bulbs consisting of overlapping scales, large ornamental flowers and a very large genome. Although it is recognized that flowers and bulb scales are modified leaves, very little is known about the genetic control and biochemical differentiation underlying lily organogenesis and development. Here we examined the differentially expressed genes in flower, leaf and scale of lily, using RNA-sequencing, and identified organ-specific genes, including transcription factors, genes involved in photosynthesis in leaves, carbohydrate metabolism in bulb scales and scent and color production in flowers. Results Over 11Gb data were obtained and 2685, 2296, and 1709 differentially expressed genes were identified in the three organs, with 581, 662 and 977 unique DEGs in F-vs-S, L-vs-S and L-vs-F comparisons. By functional enrichment analysis, genes likely to be involved in biosynthetic pathways leading to floral scent production, such as 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT), hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate (HDS) and terpene synthase (TPS), and floral color genes, such as dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavonol synthase (FLS) were identified. Distinct groups of genes that participate in starch and sucrose metabolism, such as sucrose synthase (SS), invertase (INV), sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), starch synthase (SSS), starch branching enzyme (SBE), ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) andβ-amylase (BAM) and photosynthesis genes (Psa, Psb, Pet and ATP) were also identified. The expression of six floral fragrance-related DGEs showed agreement between qRT-PCR results and RPKM values, confirming the value of the data obtained by RNA-seq. We obtained the open reading frame of the terpene synthase gene from Lilium 'Sorbonne', designated LsTPS, which had 99.55% homology to transcript CL4520.Contig5_All. In addition, 54, 48 and 50 differently expressed transcription factor were identified by pairwise comparisons between the three organs and a regulatory network for monoterpene biosynthesis was constructed. Conclusions Analysis of differentially expressed genes in flower, leaf and bulb scale of lily, using second generation sequencing technology, yielded detailed information on lily metabolic differentiation in three organs. Analysis of the expression of flower scent biosynthesis genes has provided a model for the regulation of the pathway and identified a candidate gene encoding an enzyme catalyzing the final step in scent production. These digital gene expression profiles provide a valuable and informative database for the further identification and analysis of structural genes and transcription factors in different lily organs and elucidation of their function."," 'Lilium', 'Transcriptome', 'organogenesis', 'Gene Expression', 'Rna-seq' "," 'Additional file', 'Table', 'Additional', 'genes', 'file', 'DEGs', 'flower', 'Fig.', 'related', 'expression' "," S5, Additional , RPKM, leaf-vs-flower, L-vs-F, L-vs-S, F-vs-S, F-vs-S, 65.77–66.81, CL1446.Contig13_All, Unigene6258_All, TPSs, CL4520.Contig5_All (accession number, ‘, ’, KF734591, ‘, ’, MF401556, CL4520.Contig5_All, ‘Siberia, ’, Tps-b, L-vs-F, F-vs-S, L-vs-S, L-vs-F, F-vs-S, L-vs-S, F-vs-S, L-vs-S, F-vs-S, L-vs-F, L-vs-S, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “cell”, “organelle”, “membrane”, “, ”, “binding, ”, “transporter, ”, bZIP (5 unigenes, MYB, Unigene15576_All, Unigene21249_All, Unigene1921_All, 1514.6, photosystem, photosystem II, cytochrome b6/f, photosystem electron, F-type ATPase, CHS, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, FLS, F3H, LAR (, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, TT7, flavonoid 3′-monooxygenase, L-vs-F, F-vs-S, GGPP, S5, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, L-vs-S, F-vs-S, L-vs-S, F-vs-S, sucrose synthase, INV (invertase, SPS, starch synthase, SBE, AGP, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, amylase, RNAseq, GGPP, RNA-seq, Unigene8314_All, CL1306.Contig1_All, Unigene1934_All, L.-Unigene-All, MYB, F-vs-S, L-vs-F, L-vs-S, F-vs-S, L-vs-F, L-vs-S "," 'TPS', '(TPS)', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'LhTPS', 'TPS', 'LsTPS)', 'TPS', 'LsTPS', 'LcTPS1,', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS,', 'TPS1', 'TPS2' ",  ,  ,terpene synthase
73,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC2881305/eupmc_result.json,PMC2881305,"Results The objective of this study was to discover regions of the  S. pennellii LA0716 genome that modify accumulation of specialized metabolites in SGTs as a first step toward discovering gene products involved in these metabolic pathways. This study takes advantage of a series of chromosomal substitution lines that systematically replace parts of genome of the  Solanum lycopersicum variety M82 with homologous regions from the wild species  S. pennellii LA0716 ( Eshed and Zamir, 1994,  1995). These lines were constructed in such a way that they each contain one genetically characterized region of an LA0716 chromosome in an otherwise M82 tomato genetic background. The screened lines span the entire genome with the exception of a relatively small region at the top of chromosome 5, which is unique to IL5-1 (bin 5A). Screening of the majority of the 65 ILs was performed in 2–4-fold replication, together with 30 parental  S. lycopersicum M82 control plants, using the leaf dip method. Leaflets of 3-week-old growth chamber-grown plants were harvested and immediately extracted by brief and gentle agitation in one of two solvents selected for extraction of a broad range of metabolites from the leaf surface, including the contents of SGT cells. While we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the chemicals found using the leaf dip method came from pavement epidermal cells or inside the leaves (particularly the glycoalkaloids), the patterns of metabolites detected are quite similar to those for trichomes scraped from the leaf surface ( Schilmiller   et al., 2009 ). The chemical compositions of the ILs were compared with the isogenic M82 parent, and any changes in recognizable classes of chemicals were verified by re-growing and chemically analyzing the ILs and the M82 parent. Discovery of differences in accumulation of metabolites of lower abundance Abundant metabolites that distinguish ILs from a reference genotype can be recognized by visual inspection of LC-MS chromatograms or using statistical methods such as principle component analysis ( Figures S4 and  S5). In contrast, discovery of changes in the accumulation of less abundant metabolites requires alternative data mining approaches. Low-abundance metabolites are often obscured in principal component analysis plots, and rapid separations increase the likelihood of metabolite co-elution. These challenges can be overcome through automated extraction of metabolite signals and the use of multi-variate statistics to identify metabolites that distinguish genotypes. In the current study, extracted ion chromatograms for the glycoalkaloid dehydrotomatine ( m/z 1076.5 for the formate adduct ion, negative-ion mode) were generated and integrated, as this dehydrogenated form of tomatine had been found in earlier studies ( Friedman   et al., 1997 ;  Vaananen   et al., 2006 ). The chromatograms also revealed an earlier-eluting isomer of dehydrotomatine that was present only in samples from the overlapping ILs 1-1 and 1-1-3 and not in M82 ( Figure 10). Fragmentation patterns generated using positive-ion mode suggested that the double bond in the early-eluting isomer was located in the F-ring, probably in the form of an imine group ( Figure 10c). Once ILs exhibiting metabolite variation have been identified, deeper probing of differences can be achieved using a supervised multi-variate statistical analysis termed ‘orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis’ (OPLS-DA) ( Bylesjo   et al., 2008 ). This algorithm employs multiple linear regression and orthogonal filtering to aid in recognition of metabolites that discriminate between sample classes. In this case, the two classes were the M82 parent (class 1) and IL1-1-3 (class 2), and the LC-MS data were automatically extracted using MarkerLynx software (Waters,  http://www.waters.com) to yield an array of intensities of analytical signals (ions of specific  m/z value eluting at a specific time). These processing steps generate lists of peak areas annotated with specific LC retention times and masses; the statistical analysis assigns a p(corr) score suggestive of how well they discriminate classes, and this score is independent of the metabolite abundance. Analysis by OPLS-DA suggested four analytical signals whose abundance is higher in 1-1-3 compared with M82 ( Figure S6). These were manually annotated as didehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatine and two adducts of the early-eluting dehydrotomatine isomer, based on fragmentation patterns and accurate mass measurements. None were detected in the other 63 ILs. Two ILs with lower total acyl sugars The results from screening the ILs illustrate that the rapid LC-TOF-MS method revealed quantitative changes in metabolite levels. In contrast to the effect of the  S. pennellii chromosomal regions 1-3/1-4 and 8-1/8-1-1 on acyl sugar substitution, two other ILs caused changes in total acyl sugar levels.  Figure 9(a) shows the results of a screening analysis of total acyl sugars from the chromosome substitution lines, and indicates that ILs 5-3 and 11-3 have consistently lower accumulation of all major acyl sugars compared to M82 (IL5-3,  P<0.005; IL11-3,  P<0.001; Mann–Whitney rank sum test). The finding of decreased acyl sugar levels caused by introgression of chromosomal segments from  S. pennellii LA0716 into M82 tomato is counter-intuitive because this wild tomato species accumulates much higher amounts of acyl sugars than the cultivated tomato ( Fobes   et al., 1985 ). Two general hypotheses would account for this unexpected behavior: either there are alleles of M82 that are important for normal acyl sugar levels or there are alleles from LA0716 that, when removed from the LA0716 genomic context, negatively influence acyl sugar accumulation compared to the genes from M82 tomato. IL8-1-1 causes a shift in acyl chain lengths without altering the number of substitutions The higher proportion of acyl sugars with C4 acyl chains, the corresponding decrease in C5 acyl chains, and the inability of LC-MS to distinguish branched and linear fatty acid groups prompted us to further characterize the types of acyl chains present on acyl sugars in M82 and IL8-1-1. Acyl chains on the acyl sugars were trans-esterified to the corresponding ethyl esters for analysis by GC-MS. This type of analysis allows identification of the C5 acyl chains as straight chain, iC5 or aiC5. Following ethyl trans-esterification, the leaf dips from IL8-1-1 showed an increase in isobutyrate (C4) ethyl ester compared to M82 ( Figure 8). This increase in the C4 chain was associated with a decrease in 3-methylbutyrate ethyl ester (corresponding to iC5), with no decrease in the 2-methylbutyrate ethyl ester (corresponding to aiC5). The LC-MS total-ion chromatograms for IL8-1 and IL8-1-1 also showed changes in major acyl sugar peaks when compared to M82 ( Figure 6a). In these lines, a major metabolite with a molecular mass 14 Da lower than that of S4:17 emerged as the dominant peak in the chromatograms. Fragmentation and accurate mass measurements indicated that this peak is a S4:16 acyl sucrose with a C4 fatty acid substituted for one of the C5 moieties ( Figure 6a,b). This is a quantitative change and M82 accumulates S4:16 at approximately 50% of the level seen in IL8-1 and 8-1-1. Further analysis of the acyl sugars in IL8-1-1 showed an increase in the abundance of several acyl sugars that have one or more C4 acyl chains compared to M82 ( Figure 6a,b), including a minor metabolite (S4:14) in which all three C5 fatty acid groups have been replaced by C4. The amounts of acyl sugars without any C4 acyl chains were decreased in IL8-1-1 compared to M82 ( Figure 6b). The acyl chains on acyl sugars are proposed to derive from precursors of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis ( Kandra   et al., 1990 ;  van der Hoeven and Steffens, 2000). Because the C5 acyl chains can derive from precursors of either Leu or Ile, two types of C5 acyl chains can be present. 3-methylbutyrate (iso-C5, abbreviated iC5) comes from the Leu biosynthetic pathway, and 2-methylbutyrate (anteiso-C5, abbreviated aiC5) comes from the Ile pathway ( Figure 7). ILs 1-3 and 1-4 lack an acetyl group on abundant acyl sucrose metabolites Two additional major tetra-acyl sucroses were also detected in M82 leaf dips, corresponding to substitution of either C4 or C12 fatty acids for one of the C5 chains ( Figure 5a). We analyzed positive-ion fragmentation products resulting from cleavage of the glycosidic bond. This allowed determination of which acyl groups are substituted on the six- and five-membered rings. In both cases, the variable-length chains were found on the glucopyranose ring. A single five-carbon acyl chain was found on the five-member ring for all acyl sugars reported here. Comparisons of LC-MS total-ion chromatograms for M82 with those from the overlapping ILs 1-3 and 1-4 revealed changes in the major peaks from the chromosomal substitution lines ( Figure 5a,b). For example, the mass spectrum of the most prominent metabolite peak in M82, generated using gentle ionization conditions, is dominated by an ion of  m/z 681. Mass spectra generated using a collision energy that was 15 V higher showed a peak that had a mass that was lower by 46 Da ( m/z 635). This mass difference corresponds to formic acid, suggesting that the original ion was a complex with formate present in the HPLC mobile phase, and this is consistent with a molecular mass of 636 Da for the metabolite. However, higher collision energies generated fragment ions at masses corresponding to neutral losses of one C2 and three C5 fatty acids, and an additional fragment consistent with the C5 fatty acid anion. These findings led to the conclusion that this metabolite has one acetate ester and three C5 fatty acid ester groups ( Figure 5c). The TOF-MS yielded mass measurements accurate to within 0.003 Da that supported these assignments, and were consistent with an elemental formula of C 29H 48O 15 for the metabolite. The combined information from accurate measurements of molecular and fragment ion masses suggested a disaccharide substituted with the ester groups mentioned above, but MS data alone were insufficient for definitive and complete determination of the chemical structure. NMR analysis of the purified metabolite revealed the structure shown in  Figures 5(c) and  S3, confirming the MS results (see  Appendix S1 and  Figure S3 for detailed information about NMR analysis). We refer to this acyl sugar as S4:17; in this nomenclature, ‘S’ refers to sucrose, ‘4’ indicates the total number of acyl chains, and ‘17’ is the sum of the number of carbon molecules in the acyl chains. In contrast with M82, S4:17 is barely detectable in IL1-3, for which the mass spectrum of the most prominent peak is dominated by an ion at  m/z 639. The mass spectrum generated at elevated collision energy again suggests the presence of three C5 fatty acid esters, but no evidence for the acetate ( Figure 5d). By analogy to S4:17, and based on accurate mass measurements, we infer that this metabolite is a tri-acyl sucrose with three C5 fatty acid esters, and is abbreviated as S3:15. Deacetylated variants of other tetra-acyl sucrose metabolites are also found in IL1-3 ( Figure 5b). GC-MS screening of ILs GC-MS offers an easy way to detect and quantify non-polar volatile metabolites from SGTs by extraction of whole-leaf tissue in  tert-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) ( Gang   et al., 2001 ). The predominant volatile compounds detected in M82 tomato leaf dips are C10 monoterpenes and C15 sesquiterpenes produced in the trichomes ( Schilmiller   et al., 2009 ), and the same quantitative and qualitative pattern was observed for the majority of ILs screened. Previous work with  Solanum habrochaites ILs demonstrated that sesquiterpene synthase(s) on chromosome 6 control production of sesquiterpenes in  S. lycopersicum trichomes ( van der Hoeven   et al., 2000 ). Consistent with these published studies, the overlapping  S. pennellii ILs 6-2 and 6-2-2 do not accumulate detectable sesquiterpenes in leaf trichomes, this also is the sesquiterpene phenotype of  S. pennellii LA0716 ( Figure S1). Two other ILs were found to accumulate reduced levels of terpenes compared to M82. For IL2-2, the levels of all detected terpenes were reduced, with monoterpenes accumulating to approximately 40% of M82 levels and sesquiterpenes accumulating to approximately 65% of M82 levels ( Figures 1a,c and 2c). None of the other ILs on chromosome 2 displayed this phenotype, suggesting that the locus controlling the reduction in terpene levels is in the region unique to IL2-2, defined as bin 2-D ( Figure 1b). In contrast, IL10-3 showed a 75–90% reduction of sesquiterpenes alone ( Figure 2a,c). Because this phenotype is specific to IL10-3, the locus controlling reduction in sesquiterpenes must be located on bin 10-G ( Figure 2b). This method also allowed identification of a low-abundance monoterpene that is not found in M82 leaf dips: ILs 1-3 and 1-4 were both found to accumulate α-thujene ( Figure 3a,c), a monoterpene that is present in  S. pennellii LA0716 trichomes, but is not normally detected in M82. Because two overlapping introgressions display this phenotype, the location of the locus controlling α-thujene accumulation can be narrowed to bin 1-H, the region in common between ILs 1-3 and 1-4 ( Figure 3b). Development of a LC-TOF-MS method for rapid profiling of trichome metabolites A major benefit of coupling LC to TOF-MS is the fast acquisition of accurate mass measurements for metabolites in complex mixtures. This is achieved by rapid generation of mass spectra of metabolites eluting from the column over a range of mass-to-charge ( m/z) ratios, followed by automated extraction of ion abundances that are catalogued based on retention time and  m/z value ( Wilson   et al., 2005 ). As shown in  Figure S2, 15 or more acyl sugar molecules were revealed by analyzing chromatograms for 11  m/z ratios associated with various homologs of this class of metabolite. In some cases (e.g.  m/z 737 and 695), multiple metabolites of the same molecular masses (structural isomers) were resolved by the LC separation, even using the 5 min LC method ( Figure S2, right panel). The full dataset is provided in  Table S1, and details of the data analysis used to identify ILs with alterations in specialized metabolites are described in  Appendix S1. Analysis of large numbers of complex biological samples for non-volatile specialized metabolites offers challenges that are either not encountered or less serious with GC-MS analysis of volatile compounds. The diversity of non-volatile specialized metabolite chemical properties and wide range of concentrations present a special set of problems for genetic screening, in which speed and reproducibility from sample to sample are desirable but conflicting properties. Direct-infusion MS ( Smedsgaard, 1997;  Allen   et al., 2003 ;  Castrillo   et al., 2003 ;  Goodacre   et al., 2003 ;  Dettmer   et al., 2007 ) without chromatographic separation offers short analysis times. Unfortunately, this fast method suffers from suppression of ionization ( Dettmer   et al., 2007 ), limited ability to distinguish chemical isomers, and complications that arise from in-source formation of adduct, oligomer and fragment ions due to the complexity of the mixture entering the MS. LC separation prior to MS analysis reduces the impact of these technical problems, but often involves analysis times of 30 min or more per sample, reducing its utility for screening large numbers of samples. Recent improvements in LC column technologies have provided enhanced chromatographic resolution with short run times through use of smaller particle sizes and particles with solid cores ( Cunliffe   et al., 2007 ;  Hsieh   et al., 2007 ;  Kirkland   et al., 2007 ;  Salisbury, 2008). In the current study, we compared the metabolite profiling performance of a 5 min LC-TOF-MS method ( Gu   et al., 2010 ) using an ultra-performance fused-core LC column with that of LC-MS performed using a more conventional column and a 43 min gradient. Profiles of specialized metabolites were generated for M82 and an IL using extracts from tomato leaflets dipped in solvent for selective extraction of trichome and other leaf surface metabolites ( Figure 4a,b). The major observed metabolites, including malic acid, quinic acid, chlorogenic acid, the glycosylated flavonoid rutin, the glycosylated alkaloid tomatine and multiple acyl sugars, were resolved using both separation methods, with minimal sacrifice of metabolite resolution in the faster method.","Glandular secreting trichomes of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and close relatives produce a variety of structurally diverse volatile and non-volatile specialized ('secondary') metabolites, including terpenes, flavonoids and acyl sugars. A genetic screen is described here to profile leaf trichome and surface metabolite extracts of nearly isogenic chromosomal substitution lines covering the tomato genome. These lines contain specific regions of the Solanum pennellii LA0716 genome in an otherwise 'wild-type' M82 tomato genetic background. Regions that have an impact on the total amount of extractable mono- and sesquiterpenes (IL2-2) or only sesquiterpenes (IL10-3) or specifically influence accumulation of the monoterpene alpha-thujene (IL1-3 and IL1-4) were identified using GC-MS. A rapid LC-TOF-MS method was developed and used to identify changes in non-volatile metabolites through non-targeted analysis. Metabolite profiles generated using this approach led to the discovery of introgression lines producing different acyl chain substitutions on acyl sugar metabolites (IL1-3/1-4 and IL8-1/8-1-1), as well as two regions that influence the quantity of acyl sugars (IL5-3 and IL11-3). Chromosomal region 1-1/1-1-3 was found to influence the types of glycoalkaloids that are detected in leaf surface extracts. These results show that direct chemical screening is a powerful way to characterize genetic diversity in trichome specialized metabolism.",NaN," 'Figure', 'acyl sugars', 'acyl', 'acyl chains', 'metabolites', 'ILs', 'analysis', 'sugars', 'chains', 'mass' "," IL5-1, ILs, 2–4-fold, ILs, ILs, ILs, ILs 1, 1-1-3, ILs, ‘, ’, class 1, IL1-1, class 2, LC, p(corr, hydroxytomatine, ILs, ILs, ILs, ILs, 9(a, ILs 5-3, IL5-3, IL11-3, IL8-1, C4 acyl, C5 acyl, IL8-1, C5 acyl, aiC5, IL8-1, C4 chain, aiC5, IL8-1, IL8-1, S4:16, C4 fatty acid, C5 moieties, S4:16, IL8-1, 8-1-1, IL8-1-1, C4 acyl, S4:14, C5 fatty acid, C4, C4 acyl, IL8-1, C5 acyl, C5 acyl, iso-C5, anteiso-C5, aiC5, ILs 1, 1-4, C4, C5 chains, ILs 1, 1-4, C2, C5 fatty acids, C5 fatty acid, C5 fatty acid, 5(c, ‘S’, ‘4’, ‘17, ’, IL1-3, C5 fatty acid, C5 fatty acid, S3:15, Deacetylated, IL1-3, ILs, ILs, synthase(s, pennellii LA0716, ILs, IL2-2, c and 2c, ILs, IL2-2, IL10-3, 75–90, IL10-3, ILs 1-3, 1-4, c, ILs 1, 1-4, LC, LC, LC, ILs, LC, IL ",  ," 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'GC-MS.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'MS.'

Two additional eudicot cp genomes,  Spinacia oleracea and  Arabidopsis thaliana, were set as outgroups. A phylogenetic tree was generated using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood method (Fig.  5). Bootstrap analysis showed that there were 25 out of 31 nodes with bootstrap values >95 %, and 14 of these had a bootstrap value of 100 %. The tree topologies formed two major clades, euasterids I and II. The results strongly supported the position of  Ocimum sanctum and  Salvia miltiorrhiza with 100 % bootstrap from the same family lamiaceae as the sister of the closely related species  Sesamum indicum and  Boea hygrometrica in the order Lamiales. As the chloroplast genome is considered to be free from evolutionary processes, like gene duplication/ deletion, intensive evolution and pseudogene formation, which are characteristically frequent among nuclear genes, this was included in the phylogenetic analysis   50 . Slow rate of sequence evolution in chloroplast DNA is appropriate to include cp genome in phylogenetic studies of the highly cross pollinated plant like  O. sanctum   51 . Medicinal nature of  O. sanctum In this analysis  O. sanctum cp genome was observed to be evolutionarily nearest to  S. miltiorrhiza. In the absence of complete genome sequence data (unfinished draft genome) of  S. Miltiorrhiza, the chloroplast genome comparison analysis was taken into account. Both the plants are used widely in two different traditional medicine systems (Indian and Chinese, respectively), and hence may be implicated for similar molecules, activities  vis a vis the genes biosynthesizing metabolites. In addition, both plants have chromosome number described to be 2n = 16   16,  57 . The active ingredients in  S. miltiorrhiza are both hydrophilic (phenolic acids like rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid B, lithospermic acid and dihydroxyphenyllactic acid) and lipophilic diterpene components (tanshinones, including structurally related tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, cryptotanshinone, and dihydrotanshinone I)   58 . These molecules are responsible for a wide array of activities like anti-bacterial, anti-oxidative and anti-viral to hepatoprotective activities. The chemical composition of Tulsi is highly complex, and the important are triterpene like urosolic acid (cardioprotective effect), phenolics like rosmarinic acid, apigenin, cirsimaritin, isothymusin and isothymonin (exhibiting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities), and important aroma components like 1, 8 cineole, linalool, methyl chavicol (estragole) and eugenol   16 . Phenolic acid compounds production by hairy root culture have been reported in both  O. basilicum and  S. miltiorrhiza   59 . In addition, the vast literature indicates phenylpropanoid derivatives in these two plants are responsible for a range of major activities. In this investigation also we could observe the dominance of phenylpropanoid pathway genes. The highest number of sequences among the mevalonate pathway genes in  O. sanctum are observed to be homologous to copalyl diphosphate synthases (CPS), that are involved in the biosynthesis of an important bioactive diterpene tanshinone in  S. miltiorrhiza   58 . As  O. sanctum is traditionally used for many aliments and the compounds of this plant are not fully investigated, the possibility exists for the discovery of tanshinone like compounds and other novel diterpenes. De-novo assembly of chloroplast and mitochondria genome data The complete chloroplast (cp) genome of  O. sanctum is 142,524 bp in length (Fig.  2). Recently, Qian et al   17  had reported the chloroplast genome of  Salvia miltiorrhiza to be the smallest with the exception of  Epifagus virginiana   18  cp genome of order lamiales. But this investigation revealed  O. sanctum cp genome to be 8804 bp smaller than  S. miltiorrhiza (member of the  Ocimum family- lamiaceae) cp genome of length 151,328 bp. Hence  O. sanctum cp genome is now reported as the smallest of the Lamiales cp genomes as it is ~8800 bp smaller than  E. virginiana cp genome. The overall GC content of the  O. sanctum cp genome is 36.2 %, which is similar to the other reported asterid cp genomes   17,  19– 22 . The  O. sanctum cp genome was found to code a total 158 genes, including 43 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. The aligned reads of cp genome of  O. sanctum to other angiosperms (referred in materials and methods section) were assembled into contigs for finally generating the scaffolds using all the Illumina data. Similar procedure was carried out for mitochondrial genome (Additional file  5 and  6) assembly except considering  S. miltiorrhiza as the reference mitochondial genome. A total of 48 scaffolds from 140 contigs from cp genome, and 41 scaffolds from 124 contigs (Additional file  5 and  6) from the mitochondrial genome got generated. Genomic composition and SSR prediction Among different classes of molecular markers, microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are the most preferred for its array of applications in plant genetics and breeding due to their multi-allelic nature, reproducibility, co-dominant inheritance with high abundance and wide genome coverage   38,  39 . A total of 4827 sequences greater than 500 bp length were examined for SSR search out of which 2612 sequences were found having SSR repeats while 2364 sequences showed the presence of more than one SSR (Fig.  3). A sum of 142,601 SSRs were predicted, with the highest being mono-repeats (85,624) and (13,389) complex SSR’s. The sequences were checked for mono-repeats occurring at-least 10 times, di-repeats occurring at-least 6 times and tri/ tetra/ penta/ hexa-repeats occurring atleast 5 times. The SSR was classified as complex when two SSR’s were present within 100 bp distance of each other. On the other side, 1,166,753 sequences of less than 500 bp were identified, only 162 SSRs highest being mono-repeats (68) followed by complex SSR’s (57) (Fig.  3). Previously, we reported SSRs from the transcriptome of  O. sanctum   16  but the SSRs identified were very few in comparison to the present report. Similarly, efforts were made by researchers towards the development of molecular markers in order to carry out genetic diversity studies on  Ocimum sp.   40– 42 . But, SSRs reported from the present study with a large data set would be helpful in providing insights to the plant breeders and geneticists for evaluation of desired genotypes with varied essential oil compositions and also for further development of new species of  Ocimum. GC content is an important indicator of the genomic composition including evolution, gene structure (intron size and number), gene regulation and stability of DNA   23 . Average GC content of  O. sanctum was 38.37 %. Earlier researchers have reported that across the broad phylogenetic sweep, genome size may be correlated with intron size   24– 26 , suggesting that some fraction of genome size evolution takes place within genes   27 . While performing the annotation of gene models, taking  N. tabacum and  S. lycopersicum as references, it was found that the percent genes containing introns from these plants were 55.5 % and 64.5 %, respectively (Additional file  7). It has been observed that introns and their positions are highly conserved during land plant evolution excluding conifers   28,  29 . Comparative studies had revealed that intron lengths and the abundance of mobile repetitive elements have a direct correlation with genome size, such that large genomes have longer introns and a higher proportion of mobile elements   30,  31 . Intron sizes in the genes of  O. sanctum ranged from 5 bp to 8000 bp (Additional file  7). A reason for intron size variation among organisms may be due to inherent mutational processes generating insertions and deletions   24,  32– 35 . It was also reported that low distribution of recombination regions leads to increased intron size   36,  37 . A gene density of ~30 genes per 100 kb and ~20 genes per 100 kb was observed in  O. sanctum gene model prediction taking  N. tabacum (tobacco) and  S. lycopersicum (tomato), respectively as references. Since  O. sanctum is a small genome plant, the gene density is similar to that of  Arabidopsis thaliana i.e., upto 38 genes per 100 kb   43 . Large genomes like barley and wheat show a gene density of about 5 genes per 23 kb   44  as it was suggested that the larger genomes would have accumulated non-coding sequences between the single-copy genes   45 . Genome sequencing, assembly and validation A whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy by generating long and short paired-end reads, along with long reads and mate-pair libraries was applied to assemble the 386 Mb genome sequence of  O. sanctum. The process workflow of the same has been provided in the Fig.  1. Two libraries (long and short reads) of Illumina HiSeq2000, one library of 454 GS FLX and one mate-pair library of SOLiD 5500XL were constructed. Illumina libraries were used to generate the contigs and Illumina paired-end data along with 454 GS FLX single end data were used for contig merging as a result of which scaffolds were generated. While Illumina generated 45.37 Gb data (Additional file  1), 454 sequencing resulted in 320.3 Mb (Additional file  2) data and SOLiD generated 12.68 Gb (Additional file  3) data representing approximately ~130-fold coverage of the predicted  O. sanctum genome. With the help of the two Illumina library data (short insert and long insert) the assembly showed significant improvement in respect of N50. Long- and short-paired end reads from Illumina deep sequencing was used to assemble a total of 107,785 contigs into 22,776 scaffolds. Super-scaffolding was performed in order to merge the existing gap-closed scaffolds into super-scaffolds using relative orientation of SOLiD mate pair reads. Finally, 9059 super-scaffolds of maximum length upto 2,211,552 bp were generated (Table  1). Out of the total super-scaffolds generated, 4159 super-scaffolds are larger than or equal to 1 kb in length (Table  1). The N50 length of contigs, scaffolds and super-scaffolds was found to be 12,769 bp, 61,854 bp and 303,233 bp respectively (Table  1). The total length of the gaps in the assembled scaffolds was 26.11 Mb in a total of 3999 super-scaffolds. The total number of gaps present is 45,803 considering even the presence of a single N as one gap. The biggest gap identified was of 4906 bp in length. Mate-pair reads significantly closed ~60 % of gaps between scaffolds and five-fold change in N50 value and N90 value was also observed where N50 increased from 61,242 to 303,233 while N90 from 12,534 to 73,672. In order to validate the genome assembly, a total of 69,117 transcripts generated from our previous study   16  were mapped to the genome data and more than 95 % transcripts (66,891) showed 100 % coverage (Additional file  4). Pathway identification To identify the biological pathways functional in  O. sanctum 85,723 protein sequences from scaffolds were mapped to the reference canonical pathways in KEGG taking  Arabidopsis thaliana and  Oryza sativa as reference organisms, out of which only 6328 proteins got predicted in KAAS (Additional file  18). All transcripts were classified mainly under five categories: metabolism, cellular processes, genetic information processing, environmental information processing and others. Highest numbers of sequences were related to metabolism. Maximum percentage of the sequences fell under the category of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.  O. sanctum is good source of phenylpropene- eugenol and is one of the compounds which attributes to its medicinal property   52,  53 . Precursor molecules for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis are derived from the shikimate pathway while terpenoid biosynthesis utilizes isoprenoid precursors from cytosolic MVA (mevalonate) as well as plastidial MEP pathways (2-Cmethyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate/non-mevalonate pathways)   16 . On sorting 53,480 protein coding genes of  O. sanctum annotated from UNIPROT for phenylpropanoid (Fig.  6) and terpenoid (MEP and MVA) pathway genes (Fig.  6) it was found that the highest number of phenylpropanoid pathway genes were identified as compared to the terpenes. Since the  O. sanctum variety used in the present study is high-yielding, eugenol-rich, oil producing variety   54  with 83 % eugenol in the oil, it correlates with the presence of higher number of phenylpropanoid pathway genes. Interestingly, highest number transcripts of copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) were present among the mevalonate pathway genes (Fig.  6). This enzyme participates in gibberellin biosynthesis   55 . Not only gibberellins, but a wide range of secondary metabolites, including terpenes and alkaloids, are also derived either from  ent-copalyl pyrophosphate itself or from  ent-kaurene or  ent-kaurenoic acid, the next two intermediates in the metabolic pathway to gibberellins. Knowledge of these secondary metabolic pathways is very much limited as compared to gibberellin biosynthetic pathway, and is often little more than a speculation   56 . Further functional characterization studies for copalyl diphosphate synthase may help in proving the possibility of CPS involvement in terpene and alkaloid biosynthesis. Gene prediction and annotation In order to assign putative functions to the predicted genes of  O. sanctum, they were compared against the NR (non-redundant) protein sequences of  Arabidopsis. The associated hits were searched for their respective GO. Based on sequence homology, 85,723 protein sequences were categorized into 31 functional groups under three main categories: biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC) and molecular functions (MF) (Fig.  4, Additional file  8). Genes were predicted from 22,776 scaffolds by mapping (BLASTP) the predicted proteins with UNIPROT with all Viridiplantae clade protein sequences. Out of 85,723 protein coding loci from 22,776 scaffolds, a total of 53,480 were annotated with UNIPROT (Additional file  9) but only 22,270 protein coding genes were found to be unique. On observing the plant species distribution of hits to UNIPROT database, maximum hits were from the plant  Genlisea aurea (Additional file  10) which is one of the smallest known genome among higher plants   46 . The number of unique protein coding genes (22,270) in the  O. sanctum genome, was in range as reported in potato, tomato   47 , neem   48  and grapevine   49 , having 35,004, 34,727, 20,000 and 30,434 protein coding genes, respectively. Ab initio gene model prediction was performed on scaffold sequences utilizing minimal information from the nearest available species. Overall, 130,526 and 87,918 proteins were predicted using training sets of  Nicotiana tabacum and  Solanum lycopersicum respectively. A total of 65,935 proteins were common between the two predictions. Gene annotation of the predicted proteins with BLASTP resulted in annotation of 80,516 NR proteins. A set of 38,868 of these annotated proteins were common to the predictions from  N. tabacum and  S. Lycopersicum, respectively. The un-annotated predicted proteins were scanned with Pfam and another 18,940 proteins got annotated with a predicted domain signature. Database annotation of assembled scaffold sequences greater than 500 bp was carried out for matching with the EST/mRNA sequences available for  Ocimum in the NCBI databases (Additional file  11). A total of 23,420 EST and 52 mRNA were queried, with a match to the assembled scaffolds for 21,984 of the EST/mRNA sequences at greater than 90 % sequence identity. Also  Arabidopsis sequences (Additional file  12) from TAIR database and  N. tabacum (Additional file  13) and  S. lycopersicum (Additional file  14) sequences from NCBI were Blast- checked against the  O. sanctum scaffolds with percent hitting scaffolds of 34.65 %, 4.9 % and 5.29 %, respectively. Database annotation of EST/mRNA from NCBI datasets identified the mitochondria and chloroplast expressed proteins. All of the 392 scaffolds identified were annotated to potentially map to these sequences (Additional file  15). Out of 392 scaffolds, 270 were redundant and only 122 were non-redundant. On the basis of annotation of chloroplast and mitochondria encoded proteins against TAIR database, it was found that out of 122 non-redundant scaffolds of  O. sanctum, 95 were chloroplastic while remaining 27 were mitochondrial."," Background Ocimum sanctum L. (O. tenuiflorum) family-Lamiaceae is an important component of Indian tradition of medicine as well as culture around the world, and hence is known as ""Holy basil"" in India. This plant is mentioned in the ancient texts of Ayurveda as an ""elixir of life"" (life saving) herb and worshipped for over 3000 years due to its healing properties. Although used in various ailments, validation of molecules for differential activities is yet to be fully analyzed, as about 80 % of the patents on this plant are on extracts or the plant parts, and mainly focussed on essential oil components. With a view to understand the full metabolic potential of this plant whole nuclear and chloroplast genomes were sequenced for the first time combining the sequence data from 4 libraries and three NGS platforms. Results The saturated draft assembly of the genome was about 386 Mb, along with the plastid genome of 142,245 bp, turning out to be the smallest in Lamiaceae. In addition to SSR markers, 136 proteins were identified as homologous to five important plant genomes. Pathway analysis indicated an abundance of phenylpropanoids in O. sanctum. Phylogenetic analysis for chloroplast proteome placed Salvia miltiorrhiza as the nearest neighbor. Comparison of the chemical compounds and genes availability in O. sanctum and S. miltiorrhiza indicated the potential for the discovery of new active molecules. Conclusion The genome sequence and annotation of O. sanctum provides new insights into the function of genes and the medicinal nature of the metabolites synthesized in this plant. This information is highly beneficial for mining biosynthetic pathways for important metabolites in related species.",NaN," 'Additional file', 'genome', 'Additional', 'sanctum', 'genes', 'file', 'sequences', 'pathway genes', 'scaffolds', 'gene' "," duplication/, isothymonin, CPS, lamiales, ~8800, ribosomal RNA, SSRs, 85,624, di-repeats, tri/ tetra/ penta/ hexa-repeats, 1,166,753, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, single-copy, mate-pair, GS, GS, SOLiD, short-paired, 107,785, gap-closed, SOLiD, 2,211,552, Mate-pair, 61,242, 73,672, 69,117, 66,891, phenylpropene- eugenol, 53,480, eugenol-rich, copalyl diphosphate synthase, CPS, gibberellin biosynthesis, copalyl diphosphate synthase, CPS, 85,723, UNIPROT, 85,723, 53,480, 87,918 proteins, 65,935, 80,516 NR, 38,868, TAIR, NCBI, Blast-, NCBI ",  ," 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.'

We used a genetic mapping population of wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, originating from a cross of 2 natural accessions from Arizona and Utah, separated by the Grand Canyon, to dissect genetic variation controlling VOCs. Herbivory-induced leaf terpenoid emissions varied substantially, while green leaf volatile emissions were similar. In a field experiment, only emissions of linalool, a common VOC, correlated significantly with predation of the herbivore Manduca sexta by native predators. Using quantitative trait locus mapping and genome mining, we identified an (S)-(+)-linalool synthase (NaLIS). Genome resequencing, gene cloning, and activity assays revealed that the presence/absence of a 766-bp sequence in NaLIS underlies the variation of linalool emissions in 26 natural accessions. We manipulated linalool emissions and composition by ectopically expressing linalool synthases for both enantiomers, (S)-(+)- and (R)-(-)-linalool, reported to oppositely affect M. sexta oviposition, in the Arizona and Utah accessions. We used these lines to test ovipositing moths in increasingly complex environments. The enantiomers had opposite effects on oviposition preference, but the magnitude of the effect depended strongly both on plant genetic background, and complexity of the bioassay environment. Our study reveals that the emission of linalool, a common VOC, differs by orders-of-magnitude among geographically interspersed conspecific plants due to allelic variation in a linalool synthase, and that the response of a specialist herbivore to linalool depends on enantiomer, plant genotype, and environmental complexity."," 'Manduca sexta', 'Tri-trophic Interactions', 'oviposition preference', 'Nicotiana Attenuata', 'Enantiomer-specific Linalool Synthase' ",  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,NaN
78,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC5146979/eupmc_result.json,PMC5146979,"Results and Discussion VviERF045 in Fruit Ripening Although our study was not conducted on berries, but in leaves from  in vitro plants, implying that the results cannot be transferred straightforwardly to the fruit system, we have observed the modulation of several processes in the transgenic overexpressing lines, which are also typical of grape ripening: changes in the epidermis and in the cuticle, a decrease in photosynthetic capacity, and the activation of several defense related genes. Berry ripening is a complex physiological process under tight regulation, which begins about 8 WAA and proceeds for about 5–6 weeks. From ripening onset, the berry undergoes chlorophyll degradation, accumulation of color, sugar and aroma compounds, organic acid catabolism, and an increase in berry size and elasticity ( Coombe and McCARTHY, 2000). At ripening onset, three processes take place, all of which imply a modification of the outer structures of the epidermal cells and thus possibly the intervention of VviERF045: berry softening, berry expansion ( Coombe, 1992), and a reduction in the thickness of cuticular waxes ( Rogiers et al., 2004). In the overexpressing transgenic line L15, genes known to be involved in these berry processes, such as an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase ( VIT_04s0008g02010) involved in cell wall disassembly ( Libertini et al., 2004), three expansins ( VIT_06s0004g04860, VIT_06s0004g07970, VIT_12s0059g00190), a polygalacturonase PG1 ( VIT_07s0005g01550), and a pectinesterase ( VIT_11s0016g00330) related to berry expansion and skin softening ( Deytieux-Belleau et al., 2008), are down-regulated compared to the WT plants. These same genes are induced in the berry, at ripening onset. This might suggest that  VviERF045 down-regulates these enzymes to counterbalance an excessive cell wall disassembling. The post-véraison development of an amorphous layer of cuticular waxes and the observation that deposition of epicuticular wax ceases at véraison as reported in Shiraz berries ( Rogiers et al., 2004), is in line with our microscopic analyses ( Figure   7) and the repression of cuticle and wax biosynthetic genes in L15 ( Figure   6). With the beginning of berry ripening, the photosynthetic apparatus is dismantled and consequently the photosynthetic capacity of the berry drops dramatically ( Pandey and Farmahan, 1977).  VviERF045 could contribute to this switch-off in virtue of its effect on chlorophylls and carotenoids content ( Figure   3), and the down-regulation of genes important for chlorophyll accumulation, like  CIP7 and  FERRITINs. To further corroborate the importance of the obtained results in understanding berry ripening regulation, we ran  in silico analyses taking advantage of the grapevine gene expression compendium VESPUCCI ( Moretto et al., 2016). We looked whether the 563 DEGs modulated in the L15 to WT plants comparison, were expressed in the berry during ripening, in order to gain insights about their role in the process. Five hundred and forty five DEGs (18 genes were not unique in the database) were analyzed in 389 condition contrasts (Supplementary Table  S5) mostly derived from samples of berries at different phenological stages, between EL 27 and EL 41. Interestingly, a large fraction (70%) of the DE genes appeared either up- (153 genes) or down-regulated (231 genes) (Supplementary Table  S4), indicating that these genes are indeed modulated during ripening. The two groups were also enriched in functional classes characteristic of berry ripening like starch and sucrose metabolism, auxin biosynthesis, ethylene signaling and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in the case of the up-regulated genes, cell wall and HomeoBox TFs in the case of the down-regulated ones. An important interaction between ethylene and auxin in the control of berry ripening has been recently elucidated ( Böttcher et al., 2013). Within the DEGs, we found 7  ERF encoding genes: two  SHINE putative horthologues ( VviERF042 and  VviERF044) that were down-regulated, and other five  ERFs that were strongly up-regulated. In this last group with the exception of  VviERF045, there were four  ERF genes ( VviERF093, VviERF111, VviERF118, VviERF120), from clade IX or X, previously shown to be induced in the transition from véraison to ripe berries either in skin or in flesh ( Licausi et al., 2010). These evidences strongly suggest an involvement of these ERF TFs in the control of berry ripening. Among the ERF regulatory factors possibly linked to the berry ripening process, identified previously in a microarray experiment on Pinot Noir berries at three developmental stages ( Pilati et al., 2007), we selected  VviERF045 for further characterization, since this factor displays a fruit ripening specific expression ( Figure   1). An important role for  VviERF045, as major switch in berry ripening, was recently also proposed by  Palumbo et al. (2014). Many pathogen-resistance genes appear modulated by  VviERF045 (Supplementary Table  S4), suggesting its action also increases plant defense via activation of the basic immune defense system. Among the proteins that change their levels of expression during berry ripening, there are many pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs). PRs are highly abundant at ripening and generally lowly expressed or absent in unripe berries. The presence of this class of proteins in healthy fruit suggests that they may play a role in fruit development, or that they are part of a pre-emptive defense when softening and sugar accumulation make fruit attractive targets for pathogens ( Davies and Robinson, 2000). In this study, we collected clear evidence that VviERF045 regulates wax biosynthesis and the morphology of the cuticle and probably of the cell wall in the epidermal cells by modulating a set of specific genes. The phylogenetic proximity of VviERF045 to the SHYNE clade ( Figure   1E) of ERFs, known to function in cuticle and epidermis patterning, further corroborates this conclusion. Analysis of Metabolites We measured 56 phenolic secondary metabolites ( Supplementary Figure   S4), including chlorophyll a and b and total carotenoids ( Figure   3C), hydroxycinnamic acids, benzoic acids, stilbenes, flavonols, flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins ( Figure   5A) and lipids ( Figure   6A) for the all five transgenic lines and WT (Supplementary Table  S3). To have a general idea of the dispersion of the metabolic data, a PCA was computed for all the metabolites ( Supplementary Figure   S4). In this analysis the WT and the L6 plants were the most separated groups, whereas the other lines showed an intermediate position. Thus, the metabolomic study confirmed the extreme behavior of L6 line observed in the phenotypic characterization. VviERF045 Is Involved in Plant Growth and Development Among the DEGs we found a significant number of genes whose  Arabidopsis putative orthologs are involved in growth and development, and more specifically are associated to the development of anatomical structures, the formation of cotyledonal vascular pattern, procambial histogenesis and multidimensional cell growth (Supplementary Table  S4). Noteworthy was  VIT_04s0008g01970, coding for the putative ortholog of the  ERECTA ( ER) gene, which appeared strongly down-regulated in L15.  ER codes for a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like Ser/Thr kinase that is a major transcriptional regulator with pleiotropic effects on development and plant physiology. It controls plant transpiration efficiency, modulating stomatal opening and CO 2 fixation ( Masle et al., 2005), stomatal density and patterning ( Lampard et al., 2008), abaxial-adaxial identity ( Qi et al., 2004), petal shape and size ( Abraham et al., 2013), ethylene induced hyponastic growth and leaf petiole angle ( Van Zanten et al., 2010), leaf area and plant biomass during shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) ( Kasulin et al., 2013), and resistance against specific pathogens such as fungi ( Häffner et al., 2014). Indeed  er loss of function mutants show reduced plant size, rounder and shorter leaves, shorter petioles and compact inflorescences in  Arabidopsis. These features closely resemble those we observed in the lines overexpressing  VviERF045, namely reduced leaf biomass, leaves with globular surface and different leaf margins and changes in leaf-petiole angle ( Figure   2B). In L15,  VIT_18s0001g10160, coding for the putative  WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 ( WOX4) grapevine ortholog, was induced twofold with respect to WT plants.  WOX4 is expressed in the pro-cambium and plays an important role in vascular meristem organization. Recent evidence indicated that  ER participates also in vascular development, acting upstream to  WOX4 ( Uchida and Tasaka, 2013), and our results suggest a similar interplay between these genes in grapevine. Phenotypic Characterization of  VviERF045 Transgenic Lines Fourteen transgenic lines overexpressing  VviERF045 from the  Vitis vinifera cv. ‘Brachetto’ were generated (see Materials and Methods). In five of them, the expression of  VviERF045 (due to transcription of exogenous and endogenous gene copies) was much higher than in the wild type and they were used for further functional characterization. In lines L6 and L7 the expression of  VviERF045 was about 100-fold increased; in the other three lines it was increased around 25–30 times ( Figure   2A). The overall phenotype of the transgenic lines seemed directly related to the level of expression of the transgene, affecting not only leaf morphology and color, but also root biomass and architecture ( Figure   2B) and this was particularly evident in case of L6. Several leaf features correlated strongly with the expression level of  VviERF045, such as the leaf blade insertion angle on the petiole ( Figure   2B), the leaf area and the leaf margins ( Figures   3A,B). In general, L6 leaves displayed an acute insertion angle, a globular and chlorotic surface (almost yellow) and leaf margins curved toward the abaxial surface of the leaf, resembling somehow an ‘epinastic’ phenotype ( Barry et al., 2001). Unlike L6, WT plants carried leaves with an insertion angle ranging between 180° and 140°, with a plane and bright green surface and an evident dentate margin. L15-19-22 showed an intermediate phenotype with insertion angles of 90–120°, a WT-like dentate leaf margin and a light green color, while L7 leaves were more similar to L6 in form and color. The analysis of pigment contents confirmed these phenotypic observations, with L6 showing lower values of chlorophyll a and b and carotenoids ( Figure   3C). The transgenic lines showed also a general reduction in leaf number and leaf area. The total leaf area in L6 was about 10 times lower than in WT. L7, 15, and 19 showed comparable leaf areas, about half of the WT, whereas L22 was more similar to WT ( Figures   3A,B). The  VviERF045 overexpressing lines had a smaller root system with short and thick roots ( Figure   2B). This could be due to a defective auxin gradient, which plays a key role in root development ( Overvoorde et al., 2010). VviERF045 Modulates Genes Involved in Secondary Metabolic Processes Twenty-three stilbene synthase (STS) genes appeared positively associated to  VviERF045 over-expression.  STSs form a rather expanded gene family in grapevine, including at least 33 members ( Vannozzi et al., 2012), and they produce the basic stilbene structure,  trans-resveratrol, from one  p-coumaroyl-CoA and three malonyl-CoA molecules.  Trans-resveratrol can then be modified by hydroxylation, methylation, glycosylation, or condensation of more units to form the ample class of stilbenoids, which represent the major antimicrobial phenolic compounds in grapevine ( Jeandet et al., 2002;  Malacarne et al., 2011). These compounds are also produced upon abiotic stresses such as UV-light, salinity stress ( Ismail et al., 2012), and during leaf senescence and fruit ripening ( Gatto et al., 2008). Phenolics are a large and complex group of secondary metabolites with chemical properties that contribute to pigmentation and defense against several biotic and abiotic stresses in grapes ( Ali et al., 2010). Their biosynthesis starts from the amino acid phenylalanine which is converted into a vast array of molecules belonging to the major classes of the phenylpropanoids (hydroxycinnamic acids, stilbenes and lignins) and of the flavonoids (flavonols, proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins) ( Figure   5B). In our experiment, a significant higher content of peonidin  p-coumaryl3glu and to a lesser extent of the glycosylated forms of cyanidin, delphinidin and malvidin, were observed in most transgenic lines ( Figure   5A). The glycosylated forms of the flavonols quercetin and isorhamnetin displayed a similar behavior. Where the main role of anthocyanins in grapes is the red berry pigmentation to attract animals for seed dispersal, the main function of flavonols is UV-protection. Both classes are antioxidant molecules induced during different stresses, which might be the main reason of their increase in the transgenic over-expression lines. In case of the anthocyanins, the expression data were congruent with the metabolic data for two anthocyanidin 3- o-glucosyltransferases up-regulated in L15 ( VIT_03s0017g02110, VIT_16s0022g01970, Supplementary Table  S4), but less coherent for five  MATE genes ( VIT_11s0052g01560, VIT_11s0052g01540, VIT_07s0031g00750, VIT_00s0225g00080, VIT_11s0052g01500 Supplementary Table  S4), which were down-regulated. This grapevine protein family plays a role in the H +-dependent transport of acylated anthocyanins into the vacuole ( Gomez et al., 2009), and the observed down-regulation possibly indicates a problem with the vacuolar storage of these molecules. In the transgenic lines, we observed the up-regulation of sesquiterpene synthase genes encoding for delta-cadinene synthase, alpha-farnesene synthase and valencene synthase ( Lücker et al., 2004) ( Supplementary Figure   S5). Sesquiterpenes are a class of volatile terpenoids enriched in the epicuticular wax layer of the berry fruit. They act as antimicrobial volatile compounds ( Petronilho et al., 2014) and they are induced by pathogenic fungi as well as by elicitors and MeJA ( Hampel et al., 2005), but they contribute to the typical flavor of aromatic grape varieties too. Several DEGs belonging to the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (Supplementary Table  S4) encode for enzymes often positioned at the branching point of the pathway. In agreement with the overall increases in phenolic compound concentration in the transgenic lines, the majority of related DEGs also were up-regulated (Supplementary Table  S4,  Figure   5B). This includes the induction of five  PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE ( PAL) encoding genes ( VIT_16s0039g01170, VIT_16s0039g01240, VIT_16s0039g01280, VIT_16s0039g01300 and VIT_16s0039g01360), which catalyze the conversion of  L-phenylalanine to  trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia. Among the DEGs there are also genes known to affect lignin amount and composition, suggesting that this metabolic class was likely induced as indicated by the high level of vanillin in L6 ( Vanholme et al., 2010). In particular, different genes coding for cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs), ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H), caffeoyl-CoA  o-methyltransferase (COMT1) and several peroxidases were induced in L15 ( Figure   5B). It is interesting to note that  SlSHN3 silenced tomato lines showed a thicker cell wall of the epidermal cells, and that  Ambavaram et al. (2011) reported that  AtSHN2 controls secondary cell wall biosynthesis (lignin and cellulose) acting on  CAD genes ( Ambavaram et al., 2011), observations that support  VviERF045 acting as a  SHINE factor. Another important class of secondary metabolites affected in the transgenic over-expressing lines was the photosynthetic pigments, namely chlorophylls and carotenoids. As expected from the pale leaf color, the analysis of chlorophylls and carotenoids confirmed a much lower concentration in the transgenic lines, with a minimum in L6 ( Figure   3C). During fruit ripening the photosynthetic apparatus is dismantled ( Lijavetzky et al., 2012), and our results suggest that  VviERF045 might play such a role in the berries. In  Arabidopsis COP1-INTERACTING PROTEIN 7 ( CIP7) is involved in light-dependent anthocyanin and chlorophyll accumulation ( Yamamoto et al., 1998). The putative  CIP7 gene of grapevine ( VIT_00s1306g00010) was down-regulated in our study, as confirmed by RT-qPCR ( Supplementary Figure   S2). This gene was reported to be down-regulated at véraison in five red Italian varieties ( Palumbo et al., 2014), as well as during post harvest withering ( Fasoli et al., 2012). Other L15 repressed genes related to chlorophyll metabolism are  FERRITINS ( VIT_08s0058g00410, VIT_08s0058g00430, VIT_08s0058g00440), iron-storage proteins involved in the regulation of free iron levels in the cells, whose impairment cause rapid natural senescence with leaf yellowing accompanied by accelerated decrease of maximal photochemical efficiency and chlorophyll degradation ( Murgia et al., 2007). The only highly accumulated stilbene common to all transgenic lines was the glucoside derivative of  t-resveratrol,  trans-piceide, but in L15 and L19 also the monomers  cis-piceide, isorhapontin, astringin and the dimers pallidol and ampelopsin D exhibited higher levels than in WT plants. Since polymeric forms of resveratrol are usually produced during fungal attacks ( Malacarne et al., 2011), this might indicates that  VviSTS up-regulation in L15 was mainly driven by a more general stress ( Cuendet et al., 2000). In grapes, flavan 3-ols are mainly present in skin and seed tissues, where they accumulate before véraison. In vegetative organs, their content constantly increases during leaf development, but their synthesis decreases in old leaves ( Bogs et al., 2005). They are found as monomers, namely catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin 3- O-gallate, as well as oligomers, and polymers called proanthocyanidins (PA), also known as condensed tannins. In our transgenic lines, compounds of this class, either in monomeric or dimeric form (procyanidin B), or condensed to caffeic acid, were clearly found at higher concentration than in WT ( Figure   5A). As flavan 3-ols appear to function in resistance against various biotic and abiotic stresses, including UV irradiation by decreasing oxidative stress ( Hammerbacher et al., 2014), it is likely that the transgenic lines face a more stressful situation than WT plants, due, for example, to cuticle impairment and to reduced photosynthetic capacity. Effect of  VviERF045 Overexpression on the Transcriptome To identify over-represented gene categories within the DEGs, we ran an enrichment analysis with both Blast2GO ( Conesa et al., 2005) and TopGO ( Alexa et al., 2006). Blast2GO found 35 categories ( p-value < 0.05) from the ‘biological function’ subtree enriched with respect to the reference transcriptome ( Supplementary Figure   S3A). By grouping these GO categories into broader functional categories, phenylpropanoid metabolism, signaling and amino acid metabolism were over-represented. The analysis of GO terms using Blast2GO showed a higher percentage of transferase, protein phosphorylation, protein kinase and receptor activities, which suggests the participation of  VviERF045 in complex regulatory pathways. In addition, the presence of genes related to secondary metabolite pathways, such as trihydroxystilbene synthase, naringerin-chalcone synthase, flavonoid biosynthesis, and flavonoid metabolic process suggests the involvement of  VviERF045 in the synthesis and metabolism of phenolic compounds ( Supplementary Figure   S3A). Three pools of leaves harvested from  in vitro plants of the transgenic line L15 and from WT plants were used to compare the two transcriptomes by a RNA-Seq approach. L15 was selected since it showed a high level of  VviERF045 expression, while growing sufficiently well  in vitro and  in vivo. Between 29 and 79 million of paired-end reads of 100 nucleotides were obtained for each replicate, and on average 79% of them were properly aligned in both senses (Supplementary Table  S1). A multidimensional scaling approach to the analysis of the expression data highlighted that the three replicates of L15 were well separated from those of WT ( Figure   4A). Using a volcano plot, 573 DEGs between L15 and WT were identified in the region with absolute values of log2 fold change greater than 1.5 and a  p-value <0.05 ( Figure   4B; Supplementary Table  S4). Nine major GO categories came out enriched by applying weight count versus classic count in Fisher’s enrichment test by using TopGO ( Alexa et al., 2006): protein phosphorylation (Supplementary Table  S4), wax biosynthetic process, response to endogenous stimulus, cotyledonal vascular tissue/pattern formation, drug transmembrane transport, jasmonic acid biosynthesis, response to salt stress (Supplementary Table  S4), defense response to bacterium (Supplementary Table  S4), and negative regulation of endopeptidase activity ( Supplementary Figure   S3B). VviERF045 Regulates Lipid Metabolism As Well As Cuticle and Waxes Synthesis Cuticular waxes are made of very-long-chain (VLC) fatty acids (FAs), synthesized starting from plastidial C16-C18 FAs, elongated into VLCFAs in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and subsequently modified into primary alcohols and wax esthers ( Figure   6A,  Yeats and Rose, 2013). Several genes involved in FA elongation and wax biosynthesis ( VIT_00s0179g00380, VIT_01s0011g03490, VIT_16s0050g00830) were expressed at lower level in the L15 transgenic line (Supplementary Table  S4), implying  VviERF045 overexpression reduces long FA and wax content. Down-regulation was observed for the putative orthologs of the  Arabidopsis CER1 and  CER2 genes, the grapevine genes  VIT_15s0021g00050 and  VIT_05s0029g00480. The  cer1 mutant of  Arabidopsis is blocked in the conversion of stem wax C30 aldehydes to C29 alkanes, leading to a lack of secondary alcohols and ketones. This biochemical impairment results in a reduced wax load on the leaf surface of the  cer1 mutants ( Bourdenx et al., 2011), resembling the cuticular phenotype we observed in the transgenic lines in this study. The closest sequence to  VIT_05s0029g00480 is  CER26, the homologue of  CER2, which encodes for an acyl-transferase enzyme involved in the elongation process of C28 FAs ( Pascal et al., 2013).  VIT_08s0007g00390, similar to the  Arabidopsis PROTEOLYSIS 6 ( PRT6), was less expressed in the L15 line.  prt6 mutants are impaired in lipid degradation and retain oil bodies in the cells, similar to the ones observed in the external layers of the L6 leaves in our analysis ( Supplementary Figure   S6) ( Holman et al., 2009). The cytochrome P450 genes  VIT_02s0025g03320 and  VIT_07s0031g01680 were found down-regulated in  VviERF045 overexpressing lines.  VIT_02s0025g03320 belongs to the CYP86A subfamily, known to have ω-hydroxylase activity on midchain FAs ( Yeats and Rose, 2013). The similar  Arabidopsis gene  LACERATA was reported to be involved in cutin biosynthesis ( Wellesen et al., 2001). The most similar sequence to  VIT_07s0031g01680 in  Arabidopsis belongs to the CYP96A subfamily, which includes MIDCHAIN ALKANE HYDROXYLASE 1 (MAH1, CYP96A15), an enzyme of the decarbonylation pathway catalyzing the synthesis of cuticular wax secondary alcohols and ketones from VLC alkanes ( Greer et al., 2007). L15 plants also displayed lower expression of three lipases belonging to the GDSL family ( VIT_13s0106g00350, VIT_18s0041g02160, VIT_18s0086g00220). Members of this large gene family appear to have a broad range of activities in the regulation of plant development, morphogenesis, synthesis of secondary metabolites, and defense response ( Chepyshko et al., 2012). Recently, specific members within the family have been shown to play a role in cutin synthesis by catalyzing the formation of cutin ester oligomers ( Yeats et al., 2014). Our results show that  VviERF045 is functionally linked to lipid metabolism, specifically to the synthesis of cuticle and cuticular waxes. Optical images revealed a different pattern of the lipid distribution on the surface of L6 leaves compared to WT ( Figure   7A). In the latter, the reddish color was evenly distributed along the cuticular layer that covers the epidermal cells, while in L6 the stain was observed in groups of intracellular droplets, similar to lipid bodies, in the epidermal layers. Scanning Electron Microscopy (Cryo-SEM) confirmed a striking difference in the structure of the epicuticular waxes between the two ( Figure   7B): the WT cuticle appeared heavily decorated with wax aggregates, while the L6 leaf surface was smooth. The wax decoration in the other transgenic lines was reduced compared to WT. As our results pointed toward a role of  VviERF045 in regulating cuticle biosynthesis, we compared the effects of its overexpression with those described for the major known regulators, namely the  SHINE gene family and some specific  MYB TFs.  WAX INDUCER1/SHINE1 ( WAX1/SHN1) was the first TF identified ( Aharoni et al., 2004). It is an ERF sequence of clade V, whose overexpression gives rise to dwarf plants with curved and glossy leaves, lower stomata density, thicker cutin and higher wax density. The cauline leaves of the gain of function mutant  shine display cuticular ridges similar to those here reported on the L7 leaves ( Aharoni et al., 2004;  Kannangara et al., 2007). When  SHN1 and the other two closely related members  SHN2 and  SHN3 were silenced,  Arabidopsis plants exhibited, among other phenotypic traits, a decrease in cutin load ( Shi et al., 2011), and changes in cuticle structure and lipid composition have also been demonstrated in tomato ( Shi et al., 2013). SHINE regulators exert their function by acting on several cuticle- and epidermis-associated genes, including  CYTOCHROME P450s, GSDL-type LIPASES, ACYLTRANSFERASES, LONG CHAIN ACYL_CoA SYNTHASES, CER1 and  CER2 ( Kannangara et al., 2007;  Shi et al., 2011,  2013). Genes with similar functions were down-regulated in L15 transgenic plants, as reported above. The FA chain α-linolenic acid is also the precursor of the phytohormone Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA) via the action of a lipoxygenase and a jasmonate  O-methyltransferase. In L15 we found up-regulated the genes encoding for these two enzymes  (VIT_06s0004g01470 and  VIT_14s0006g02170), as well as for a MeJA esterase  (VIT_00s0253g00090), catalyzing the inverse reaction from MeJA to JA ( Supplementary Figure   S6). MeJA and JA are considered to be defense-related hormones and they do not seem to play a major role during berry ripening. It is not clear if the observed induction of the MeJA biosynthetic genes in L15 is related to the stress induced by the expression of the transgene or to direct regulatory effect of  VviERF045. The lipid composition of leaf samples was analyzed to further understand the observed alterations at the cuticular level. Six lipid compounds belonging to the classes of fatty acids, sterols, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids appeared significantly modulated ( Figure   6A). The steroid-like lanosterol was at a higher concentration in WT and diminished in transgenic lines proportionally to  VviERF045 expression ( Figure   6A). Lanosterol is known to be a component of the tomato cuticular waxes. In the  lcer6 mutant, an increase of lanosterol together with other sterols and triterpenic cycles, was accompanied by a proportional decrease in long chain alkanes ( Leide et al., 2007). This result is in line with the down-regulation in L15 of a squalene monoxigenase ( VIT_00s0441g00020), involved in the oxidation of squalene to squalene epoxide, the precursor for lanosterol biosynthesis ( Figure   6B). AP2-containing TFs can be either activators or repressors depending on the effect on transcription of specific target genes. Transcriptional repressors are further classified as active or passive repressors: active repressors contain a repression domain (RD), which allows these proteins to actively prevent transcription of a target gene; passive repressors do not have an RD and suppress transcription by competing with transcriptional activators for binding to the target sequence ( Licausi et al., 2013).  VviERF045 can not be classified as an active repressor because its sequence does not display a RD. The cuticular phenotype of the lines, as revealed by microscopical investigation, as well as the negative regulation of the cuticle- and wax-related genes in L15, are similar to those reported for  SHINE silenced lines of  Arabidopsis and tomato, indicating  VviERF045 as a potential passive repressor. In particular VviERF045 might negatively regulate  VviERF042 encoded by VIT_09s0002g06750 and VviERF044 encoded by VIT_04s0008g05440, which are down-regulated in L15 (Supplementary Table  S4). Interestingly,  VviERF042 and  VviERF044 are the putative horthologues of the  Arabidopsis SHINE1 and  SHINE3 genes, whose silencing leads to a decrease in cutin load and to changes in cell wall structure ( Shi et al., 2011) similar to the ones observed in the transgenic lines of this study. The only two genes of the wax biosynthetic pathway which resulted up-regulated in L15 were  VIT_02s0012g02500 and  VIT_15s0046g00490, encoding for a putative stearoyl-acyl carrier protein-desaturase (S-ACP-DES) and a putative wax synthase/diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (WSD1), respectively ( Figure   6A). In plants, S-ACP-DESs tune the ratio of saturated to monounsaturated FAs ( Kachroo et al., 2007). In  Arabidopsis, WSD1 is responsible for the esterification of VLC primary alcohols to long chain wax esthers using C16 FAs as substrates ( Li et al., 2008). VviERF045 Is a Berry-Specific Transcription Factor Induced at Ripening and Closely Related to the ERFs from the SHINE-Clade AT5G25190 was reported to be induced by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and salt ( Zhang et al., 2011) as well as by drought ( Huang et al., 2008), but it was shown that its overexpression does not lead to a typical leaf  shine phenotype ( Aharoni et al., 2004).  SlERF1 overexpression leads to several phenotypic effects including ethylene triple response on etiolated seedling, leaf development, enhanced fruit ripening and softening ( Li et al., 2007) and improved tolerance to drought stress ( Lu et al., 2010). Expression analysis via RT-qPCR showed that  VviERF045 is highly expressed in fruit at 10 WAA, while its expression is much lower in other tissues such as root, stem, leaf, bud, flower and green berry ( Figure   1A). During berry development  VviERF045 expression raises starting from 7 WAA and peaks 2–3 weeks later, about at the end of the véraison period, ( Figure   1B) at which time,  VviERF045 expression is more pronounced in skin and pulp rather than seed ( Figure   1C). These observations suggest that  VviERF045 might play a regulatory role in the berry ripening process. Although several members of the ethylene response factor family are ethylene inducible ( Pirrello et al., 2012), berries treated around véraison (7, 8, and 9 WAA) with 1-MCP or etephon showed no significant differences in the expression of  VviERF045 compared with the control ( Figure   1D). However, our study could not exclude that treatments done in a pre-véraison stage could have led to the same results. Former phylogenetic analysis assigned VviERF045 to clade V of the ten clades identified for the 122 grapevine members of the ERF superfamily ( Licausi et al., 2010). In this study we have made a more focused analysis comparing VviERF045 and other VviERFs from cladeV to 15 highly similar and previously characterized ERF protein sequences from  Prunus salicina, Arabidopsis thaliana, and  Solanum lycopersicum ( Figure   1E). Our phylogenetic tree highlights that the seven ERFs related to fruit development and ripening in  Prunus salicina ( El-Sharkawy et al., 2009) cluster apart from the other ERF sequences. On the other side, VviERF045 and its homologs from tomato and  Arabidopsis fall into a single clade together with VviERF046 and VviERF047. Interestingly, one subgroup into this clade contains exclusively wax biosynthesis genes whose overexpression results in a glossy leaf phenotype and increased drought tolerance: AT1G15360 (SHN1), AT5G11190 (SHN2), and AT5G25390 (SHN3) from  Arabidopsis, and SlSHN1 and SlSHN3 from tomato ( Tournier et al., 2003;  Aharoni et al., 2004;  Shi et al., 2013). They share a high degree of similarity since in addition to the conserved AP2 domain they display two other conserved motifs located in the middle and the C-terminus of the protein sequence (‘mm’ and ‘cm’;  Aharoni et al., 2004). The remaining three sequences, which comprise VviERF045, SlERF1, and the  Arabidopsis AT5G25190, form a distinct subgroup within clade V that distinguishes itself most notably by a deletion of six and one amino acid(s) in the ‘mm’ and ‘cm’ domains, respectively ( Figure   1F).","During grape ripening, numerous transcriptional and metabolic changes are required in order to obtain colored, sweet, and flavored berries. There is evidence that ethylene, together with other signals, plays an important role in triggering the onset of ripening. Here, we report the functional characterization of a berry-specific Ethylene Responsive Factor (ERF),  VviERF045 , which is induced just before véraison and peaks at ripening. Phylogenetic analysis revealed it is close to the SHINE clade of ERFs, factors involved in the regulation of wax biosynthesis and cuticle morphology. Transgenic grapevines lines overexpressing  VviERF045  were obtained,  in vitro  propagated, phenotypically characterized, and analyzed for the content of specific classes of metabolites. The effect of  VviERF045  was correlated with the level of transgene expression, with high-expressing lines showing stunted growth, discolored and smaller leaves, and a lower level of chlorophylls and carotenoids. One line with intermediate expression, L15, was characterized at the transcriptomic level and showed 573 differentially expressed genes compared to wild type plants. Microscopy and gene expression analyses point toward a major role of  VviERF045  in epidermis patterning by acting on waxes and cuticle. They also indicate that  VviERF045  affects phenolic secondary metabolism and induces a reaction resembling a plant immune response with modulation of receptor like-kinases and pathogen related genes. These results suggest also a possible role of this transcription factor in berry ripening, likely related to changes in epidermis and cuticle of the berry, cell expansion, a decrease in photosynthetic capacity, and the activation of several defense related genes as well as from the phenylpropanoid metabolism. All these processes occur in the berry during ripening."," 'Vitis vinifera', 'Wax', 'ERF', 'VOCs', 'Rna-seq', 'Over-expressing Transgenic Lines' "," 'Supplementary Figure', 'Supplementary Table', 'Figure', 'VIT', 'transgenic lines', 'Supplementary', 'genes', 'Berry ripening', 'lines', 'Ripening' "," McCARTHY, VviERF045, endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, VIT_06s0004g04860, VIT_06s0004g07970, polygalacturonase PG1, pectinesterase (, post-véraison, Farmahan, 1977), VESPUCCI, WT, auxin, HomeoBox TFs, auxin, Böttcher, VviERF042, VviERF093, VviERF111, VviERF120, véraison, PRs, PRs, VviERF045, VviERF045, SHYNE clade, b, VviERF045, ER, CO 2, Kasulin, WOX4, pro-cambium, ER, Uchida, L7, 25–30, L6, °, bright green surface, L7, L22, auxin, VIT_03s0017g02110, VIT_16s0022g01970, VIT_11s0052g01560, VIT_11s0052g01540, VIT_07s0031g00750, VIT_00s0225g00080, VIT_11s0052g01500 Supplementary, Petronilho, VIT_16s0039g01240, VIT_16s0039g01280, VIT_16s0039g01300, VIT_16s0039g01360, L6 ( Vanholme et, cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenases, peroxidases, COP1-INTERACTING PROTEIN 7, CIP7, véraison, VIT_08s0058g00410, VIT_08s0058g00430, VIT_08s0058g00440, L19, PA, Hammerbacher, ‘, ’, protein kinase, naringerin-chalcone synthase, WT, endopeptidase, FAs, VIT_01s0011g03490, VIT_16s0050g00830, CER1, acyl-transferase, PRT6, cytochrome P450, CYP86A, ω-hydroxylase, FAs, MIDCHAIN, MAH1, VIT_18s0041g02160, VIT_18s0086g00220, Chepyshko, cutin ester oligomers, INDUCER1/SHINE1, WAX1/SHN1, cuticle-, epidermis-associated, P450s, GSDL-type, ACYLTRANSFERASES, ACYL_CoA, CER1, lipoxygenase, VIT_06s0004g01470, esterase  , VIT_00s0253g00090, JA, VIT_00s0441g00020, cuticle-, wax-related, VIT_09s0002g06750, VviERF044, SHINE1, stearoyl-acyl, protein-desaturase (, S-ACP-DES, synthase/diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, WSD1, S-ACP-DESs, FAs, WSD1, green berry (, 2–3, véraison (7, VviERF045, VviERF045, VviERFs from cladeV, VviERF045, VviERF047, AT1G15360, SHN1, AT5G11190, SHN2, AT5G25390, SHN3, SlSHN1, SlSHN3, AP2, ‘, ’, ‘, ’, VviERF045, SlERF1, AT5G25190, ‘, ’, ‘, ’ ",  ,  , 'lycopersicum' ,terpene synthase
79,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC5495837/eupmc_result.json,PMC5495837,"Results The Volatile Profile of Tomato Leaves Altered Differentially upon Infection with Both  Pseudomonas syringae Strains In order to distinguish the defense metabolites associated with each plant–pathogen interaction, the two infections were independently analyzed. The volatile content of the mock-inoculated RG- Pto tomato plants was compared with that of the RG- Pto-infected one with either avirulent strain  Pst DC3000 (Supplementary Figure  S1) or virulent strain  Pst DC3000 Δ avrPto/Δ avrPtoB (Supplementary Figure  S2). In these PLS analyses, a marked separation between the infected and mock plants was clearly observed by PC2. In both cases, the loading plot revealed a specific set of VOCs that strongly contributed to the separation of samples according to the specific plant–bacterial infection.  Figure   5 shows a hierarchically clustered heat map, including the most discriminative compounds by comparing the volatile profile of the tomato plants infected with the avirulent or virulent Pst strains with the control plants (column 1 and column 2, respectively). In order to examine the VOCs involved in the tomato–pathogen interactions, changes in the levels of these metabolites in the RG- Pto tomato plants, which were either mock-inoculated or infected with avirulent strain  Pst DC3000 or virulent  Pst DC3000 Δ avrPto/Δ avrPtoB, were analyzed by GC-MS in the leaves infected between 10 and 48 hpi (see Materials and Methods).  Table   1 lists the VOCs detected on our HS-SPME/GC-MS platform for the mock and infected RG- Pto tomato plants. In all, 73 compounds were identified: 11 esters (9 aliphatic and 2 aromatic), 20 aldehydes (16 aliphatic, 3 aromatic and 1 norcarotenoid), 13 alcohols (6 aliphatic, 1 norcarotenoid, 5 monoterpenic, and 1 sesquiterpenic), 9 monoterpene hydrocarbons, 8 ketones (5 aliphatic, 1 aromatic, and 2 norcarotenoid), 3 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, 2 furans, 2 nitriles, 4 aliphatic acids, and 1 aromatic hydrocarbon. They were all unequivocally confirmed by using pure standards, except for three of them, which were tentatively identified based on their mass spectra similarity (match > 900). To manage the large amount of mass data, a multivariate data analysis was performed that consisted in a PLS analysis, where compound abundance was assigned to the X variable, and harvesting time (10, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hpi) and type of infection (mock, compatible, and incompatible interaction) were defined as stepwise Y variables. The PLS analysis ( Figure   4) showed that the first component (PC1) explained changes in the chemical composition during the experiment (harvesting time), while the metabolic alteration due to bacterial infection was clearly characterized by the second component (PC2).  Figure   4 also displays the over-emitted metabolites in both infected plants, which were identified by the loading plot analysis. As expected, the VOCs from the non-infected plants were chemically similar within 48 h of the experiment. However, the plants infected with both bacterial strains showed an evident variation in their metabolic profile compared to the mock plants. This indicated that VOCs emission was independent of symptomatology. However, no clear separation between the virulent and avirulent infections was observed in this PLS score plot. These defense compounds, induced by both infection types, derive from three important plant metabolic pathways: fatty acids, terpenoids and benzenoids. Among them, the most prominent VOCs produced upon both bacterial infections (red in columns 1 and 2) were some esters of ( Z)-3-hexenol, such as ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, ( Z)-3-hexenyl propionate, ( Z)-3-hexenyl isobutyrate, ( Z)-3-hexenyl butyrate, some hydroxylated monoterpenes (HMT), such as linalool, α-terpineol, both ( Z)- and ( E)- isomers of linalool oxide, and an unidentified sesquiterpene. The statistical analyses showed that their differential induction was significant (Supplementary Table  S2). Regarding benzenoids emission, an increase in the production of methyl salicylate (MeSA), salicylaldehyde, and ethyl salicylate was also observed in both infections. The accumulation of the VOCs that derived from salicylate was consistent with the SA accumulation detected in the compatible interaction since levels of these phenolic derivatives were also higher in this virulent infection ( Figure   2). RG- Pto Tomato Plants Infected Either with the Avirulent or Virulent Bacterial Strain Displayed Noticeable Symptom Differences Symptoms development of the tomato plants infected with either avirulent strain  Pst DC3000 or virulent  Pst DC3000 Δ avrPto/Δ avrPtoB is shown in  Figure   1. These symptoms ranged on a 0–4 scale as follows: symptomless (0), weak (1), moderate (2), severe (3), and very severe (4). Inoculation of the RG- Pto tomato plants with the virulent strain resulted in chlorotic lesions appearing by 18 hpi, which displayed a symptom degree from (0) to (1). These initial lesions increased in intensity and size, and caused significant leaf damage that ranged from (2) to (3) at 24 and 36 hpi, respectively. By 48 hpi, necrotic lesions extended to the total area, and leaves lost their firmness and completely collapsed, which was the maximum level of symptomatology (4). Strong epinasty was observed in the leaves of these symptomatic tomato plants. In contrast, no symptoms (0) were observed at any time on the RG- Pto tomato plants inoculated with avirulent strain  Pst DC3000 due to  Pto-avrPto/avrPtoB recognition and ETI establishment. Therefore, these immunized tomato leaves were similar to the mock-inoculated plants. Comparison of the VOCs Profiles of Tomato Leaves upon Infection with Virulent and Avirulent  Pseudomonas syringae Strains Unraveled a Specific Volatile Response for ETI Interestingly, we identified a set of volatiles that were significantly over-emitted by tomato plants when effectively resisting disease (green-colored in column 3 of  Figure   5). Among them, several HMT, such as linalool, α-terpineol, 4-terpineol, ( Z) and ( E)-linalool oxides, HMT-1, HMT-2, HMT-3, and HMT-4, as well as the esters ( Z)-3-hexenyl propionate, ( Z)-3-hexenyl butyrate and ( Z)-3-hexenyl isobutyrate, were found. The induction of these compounds is mentioned above (when comparing the volatile profiles of the resistant plants with their corresponding mock-inoculated plants; Supplementary Figure  S1). The specific over-emission of these green leaf volatiles (GLVs) esters and HMTs during ETI suggests that these VOCs could participate in the defense response. In order to identify whether a specific set of volatile metabolites was involved in the establishment of effective defense such as ETI, another PLS analysis was performed by comparing the VOCs emitted from the tomato plants infected with avirulent strain  Pst DC3000 and with virulent strain  Pst DC3000 Δ avrPto/Δ avrPtoB ( Figure   6). Once again, the second component clearly showed the different set of volatile compounds emitted by the plant that underwent either a compatible or an incompatible interaction during the 48 hpi period. This metabolomic approach allowed us to identify the differentially induced VOCs in each infection type, by using the loading plot analysis. The hierarchically clustered heat map shows the VOCs that were differentially emitted by the tomato plants infected with virulent Pst strains compared with the avirulent infection ( Figure   5, column 3). Most VOCs, which were over-emitted by tomato plants during the establishment of the ETI triggered by the avirulent strain (green-colored), showed significant differences compared with the symptomatic infection (Supplementary Table  S2). The specific VOCs differentially released from the symptomatic tomato plants (virulent/avirulent ratio > 1; Supplementary Table  S2) were an unidentified sesquiterpene, SA derivatives methyl salicylate and salicylaldehyde, monoterpenes α-pinene, α-phellandrene, β-phellandrene and limonene, as well as two isoprenoid chlorides. The strong induction of the SA derivatives was previously observed when comparing the volatile profiles of these susceptible plants to their corresponding mock-inoculated plants (Supplementary Figure  S2). This study also revealed enhanced emission of monoterpenes after infection with virulent strain  Pst DC3000 Δ avrPto/Δ avrPtoB. As a result of these untargeted metabolomic analyses, we conclude that the infected tomato plants emitted quantitatively different volatiles depending on each type of bacterial strain used in this experiment. Monoterpenes and SA derivatives were released at higher rates by the symptomatic plants upon successful bacterial infection, while HMT and hexenyl esters were differentially over-emitted during ETI establishment, which led to resistance. Levels of Salicylic Acid, Gentisic Acid, and Ethylene Were Enhanced in the RG- Pto Tomato Plants Infected with the Virulent Bacterial Strain, While Jasmonic Acid Drastically Lowered In contrast, the JA levels drastically lowered during virulent infection, and almost non-detectable values were displayed at 10 hpi. Regarding avirulent infection, JA production remained unaltered compared to the mock-inoculated tomato plants. A similar tendency was observed at 24 hpi ( Figure   3B). The levels of the signaling defense molecules, SA, GA, ET, and JA were analyzed in the plants infected with both virulent and avirulent strains in a time-course study.  Figure   2 shows the significant GA induction that occurred in all the inoculated plants that bore both interactions. The increased amount of GA was already evident in tomato plants at 10 hpi. Leaf GA accumulation increased as bacterial infection progressed, and the highest levels peaked at 48 hpi (45 nmol/g FW) in the symptomatic tomato plant leaves. By 24 hpi, a significantly higher GA value was obtained in the compatible interaction compared to the incompatible infection. No remarkable increments in SA were observed in the  Pseudomonas-infected tomato plants at any time point, although differences in the SA levels started to become significant in the compatible interaction by 24 hpi. The evolution of ET from the leaves of both the compatible and incompatible tomato interactions was also measured. A dramatic increase in the production of this stress hormone was detected in the compatible interaction, which paralleled GA accumulation and appearance of symptoms ( Figure   3A). Maximum ET production (188 nL/gFW/h) was reached at 18 hpi, which coincided with the onset of symptom development. These high levels of ET (up to 10-fold) could explain the strong epinasty observed in the tomato plants infected with the virulent bacteria. Remarkably during this compatible infection, ET biosynthesis was higher than that observed in the incompatible interaction, and was significantly elevated at any time point. Regarding infection with the avirulent bacteria, the differences in ET emission between the infected and mock-inoculated plants was only significant at 24, 36, and 48 hpi. Bacterial Infection Induces the Specific Expression of the Genes Involved in VOCs Biosynthesis Terpene synthases (TPS) catalyze the synthesis of mono-, sesqui- and diterpenes, and are responsible for the diversity of the isoprene compounds found in nature ( Degenhardt et al., 2009). There are 44 TPS genes in  Solanum lycopersicum, 29 of which are potentially functional ( Falara et al., 2011). By qRT-PCR, we observed a significant induction of  TPS5, also known as  MTS1 ( Figure   7D), in the immunized tomato plants, which peaked at 18 hpi. This gene induction correlated with the production of several HMTs, such as linalool or α-terpineol (Supplementary Table  S3B). To study whether differential volatile production was due to transcriptional activation, we analyzed the expression levels of several key genes involved in the VOC biosynthesis by qRT-PCR. The results of the mock-inoculated RG- Pto tomato plants and the plants infected with  Pst DC3000 or  Pst DC3000 Δ avrPto/Δ avrPtoB at 10, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hpi are shown in  Figure   7. We used the induction of the tomato Pathogenesis-Related  PR1 gene as a positive control of bacterial infection, and observed a correlation of the expression of this gene and symptom development ( Figure   7A). GLVs esters are known to be synthesized by 13-lipoxygenases (13-LOX) via 13-hydroperoxides, which are later cleaved by 13-hydroperoxide lyases (13-HPL) into ( Z)-3-hexenal. This last compound is reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Finally, ester formation is catalyzed by alcohol acyl transferases (AAT) ( Scala et al., 2013a). In tomato, six genes that encode various types of lipoxygenases (TomloxA-F) have been described ( Mariutto et al., 2011).  TomloxC, TomloxD, and  TomloxF encode 13-LOX lipoxygenases, and are involved in the synthesis of oxylipins, which play an important role in the response to biotic stress. Tomlox D lipoxygenase participates in the synthesis of JA, while Tomlox C and Tomlox F are involved in the biosynthesis of GLVs. As  Figure   7B shows, a significant induction of  TomloxF was detected upon bacterial infection with both strains at all the studied time points, and this induction was greater when ETI had been established. Regarding alcohol acyltransferases, five  AAT genes (SlAAT1 - 5) have been identified in tomato ( Goulet et al., 2015). We observed that the induction of  AAT1 followed a similar pattern to that of  TomloxF ( Figure   7C). These induction patterns statistically correlated with the emission of the GLV esters (Supplementary Table  S3A) in both infections, and became higher during ETI establishment. Therefore, these data are consistent with the VOCs metabolomic analysis, and suggest a possible role of the biosynthesis of GLV esters in plant defense against bacteria.","Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants are secondary metabolites that mediate the plant interaction with pathogens and herbivores. These compounds may perform direct defensive functions, i.e., acting as antioxidant, antibacterial, or antifungal agents, or indirectly by signaling the activation of the plant's defensive responses. Using a non-targeted GC-MS metabolomics approach, we identified the profile of the VOCs associated with the differential immune response of the Rio Grande tomato leaves infected with either virulent or avirulent strains of  Pseudomonas syringae  DC3000 pv.  tomato . The VOC profile of the tomato leaves infected with avirulent bacteria is characterized by esters of (Z)-3-hexenol with acetic, propionic, isobutyric or butyric acids, and several hydroxylated monoterpenes, e.g., linalool, α-terpineol, and 4-terpineol, which defines the profile of an immunized plant response. In contrast, the same tomato cultivar infected with the virulent bacteria strain produced a VOC profile characterized by monoterpenes and SA derivatives. Interestingly, the differential VOCs emission correlated statistically with the induction of the genes involved in their biosynthetic pathway. Our results extend plant defense system knowledge and suggest the possibility for generating plants engineered to over-produce these VOCs as a complementary strategy for resistance."," 'Bacteria', 'Tomato', 'Metabolomics', 'VOCs', 'Defense' "," 'tomato plants', 'plants', 'strain Pst', 'Pto tomato', 'Tomato', 'plants infected', 'Figure', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Infection', 'Pst' "," PC2, avrPtoB, PC2, Z)-3-hexenol, HMT, α-terpineol, Z)-, E)- isomers, avrPtoB, 0–4, HMT, α-terpineol, E)-linalool, HMT-1, HMT-2, HMT-3, HMT-4, HMTs, mock-inoculated plants, avrPtoB., HMT, SA, GA, ET, JA, GA, GA, GA, SA, SA, GA, HMTs, α-terpineol, avrPtoB, alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH, alcohol acyl, AAT, TomloxA-F, TomloxD, Tomlox D lipoxygenase, JA, Tomlox C, GLVs, alcohol acyltransferases, SlAAT1 - 5 "," '(TPS)', 'TPS', 'TPS5,' ",  ," 'lycopersicum,' ",terpene synthase
80,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC3492160/eupmc_result.json,PMC3492160,"Results Evolutionary analysis To analyze evolutionary relationships and patterns of sequence evolution in  SlGOMTs and  SdOMTs sequences, we retrieved a total of 92 plant OMT sequences from NCBI (Additional file  2: Table S1) following the criteria described in the methods section. These sequences were combined with our  SlGOMTs and  SdOMTs sequences to construct a Bayesian inference phylogeny. All identified  Silene sequences formed a separate clade and showed distant relationships with  M. truncatula isoflavone7-O-methyltransferase ( IOMT) gene. A maximum likelihood-based analysis of synonymous versus non-synonymous mutations was performed to test for the signature of selection. Our analysis revealed strong evidence for positive selection (ω = 2.38;  p = 0.0017) along the branch leading to  SlGOMT1 and  SlGOMT2, whereas no evidence for positive selection was found along the branch to  SdOMT1 and  SdOMT2 (Additional file  3: Table S2). Purifying selection was found along the branch linking the  SlGOMT and  SdOMT sequences (ω =0.14;  p = 0.0032; Figure  6). Gene expression analysis To ascertain whether  SlGOMT genes are differentially expressed between flowers and leaves in  S. latifolia, qRT-PCR analyses were performed (Table  3). Our results show that  SlGOMT genes are preferentially expressed in floral tissue, whereas no expression was detected in leaf tissues (Table  3, data is not shown for leaf tissue in this table). Surprisingly, there was no significant difference found in  SlGOMT gene expression in flowers collected during day and night (Z = −0.680,  p = 0.529). However,  SlGOMT expression is significantly (3–4 folds) higher in males than in females during day and night (Z = −3.250,  p = 0.001). Veratrole emission Veratrole emission from both female and male flowers was 50–77 orders of magnitude higher during the night than during the day (Z = −3.321,  p = 0.001; Table  3). As expected, there was no veratrole emission detected from leaf tissue, indicating that veratrole is a flower-specific compound (leaf volatile data is not shown in Table  3). However, there was no significant difference in veratrole emission for male and female flowers (Z = 0,  p = 1). Biochemical characterization of SlGOMTs and SdOMTs SlGOMTs and SdOMTs were expressed in  E. coli and the proteins tested for methylation activity with guaiacol, the presumed substrate of veratrole, as well as orcinol, the substrate of OOMT, eugenol, the substrate of EOMT, and catechol, a compound recently shown to be the substrate of a methyltransferase in tomato, which converts it to guaiacol   47 . Methyleugenol, which has no hydroxyl groups that could be methylated, was used as a control (Table  1). SlGOMT1 exhibited preferred activity with guaiacol and was efficiently able to methylate guaiacol to veratrole (Figures  3,  4,  5 & Additional file  1: Figure S4), with a K m value for guaiacol of 9.8 μM (Table  2). SlGOMT2 had low levels of activity with several substrates, including guaiacol (Table  1) and a K m value for guaiacol, 501 μM, that is 51-fold higher than that of SlGOMT1 (Table  2), resulting an enzyme that is 31-fold less efficient with guaiacol than SlGOMT1 (Table  2). SdOMT1 and SdOMT2 did not methylate any of these tested substrates.  Isolation and characterization of GOMT and GOMT-like cDNAs A search of the EST database constructed from  S. latifolia flowers (Gupta et al. in prep) for sequences homologous to known  O-methyltransferases identified ESTs, and the sequence information in these ESTs led to the isolation of two coding cDNA sequences of 1,059 bp that we designated as SlGOMT1 and SlGOMT2. These sequences encode peptide sequences of 353 amino acids and the molecular mass of both purified SlGOMT proteins was approximately 37 kD on SDS-PAGE, similar to other plant-based methyltransferases   29  (Figures  1). SlGOMT1 and SlGOMT2 were nearly identical with the exception of two nucleotides differences that result in one amino acid difference at position 74. This weak divergence suggests that the two sequences correspond to different alleles of the same locus. An alignment of the deduced SlGOMT1 and SlGOMT2 protein sequences with other characterized protein sequences is shown in Figure  2. The comparison of deduced amino acid sequences between SlGOMTs (SlGOMT1 and SlGOMT2) and biochemically characterized OMTs of other plants revealed the 54–55% identity with orcinol OMTs from  Rosa hybrida  43  and 54% identity with resveratrol OMT from  Vitis  35 . Further Blast searches also showed 45% identity with  Ocimum eugenol OMT   42  and 31% identity with  Solanum catechol OMT   47 . Based on primers designated for SlGOMT1 and SlGOMT2, we were also able to obtain two GOMT-like coding cDNAs of 1,062 bp long from RNA extracted from  S. dioica flowers and we designated them SdOMT1 and SdOMT2. These both sequences shared 89–90% identity with SlGOMT1 and SlGOMT2. "," Background Silene latifolia and its pollinator, the noctuid moth Hadena bicruris, represent an open nursery pollination system wherein floral volatiles, especially veratrole (1, 2-dimethoxybenzene), lilac aldehydes, and phenylacetaldehyde are of key importance for floral signaling. Despite the important role of floral scent in ensuring reproductive success in S. latifolia, the molecular basis of scent biosynthesis in this species has not yet been investigated. Results We isolated two full-length cDNAs from S. latifolia that show similarity to rose orcinol O-methyltransferase. Biochemical analysis showed that both S. latifolia guaiacol O-methyltransferase1 (SlGOMT1) &S. latifolia guaiacol O-methyltransferase2 (SlGOMT2) encode proteins that catalyze the methylation of guaiacol to form veratrole. A large Km value difference between SlGOMT1 (~10 μM) and SlGOMT2 (~501 μM) resulted that SlGOMT1 is 31-fold more catalytically efficient than SlGOMT2. qRT-PCR expression analysis showed that the SlGOMT genes are specifically expressed in flowers and male S. latifolia flowers had 3- to 4-folds higher level of GOMT gene transcripts than female flower tissues. Two related cDNAs, S. dioica O-methyltransferase1 (SdOMT1) and S. dioica O-methyltransferase2 (SdOMT2), were also obtained from the sister species Silene dioica, but the proteins they encode did not methylate guaiacol, consistent with the lack of veratrole emission in the flowers of this species. Our evolutionary analysis uncovered that SlGOMT1 and SlGOMT2 genes evolved under positive selection, whereas SdOMT1 and SdOMT2 genes show no evidence for selection. Conclusions Altogether, we report the identification and functional characterization of the gene, SlGOMT1 that efficiently catalyzes veratrole formation, whereas another copy of this gene with only one amino acid difference, SlGOMT2 was found to be less efficient for veratrole synthesis in S. latifolia.",NaN," 'Table', 'analyze evolutionary', 'sequences', 'evolutionary relationships', 'Additional file', 'Evolutionary analysis', 'Evolutionary', 'Results Evolutionary', 'Veratrole', 'SlGOMT' "," ω , ω, −3.321, flower-specific, OOMT, K m, K m, μM, GOMT, GOMT-like cDNAs, ESTs, plant-based methyltransferases   29 , OMTs, OMTs, hybrida  43 , GOMT-like, 89–90 ",  ," 'S.', 'S.', 'S.'

81,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6707142/eupmc_result.json,PMC6707142,"Results Improving titers and enabling downstream oxidation steps Using the NPP-specific synthases developed here, we were able to harvest the orthogonal pathway established to produce monoterpenes with considerably higher efficiency than only with the GPP-dependent pathway. In shake-flask batch cultivation of strain MIC2 expressing the Erg20p(N127W)- SlNPPS1 fusion, the  ClLimS(H570Y)-supported limonene titer reached 130 mg L −1, while  SpSabS(H561F) enabled the production of 72.7 mg L −1 sabinene (Supplementary Table  8). Furthermore, the engineered synthases were quite efficient in harvesting NPP, leading to a significant reduction in nerol production from excess NPP (Supplementary Table  8). Engineering efficient monoterpene scaffold production in yeast is of particular interest because yeast cells offer an advantage over prokaryotic hosts for the functional expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are required for the synthesis of more complex monoterpenoids. So far, low monoterpene titers have hindered efficient P450 catalyzed oxidation of monoterpenes by a yeast cell factory. We evaluated whether the overall improvements obtained here were sufficient to enable downstream oxidation steps by introducing the sabinene hydroxylase CYP750B1 45 from  T. plicata, together with a compatible cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase 38,  46, to establish production of  trans-sabin-3-ol. While production of  trans-sabin-3-ol was not detectable when only the GPP pathway was used, we were able to synthesize detectable amounts of  trans-sabin-3-ol in the NPP-producing MIC2 strain using wild-type  SpSabS. The levels of  trans-sabin-3-ol increased three times when the NPP-specific  SpSabS(H561F) variant was used instead of  SpSabS (Fig.  5f; Supplementary Fig.  14). Establishing efficient NPP biosynthesis in yeast cells A cDNA fragment encoding  SlNPPS1 was cloned into the yeast vector pHTDHmyc under the P TDH3 constitutive promoter and expressed in strain AM94. To monitor NPP synthesis, we also introduced yeast codon-optimized versions of three different NPP-specific monoterpene synthases,  Solanum lycopersicum phellandrene synthase ( SlPHS1) 28,  Solanum habrochaites limonene synthase ( ShLimS) 30, and  S. habrochaites pinene synthase ( ShPinS) 30. When expressed in yeast in the absence of  SlNPPS1, no new products were detected, as none of the three monoterpene synthases were able to utilize the available GPP. However, upon  SlNPPS1 co-expression, all three synthases produced their reported NPP-derived products. Specifically,  SlPHS1 produced  β-phellandrene (48.6%), δ-2-carene (36.6%), α-phellandrene (8.3%), and α-terpinene (6.5%).  ShLimS produced limonene as a single product, and  ShPinS produced α-pinene (84%) and limonene (16%) (Fig.  2a). Product titers in all cases were very low, ranging from 0.009 mg L −1 α-pinene to 0.16 mg L −1β-phellandrene (Supplementary Table  2). Furthermore, we observed that AM94 cells engineered to express  SlNPPS1 in the absence of any monoterpene synthase produced detectable levels of nerol, as confirmed by comparison of mass spectra and retention time with an authentic standard (Fig.  2b). By analogy to the formation of geraniol via the hydrolysis of GPP by intracellular phosphatases like Lpp1p and Dpp1p 14,  34, we attributed the production of nerol to the hydrolysis of NPP that accumulated in the absence of a suitable terpene synthase. Taken together, these results confirmed that the alternative substrate, NPP, is synthesized in the engineered yeast strain and it can be used to produce monoterpenes. To ensure that NPP can form the basis for an orthogonal pathway, we confirmed that it did not interfere with the rest of the yeast isoprenoid metabolism. With a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we confirmed that NPP was not taken up by Erg20p to produce larger prenyl diphosphates. We expressed Erg20p in  Escherichia coli and used the purified protein (Supplementary Fig.  4) in in vitro assays with GPP and NPP. Although the recombinant enzyme was able to produce FPP from IPP and GPP, it was not able to catalyze elongation of NPP. We were also unable to detect any NPP-derived products of Erg20p in yeast cells or in yeast cell extracts supplemented with NPP and IPP (Supplementary Fig.  5). We also confirmed that the growth properties of  SlNPPS1-expressing yeast cells were very similar to their empty vector-containing counterparts (Supplementary Fig.  6). Dynamic regulation of the orthogonal pathway The metabolic valve created at the point of DMAPP and IPP condensation can be dynamically controlled to divert fluxes towards NPP in response to internal metabolite levels. A key metabolite in our system is ergosterol, the main yeast sterol. To minimize flux to the sterol branch when adequate levels of ergosterol were synthesized, we implemented a dynamic design based on the promoter of the  ERG1 gene. Expression of  ERG1 is negatively regulated by ergosterol via an ergosterol-responsive regulatory element in its promoter (P ERG1) 47. A similar design was previously exploited to improve production of the sesquiterpene amorpha-4,11-diene by controlling  ERG948, and of the diterpene casbene by controlling both the  ERG9 and  ERG20 genes 49. To dynamically regulate FPP synthesis in response to ergosterol levels in our system, we replaced the promoter of  ERG20 in strain MIC2 with an 807 bp region of P ERG1 that contains the ergosterol-responsive element to give rise to strain MIC3. Using the engineered NPP-specific synthases and strain MIC3, we were able to produce monoterpenes with considerably higher efficiency than with the native GPP-based pathway. In semi-batch shake-flask cultivation,  ClLimS(H570Y)-supported limonene titer in MIC3 strain reached 166 mg L −1, which is 6.8-times higher than the titer obtained in GPP-only producing MIC2 cells with wild-type  ClLimS (Fig.  5e and Table  2). Similarly, with  SpSabS(H561F), we obtained 113 mg L −1 sabinene under dynamic regulation (MIC3), which was 7.1 times higher than the highest titer obtained in MIC2 by the native pathway and  SpSabS (Fig.  5e and Table  3). Redirecting flux to the orthogonal pathway Previous studies had shown that fusion of a heterologous enzyme to Erg20p can be beneficial for the enzyme’s stability 37–  39. We fused  SlNPPS1 to the C terminus of Erg20p(N127W) and confirmed that the fused protein reached higher intracellular levels compared with the non-fused  SlNPPS1 (Supplementary Fig.  7). We subsequently introduced the Erg20p(N127W)– SlNPPS1 variant into strain MIC2 to achieve an additional 1.4–2-fold improvement in production. The combination of these interventions resulted in an overall 12–18-fold increase, reaching 2.7 mg L −1 β-phellandrene, 2.5 mg L −1 limonene, and 0.11 mg L −1 α-pinene (Fig.  2c and Supplementary Table  2). Following these improvements, a significant amount of nerol could be detected in the NPP-producing cells overexpressing  ShLimS,  ShPinS, or  SlPHS1 (Fig.  2d and Supplementary Table  3). This suggested that the combination of these interventions achieved efficient synthesis of NPP, but utilization of the alternative substrate has reached a bottleneck at the level of the monoterpene synthases that resulted in its accumulation and eventual conversion to nerol. The new branching point established for monoterpene biosynthesis could function as a valve to direct the flux of substrates away from FPP synthesis and to increase the monoterpene yield (Fig.  1). First, we aimed to decrease the competition for IPP by Erg20p. To achieve this, we introduced Erg20p(N127W), a dominant-negative Erg20p variant that inhibits the FPP synthesis step of the endogenous wild-type enzyme 14,  35. This resulted in a 3–4-fold increase (depending on the enzyme) in the total monoterpene yield of all three NPP-specific monoterpene synthases (Fig.  2c and Supplementary Table  2). Heterozygous gene deletions in yeast have been shown to decrease the level of the corresponding protein to 50% 36. Thus, to further reduce the flux through the FPP-synthesizing branch, we downregulated Erg20p by shifting to the yeast strain MIC2, which carries a deletion in one of the two  ERG20 alleles 14. This resulted in a further 1.9–2.8-fold increase in monoterpene titer (Fig.  2c and Supplementary Table  2). Canonical monoterpene synthases accept NPP as a substrate The canonical monoterpene synthases convert GPP and NPP to the same blend of products (Supplementary Fig.  8), not allowing to determine the relative contribution of the two substrates simply by examining the product profile. To resolve this, we synthesized  13C-labeled NPP (Supplementary Fig.  9), so as to distinguish the products of each substrate when mixtures of the labeled compound with unlabeled GPP were used. We added precursors to extracts of yeast cells expressing  ClLimS and determined the isotopic composition of the produced limonene using GC–APCI–QqToF analysis. In these experiments,  13C-NPP was initially shown to be channeled efficiently to limonene synthesis, while GPP was mostly consumed to produce FPP (Supplementary Figs.  10 and  11). In subsequent competition experiments between  13C-labeled NPP and GPP, when the two isomeric substrates were added at equal concentrations, over 90% of the limonene produced originated from  13C-NPP. The contribution of the two substrates to limonene production was comparable, only when GPP was in tenfold excess (Supplementary Fig.  12a). The accumulation of nerol indicated that the three NPP-specific synthases tested here could not harvest the full potential of the orthogonal pathway, and more efficient biocatalysts were required. However, only few NPP-specific synthases have been reported to date 28,  30,  40, limiting the possibility that a search to identify enzymes more active than the synthases used here would be successful. Furthermore, the product range of the known NPP-specific enzymes was limited to only four main products, β-phellandrene 28, limonene 30, α-pinene 30, and nerol 40. To identify enzymes that are more active and to enable the production of a broad range of different monoterpene scaffolds, we turned into the rich resource of canonical, GPP-converting, plant monoterpene synthases. We selected five synthases with different product profiles, including  ClLimS 33,  Salvia fruticosa 1,8-cineole synthase ( SfCinS1) 41,  Salvia pomifera sabinene synthase ( SpSabS) 41,  Pinus taeda α-pinene synthase ( PtPinS) 42, and  Solanum elaeagnifolium camphene synthase ( SeCamS) 43, and tested whether they can accept NPP as a substrate. When introduced to strain MIC2 expressing Erg20p(N127W), i.e., a GPP-synthesizing strain, all five enzymes produced their expected monoterpene products (Fig.  3). When Erg20p(N127W) was replaced by the Erg20p(N127W)– SlNPPS1 fusion to establish the production of NPP, an overall increase ranging between 1.3- and 2.8-fold (depending on the enzyme) in monoterpene formation compared with the GPP-only producing strain was achieved with all canonical monoterpene synthases (Fig.  3). This suggested that the canonical enzymes could accept both substrates, resulting in overall higher yields, and that the different enzymes had varying capacity to accept the isomeric substrate. We confirmed that the selected monoterpene synthases were able to utilize NPP in in vitro assays with bacterially expressed enzymes (Supplementary Figs.  4 and  8a). We also examined the product profile of the five enzymes with NPP in vitro and found that four of them synthesized almost the same blend of monoterpenes as with GPP. Only the profile of  SeCamS shifted from camphene toward limonene with NPP in vitro (Fig.  3e; Supplementary Fig.  8a), which was reflected in the product profile of NPP-producing yeast cells expressing  SeCamS (Supplementary Fig.  8b). There was no new monoterpene product with any of the synthases and NPP. Kinetic analysis of the reaction with each isomeric substrate revealed that the canonical synthases exhibited higher affinity and overall catalytic efficiency ( kcatapp/ KMapp) with GPP than with NPP ( SfCinS1: 0.213 min −1 μM −1 with GPP vs. 0.137 min −1 μM −1 with NPP;  ClLimS: 0.735 min −1 μM −1 with GPP vs. 0.456 min −1 μM −1 with NPP;  SeCamS: 0.21 min −1 μM −1 with GPP vs. 0.044 min −1 μM −1 with NPP; Table  1). Yet, the observation that yeast productivity with  ClLimS and  PtPinS when both the GPP and the NPP pathways were present was more than double, compared with when only the GPP pathway was active (Fig.  3), provided two main conclusions. First, it indicated that these terpene synthases were not the limiting step of the pathway. Second, the ability of  ClLimS and  PtPinS to support equal or higher titers with NPP, despite this not being their preferred substrate, suggested that the established NPP-based pathway was efficient and had the potential to exceed the GPP pathway in productivity. To further evaluate the performance of the NPP-based pathway, we examined the kinetic characteristics of  SlNPPS1 using in vitro assays with enzymes expressed and purified in  E. coli (Supplementary Fig.  4). The determined kinetic parameters revealed that  SlNPPS1 is significantly less efficient than Erg20p in utilizing DMAPP and IPP (Supplementary Table  4; refs.  14, 28). Combined with the preference of canonical terpene synthases for GPP rather than NPP (Table  1), we concluded that the observed increase in productivity is not due to favorable kinetics of the  SlNPPS1 branch. Comparison of the overall production titers revealed that  ClLimS and  PtPinS were 24 and 224 times more efficient, respectively, in limonene and α-pinene synthesis in NPP-producing yeast cells than their NPP-specific counterparts,  ShLimS and  ShPinS (Supplementary Table  5). Taken together, these findings confirmed that canonical monoterpene synthases can serve as efficient surrogate synthases in this synthetic pathway and suggested that canonical enzymes could offer a starting point for protein engineering efforts to improve NPP utilization. Engineering NPP-specific monoterpene synthases We explored whether residues analogous to F571 in the other canonical monoterpene synthases play a similarly critical role. Based on amino acid sequence alignment (Supplementary Fig.  13), candidate residues in the other monoterpene synthases were identified and substituted with aromatic or aliphatic side chains of different size using site-directed mutagenesis (Supplementary Table  7). As shown in Fig.  5, in all four enzymes tested, we were able to identify variants at this position that shift substrate selectivity to NPP. Specifically, in  ClLimS, all H570 variants showed higher preference for NPP than the wild-type enzyme in the yeast system (Fig.  5a, left panel). Among them,  ClLimS(H570Y) and  ClLimS(H570F) also achieved improved performance in NPP-based monoterpene production in yeast (Fig.  5a, right panel). In  ClLimS(H570Y), this was the result of a twofold improvement on the catalytic efficiency ( kcatapp/ KMapp) with NPP, which was mostly due to a lower  KMapp with NPP and a decreased  kcatapp with GPP (Table  1). In the case of  ClLimS(H570F), the higher overall productivity in the yeast system was the result of improved binding of both substrates.  ClLimS(H570I),  ClLimS(H570L), and  ClLimS(H570V) were even more specific for NPP (Fig.  5a, left panel), as manifested by an eightfold higher  kcatapp/ KMapp in  ClLimS(H570I) and a threefold higher  kcatapp/ KMapp in  ClLimS(H570L) (Table  1). However, the overall efficiency of these variants was low and could not sustain high-product titers (Fig.  5a, right panel; Table  1). We evaluated  ClLimS(H570Y) in competition experiments using yeast extracts and  13C-NPP.  ClLimS(H570Y) was markedly more efficient than wild-type  ClLimS in harvesting NPP fluxes, and even when GPP was present at a tenfold excess over  13C-NPP, over 75% of the products were derived from  13C-NPP (Supplementary Fig.  11b). To fully exploit the potential of the orthogonal pathway, we set out to engineer the selected canonical monoterpene synthases, with the aim to increase their efficiency and specificity for NPP. Initially, we focused on  SfCinS1 due to the availability of structural information and our previous experience in engineering this enzyme to alter its substrate and product specificity 41. In these efforts, we developed a library of 19 variants at different positions in the active site 39,  41. Here, we differentially screened this library in GPP- and NPP-producing yeast strains to identify sites that potentially influence substrate specificity. As shown in Fig.  4a, one site, F571, stood out as playing a critical role in selecting between the two isomeric substrates, as several variants at this position were able to markedly improve the performance of the enzyme with NPP. Variants  SfCinS1(F571V),  SfCinS1(F571Y), and  SfCinS1(F571I) were 18, 9, and 7 times more efficient, respectively, when the NPP pathway was present, compared with their performance with only GPP as a substrate (Fig.  4a). Although the catalytic efficiency of the variants was lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (Supplementary Table  6), these findings suggested that F571 may be acting as a switch that differentiates substrate preference between NPP and GPP. In addition to F571, certain substitutions in a second residue, N338, also resulted in shifts in specificity, albeit in a less efficient or consistent manner. Variants  SfCinS1(N338A) and  SfCinS1(N338S) exhibited an opposing substrate selectivity.  SfCinS1(N338A) became a strictly GPP-utilizing enzyme, while  SfCinS1(N338S) was 6.7 times more efficient when the NPP pathway was present (Fig.  4a). To test for potential synergistic effects, we also constructed several variants combining F571 substitutions with substitutions in the other positions (Supplementary Table  7). However, no further improvements in substrate specificity were observed (Fig.  4a). For further studies, we focused exclusively on the role of F571, because of the extent and consistency of specificity changes. Analysis of the structural information available for  SfCinS1 41 in the context of biochemical and structural studies on the enzymatic mechanism of monoterpene synthases 44 provided insight into the possible role of F571. As shown in Fig.  4b, the early steps of the canonical monoterpene synthase mechanism involve the initial binding of GPP in an extended conformation, followed by the ionization of the substrate and the syn migration of the diphosphate moiety to C-3. The resulting linalyl diphosphate (LPP) maintains the transoid conformation of GPP (Fig.  4b). Thus, for cyclization to take place, the C-2,3 bond must rotate to convert LPP from the transoid to the cisoid conformer. Subsequent conformational change of LPP to the closed configuration brings C-6 and C-1 to a position competent for cyclization. Following cyclization, the resulting carbocations rearrange to finally yield different hydrocarbons (Fig.  4b). Due to the cisoid conformation of NPP, its cyclization does not require the same transition from the transoid to the cisoid form (Fig.  4b). As shown in Fig.  4b, in the structure of  SfCinS1, F571 is positioned at a short distance from C-1 of LPP. This analysis suggested two possible explanations for the ability of F571 to control isomeric substrate selectivity. Considering the extensive conformational changes that are required for the substrate to transition from the transoid to the cisoid form (compare the structure of the two intermediate analogs in Fig.  4b), one scenario would be that F571 plays a direct role in this process. In this case, substitutions in F571 that impair the transoid to cisoid transition would have a negative impact in the GPP-based reaction, but would not interfere with the transition-independent NPP reaction. Alternatively, F571 may not be directly involved in the transition process; instead, the size and orientation of the side chain at position 571 may alter the geometry of the active site to favor binding of one substrate versus the other. To distinguish between these two mechanisms, we conducted a detailed kinetic analysis of  SfCinS1 mutants.  SfCinS1(F571V),  SfCinS1(F571Y), and  SfCinS1(F571L) showed shifts in  KMapp either favoring NPP binding or disfavoring binding of GPP (Table  1), suggesting that the residue at position 571 exerts stereochemical control. In agreement, the reverse behavior of  SfCinS1(F571H), which showed preference for GPP in vivo, was the result of a significant increase in  KMapp for NPP. In  SpSabS, substitution of H561 with F resulted in a highly efficient biocatalyst, with an almost threefold improved apparent specificity for NPP in yeast compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig.  5b, left panel) and an overall 2.5-fold improvement in performance when the NPP pathway was present (Fig.  5b; right panel). We were not able to obtain active recombinant  SpSabS(H561F) to determine the kinetic parameters underlying these improvements. In the case of  SeCamS, substitution of H583 resulted in drastic changes in specificity and activity. Variants  SeCamS(H583F) and  SeCamS(H583V) became limonene-synthesizing enzymes that exhibited three -times higher apparent selectivity for NPP compared to wild-type  SeCamS (Fig.  5c, left panel). These two variants improved overall NPP-based production in yeast by 11 and 9 times, respectively (Fig.  5c, right panel and Fig.  5e). Finally, in  PtPinS, four out of five variants of F607 switched specificity to NPP in the yeast system (Fig.  5d), nevertheless, with lower activity than the parental enzyme. Overall, these results revealed a conserved role for F571 in  SfCinS1, and the corresponding residues in the other synthases, in dictating substrate selectivity. The identification of such a key residue in the terpene synthase active site reveals fundamental mechanistic details of these enzymes and will be invaluable for future protein engineering efforts aiming to expand the synthetic pathway developed here with additional synthases. Justifying the construction of an orthogonal monoterpene pathway To justify the need for constructing an orthogonal pathway, we first confirmed that the low titers of monoterpene observed in previous efforts 14,  23 were not due to product toxicity, and that additional factors, such as pathway structure, may play an important role. We evaluated the growth of yeast cells engineered to provide high levels of isoprenoid precursors (strain AM94; Supplementary Table  1) under conditions that recapitulate production of specific titers of monoterpenes. In agreement with previous studies 31,  32, yeast cells grew equally well when supplemented with increasing monoterpene concentrations up to 500 mg L −1 (Supplementary Fig.  1), which was more than seven times higher than the current best-production titers 23. Subsequently, we introduced the  Citrus limon limonene synthase ( ClLimS) 33 into strain AM94 and confirmed that limonene productivity was not reduced, even when the culture was supplemented with a limonene concentration that was tenfold higher than the titer produced by the strain (Supplementary Fig.  2). To further corroborate previous evidence suggesting that the sequential reaction of Erg20p may be a contributing factor to low monoterpene productivity 14, we supplemented the cell extract of  ClLimS-expressing AM94 cells with isoprenoid precursors and measured the formation of limonene. Addition of GPP, in the presence of IPP and DMAPP, resulted in the production of low amounts of limonene and a significant larger amount of FPP (Supplementary Fig.  3). This suggested that most of the GPP precursor was used by Erg20p to synthesize FPP, and only a small amount of the GPP added was converted to limonene by  ClLimS (Supplementary Fig.  3). Further experiments using  13C-GPP confirmed that <10% of the  13C-GPP was converted to limonene under these conditions, and most of it was channeled to FPP. Therefore, Erg20p is very efficient in utilizing GPP, reducing the GPP pool and hindering monoterpene production. Thus, we set out to engineer an orthogonal pathway that does not depend on GPP.","Synthetic biology efforts for the production of valuable chemicals are frequently hindered by the structure and regulation of the native metabolic pathways of the chassis. This is particularly evident in the case of monoterpenoid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the canonical terpene precursor geranyl diphosphate is tightly coupled to the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds essential for yeast viability. Here, we establish a synthetic orthogonal monoterpenoid pathway based on an alternative precursor, neryl diphosphate. We identify structural determinants of isomeric substrate selectivity in monoterpene synthases and engineer five different enzymes to accept the alternative substrate with improved efficiency and specificity. We combine the engineered enzymes with dynamic regulation of metabolic flux to harness the potential of the orthogonal substrate and improve the production of industrially-relevant monoterpenes by several-fold compared to the canonical pathway. This approach highlights the introduction of synthetic metabolism as an effective strategy for high-value compound production.",NaN," 'Supplementary Fig.', 'Supplementary Table', 'Fig.', 'NPP', 'Supplementary', 'GPP', 'monoterpene synthases', 'Table', 'monoterpene', 'synthases' "," NPP-specific, GPP-dependent, MIC2, Erg20p(N127W)- SlNPPS1, −1, −1, cytochrome P450, P450, plicata, cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, NPP-producing MIC2, pHTDHmyc, TDH3, ShLimS, ShPinS, NPP-derived, α-pinene, −1, intracellular phosphatases like Lpp1p, Dpp1p 14, Erg20p, Erg20p, NPP-derived, Erg20p, DMAPP, sterol branch, ergosterol-responsive regulatory, MIC2, ERG1, MIC3, MIC3, GPP-based, MIC3, −1, 6.8-times, GPP-only, MIC2 cells, −1, MIC3, MIC2, Erg20p, C, Erg20p(N127W, Erg20p(N127W)– SlNPPS1, MIC2, 12–18-fold, −1, −1, −1 α-pinene, Erg20p, Erg20p(N127W, 3–4-fold, Erg20p, MIC2, 1.9–2.8-fold, GC–, NPP-specific, NPP-specific enzymes, α-pinene, α-pinene synthase, MIC2, Erg20p(N127W, GPP-synthesizing, Erg20p(N127W, Erg20p(N127W)– SlNPPS1, GPP-only, −1 μM −1, −1 μM −1, −1 μM −1, −1 μM −1, −1 μM −1, −1 μM −1, NPP-based, NPP-based, Erg20p, DMAPP, α-pinene, NPP-specific, H570, NPP (Fig.  , high-product, GPP-, NPP-producing yeast, GPP-based, H561, H583, NPP-based, 9, −1, Erg20p, DMAPP, Erg20p, Erg20p ",  ," 'SpSabS.', 'S.'

Trichomes of many plants in the nightshade family (Solanaceae) produce O-acylsugars, and in cultivated and wild tomatoes these are mixtures of aliphatic esters of sucrose and glucose of varying structures and quantities documented to contribute to insect defense. We characterized the first two enzymes of acylsucrose biosynthesis in the cultivated tomato Solanum lycopersicum. These are type I/IV trichome-expressed BAHD acyltransferases encoded by Solyc12g006330--or S. lycopersicum acylsucrose acyltransferase 1 (Sl-ASAT1)--and Solyc04g012020 (Sl-ASAT2). These enzymes were used--in concert with two previously identified BAHD acyltransferases--to reconstruct the entire cultivated tomato acylsucrose biosynthetic pathway in vitro using sucrose and acyl-CoA substrates. Comparative genomics and biochemical analysis of ASAT enzymes were combined with in vitro mutagenesis to identify amino acids that influence CoA ester substrate specificity and contribute to differences in types of acylsucroses that accumulate in cultivated and wild tomato species.

They contaminate food and feed stocks, resulting in potential harm to animals and human beings. Trichoderma brevicompactum and T. arundinaceum produce trichodermin and harzianum A (HA), respectively, two trichothecenes that show different bioactive properties. Both compounds have remarkable antibiotic and cytotoxic activities, but in addition, trichodermin is highly phytotoxic, while HA lacks this activity when analyzed in vivo. Analysis of Fusarium trichothecene intermediates led to the conclusion that most of them, with the exception of the hydrocarbon precursor trichodiene (TD), have a detectable phytotoxic activity which is not directly related to the structural complexity of the intermediate. In the present work, the HA intermediate 12,13-epoxytrichothec-9-ene (EPT) was produced by expression of the T. arundinaceum tri4 gene in a transgenic T. harzianum strain that already produces TD after transformation with the T. arundinaceum tri5 gene. Purified EPT did not show antifungal or phytotoxic activity, while purified HA showed both antifungal and phytotoxic activities. However, the use of the transgenic T. harzianum tri4 strain induced a downregulation of defense-related genes in tomato plants and also downregulated plant genes involved in fungal root colonization. The production of EPT by the transgenic tri4 strain raised levels of erg1 expression and reduced squalene accumulation while not affecting levels of ergosterol.

84,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6976640/eupmc_result.json,PMC6976640,"Results Tempo-spatial expression patterns of  TPS genes in different tea organs qRT-PCR was performed to validate the expression patterns of  CsTPS genes using some of putatively functional genes in Table  1. Significantly distinct transcript levels of  CsTPS01, and - 2 were found in young leaves (YL) compared to the corresponding levels in flowers using qPCR methods. Higher transcript levels of  CsTPS22 and - 23 were found in mature leaves (ML) than in both flower buds (F1) and open flowers (F2). Similarly, higher transcript levels of  CsTPS43, - 76, and - 77 were also found in leaves than in flowers. However, for  CsTPS29, - 78, and - 79, higher transcript levels were noted in flowers compared to those in leaves (Fig.  3D). It is interesting to note that  CsTPS29 was exclusively expressed in flowers. All these quantitative analysis results obtained using qRT-PCR were well consistent with the transcriptomic data (Fig.  3A–C). Gene annotation indicates that  CsTPS01 and - 02 likely encoded sesquiterpene synthases and that  CsTPS76- 79 were annotated as difunctional  CsTPS genes, among which  CsTPS76 has been proved as linalool synthase and nerolidol synthase 33. To learn the tempo-spatial expression patterns of tea  TPS genes, transcriptome datasets from eight organs of tea plants (i.e. apical buds, young leaves, mature leaves, old leaves, stem, flowers, fruit and roots) (tpia.teaplant.org) were employed (Supplementary Table  S6). Logarithm value (Log 10) of transcripts per million (TPM) of each annotated tea  TPS transcript was obtained. Results indicated that  TPS genes had distinct tempo-spatial expression patterns (Fig.  3). Seventeen genes, particularly  CsTPS17, - 59, - 69, - 70, and - 71, were substantially expressed in all the tested organs with a few exceptions such as  CsTPS22, - 23, - 43, - 58 and - 76 with undetectable levels in one or two organs (Fig.  3A). On the contrary the majority of  TPS genes that exhibited distinct tempo-spatial expression patterns. Six genes ( CsTPS25, - 26, - 40, - 56, - 62, and -63) were solely and another 11 genes ( TPS02, - 06, - 07, - 11, - 12, - 14, - 18, - 20, - 49, - 53, and - 57) were predominantly expressed in leaves (Fig.  3B); another eight ( CsTPS08, - 28 ~ - 32, - 35, and - 36) and three (- 21, - 78, and -79) were almost exclusively and primarily expressed in flowers (Fig.  3C). In addition, eight genes ( CsTPS09, - 10, - 13, - 16, - 27, - 33, - 65 and - 73) had no detectable or trace transcript levels in all the tested organs, all of which belonged to the third group of putatively non-functional  TPS genes except for  CsTPS73 (Supplementary Fig.  S2 and Table  S5). Interestingly, 38  TPS genes expressed with substantial levels either in flowers or leaves were annotated as sesquiterpene synthases genes, while monoterpenoid synthase genes largely with low transcription levels were only seven ( CsTPS40, - 43, - 45, - 46, - 49, - 60, - 62, and - 63). These mono- TPS genes were restricted to be expressed in vegetative organs except for  CsTPS43, - 46 and - 49 which also expressed in flowers. TPS gene expression under abiotic stress conditions Under cold acclimation (between 10 °C to 4 °C) for 7 days, more  CsTPS genes (24) were suppressed than the number of enhanced genes (9) (Fig.  5B). compared to the non-acclimated controls, transcript suppression ranged from 1.4- to 32.3-fold with an average suppression 11.8-fold. The most severely suppressed was  CsTPS78, followed by  CsTPS11(28.4-fold) and  CsTPS46 (26.4-fold). On the contrary, expression enhancement for another 9  CsTPS genes ranged from 1.3- to 37.8-fold with the average of 12.6-fold. The maximal enhancement occurred to  CsTPS43, followed by  CsTPS35 (23-fold) and  CsTPS16 (19.5-fold) (Fig.  5B). Tea plants are often subjected to drought, salinity, cold and other stress conditions most likely they are generally grown in mountainous regions with shallow soils, thereby possibly affecting the production of terpenoids as responding to stress conditions 7,  22,  33. Hence, transcriptome data were employed to investigate the expression alterations of tea  TPS genes responding to the treatments of stress or stress signal molecule methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Furthermore, PEG treatment for a certain period to simulate drought treatment 41 also resulted in the suppression of 20  TPS genes in the range from 1.3- to 324.7-fold, with the average of 36.8-fold. The most dramatically suppressed gene expression occurred to  CsTPS03, followed by  CsTPS59 (151.2-fold) and  CsTPS02 (142.9-fold). Six genes were PEG enhanced with the most notably enhancement occurred to  CsTPS74 (48.3-fold), followed by  CsTPS75 (17.9-fold) 24 hr after the treatment (Fig.  5D). Further validation of the transcriptomic analysis result was conducted using qRT-PCR approach with some  CsTPS genes and GS-MS quantification of volatile terpenoid abundance in tea leaves treated with MeJA or salinity (Fig.  6). Our qRT-PCR results confirmed the salinity suppression and MeJA induction of  CsTPS genes ( CsTPS03, - 43, - 51, -57, - 76, - 77, and - 79) ( p < 0.05), well consistent with transcriptomic data (Fig.  6A). Moreover, salinity stress resulted in a significant abundance reduction in linalool and its three oxides and nerol ( p < 0.05). Geraniol was slightly decreased ( p > 0.05) due to salinity treatment. Nevertheless, an increase ( p < 0.05) in linalool, nerol, geraniol, and nerolidol was induced by MeJA (Fig.  6B). Neophytadiene, a putatively identified diterpene volatile, was also increased by both MeJA and salinity treatments. It was interesting to note that the amounts of linalool, geraniol and nerolidol in leaves were increased by 192%, 318% and 232%, respectively (Fig.  6B). MeJA treatment differentially regulated  CsTPS gene expression (Fig.  5). Compared to nontreated control, 12 hr after MeJA treatment, 12  CsTPS genes were suppressed in the range from 1.3- to 542.3-fold, the highest for  CsTPS46 and the lowest for  CsTPS61, with the average suppression of 59.0-fold (Fig.  5A). The suppression of gene expression was alleviated for 11  CsTPS genes 24 hr after the treatment, except for  CsTPS17, whose expression was further suppressed from 45.0-fold (12 hr after the treatment) to 457.7-fold (24 hr after the treatment). The majority of the suppressed genes were recovered 48 hr after the treatment. On the contrary, 12 hr after the treatment 27  CsTPS genes were enhanced in the range from 1.2- to 94.2-fold, the highest for  CsTPS48 and the lowest for  CsTPS78, with the average enhancement of 13.2-fold (Fig.  5A). Time course study indicated enhanced expression of many  CsTPS genes declined 24 hr after the treatment, except for  CsTPS03, - 07, - 51, - 52, - 54, and - 55, whose expression levels were further enhanced. Whereas the MeJA enhanced expression for almost all the  CsTPS genes was recovered back to non-treated control levels 48 hr after the treatment. It was interesting to note that across all the four different treatments three genes ( CsTPS67, - 69, and - 70 in red and bold) were all suppressed while  CsTPS22 (in red and bold) was enhanced (Fig.  5). Moreover, out of 20  CsTPS genes suppressed by salinity, 17 were also suppressed by PEG-induced drought (in dark red) and 15 were suppressed by cold acclimation (in blue). In addition, some genes (in green) shared the same suppression or induction alteration among two or three different treatments, suggesting that some genes responded to the abiotic stresses in the similar ways. Salinity stress primarily led to varying expression reduction of 20  CsTPS genes in the range from 1.4- to 47.6-fold 24 hr after the treatment. The most severely suppression was found for  CsTPS02, followed by  CsTPS54 (43.6-fold) and  CsTPS51(36.2-fold). Time-course study revealed that the suppression was alleviated as the time proceeded after the treatment. Eight  CsTPS genes were slightly salt stress induced. The most dramatically enhanced was  CsTPS22 (11.6-fold), followed by  CsTPS68 (9.2-fold), all occurred 72 hr after salinity treatment (Fig.  5C). Identification of  TPS gene members in tea genomes To retrieve tea  TPS genes from recently publicized tea genome databases, the PF01397 and PF03936 domains, representing respectively N-terminal and C-terminal domains of TPS, were used. Those genes contained one or two domains of PF01397 and PF03936 were retrieved as tea  TPS candidate genes from CSS and CSA genomes, meanwhile manual curation and validation of these  TPS gene candidates were performed using each candidate genes as query to do BLASTP against the database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). A total of 80 and 60  TPS-like genes were found in CSS “Shu-Cha-Zao” (Supplementary Table  S2) and CSA “Yunkang10” genomes (Supplementary Table  S3), respectively.  TPS genes from two tea genomes were found highly conserved in cDNA sequence with identity ranging from 77% to 100% but with varying sequence coverages. No  TPS genes with identical sequences were found from the two genomes. Compared to the corresponding  TPS homologues in CSS “Shu-Cha-Zao”, eight TPS genes from CSA “Yunkang 10” (highlighted in Supplementary Table  S3) were found containing similar protein sequence length (90–110%), high identity at both cDNA and protein levels (>90%). However, 31 and 13  TPS genes respectively from CSA “Yunkang10” and “Shu-Cha-Zao” had incomplete protein sequences with less than 200 amino acid residues, all lacking either Pfam domain PF01397 or PF03936 (Supplementary Tables  S2, S3). For further analysis,  TPS gene models from the CSS genome assembly was employed. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using 48  CsTPSs (the remaining  CsTPS genes were too short for meaningful alignment) and another 22 documented  TPS from different plant species, indicating that tea  TPS genes belongs to six subfamilies from TPS-a to TPS-g, but without TPS-d based on their protein sequences (Fig.  2). The TPS-a gene family in tea was the most expanded, with 36 genes, approximately 45% of the total  TPS genes identified. This is in accordance with other plant species, including grape,  Arabidopsis, and rice 24. TPS-b gene subfamily as the second largest, included 30, about 37.5% of the total tea TPS genes. For the remaining  TPS subgroups, only one gene encoding copalyl diphosphate synthase representing the TPS- c subgroup, eight representing the TPS- e/ f subgroup, and five genes representing the TPS-g subgroups, respectively, were also identified (Supplementary Table  S2). We designated these gene models of CSS genome as  TPS1 through  TPS80 according to the order of their subfamilies. Terpenoid profiling in tea leaves and flowers On the contrary, compared to 17 and 11 sesqui- and mono-terpenoids respectively detected, reduced numbers of emitted monoterpenoids (11) and sesquiterpenoids (2) in addition to a diterpene (neophytadiene) were detected from leaves and flowers, probably attributing to some terpenoids that is not readily emitted or unstable (Fig.  4C). It is interesting to note that emitted linalool from homogenized flowers was significantly higher than that from homogenized leaves ( p < 0.01) while the opposite was found for geraniol. Either organic extraction analysis or emitted terpenoids analysis, linalool and geraniol were no doubt as the most abundant monoterpenoids in tea plants. It was clear that  CsTPS77-79 are responsible for the linalool biosynthesis. However, the key enzyme involved in geraniol biosynthesis in tea plants is still unknown. It was obvious that transcription regulation is crucial for terpenoid production in plants 7,  22. Intact tea leaves usually do not release any perceivable volatiles, but they contain significant amount of terpenoid volatile precursors, which contribute to the aroma formation of made teas 11. On the contrary, tea flowers have a great potential to be utilized because of their abundant functional molecules such as saponins, polysaccharides, aromatic compounds and functional proteins 42 and emit substantial volatiles, including terpenoid compounds 16. Therefore, terpenoid profiling in tea leaves and flowers combined with  CsTPS transcriptomic analysis may reveal the association between  CsTPS gene expression and their chemical products, which could be helpful for further  CsTPS gene functional characterization. In the present study, the abundance of the internal volatile terpenoids and emitted volatile terpenoids (collectively from free and hydrolyzed glycosides) from tea leaves and flowers were analyzed by GC-MS. In total, seventeen monoterpenes and eleven sesquiterpene compounds were identified from tea leaves and flowers (Fig.  4A,B). The total abundance of all monoterpenes extracted from flowers was lower than that from leaves and almost all the monoterpenes detected from leaves were more than their counterparts in flowers, except for linalool, lavandulol and α-terpineol. Linalool and its oxides were the most abundant among all the monoterpenoids, followed by geraniol, two accounting for 66% and 76% of the total monoterpenoid amounts in tea leaves and flowers, respectively (Fig.  4A). However, the total abundances of internal sesquiterpenoids and emitted terpenoids in flowers were higher than those in leaves ( p < 0.01) (Fig.  4B,C). α-Farnesene was the most abundant sesquiterpene detected from flowers, contributing to approximately 70% of the total amount of sesquiterpenoids in tea flowers, while nerolidol is the most abundant sesquiterpene in leaves, contributing to 38% of total sesquiterpenoids abundance.  CsTPS51- 56, were annotated as putative α-farnesene synthase according to BLASTP results (Supplementary Table  S2). Nevertheless, their transcription only found in leaves (Supplementary Fig.  S2), indicated that abundant emission of α-farnesene in flower might be depended on other  TPS genes, such as  CsTPS28- 32. Another possibility could not be excluded that the function of these  CsTPS genes could be wrong. Furthermore, all sesquiterpenoids were mainly generated from flowers, rather than leaves, except for nerolidol (Fig.  4B). As above the gene expression patterns analysis, sesquiterpenoids were abundant in flowers than leaves mainly attributed to the higher accumulation of their transcripts in tea flowers. Putatively functional  TPS genes The third type of tea  TPS genes (48 members) with incomplete sequences contained no expected gene structures (i.e. intron-exon structure, open reading frames), compared to other plant species. The sequences of these  TPS genes could not be validated using full transcriptomic data or RNA-seq data. Thus, these type of the  TPS genes might not be functional, even though some of their incomplete sequences could be resulted from imperfect sequencing technique or transposon insertions (Supplementary Table  S5). For assessment of the tea  TPS gene functions, full-length transcriptome sequencing data 37,  38 were employed to verify the putative functional  TPS genes obtained from tea genome. Sequence similarity comparison between the full-length transcripts of  TPS and genome assembly were conducted using BLAST with a threshold E-value < 1e-5 and identity >98%. After series of BLAST using the nucleotide sequence and manual evaluation, 80 tea  TPS genes divided into three types: putative functional  TPS genes with full coding sequences and complete structures (23 members); full-length coding  TPS genes with disordered structure (9 members); and partial  TPS genes (48 members), respectively (Supplementary Table  S4). The first type of tea  TPS genes had 23 members and all had an uncompromised open reading frame in either transcriptomic or genomic data (Table  1). Thus, they were most likely functional.  CsTPS57, CsTPS76, and  CsTPS78 have been proved as active ocimene synthase, bifunctional linalool/nerolidol synthases and nerolidol synthase, respectively 33,  34,  39. Another 20  TPS genes possessed full-length coding sequences either revealed by transcriptome data or genome assembly. These genes also possessed the intron-exon structure, i.e. seven exons for TPS-a, TPS-b, and TPS-g and 13 to 15 exons for TPS-e/f and TPS-c. Moreover, these genes contain the specific protein features of  TPS gene family, such as the ‘DDXXD’ and ‘NSE/DTE’ motifs (Supplementary Table  S4), which are important for metal dependent ionization of the prenyl diphosphate substrate in the C-terminal domain 23,  40,  41. Out of these 20  TPS genes, 5, 11, and 2 were annotated as monoterpene, sesquiterpene and diterpene synthase genes in addition to 3 bifunctional  TPS genes (mono- and sesqui-terpene synthase genes) (Table  1). The functions of the second type of 9  TPS genes were uncertain because full-length transcripts were not found or with low identity between the two sequence sources (the full-length transcriptomic data and genome assembly). In addition, their gene structures in genome assembly exhibited alterations in different extents compared to common structures of functional  TPS genes, likely resulting in non-function or malfunction. For instance,  CsTPS24, -37, - 41, - 67 had one or more retrotransposon segment inserts, leading to disturbed gene structures. In particular,  CsTPS67 encoding a copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), harboring three retrotransposons with a total of 13,296 bp in length in the first intron (Supplementary Fig.  S1), probably leading to failure of gene transcription. Even though it was unknown whether its transcription could occur regularly, Although the active domain ‘DXDD’ still present in its protein structure, 89 amino acids sequences in N-terminal is lost compared to  CPS genes of other plant species identified. The  TPS genes of this group were annotated as mono-, sesqui-, and di-terpene synthase genes (4, 4, and 2, respectively) according to manual BLASTP homologue searches.","For a better understanding terpenoid volatile production in Camellia sinensis, global terpenoid synthase gene (TPS) transcription analysis was conducted based on transcriptomic data combined with terpenoid metabolic profiling under different abiotic stress conditions. Totally 80 TPS-like genes were identified. Twenty-three CsTPS genes possessed a complete coding sequence and most likely were functional. The remaining 57 in the currently available database lack essential gene structure or full-length transcripts. Distinct tempo-spatial expression patterns of CsTPS genes were found in tea plants. 17 genes were substantially expressed in all the tested organs with a few exceptions. The other 17 were predominantly expressed in leaves whereas additional eight were primarily expressed in flowers. Under the treatments of cold acclimation, salt and polyethylene glycol, CsTPS67, -69 and -71 were all suppressed and the inhibited expression of many others were found in multiple stress treatments. However, methyl jasmonate resulted in the enhanced expression of the majority of CsTPS genes. These transcription data were largely validated using qPCR. Moreover, volatile terpenoid profiling with leaves, flowers and stress-treated plants revealed a general association between the abundances of mono- and sesqui-terpenoids and some CsTPS genes. These results provide vital information for future studies on CsTPS regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis.",NaN," 'TPS genes', 'TPS', 'tea TPS', 'genes', 'TPS gene', 'Fig.', 'Supplementary Table', 'CsTPS genes', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'tea' "," - 2, CsTPS08, CsTPS09, monoterpenoid synthase, 32.3-fold, Tea, stress signal molecule methyl jasmonate, 324.7-fold, 36.8-fold, 142.9-fold, CsTPS03, p , p , 542.3-fold, 59.0-fold (Fig.  , 457.7-fold (24 , 94.2-fold, CsTPS67, - 70, 47.6-fold 24 , 43.6-fold, PF03936, “Shu-Cha-Zao”, CSA “Yunkang10”, “Shu-Cha-Zao”, “Yunkang, ”, 90–110, “Shu-Cha-Zao”, TPS-g, copalyl diphosphate synthase, c, e/ f, mono-terpenoids, α-terpineol, C, RNA-seq, CsTPS76, TPS-b, TPS-g, ‘DDXXD, ‘NSE/DTE, prenyl diphosphate, sesqui-terpene synthase genes, CPS, di-terpene synthase "," 'TPS', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS01,', 'CsTPS22', 'CsTPS43,', 'CsTPS29,', 'CsTPS29', 'CsTPS01', 'CsTPS76-', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS76', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CsTPS17,', 'CsTPS22,', 'TPS', 'CsTPS25,', 'TPS02,', 'CsTPS08,', 'CsTPS09,', 'TPS', 'CsTPS73', 'TPS', 'CsTPS40,', 'TPS', 'CsTPS43,', 'TPS', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS78,', 'CsTPS11(28.4-fold)', 'CsTPS46', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS43,', 'CsTPS35', 'CsTPS16', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CsTPS03,', 'CsTPS59', 'CsTPS02', 'CsTPS74', 'CsTPS75', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS03,', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS46', 'CsTPS61,', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS17,', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS48', 'CsTPS78,', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS03,', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS67,', 'CsTPS22', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS02,', 'CsTPS54', 'CsTPS51(36.2-fold).', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS22', 'CsTPS68', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-like', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CsTPSs', 'CsTPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-g,', 'TPS-d', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-', 'TPS-', 'TPS-g', 'TPS1', 'TPS80', 'CsTPS77-79', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS51-', 'TPS', 'CsTPS28-', 'CsTPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CsTPS57,', 'CsTPS76,', 'CsTPS78', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-e/f', 'TPS-c.', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CsTPS24,', 'CsTPS67', 'TPS' ", 'GC-MS.' ,  ,terpene synthase
85,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC6930893/eupmc_result.json,PMC6930893,"Results Tomato Protection Against  Fusarium oxysporum and  Rhizoctonia solani Using Dual Inoculations Tomato plants infected with the pathogen  F. oxysporum (Fol) showed typical symptoms as leaf yellowing, necrotized vessels, wilting, and death (as described in van der Does et al.,  2019). On average, fresh weights of  Fusarium-treated plants were always reduced in comparison with mock-inoculated plants, although it was statistically significant uniquely for plants single-inoculated with P9-64 ( Figure 5B). The extent of disease progression (i.e., yellowing, brown bundles, wilting) seemed to be alleviated when the plants were treated with the beneficial fungus  S. indica but it was not statistically significant. Only during combined treatments of  S. indica+P1-18 and  S. indica+P9-22, the level of disease progression was significantly reduced ( Figure 5A). Furthermore, single inoculation of P9-22 significantly reduced Fol symptoms to the same extent as the combination  S. indica+P9-22. Concerning the experiments with  Rhizoctonia, the effect of seedlings germinated and alive was regularly monitored up to 111 days. The effects of the damping-off caused by  Rhizoctonia first appeared 7 days after planting (dap), affecting only treatments in which  S. indica was not inoculated ( Figure 5C). Seedlings inoculated with  S. indica as well as combinations of  S. indica + bacteria were not affected by the pathogen until 11 dap. In contrast, single inoculation of  Mycolicibacterium P1-5 accelerated the damping off caused by  Rhizoctonia and the number of seedlings alive was significantly decreased 25 dap in comparison to  Rhizoctonia control. In general, inoculation of seedlings with  S. indica conferred resistance against the pathogen, but uniquely dual inoculations of  S. indica + bacteria significantly maintained the number of seedlings alive for all the measurements from 18 to 111 dap, in comparison to  Rhizoctonia control. The combinations of  S. indica+P1-18 (at 73 dap) and  S. indica+P9-64 (at 73 and 111 dap) further significantly increased the number of plants alive in comparisons to single inoculation of  S. indica. Screening of Bacterial Strains for Further Experiments Since  Mycobacteriaceae was the family that contains more strains stimulating fungal growth, four isolates of the genus  Mycolicibacterium (P1-5, P1-18, P9-22, and P9-64) recovered from potato roots were selected for further experiments. These isolates strongly stimulated  S. indica growth when co-cultured on PDA and after 4 days of bacterial pre-culture ( Figure 2A). The four isolates further stimulated  S. indica growth on different growing media (PDA+NA) and bacterial growth phase (9 days preculture) ( Supplementary Figure 3), except for P9-22 that did not significantly increase fungal growth on PDA+NA. To rule out the hypothesis that the stimulating effect of bacteria on fungal growth is due to stressed hyphae running away from the bacterium, we further confronted  S. indica with the selected isolates, but growing on different zones of the Petri dish. Concomitantly,  S. indica growth was also stimulated when the bacteria were streaked few centimeters away from the fungus ( Figure 2B). Interaction Between  S. indica and Bacteria The most abundant families showing a positive interaction were  Mycobacteriaceae (22.67% of the total positive strains),  Rhizobiaceae (13.33%),  Xanthomonadaceae (10.67%),  Paenibacillaceae (10.67%), and  Rhodanobacteraceae (9.33%). Considering the type of interaction within a family, every strain of  Xanthomonadaceae, and 17 out of 19 for  Mycobacteriaceae stimulated  S. indica growth. At the genus level, several strains classified as  Achromobacter and  Sphingomonas were further positive for  S. indica growth, although some others were just neutral. From the whole assemblage of bacteria co-cultured  in vitro with  S. indica, similar number of strains were found in each type of interaction. Twenty percentage of the total strains were completely inhibitory, 26% negative, 28% neutral, and 26% positive for  S. indica growth ( Figure 1C), revealing that  S. indica must coexist with antagonistic microbes, but also with synergistic ones, during the process of root colonization by the fungus. Bacillaceae, Enterobacteraceae, and  Burkholderiaceae were the most detrimental families for  S. indica growth ( Figure 1C). All the strains from  Enterobacteriaceae displayed an inhibitory or negative interaction with the beneficial fungus. Similar results were obtained with members of  Bacillaceae, especially strains of  B. subtilis, B. pumilus, B. velezensis, and  B. thuringiensis, although strains of  B. simplex displayed a neutral effect to  S. indica growth. In the  Burkholderiaceae family, all the strains of  Burkholderia completely inhibited  S. indica growth or were strongly negative, while one strain of  Paraburkholderia displayed positive interactions ( Supplementary Figure 2D). Likewise, the great majority of  Leifsonia, Rathayibacter, and  Pseudomonas (95%) strains showed an inhibitory or negative interaction with  S. indica. Genome Analysis Genes and Proteins Related to Stress Tolerance The four genomes encode genes implicated in protection against diverse stresses ( Table 4 and  Supplementary Table 4), and this protection may indirectly lead to growth promotion (Liu et al.,  2016). We further found genes involved in resistance to heavy metals and metalloids including cobalt, zinc, cadmium, copper, arsenic, mercury, chromium, and selenite. We also identified numerous proteins and compounds that protect the cell from oxidative stress: peroxidases, catalases, hydroperoxide reductases, superoxide dismutases, glutathione S-transferases, and mycothiol (Newton et al.,  2008). The four genomes also encode domain proteins of rhodanese ( Supplementary Table 6), an enzyme that detoxifies cyanide (Cipollone et al.,  2008), and nitrilases and cyanide hydratases, enzymes with critical roles in plant-microbe interactions for defense, nitrogen utilization, detoxification, and synthesis of plant hormones (Howden and Preston,  2009). Strain P1-18 further contains genes involved in the synthesis of mycosporines ( Table 4), secondary metabolites considered to be amongst the strongest natural absorbers of UV radiation and with antioxidative capacities (Oren and Gunde-Cimerman,  2007). The four strains might potentially confer tolerance to salt stress as they possess several copies of the genes encoding choline dehydrogenase and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase ( Table 4 and  Supplementary Table 4), required to produce glycine betaine, one of the most important solutes to face osmolarity fluctuations (Nau-Wagner et al.,  2012). The genomes contain also several genes involved in trehalose biosynthesis, a sugar with a protective effect under salt and drought stress (Garg et al.,  2002). The strain P9-22 further harbors genes for ectoine ( Tables 4,  5), an osmolyte that helps organisms survive extreme osmotic stress (Bernard et al.,  1993). Complementarily, all strains also contain various K + transport and Na +/H + antiporters that contribute to resist hyperosmotic stress (Liu et al.,  2016). Genomic Features, ANI and Phylogeny of Sequenced Strains The genomes of the  Mycolicibacterium strains P1-5, P1-18, P9-22, and P9-64 have a total of 5.47, 6.70, 6.79, and 7.34 Mb with an average G+C content of 65.95, 68.74, 66.89, and 66.27%, respectively. No evidence of plasmids was ascertained. The analysis of antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes detected few genes ( Supplementary Table 1). In particular, strain P1-5 shows the presence of the  rbpA gene, that can confer resistance to rifampin, and the strains P1-18 and P9-64 harbor the gene  tet(V), possibly involved in tetracycline resistance. The genomic features of the four genomes are summarized in  Table 2. To determine the relatedness of the sequenced strains to genomes publicly available at the NCBI database, ANI was calculated with the BLAST algorithm (ANIb), and with tetranucleotide frequency correlation coefficients (TETRA). The maximum values of ANIb for the four sequenced genomes were only in the range of 80–90% ( Supplementary Table 2) and therefore the proposed threshold of ≈95% ANIb as the putative boundary for species circumscriptions was not reached (Konstantinidis and Tiedje,  2005; Richter and Rosselló-Móra,  2009). Contrarily, the TETRA values for the isolates P1-5 and P9-22 reached the 99% threshold ( Supplementary Table 2) required to support the species circumscription (Richter and Rosselló-Móra,  2009). However, since TETRA values > 99% should agree with ANIb > 95–96% (Richter and Rosselló-Móra,  2009), we did not assign species names to these isolates. The dendrogram computed with the distance matrix of pairwise ANI values showed two separated groups ( Figure 6). One group represents the clade of slow-growing mycobacteria designated as “ Tuberculosis-Simiae” and depicts the emended genus  Mycobacterium (Gupta et al.,  2018; Oren and Garrity,  2018). This group includes well-known human pathogens (Gupta et al.,  2018), most notably  Mycobacterium leprae and  Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causative agents of leprosy and tuberculosis, respectively (Magee and Ward,  2012; Lory,  2014). The second group, in which the four sequenced bacteria are included, encompasses species from the clade “ Fortuitum-Vaccae,” recently transferred to a new genus,  Mycolicibacterium gen. nov. (Oren and Garrity,  2018). Genes and Proteins Related to Plant Growth Promotion Traits The RAST annotation and the functional annotation of proteins based on the eggNOG protein database detected various genes related to plant growth promotion (PGP) traits. In the genomes of the strains P1-18, P9-22, and P9-64, we identified key genes attributable to well-known plant growth-promoting compounds like siderophore synthesis and receptors as well as siderophore-interacting proteins, auxin biosynthesis and acetoin and butanediol metabolism ( Table 4 and  Supplementary Table 4). Regarding strain P1-5, the antiSMASH analysis detected a secondary metabolite cluster identified as mycobactin ( Supplementary Table 5), a siderophore used by members of the genus  Mycobacterium to shuttle free extracellular iron ions into the cytoplasm (McMahon et al.,  2012). This cluster was also detected in the genomes of P9-22 and P9-64. The four genomes, and especially P9-64, contain also genes involved in phosphate solubilization ( Table 4 and  Supplementary Table 4). These genomes encode phosphatases and pyrroloquinoline quinone biosynthesis ( pqqE genes) that catalyzes the synthesis of gluconic acid, considered as one of the major organic acids responsible for mineral phosphate solubilization (Wagh et al.,  2014; Liu et al.,  2016). Phosphate solubilization was additionally confirmed  in vitro (data not shown). Furthermore, inorganic phosphate transport and uptake may be facilitated by low- and high-affinity phosphate transport systems, detected in these genomes. Similarly, iron is an essential nutrient for plant nutrition that is mainly absorbed by plants as ferrous iron (Morrissey and Guerinot,  2009). Genes coding for ferrous iron transporters are present in the four genomes analyzed, contributing to the provision of iron to the plants. Polyamines are phytohormone-like compounds with biological activity in processes like plant growth, development, and stress mitigation (Niemi et al.,  2002; Kuznetsov et al.,  2006). Furthermore, we identified several proteins involved in the transport and synthesis of the polyamines spermidine and putrescine in all genomes. Moreover, the strains P1-18 and P9-64 contain the gene  acdS for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase ( Supplementary Table 6), that enhances plant growth by lowering plant ethylene levels (Glick,  2014). Resistance to Antibiotics and Production of Antibiotic Compounds In addition, these bacteria contain genes encoding enzymes involved in the degradation of the fungal cell-wall, like β-hexosaminidases and chitooligosacharide deacetylases, which have been proved to degrade chitin and chitooligosaccharides (Barber and Ride,  1989; Zhao et al.,  2010). Furthermore, genes encoding chitinases are present in the genome of P1-5 ( Tables 4,  6) and these enzymes can potentially contribute to biocontrol of fungal pathogens by disruption of fungal cell walls (Whipps,  2001). Genes for antibiotic resistance may protect the plant against other pathogenic microbes. The four genomes encode the enzymes β-lactamases, that provide multi-resistance to β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins (Neu,  1969), genes involved in resistance to the bactericide fluoroquinolone, and genes encoding multidrug resistance proteins ( Table 4 and  Supplementary Table 6). P1-18 and P9-64 have genes involved in the degradation of oxalate, a compound secreted by fungi to promote their growth and colonization of substrates (Dutton and Evans,  1996), which might contribute to plant defense against pathogenic fungi. Similarly, we identified several genes involved in the production of antibiotics compounds ( Tables 4,  5 and  Supplementary Tables 4–6), including bacteriocins, clavulanic acid (Reading and Cole,  1977), aminoglycosides antibiotics (Davies and Wright,  1997) and type IV pili, a bacterial virulence mechanism that appears operational during pathogenesis of fungal hosts (Dörr et al.,  1998). Polyketides are secondary metabolites that have antimicrobial properties, including the mycotoxins produced by fungi (Huffman et al.,  2010). We identified in the four genomes several enzymes involved in the synthesis of polyketides ( Table 5 and  Supplementary Tables 5, 6). Among the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) characterized as polyketides synthases (PKS) by antiSMASH analysis, several have been identified as alkylresorcinols, phenolic lipids with the ability to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth (Stasiuk and Kozubek,  2010). Others BGCs characterized as PKS were identified as the antibiotics rifamycin, FK520 (ascomycin), ansamitocin and tetrocarcin A, and as the siderophore griseobactin (Patzer and Braun,  2010) ( Supplementary Table 5). However, the percentage of gene match was very low in comparison to their homologs BGCs, suggesting that these BGCs might encode novel antibiotic and siderophore biosynthetic pathways (de Los Santos-Villalobos et al.,  2018). Other antibiotic BGCs detected by antiSMASH with antifungal properties, although with low percentage of gene match, include galbonolides (Fauth et al.,  1986) identified in all the genomes, bacillomycin (Gu et al.,  2017) in the genomes of P9-22 and P9-64, angucycline Sch 47554 (Basnet et al.,  2006), pimaricin (Aparicio et al.,  2016) in P1-18, and fengycin (Vanittanakom et al.,  1986) in P1-5. We further identified proteins involved in the synthesis of phenazines ( Supplementary Table 6), heterocyclic compounds that have been shown to control a wide range of plant pathogenic fungi (Chin-A-Woeng et al.,  2003) and to elicit ISR (Pierson and Pierson,  2010). CAZy Analysis We identified roughly 140 putative genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) in each genome analyzed ( Table 7). CAZy were distributed unevenly among the six CAZy families and no enzymes belonged to the class polysaccharide lyases (PL). In the classes carbohydrate esterases (CE) and glycoside hydrolases (GH), we identified several plant cell-wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) related genes in all the genomes analyzed ( Table 6 and  Supplementary Table 7). The PCWDEs identified have the potential to degrade many plant cell-wall polymers, including cellulase, hemicellulose, pectin, and cutin. In addition, P1-18 encodes proteins involved in lignin degradation ( Supplementary Table 6). Many other genes related to enzymes involved in the degradation of different plant intracellular polysaccharides were detected ( Table 6), suggesting that the strains harbor traits for endophytic colonization. Genes and Proteins Predicted to Stimulate  S. Indica Growth Analysis of the genomes revealed the four  Mycolicibacterium strains contain numerous genes predicted to be involved in the stimulation of  S. indica growth. Some vitamins and cofactors are indispensable for fungal growth (van Overbeek and Saikkonen,  2016), and since some vitamins like cobalamin (B12) can only be synthesized by bacteria (Ghignone et al.,  2012; Danchin and Braham,  2017), we hypothesized that production of vitamins could be one of the key factors in the stimulation of fungal growth. We identified several genes involved in the synthesis of six vitamins of the vitamin B complex: cobalamin (B12), biotin (B7), thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), pyridoxin (B6), and folate (B9), as well as menaquinone and phylloquinone of the vitamin K complex in all the four genomes. Moreover, genes related to nitrogen metabolism such as those for nitrate and nitrite reductase, ammonification, ammonium transporters, and glutamine synthase were detected in all four genomes ( Table 3 and  Supplementary Table 3). In vitro Interaction Between Selected Bacterial Strains and Fungal Pathogens By  in vitro dual-culturing, the effect of selected  Mycolicibacterium strains on  Fusarium and  Rhizoctonia growth was studied. In contrast to the beneficial interaction observed between  S. indica and the selected  Mycolicibacterium strains, none of these bacteria stimulated  F. oxysporum growth. Interestingly, some strains significantly reduced hyphal growth respect to the control ( Supplementary Figure 4) under certain growth conditions. In the case of  Rhizoctonia solani, none of the four bacteria restrained fungal growth  in vitro. Contrarily, the strains P9-22 and P9-64 slightly stimulated fungal growth under certain growth conditions. Isolation and Identification of Bacteria In total, 479 isolates were recovered and identified at the genus level ( Table 1). The most abundant families of isolates were  Bacillaceae (21.09% of the total isolates),  Enterobacteriaceae (13.78%),  Rhizobiaceae (11.48%), and  Paenibacillaceae (10.02%) ( Table 1 and  Supplementary Figure 2A). At the genus level, the overall top five genera were  Bacillus (21.09% of isolates),  Enterobacter (13.57%),  Paenibacillus (8.56%),  Burkholderia (7.52%), and  Agrobacterium (6.05%). After de-replication with a 100% threshold, we obtained 260 different clusters (strains) with different 16S rRNA genes. The most abundant strains belonged to the families  Bacillaceae (17.31%),  Paenibacillaceae (15.0%),  Enterobacteriaceae (11.15%), and  Microbacteriaceae (9.23%). At the genus level, the most abundant strains belonged to  Bacillus (17.31%),  Paenibacillus (12.69%),  Enterobacter (10.77%), and  Mycolicibacterium (7.31%). Tomato roots were thinner than potato roots, thus fewer isolates were recovered from tomato plants (25.47% of the total isolates) using the sterilization procedure. After de-replication, only 15 strains were shared by tomato and potato plants ( Supplementary Figure 2B). The bacterial community isolated from potato plants differed considerably to the tomato plants ( Figure 1). Interestingly, strains belonging to  Enterobacteriaceae (overall top second family) were only found in potato roots. Abundances of bacterial taxa isolated from the same plant species, but under different treatment, were more similar. Nevertheless, there were some differences between control plants and plants inoculated with  S. indica ( Table 1 and  Figure 1A). Particularly, strains of the genus  Burkholderia (9 strains, 36 isolates) were only found in control plants of tomato and potato, or in plants inoculated at 10 2 CFU/g, but never in the treatments of plants heavily (10 4 CFU/g) inoculated with  S. indica ( Table 1 and  Supplementary Figure 2C). Effect of Combined Inoculation of Endophytic Bacteria and  S. indica on Tomato Growth To determine effects of selected  Mycolicibacterium strains and  S. indica on plants, tomato plants were inoculated with single or dual inoculations. The fresh weight in all the inoculated treatments was never lower than control (untreated) plants ( Figure 3), therefore none of these microbes seemed detrimental or pathogenic for plant growth. Apart from the strain P1-5, single inoculations of bacteria increased plant growth, but only P1-18 and P9-22 increased shoot fresh weight significantly. Inoculation of plants with  S. indica increased shoot fresh weight (3.3-fold). Dual inoculations of  S. indica+P1-5 and  S. indica+P1-18 further enhanced the beneficial effect triggered by  S. indica, but it resulted significant only for leaf area measurements of plants inoculated with  S. indica+P1-5. Contrarily, dual inoculations of  S. indica+P9-22 and  S. indica+P9-64 displayed lower performance than inoculation of  S. indica alone. To confirm the plant growth promotion triggered by these microbes, this experiment was repeated in soil with high content of nutrients but in this experiment no differences were obtained between treatments ( Figure 4).","Serendipita (=Piriformospora) indica is a fungal endophytic symbiont with the capabilities to enhance plant growth and confer resistance to different stresses. However, the application of this fungus in the field has led to inconsistent results, perhaps due to antagonism with other microbes. Here, we studied the impact of individual bacterial isolates from the endophytic bacterial community on the in vitro growth of S. indica. We further analyzed how combinations of bacteria and S. indica influence plant growth and protection against the phytopathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani. Bacterial strains of the genera Bacillus, Enterobacter and Burkholderia negatively affected S. indica growth on plates, whereas Mycolicibacterium, Rhizobium, Paenibacillus strains and several other bacteria from different taxa stimulated fungal growth. To further explore the potential of bacteria positively interacting with S. indica, four of the most promising strains belonging to the genus Mycolicibacterium were selected for further experiments. Some dual inoculations of S. indica and Mycolicibacterium strains boosted the beneficial effects triggered by S. indica, further enhancing the growth of tomato plants, and alleviating the symptoms caused by the phytopathogens F. oxysporum and R. solani. However, some combinations of S. indica and bacteria were less effective than individual inoculations. By analyzing the genomes of the Mycolicibacterium strains, we revealed that these bacteria encode several genes predicted to be involved in the stimulation of S. indica growth, plant development and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Particularly, a high number of genes related to vitamin and nitrogen metabolism were detected. Taking into consideration multiple interactions on and inside plants, we showed in this study that some bacterial strains may induce beneficial effects on S. indica and could have an outstanding influence on the plant-fungus symbiosis."," 'Symbiosis', 'Biocontrol', 'Bacterial Endophytes', 'Tripartite Interactions', 'Serendipita Indica', 'Mycolicibacterium', 'Fungal Stimulation' "," 'Supplementary Table', 'Table', 'Supplementary Figure', 'indica growth', 'indica', 'Supplementary', 'Strains', 'growth', 'Figure', 'Genes' "," P9-64, indica+P1-18, indica+P9-22, P9-22, indica+P9-22, indica+P1-18, indica+P9-64, P1-18, P9-22, P9-64, PDA+NA, P9-22, PDA+NA, pumilus, peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases, nitrilases, P1-18, choline dehydrogenase, P1-18, P9-22, P9-64, P9-64, ≈95, Rosselló-Móra, P9-22, Rosselló-Móra, Rosselló-Móra, “ Tuberculosis-Simiae”, ”, RAST, P9-22, P9-64, auxin, P9-22, P9-64, P9-64, P9-64, like β-hexosaminidases, chitooligosacharide deacetylases, chitin, chitinases, P1-5, β-lactam, Neu, multidrug resistance proteins, P9-64, bacteriocins, Wright, type IV pili, Dörr, PKS, BGCs, P9-22, P9-64, P1-18, fengycin, class polysaccharide lyases, carbohydrate esterases, glycoside hydrolases, GH, PCWDEs, cellulase, pectin, P1-18, Ghignone, vitamin B, B7, B1, B9, vitamin K, glutamine synthase, dual-culturing, P9-64, P1-18, P9-22, indica+P1-18, indica+P9-22, indica+P9-64 ",  ," 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.', 'S.'

86,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC7705728/eupmc_result.json,PMC7705728,"Results Molecular markers associated with sabinene content Genotyping of the F 2 mapping population with the molecular markers KASP 4-31,228,189 and CAPS 4-31,218,832 allowed the identification of three groups ‘a’, ‘h’ and ‘b’ with different content of specific monoterpenes (Fig.  2a). The plants in these groups differed regarding the homozygous maternal allele (a), the homozygous paternal allele (b) and the heterozygous genotype (h). The highest average content of specific monoterpenes was always detected in group ‘a’ and the lowest in group ‘b’ (Fig.  2a). To test the applicability of the molecular marker KASP 4-31,228,189, we investigated a panel of 85 carrot genotypes described previously 23. The group ‘a’ harbouring genotypes, homozygous for the allele (a), consists of nine genotypes, including the  yellow mutant. Fifty-one accessions and the  cola mutant are arranged in group ‘b’, which is homozygous for allele (b). Twenty-five accessions are members of group ‘h’ displaying the heterozygous genotype (Fig.  S3). As expected, marker-trait association analysis for the control substances β-myrcene and limonene showed no significant differences. For the sabinene content in leaf tissue a strong correlation was found. The homozygous alleles (a) and (b) were associated with high and low sabinene content, respectively. The same tendency was observed for sabinene in root tissue (Fig.  2c). For α-terpinene, terpinen-4-ol, and 4-carene no significant differences were observed, due to their low detectability. For γ-terpinene, the marker-trait association in leaves showed the same tendency as for sabinene (Fig.  2c). Our data show that the molecular marker KASP 4-31,228,189 can discriminate carrot genotypes by a specific allelic configuration for sabinene production. To validate the major QTL for sabinene, we investigated candidate genes with tentative terpene synthase activity within the terpene synthase gene cluster on chromosome 4. Functional characterization of sabinene synthase candidates Our data clearly show that both proteins catalyse sabinene formation in vitro. Moreover, the functional test revealed  DcTPS54 as a single-product terpene synthase and  DcTPS04 as a multiple-product terpene synthase. Therefore, we were able to confirm the sabinene-associated QTL on chromosome 4. For functional characterization of  DcTPS04 and  DcTPS54, we cloned the ORF of the catalytic domains excluding the N-terminal region with the transit peptide. The amplified sequences of 1632 bp and 1692 bp for  DcTPS04 and  DcTPS54, respectively, were integrated upstream of the 6-His tag and following stop codon in pET28c plasmid and expressed in  E. coli Rosetta TM 2 strain. The synthesised terpene synthases were assayed for monoterpene (GPP and NPP substrates) and sesquiterpene ((E,E)-FPP and (Z,Z)-FPP substrates) synthase activity. The products were analysed by mass spectrometry. Enzymatic formation of terpenes was observed only with GPP substrate identifying  DcTPS04 and  DcTPS54 as functional monoterpene synthases (Fig.  5,  S4). DcTPS54 yielded the single monoterpene product sabinene. The major product of  DcTPS04 is α-terpineol along with the minor products sabinene, β-limonene, β-pinene and myrcene. Extracts prepared from  E. coli served as controls for terpene formation in vitro. These extracts did not produce any detectable amounts of terpenes. Expression pattern of terpene synthase candidates We analysed the expression patterns of  DcTPS04,  DcTPS26,  DcTPS27,  DcTPS54 and  DcTPS55 clustered on chromosome 4 to assign a priority to candidate genes, which could be involved in sabinene production. For this purpose, total RNA was isolated from leaf and root tissue of the two 16 weeks old carrot mutants ( cola and  yellow) and was analysed with gene-specific primers by qRT-PCR. Transcript accumulation was obtained for  DcTPS04,  DcTPS26 and  DcTPS54, whereas the transcripts of  DcTPS27 and  DcTPS55 genes could hardly be identified (Fig.  4). Our results show that  DcTPS04, DcTPS26 and  DcTPS54 transcript levels are higher in root tissue compared to leaf tissue (Fig.  4). For  DcTPS26 we detected lower expression levels in leaf tissue of  yellow compared to  cola. In root tissue, the expression of  DcTPS26 was higher as in  cola. Due to these contrasting expression patterns,  DcTPS26 was not selected for further analysis. We also observed differences in the expression of  DcTPS04 and  DcTPS54 in the  yellow and  cola mutant. The transcript of  DcTPS04 was detected in root and leaf tissue of  cola and it was not detectable in  yellow. In contrast, higher expression levels of  DcTPS54 were found in  yellow compared to  cola (Fig.  4). The expression profile of  DcTPS54 is in good agreement to the abundance of sabinene in  yellow and  cola mutants (Fig.  1). The expression pattern of  DcTPS04 and  DcTPS54 in  yellow and  cola gives an indication for their involvement in sabinene synthesis in these genotypes. Based on the gene expression and QTL analysis, we selected  DcTPS04 and  DcTPS54 for further functional analysis. Phenotyping and QTL mapping in a F 2 population Genotypic analysis was performed using 89 molecular markers that were polymorphic in the F 2 mapping population. This set of molecular markers was distributed over all carrot chromosomes and included 33 SSR-, 13 CAPS-, 9 KASP-, 24 InDel- and 10 RAPD markers. Twenty-eight molecular markers close to TPS genes are presented in Tab.  S2. Markers with segregation distortion were excluded from map construction. The resulting partial genetic map had a length of 536.6 cM encompassing all nine  Daucus carota chromosomes (data not shown). A prerequisite for QTL analysis is two parent genotypes that are different in the trait of interest. We observed that the  yellow and the  cola carrot genotypes display significant phenotypic differences in the content of low molecular weight terpenes. In comparison to the  yellow genotype, the  cola genotype showed reduced amounts of terpinen-4-ol, α-terpinene, sabinene in leaf and root tissue and γ-terpinene in leaves. The monoterpene 4-carene was detectable in roots of the  yellow mutant but not in the leaves of this genotype (Fig.  1). In carrot roots, QTLs associated with bornyl acetate and β-pinene were detected on chromosomes 1 and 5, respectively. QTLs located on chromosome 3 were calculated for β-elemene, δ-elemene and β-farnesene in leaves and for guaia-3,9-diene and δ-elemene in roots. A genomic region spanning 105 kb on chromosome 4 includes QTLs for sabinene, α-thujene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, terpinen-4-ol and 4-caren. Five molecular markers, namely KASP 4-31,228,189, CAPS 4-31,218,832, KASP 4-31,147,906, KASP 4-31,258,391 and KASP 4-31,239,271 were associated within this region (Fig.  2b). These molecular markers segregated in the F 2 mapping population according to the Mendel’s law of segregation (Fig.  S1, Tab.  S3). Highly significant QTLs were detected for sabinene (LOD: 27.49), α-terpinene (LOD: 20.37), γ-terpinene (LOD: 20.48) in leaves and for 4-carene (LOD: 28.68) in roots. Although the LOD scores for other analysed low molecular weight terpenes showed the same tendency, they did not exceed the significance threshold calculated individually for each terpene. These two contrasting parental genotypes were crossed to develop a QTL mapping population. The F 2 generation of this population comprised 320 individual plants. They were analysed for volatile terpene compounds using headspace SPME-gas chromatography. This analysis allowed us to quantify 20 monoterpenes and 15 sesquiterpenes in root tissue, and 18 monoterpenes and 18 sesquiterpenes in leaf tissue, respectively (Tab.  S1). In leaves, the most abundant monoterpenes were β-myrcene, sabinene and limonene, and the major sesquiterpenes were β-caryophyllene and β-bisabolene. The terpenes with the highest abundance in roots were the monoterpenes terpinolene, γ-terpinene and sabinene and the sesquiterpenes β-caryophyllene, guaia-3,9-diene and α-bisabolene (Tab.  S1). Phenotypic variation in the contents of sabinene, α-terpinene and terpinen-4-ol (leaf and root tissue), 4-carene, α-thujene (root tissue) and γ-terpinene (leaf tissue) was observed in the F 2 population. No significant differences could be measured for the non-circular compound β-myrcene and the circular limonene, functioning as unaffected controls (Fig.  2a). QTL analysis was conducted using phenotypic and genotypic data from the F 2 mapping population. In total, 14 QTLs with LOD scores >10 were identified for terpenes in roots and leaves (Table  1). Terpene synthase cluster on chromosome 4 includes putative monoterpene synthases We identified five terpene synthase genes,  DcTPS04 (DCAR_013298),  DcTPS26 (DCAR_013310),  DcTPS27 (DCAR_013293),  DcTPS54 (DCAR_013297) and  DcTPS55 (DCAR_013294) confirming the terpene synthase gene prediction reported previously 22,  23. The terpene synthase genes spread over a region of 105 kb. The genes  DcTPS04,  DcTPS27, DcTPS54 and  DcTPS55 are located physically within a genomic region of 35 kb and genetically within 0.11 cM. The gene  DcTPS26 is located 70 kb upstream of  DcTPS04 (Fig.  3a). In addition, a 609 bp TPS-fragment at position 31,157,047 –31,157,656 bp was found. Its amino acid sequence has 86% identity to the first 150 residues of the N-terminus of  DcTPS26. However, a large part of the catalytic domain is missing. Thus, it can be assumed that this terpene synthase gene fragment is non-functional. The amino acid sequence alignment of the five predicted terpene synthase genes revealed their high sequence similarity, varying from 78.5 to 91% (Fig.  3b). Based on high sequence similarity and chromosomal orientation of  DcTPS04,  DcTPS26, DcTPS27, DcTPS54 and  DcTPS55, the same evolutionary origin can be suggested. Although  DcTPS26 has a high sequence similarity to other monoterpene synthases, the lack of a proper transit peptide indicates a sesquiterpene producing activity (Fig.  3b, Fig.  S3). Proper transit peptides were predicted by Target P2.0 algorithm for  DcTPS04 (the cleavage site position CS pos: 54–55, between the residues VSR-GD, with a prediction Pr. of 0.2131), for  DcTPS54 (CS pos: 44–45, IRC-TS. Pr: 0.7755), for  DcTPS55 (CS pos: 34–35, TCC-TS, Pr: 0.2387) and for  DcTPS27 (CS pos: 45–46, IRC-TG, Pr: 0.7556), indicating their monoterpene synthase activity. For in silico analysis of the genomic region on chromosome 4 associated with sabinene production, we performed a reannotation of the carrot genome using 12 reference genomes in GeMoMa 1.6.2beta 22,  28. This gene cluster with the genomic coordinates 31,120,000–31,280,000 bp includes genes encoding proteins of different functional groups. Two zinc finger transcription factors, two methyltransferases, one phosphatase, one galacturonosyl transferase (GAUT), seven glycosyl hydrolases (GH) and five terpene synthases were predicted (Fig.  3a). The putative glycosyl hydrolase genes are homologous to plant xyloglucan endotransglucosylases (XET). Out of 36 XET genes that were recognized in the carrot genome, seven XETs surround the  DcTPS26 gene.","In plants, low molecular weight terpenes produced by terpene synthases (TPS) contribute to multiple ecologically and economically important traits. The present study investigates a carrot terpene synthase gene cluster on chromosome 4 associated with volatile monoterpene production. Two carrot mutants, yellow and cola, which are contrasting in the content of low molecular weight terpenes, were crossed to develop an F 2  mapping population. The mapping analysis revealed overlapping QTLs on chromosome 4 for sabinene, α-thujene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, terpinen-4-ol and 4-carene. The genomic region of this locus includes a cluster of five terpene synthase genes (DcTPS04, DcTPS26, DcTPS27, DcTPS54 and DcTPS55). DcTPS04 and DcTPS54 displayed genotype- and tissue-specific variation in gene expression. Based on the QTL mapping results and the gene expression patterns, DcTPS04 and DcTPS54 were selected for functional characterization. In vitro enzyme assays showed that DcTPS54 is a single-product enzyme catalysing the formation of sabinene, whereas DcTPS04 is a multiple-product terpene synthase producing α-terpineol as a major product and four additional products including sabinene, β-limonene, β-pinene and myrcene. Furthermore, we developed a functional molecular marker that could discriminate carrot genotypes with different sabinene content in a set of 85 accessions.",NaN," 'Fig.', 'terpene synthase', 'sabinene', 'root tissue', 'terpene', 'synthase', 'KASP', 'tissue', 'Molecular markers', 'content Genotyping' "," CAPS 4-31,218,832, ‘, ’, ‘, ’, ‘b’, ‘, ’, ‘b, ‘, ’, ‘, ’, sabinene-associated, 6-His, E)-FPP, (Z, Z)-FPP, DcTPS54, α-terpineol, gene-specific, DcTPS26, InDel-, γ-terpinene, β-pinene, 4-caren, KASP 4-31,228,189, CAPS 4-31,218,832, KASP 4-31,147,906, KASP 4-31,258,391, KASP 4-31,239,271, β-caryophyllene, DCAR_013294, DcTPS54, TPS-fragment, Its amino acid, terpene synthase, DcTPS27, DcTPS54, P2.0, 54–55, VSR-GD, 44–45, IRC-TS, TCC-TS, 45–46, IRC-TG, GeMoMa 1.6.2beta, galacturonosyl transferase, GH, hydrolase, xyloglucan endotransglucosylases, XET, XET, XETs "," 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS54,', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS54,', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS26,', 'DcTPS27,', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS54,', 'DcTPS27', 'DcTPS55', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS54', 'TPS', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS27', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS27,', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS04', 'TPS-fragment', 'DcTPS26.', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS26,', 'DcTPS27,', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55,', 'DcTPS26', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55', 'DcTPS27', 'DcTPS26' ", 'IRC-TS.' ,  ,terpene synthase
87,/Users/ankitlade/Tomato/corpus/tps_tomato/PMC8248349/eupmc_result.json,PMC8248349,"Results AmNES/LIS-1 and  -2 Tomato Fruits Accumulate Glycosylated Terpenes Terpenes with hydroxyl functional groups, such as nerolidol and linalool, can be glycosylated by non-specific glucotransferases to form non-volatile, inert end products. To test whether the apparent discrepancy between production of nerolidol and linalool in  AmNES/LIS-1 and  -2 fruits, respectively, may be the consequence of an unequal flux toward respective glucoside derivatives, we analyzed terpene glucoside accumulation in ripe tomato fruits (Br + 10 stage) ( Figure 5) from the MP1 control, and representative  AmNES/LIS-1 and  -2 lines showing high transgene expression. Nerolidol-glucosides were detected only in fruits of the  AmNES/LIS-1 lines, and linalool-glucosides were only present in fruits of the  AmNES/LIS-2 lines ( Figures 5A,B). Remarkably, a substantial part of both, the nerolidol and linalool formed in  AmNES/LIS-1 and  -2 lines, respectively, appears to be converted to glucosides and accumulated as internal pools (in the nmol/g FW range) in these fruits. However, consistent with the difference in emission of the volatile free nerolidol and linalool ( Figures 2C,  3C), the amount of nerolidol-glucosides in the  AmNES/LIS-1 lines was 4- to 14-fold lower than the amount of linalool-glucosides in the  AmNES/LIS-2 lines ( Figure 5). Therefore, these results further confirm a significant difference in the potential to produce sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes in tomato fruits. Co-expression of  HMGR and  DXS in  AmNES/LIS-1 and  -2 Fruits Has Different Effects on Nerolidol and Linalool Formation In parallel, we also evaluated the effect of higher metabolic fluxes through the MVA and MEP pathways on the linalool formation by AmNES/LIS-2 introduced into transgenic tomato fruits. Therefore,  AtHMGR1 and  AtDXS were transiently overexpressed in ripening  AmNES/LIS-2 fruits by  Agrobacterium injection. Subsequent analysis of emitted volatiles showed that linalool formation was 1.8- and 3.2-fold higher upon co-expression of  AtHMGR1 and  AtDXS, respectively, in  AmNES/LIS-2 fruits compared to fruits injected with  Agrobacterium carrying the empty vector control ( Figure 6B). These results indicate that increased metabolic fluxes through the MVA and MEP pathway both support monoterpene formation in plastids, although the cytosolic MVA pathway contributes to a lesser extent. Next, we analyzed whether an increase in the flux through the upstream metabolic pathways providing precursors for the introduced AmNES/LIS-1 can enhance nerolidol production in transgenic tomato fruits. It is generally accepted that HMGR catalyzes the rate limiting step in the MVA pathway (Hemmerlin et al.,  2012) ( Figure 1). Thus, to increase the level of precursors available for the cytosolic AmNES/LIS-1, we transiently overexpressed  Arabidopsis thaliana AtHMGR1 (Enjuto et al.,  1994) in ripening  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits using  Agrobacterium injection (Gutensohn and Dudareva,  2016). Upon co-expression of  AtHMGR1, emission of nerolidol was found to be 5.7-fold higher in  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits when compared to fruits injected with  Agrobacterium carrying the empty vector control ( Figure 6A), thus indicating that the metabolic flux through the MVA pathway is indeed limiting in ripening tomato fruits. To analyze if an increased flux through the plastidic MEP pathway could also provide precursors for the cytosolic AmNES/LIS-1 via metabolic crosstalk between plastids and cytosol, we transiently overexpressed  A. thaliana AtDXS (Estévez et al.,  2000), a key enzyme of the MEP pathway ( Figure 1), in ripening  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits by  Agrobacterium injection. Upon co-expression of  AtDXS in  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits nerolidol emission was increased 2.5-fold compared to fruits injected with  Agrobacterium carrying the empty vector control ( Figure 6A), suggesting that an enhanced metabolic flux through the MEP pathway also supports cytosolic sesquiterpene formation although not to the same extent as an increased flux through the MVA pathway. Overexpression of  AmNES/LIS-1 and  -2 in Tomato Fruits Results in Different Levels of Nerolidol and Linalool Formation To determine the level of available FPP and GPP precursors for sesquiterpene and monoterpene production, respectively, in tomato fruits, we overexpressed the cytosolic AmNES/LIS-1 and plastidic AmNES/LIS-2, the two nearly identical bifunctional terpene synthases from snapdragon (Nagegowda et al.,  2008), in tomato plants under control of the fruit ripening specific  PG promoter (Nicholass et al.,  1995). This promoter limits transgene expression to the pericarp of ripening fruit, thus avoiding negative effects on vegetative tissues and general plant development (Orlova et al.,  2009). After an initial screening of 29 tomato lines for the presence of the  AmNES/LIS-1 transgene as well as nerolidol formation, four independent lines (B5, B7, C6, and C13) with various  AmNES/LIS-1 expression levels, as determined by quantitative real-time PCR ( Figure 2A), were chosen for further characterization. Likewise, four independent  AmNES/LIS-2 overexpressing lines (B12, C14, D13, and U8) with different expression levels ( Figure 3A) were selected for detailed analysis from 56 transgenic tomato lines after an initial screening for the presence of the  AmNES/LIS-2 transgene and linalool formation. To examine sesquiterpene and monoterpene formation upon  AmNES/LIS-1 and  AmNES/LIS-2 overexpression, respectively, emitted volatiles were collected from ripe tomato fruits (Br +10 stage) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The only difference in the volatile profile between transgenic lines and control was the formation of the sesquiterpene nerolidol and the monoterpene linalool in  AmNES/LIS-1 ( Figure 2B) and  AmNES/LIS-2 ( Figure 3B) transgenic fruits, respectively, which were absent in the MP1 control fruits ( Figures 2B,  3B). The amounts of nerolidol emitted from  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits positively correlated with the  AmNES/LIS-1 expression level in the different transgenic lines ( Figures 2A,C). A similar positive correlation between the amounts of linalool emitted from fruits and the respective  AmNES/LIS-2 transcript levels was observed in the different transgenic  AmNES/LIS-2 lines ( Figures 3A,C). No formation of linalool was observed in  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits and likewise  AmNES/LIS-2 fruits did not produce nerolidol ( Supplementary Figure 1). The most remarkable outcome of the characterization of these transgenic  AmNES/LIS-1 and  AmNES/LIS-2 fruits was that despite the almost identical kinetic properties of the two expressed terpene synthases (Nagegowda et al.,  2008), and similar or higher expression levels of  AmNES/LIS-1 (4.78 ± 1.50 to 28.43 ± 5.31 × 10 −3% of total mRNA) relative to that of  AmNES/LIS-2 (1.90 ± 0.08 to 5.97 ± 0.52 × 10 −3% of total mRNA) ( Figures 2A,  3A), nerolidol emission in  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits was 60- to 584-fold lower than linalool emission in  AmNES/LIS-2 fruits ( Figures 2C,  3C). Co-expression of  IPK in  AmNES/LIS-1 Fruits Significantly Enhances Nerolidol Formation Isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK) was recently identified as a new member of the plant terpenoid metabolic network ( Figure 1) and shown to play an important role in modulating the formation of FPP-derived terpenoid compounds, including sesquiterpenes (Henry et al.,  2015). In order to find if IPK could also positively influence the FPP levels for sesquiterpene formation in tomato fruits, we transiently overexpressed  A. thaliana AtIPK (Henry et al.,  2015) in ripening  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits by  Agrobacterium injection. The analysis of emitted volatiles showed that nerolidol formation was 2.9-fold higher upon  AtIPK co-expression in  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits compared to control fruits injected with  Agrobacterium carrying the empty vector control ( Figure 6C). This result indicates that overexpression of IPK indeed supports nerolidol formation in engineered  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits by shifting the ratio of IP/DMAP to IPP/DMAPP and thus increasing the pool of precursors available for sesquiterpene formation. AmNES/LIS-1 Tomato Fruits Accumulate Internal Pools of Nerolidol Derivatives Earlier metabolic engineering attempts to produce volatile terpenes in different plant tissues, including tomato fruits, resulted in formation not only of the desired product but also of other terpenes, which are derived from the primary product by the action of endogenous plant enzymes (Lewinsohn et al.,  2001; Lücker et al.,  2001; Davidovich-Rikanati et al.,  2007). These product modifications often affect the volatility of the derived compounds and result in their accumulation inside the tissue. Thus, as a first step to further evaluate the underlying mechanisms causing the low levels of nerolidol emission in  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits relative to the linalool emission in  AmNES/LIS-2 fruits, we analyzed internal terpene pools in  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits ( Figure 4). GC-MS analysis of terpenes extracted from ripe tomato fruits with methyl  tert-butyl ether revealed four different terpene compounds in  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits that were absent in the MP1 control fruits ( Figure 4A). Besides nerolidol, the transgenic fruits accumulated nerolidyl acetate as well as two unknown terpene compounds (mass spectra shown in  Supplementary Figure 2). Comparative analysis of the internal pools of nerolidol and its three derivatives in the lines B5 and C6 with high and low  AmNES/LIS-1 expression levels, respectively ( Figure 2A), revealed a trend toward accumulating larger amounts of these terpene compounds in line B5 vs. line C6 ( Figure 4B). However, only the internal nerolidol pool was statistically higher in line B5. While the metabolic profiling suggests that some of the nerolidol produced in transgenic  AmNES/LIS-1 fruits is indeed converted to other compounds by endogenous enzymes, such as acetyl transferases, the accumulated compounds (in the pmol/g FW range) cannot explain the roughly 100-fold difference in nerolidol vs. linalool emission observed in  AmNES/LIS-1 and  AmNES/LIS-2 fruits, respectively ( Figures 2C,  3C).","Terpenoids are a large and diverse class of plant metabolites that also includes volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes which are involved in biotic interactions of plants. Due to the limited natural availability of these terpenes and the tight regulation of their biosynthesis, there is strong interest to introduce or enhance their production in crop plants by metabolic engineering for agricultural, pharmaceutical and industrial applications. While engineering of monoterpenes has been quite successful, expression of sesquiterpene synthases in engineered plants frequently resulted in production of only minor amounts of sesquiterpenes. To identify bottlenecks for sesquiterpene engineering in plants, we have used two nearly identical terpene synthases, snapdragon ( Antirrhinum majus ) nerolidol/linalool synthase-1 and -2 (AmNES/LIS-1/-2), that are localized in the cytosol and plastids, respectively. Since these two bifunctional terpene synthases have very similar catalytic properties with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), their expression in target tissues allows indirect determination of the availability of these substrates in both subcellular compartments. Both terpene synthases were expressed under control of the ripening specific  PG  promoter in tomato fruits, which are characterized by a highly active terpenoid metabolism providing precursors for carotenoid biosynthesis. As  AmNES/LIS-2  fruits produced the monoterpene linalool,  AmNES/LIS-1  fruits were found to exclusively produce the sesquiterpene nerolidol. While nerolidol emission in  AmNES/LIS-1  fruits was 60- to 584-fold lower compared to linalool emission in  AmNES/LIS-2  fruits, accumulation of nerolidol-glucosides in  AmNES/LIS-1  fruits was 4- to 14-fold lower than that of linalool-glucosides in  AmNES/LIS-2  fruits. These results suggest that only a relatively small pool of FPP is available for sesquiterpene formation in the cytosol. To potentially overcome limitations in sesquiterpene production, we transiently co-expressed the key pathway-enzymes hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), as well as the regulator isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK). While HMGR and IPK expression increased metabolic flux toward nerolidol formation 5.7- and 2.9-fold, respectively, DXS expression only resulted in a 2.5-fold increase."," 'Tomato fruit', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Monoterpenes', 'metabolic engineering', 'Mep Pathway', 'Mva Pathway', 'Isopentenyl Phosphate Kinase', 'Nerolidol/linalool Synthase' "," 'AmNES', 'Fruits', 'Tomato Fruits', 'Figure', 'nerolidol', 'Figures', 'Formation', 'Tomato', 'linalool', 'Linalool Formation' "," AmNES/LIS-1, MP1, Nerolidol-glucosides, linalool-glucosides, nerolidol-glucosides, linalool-glucosides, AmNES/LIS-2, AmNES/LIS-1, Estévez, plastidic AmNES/LIS-2, B5, B7, D13, U8, MP1, C, C, ±, ±, FPP-derived terpenoid, IP/DMAP, MP1 ",  ,  ,  ,terpene synthase
