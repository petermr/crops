        <span class="abst" title="Solanum lycopersicum and Solanum habrochaites (f. typicum) accession PI127826 emit a variety of sesquiterpenes. To identify terpene synthases involved in the production of these volatile sesquiterpenes, we used massive parallel pyrosequencing (RNA-seq) to obtain the transcriptome of the stem trichomes from these plants. This approach resulted initially in the discovery of six sesquiterpene synthase cDNAs from S. lycopersicum and five from S. habrochaites. Searches of other databases and the S. lycopersicum genome resulted in the discovery of two additional sesquiterpene synthases expressed in trichomes. The sesquiterpene synthases from S. lycopersicum and S. habrochaites have high levels of protein identity. Several of them appeared to encode for non-functional proteins. Functional recombinant proteins produced germacrenes, β-caryophyllene/α-humulene, viridiflorene and valencene from (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate. However, the activities of these enzymes do not completely explain the differences in sesquiterpene production between the two tomato plants. RT-qPCR confirmed high levels of expression of most of the S. lycopersicum sesquiterpene synthases in stem trichomes. In addition, one sesquiterpene synthase was induced by jasmonic acid, while another appeared to be slightly repressed by the treatment. Our data provide a foundation to study the evolution of terpene synthases in cultivated and wild tomato.">

Hierarchical clustering identified distinct terpene phenotypic modules with shared patterns of terpene accumulation across accessions. Several terpene modules could be assigned to previously identified terpene synthase (TPS) activities that included members of the TPS-e/f subfamily that utilize the unusual cis-prenyl diphosphate substrates neryl diphosphate and 2z,6z-farnesyl diphosphate. DNA sequencing and in vitro enzyme activity analysis of TPS-e/f members from S. habrochaites identified three previously unassigned enzyme activities that utilize these cisoid substrates. These produce either the monoterpenes α-pinene and limonene, or the sesquiterpene 7-epizingiberene, with the in vitro analyses that recapitulated the trichome chemistry found in planta. Comparison of the distribution of S. habrochaites accessions with terpene content revealed a strong preference for the presence of particular TPS20 alleles at distinct geographic locations. This study reveals that the unusually high intra-specific variation of volatile terpene synthesis in glandular trichomes of S. habrochaites is due at least in part to evolution at the TPS20 locus.">

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenes are important defensive compounds against herbivores and pathogens. Here, we report the identification of a new monoterpene synthase gene, GmNES, from soybean. The transcription of GmNES was up-regulated in soybean plants that were infested with cotton leafworm (Prodenia litura), mechanically wounded or treated with salicylic acid (SA). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that recombinant GmNES enzyme exclusively produced nerol, generated from a newly identified substrate for monoterpene synthase: neryl diphosphate (NPP). This finding indicates that GmNES is a nerol synthase gene in soybean. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions showed that GmNES localized to the chloroplasts. Transgenic tobacco overexpressing GmNES was generated. In dual-choice assays, the GmNES-expressing tobacco lines significantly repelled cotton leafworm. In feeding tests with transgenic plants, the growth and development of cotton leafworm were significantly retarded. This study confirms the ecological role of terpenoids and provides new insights into their metabolic engineering in transgenic plants.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Plant induced defense against herbivory are generally associated with metabolic costs that result in the allocation of photosynthates from growth and reproduction to the synthesis of defense compounds. Therefore, it is essential that plants are capable of sensing and differentiating mechanical injury from herbivore injury. Studies have shown that oral secretions (OS) from caterpillars contain elicitors of induced plant responses. However, studies that shows whether these elicitors originated from salivary glands or from other organs associated with feeding, such as the ventral eversible gland (VEG) are limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the secretions from the VEG gland of Spodoptera exigua caterpillars contain elicitors that induce plant defenses by regulating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other defense-related genes. To test this hypothesis, we quantified and compared the activity of defense-related enzymes, transcript levels of defense-related genes and VOC emission in tomato plants damaged by S. exigua caterpillars with the VEG intact (VEGI) versus plants damaged by caterpillars with the VEG ablated (VEGA).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The quantified defense-related enzymes (i.e. peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and lipoxigenase) were expressed in significantly higher amounts in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars than in plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars. Similarly, the genes that encode for the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and terpene synthase genes that regulate production of terpene VOCs, were up-regulated in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars. Moreover, the OS of VEGA caterpillars were less active in inducing the expression of defense genes in tomato plants. Increased emissions of VOCs were detected in the headspace of plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars compared to plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;These results suggest that the VEG of S. exigua caterpillars contains elicitors of late plant defense signaling in tomato which trigger defense-related enzymatic activity, regulate expression of defense-related genes, and induce emission of plant VOCs. These signaling cascades may have important ramifications for plant-insect and tritrophic interactions.">

        <span class="abst" title="We recently reported that three genes involved in the biosynthesis of monoterpenes in trichomes, a cis-prenyltransferase named neryl diphosphate synthase 1 (NDPS1) and two terpene synthases (TPS19 and TPS20), are present in close proximity to each other at the tip of chromosome 8 in the genome of the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). This terpene gene &quot;cluster&quot; also contains a second cis-prenyltransferase gene (CPT2), three other TPS genes, including TPS21, and the cytochrome P450-oxidoreductase gene CYP71BN1. CPT2 encodes a neryneryl diphosphate synthase. Co-expression in E. coli of CPT2 and TPS21 led to the formation of the diterpene lycosantalene, and co-expression in E. coli of CPT2, TPS21 and CYP71BN1 led to the formation of lycosantalonol, an oxidation product of lycosantalene. Here we show that maximal expression of all three genes occurs in the petiolule part of the leaf, but little expression of these genes occurs in the trichomes present on the petiolules. While lycosantalene or lycosantalonol cannot be detected in the petiolules of wild-type plants (or anywhere else in the plant), lycosantalene and lycosantalonol are detected in petiolules of transgenic tomato plants expressing CPT2 under the control of the 35S CaMV promoter. These results suggest that lycosantalene and lycosantalonol are produced in the petiolules and perhaps in other tissues of wild-type plants, but that low rate of synthesis, controlled by the rate-limiting enzyme CPT2, results in product levels that are too low for detection under our current methodology. It is also possible that these compounds are further modified in the plant. The involvement of CPT2, TPS21 and CYP71BN1 in a diterpenoid biosynthetic pathway outside the trichomes, together with the involvement of other genes in the cluster in the synthesis of monoterpenes in trichomes, indicates that this cluster is further evolving into &quot;sub-clusters&quot; with unique biochemical, and likely physiological, roles.">

(O. tenuiflorum) family-Lamiaceae is an important component of Indian tradition of medicine as well as culture around the world, and hence is known as &quot;Holy basil&quot; in India. This plant is mentioned in the ancient texts of Ayurveda as an &quot;elixir of life&quot; (life saving) herb and worshipped for over 3000 years due to its healing properties. Although used in various ailments, validation of molecules for differential activities is yet to be fully analyzed, as about 80 % of the patents on this plant are on extracts or the plant parts, and mainly focussed on essential oil components. With a view to understand the full metabolic potential of this plant whole nuclear and chloroplast genomes were sequenced for the first time combining the sequence data from 4 libraries and three NGS platforms.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The saturated draft assembly of the genome was about 386 Mb, along with the plastid genome of 142,245 bp, turning out to be the smallest in Lamiaceae. In addition to SSR markers, 136 proteins were identified as homologous to five important plant genomes. Pathway analysis indicated an abundance of phenylpropanoids in O. sanctum. Phylogenetic analysis for chloroplast proteome placed Salvia miltiorrhiza as the nearest neighbor. Comparison of the chemical compounds and genes availability in O. sanctum and S. miltiorrhiza indicated the potential for the discovery of new active molecules.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The genome sequence and annotation of O. sanctum provides new insights into the function of genes and the medicinal nature of the metabolites synthesized in this plant. This information is highly beneficial for mining biosynthetic pathways for important metabolites in related species.">

Quantitative and qualitative inter- and intra- specific variation of terpenes is common in eucalypts.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The genome sequences of Eucalyptus grandis and E. globulus were mined for terpene synthase genes (TPS) and compared to other plant species. We investigated the relative expression of TPS in seven plant tissues and functionally characterized five TPS genes from E. grandis. Compared to other sequenced plant genomes, Eucalyptus grandis has the largest number of putative functional TPS genes of any sequenced plant. We discovered 113 and 106 putative functional TPS genes in E. grandis and E. globulus, respectively. All but one TPS from E. grandis were expressed in at least one of seven plant tissues examined. Genomic clusters of up to 20 genes were identified. Many TPS are expressed in tissues other than leaves which invites a re-evaluation of the function of terpenes in Eucalyptus.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our data indicate that terpenes in Eucalyptus may play a wider role in biotic and abiotic interactions than previously thought. Tissue specific expression is common and the possibility of stress induction needs further investigation. Phylogenetic comparison of the two investigated Eucalyptus species gives insight about recent evolution of different clades within the TPS gene family. While the majority of TPS genes occur in orthologous pairs some clades show evidence of recent gene duplication, as well as loss of function.">

        <span class="abst" title="The pleasant fragrance of ylang ylang varieties (Cananga odorata) is mainly due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the flowers. Floral scents are a key factor in plant-insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to β-thujene, sabinene, β-pinene, and α-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate. The other two TPSs were identified as sesqui-TPSs. CoTPS3 catalysed the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to α-bergamotene, whereas CoTPS2 was found to be a multifunctional and novel TPS that could catalyse the synthesis of three sesquiterpenes, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene. Additionally, the activities of the two sesqui-TPSs were confirmed in planta by transient expression of these TPS genes in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Solanum elaeagnifolium, an invasive weed of the Solanaceae family, is poorly studied although it poses a significant threat to crops. Here the analysis of the transcriptome of S. elaeagnifolium is presented, as a means to explore the biology of this species and to identify genes related to its adaptation to environmental stress. One of the basic mechanisms by which plants respond to environmental stress is through the synthesis of specific secondary metabolites that protect the plant from herbivores and microorganisms, or serve as signaling molecules. One important such group of secondary metabolites are terpenes.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;By next-generation sequencing, the flower/leaf transcriptome of S. elaeagnifolium was sequenced and de novo assembled into 75,618 unigenes. Among the unigenes identified, several corresponded to genes involved in terpene biosynthesis; these included terpene synthases (TPSs) and genes of the mevalonate (MVA) and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. Functional characterization of two of the TPSs showed that one produced the sesquiterpene (E)-caryophyllene and the second produced the monoterpene camphene. Analysis of wounded S. elaeagnifolium leaves has shown significant increase of the concentration of (E)-caryophyllene and geranyl linalool, two terpenes implicated in stress responses. The increased production of (E)-caryophyllene was matched to the induced expression of the corresponding TPS gene. Wounding also led to the increased expression of the putative 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 2 (DXS2) gene, a key enzyme of the MEP pathway, corroborating the overall increased output of terpene biosynthesis.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The reported S. elaeagnifolium de novo transcriptome provides a valuable sequence database that could facilitate study of this invasive weed and contribute to our understanding of the highly diverse Solanaceae family. Analysis of genes and pathways involved in the plant's interaction with the environment will help to elucidate the mechanisms that underly the intricate features of this unique Solanum species.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Terpenes are of great interest to winemakers because of their extremely low perception thresholds and pleasant floral odors. Even for the same variety, terpene profile can be substantially different for grapevine growing environments. Recently a series of genes required for terpene biosynthesis were biochemically characterized in grape berries. However, the genes that dominate the differential terpene accumulation of grape berries between regions have yet to be identified.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Free and glycosidically-bound terpenes were identified and quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. The transcription expression profiling of the genes was obtained by RNA sequencing and part of the results were verified by quantitative real time PCR (QPCR). The gene co-expression networks were constructed with the Cytoscape software v 2.8.2 ( www.cytoscape.org).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;'Muscat Blanc a Petits Grains' berries were collected from two wine-producing regions with strikingly different climates, Gaotai (GT) in Gansu Province and Changli (CL) in Hebei Province in China, at four developmental stages for two consecutive years. GC-MS analysis demonstrated that both free and glycosidically bound terpenes accumulated primarily after veraison and that mature grape berries from CL contained significantly higher concentrations of free and glycosidically bound terpenes than berries from GT. Transcriptome analysis revealed that some key genes involved in terpene biosynthesis were markedly up-regulated in the CL region. Particularly in the MEP pathway, the expression of VviHDR (1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase) paralleled with the accumulation of terpenes, which can promote the flow of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) into the terpene synthetic pathway. The glycosidically bound monoterpenes accumulated differentially along with maturation in both regions, which is synchronous with the expression of a monoterpene glucosyltransferase gene (VviUGT85A2L4 (VviGT14)). Other genes were also found to be related to the differential accumulation of terpenes and monoterpene glycosides in the grapes between regions. Transcription factors that could regulate terpene synthesis were predicted through gene co-expression network analysis. Additionally, the genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene signal responses were expressed at high levels earlier in GT grapes than in CL grapes.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Differential production of free and glycosidically-bound terpenes in grape berries across GT and CL regions should be related at least to the expression of both VviHDR and VviUGT85A2L4 (VviGT14). Considering the expression patterns of both transcription factors and mature-related genes, we infer that less rainfall and stronger sunshine in the GT region could initiate the earlier expression of ripening-related genes and accelerate the berry maturation, eventually limiting the production of terpene volatiles.">

        <span class="abst" title="Syringa oblata Lindl. is a woody ornamental plant with high economic value and characteristics that include early flowering, multiple flower colors, and strong fragrance. Despite a long history of cultivation, the genetics and molecular biology of S. oblata are poorly understood. Transcriptome and expression profiling data are needed to identify genes and to better understand the biological mechanisms of floral pigments and scents in this species. Nine cDNA libraries were obtained from three replicates of three developmental stages: inflorescence with enlarged flower buds not protruded, inflorescence with corolla lobes not displayed, and inflorescence with flowers fully opened and emitting strong fragrance. Using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique, 319,425,972 clean reads were obtained and were assembled into 104,691 final unigenes (average length of 853 bp), 41.75% of which were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Among the annotated unigenes, 36,967 were assigned to gene ontology categories and 19,956 were assigned to eukaryoticorthologous groups. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database, 12,388 unigenes were sorted into 286 pathways. Based on these transcriptomic data, we obtained a large number of candidate genes that were differentially expressed at different flower stages and that were related to floral pigment biosynthesis and fragrance metabolism. This comprehensive transcriptomic analysis provides fundamental information on the genes and pathways involved in flower secondary metabolism and development in S. oblata, providing a useful database for further research on S. oblata and other plants of genus Syringa.">

        <span class="abst" title="Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC., named &quot;Cangzhu&quot; in China, which belongs to the Asteraceae family. In some countries of Southeast Asia (China, Thailand, Korea, Japan etc.) its rhizome, commonly called rhizoma atractylodis, is used to treat many diseases as it contains a variety of sesquiterpenoids and other components of medicinal importance. Despite its medicinal value, the information of the sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome analysis of different tissues of non-model plant A. lancea by using short read sequencing technology (Illumina). We found 62,352 high quality unigenes with an average sequence length of 913 bp in the transcripts of A. Lancea. Among these, 43,049 (69.04%), 30,264 (48.53%), 26,233 (42.07%), 17,881 (28.67%) and 29,057(46.60%) unigenes showed significant similarity (E-value&lt;1e(-5)) to known proteins in Nr, KEGG, SWISS-PROT, GO, and COG databases, respectively. Of the total 62,352 unigenes, 43,049 (Nr Database) open reading frames were predicted. On the basis of different bioinformatics tools we identify all the enzymes that take part in the terpenoid biosynthesis as well as five different known sesquiterpenoids via cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway and plastidal methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. In our study, 6, 864 Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were also found as great potential markers in A. lancea. This transcriptomic resource of A. lancea provides a great contribution in advancement of research for this specific medicinal plant and more specifically for the gene mining of different classes of terpenoids and other chemical compounds that have medicinal as well as economic importance.">

        <span class="abst" title="Phytohormones control the development and growth of plants, as well as their response to biotic and abiotic stress. The seven most well-studied phytohormone classes defined today are as follows: auxins, ethylene, cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, gibberellins, and brassinosteroids. The basic principle of hormone regulation is conserved in all plants, but recent results suggest adaptations of synthesis, transport, or signaling pathways to the architecture and growth environment of different plant species. Thus, we aimed to define the extent to which information from the model plant &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; is transferable to other plants such as &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum.&lt;/i&gt; We extracted the co-orthologues of genes coding for major pathway enzymes in &lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt; from the translated genomes of 12 species from the clade Viridiplantae. Based on predicted domain architecture and localization of the identified proteins from all 13 species, we inspected the conservation of phytohormone pathways. The comparison was complemented by expression analysis of (co-) orthologous genes in &lt;i&gt;S. lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;. Altogether, this information allowed the assignment of putative functional equivalents between &lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; but also pointed to some variations between the pathways in eudicots, monocots, mosses, and green algae. These results provide first insights into the conservation of the various phytohormone pathways between the model system &lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and crop plants such as tomato. We conclude that orthologue prediction in combination with analysis of functional domain architecture and intracellular localization and expression studies are sufficient tools to transfer information from model plants to other plant species. Our results support the notion that hormone synthesis, transport, and response for most part of the pathways are conserved, and species-specific variations can be found.">

        <span class="abst" title="During grape ripening, numerous transcriptional and metabolic changes are required in order to obtain colored, sweet, and flavored berries. There is evidence that ethylene, together with other signals, plays an important role in triggering the onset of ripening. Here, we report the functional characterization of a berry-specific Ethylene Responsive Factor (ERF), &lt;i&gt;VviERF045&lt;/i&gt;, which is induced just before véraison and peaks at ripening. Phylogenetic analysis revealed it is close to the SHINE clade of ERFs, factors involved in the regulation of wax biosynthesis and cuticle morphology. Transgenic grapevines lines overexpressing &lt;i&gt;VviERF045&lt;/i&gt; were obtained, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; propagated, phenotypically characterized, and analyzed for the content of specific classes of metabolites. The effect of &lt;i&gt;VviERF045&lt;/i&gt; was correlated with the level of transgene expression, with high-expressing lines showing stunted growth, discolored and smaller leaves, and a lower level of chlorophylls and carotenoids. One line with intermediate expression, L15, was characterized at the transcriptomic level and showed 573 differentially expressed genes compared to wild type plants. Microscopy and gene expression analyses point toward a major role of &lt;i&gt;VviERF045&lt;/i&gt; in epidermis patterning by acting on waxes and cuticle. They also indicate that &lt;i&gt;VviERF045&lt;/i&gt; affects phenolic secondary metabolism and induces a reaction resembling a plant immune response with modulation of receptor like-kinases and pathogen related genes. These results suggest also a possible role of this transcription factor in berry ripening, likely related to changes in epidermis and cuticle of the berry, cell expansion, a decrease in photosynthetic capacity, and the activation of several defense related genes as well as from the phenylpropanoid metabolism. All these processes occur in the berry during ripening.">

These compounds may perform direct defensive functions, i.e., acting as antioxidant, antibacterial, or antifungal agents, or indirectly by signaling the activation of the plant's defensive responses. Using a non-targeted GC-MS metabolomics approach, we identified the profile of the VOCs associated with the differential immune response of the Rio Grande tomato leaves infected with either virulent or avirulent strains of &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt; DC3000 pv. &lt;i&gt;tomato&lt;/i&gt;. The VOC profile of the tomato leaves infected with avirulent bacteria is characterized by esters of (Z)-3-hexenol with acetic, propionic, isobutyric or butyric acids, and several hydroxylated monoterpenes, e.g., linalool, α-terpineol, and 4-terpineol, which defines the profile of an immunized plant response. In contrast, the same tomato cultivar infected with the virulent bacteria strain produced a VOC profile characterized by monoterpenes and SA derivatives. Interestingly, the differential VOCs emission correlated statistically with the induction of the genes involved in their biosynthetic pathway. Our results extend plant defense system knowledge and suggest the possibility for generating plants engineered to over-produce these VOCs as a complementary strategy for resistance.">

Total transcriptome data from these stages ranged between 65 and 143 Mb. Importantly, 20,755 unique transcripts were annotated and 4,611 were assigned enzyme commission numbers, which encoded 142 biological pathways. These included ethylene and flavor related secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, as well as those involved in metabolism of starch, sucrose, amino acids and fatty acids. Differential regulation (p-value ≤ 0.05) of thousands of transcripts was evident in various stages of fruit development and ripening. Novel transcripts for biosynthesis of mono-terpenes, sesqui-terpenes, di-terpenes, lactones and furanones involved in flavor formation were identified. Large number of transcripts encoding cell wall modifying enzymes was found to be steady in their expression, while few were differentially regulated through these stages. Novel 79 transcripts of inhibitors of cell wall modifying enzymes were simultaneously detected throughout Alphonso fruit development and ripening, suggesting controlled activity of these enzymes involved in fruit softening.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Lily is an economically important plant, with leaves and bulbs consisting of overlapping scales, large ornamental flowers and a very large genome. Although it is recognized that flowers and bulb scales are modified leaves, very little is known about the genetic control and biochemical differentiation underlying lily organogenesis and development. Here we examined the differentially expressed genes in flower, leaf and scale of lily, using RNA-sequencing, and identified organ-specific genes, including transcription factors, genes involved in photosynthesis in leaves, carbohydrate metabolism in bulb scales and scent and color production in flowers.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Over 11Gb data were obtained and 2685, 2296, and 1709 differentially expressed genes were identified in the three organs, with 581, 662 and 977 unique DEGs in F-vs-S, L-vs-S and L-vs-F comparisons. By functional enrichment analysis, genes likely to be involved in biosynthetic pathways leading to floral scent production, such as 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT), hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate (HDS) and terpene synthase (TPS), and floral color genes, such as dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavonol synthase (FLS) were identified. Distinct groups of genes that participate in starch and sucrose metabolism, such as sucrose synthase (SS), invertase (INV), sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), starch synthase (SSS), starch branching enzyme (SBE), ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) andβ-amylase (BAM) and photosynthesis genes (Psa, Psb, Pet and ATP) were also identified. The expression of six floral fragrance-related DGEs showed agreement between qRT-PCR results and RPKM values, confirming the value of the data obtained by RNA-seq. We obtained the open reading frame of the terpene synthase gene from Lilium 'Sorbonne', designated LsTPS, which had 99.55% homology to transcript CL4520.Contig5_All. In addition, 54, 48 and 50 differently expressed transcription factor were identified by pairwise comparisons between the three organs and a regulatory network for monoterpene biosynthesis was constructed.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Analysis of differentially expressed genes in flower, leaf and bulb scale of lily, using second generation sequencing technology, yielded detailed information on lily metabolic differentiation in three organs. Analysis of the expression of flower scent biosynthesis genes has provided a model for the regulation of the pathway and identified a candidate gene encoding an enzyme catalyzing the final step in scent production. These digital gene expression profiles provide a valuable and informative database for the further identification and analysis of structural genes and transcription factors in different lily organs and elucidation of their function.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Terpenoid hydrocarbons represent the largest and most ancient group of phytochemicals, such that the entire chemical library of a plant is often referred to as its 'terpenome'. Besides having numerous pharmacological properties, terpenes contribute to the scent of the rose, the flavors of cinnamon and the yellow of sunflowers. Rapidly increasing -omics datasets provide an unprecedented opportunity for terpenome detection, paving the way for automated web resources dedicated to phytochemical predictions in genomic data. Results:We have developed Terzyme, a predictive algorithm for identification, classification and assignment of broad substrate unit to terpene synthase (TPS) and prenyl transferase (PT) enzymes, known to generate the enormous structural and functional diversity of terpenoid compounds across the plant kingdom. Terzyme uses sequence information, plant taxonomy and machine learning methods for predicting TPSs and PTs in genome and proteome datasets. We demonstrate a significant enrichment of the currently identified terpenome by running Terzyme on more than 40 plants. Conclusions:Terzyme is the result of a rigorous analysis of evolutionary relationships between hundreds of characterized sequences of TPSs and PTs with known specificities, followed by analysis of genome-wide gene distribution patterns, ontology based clustering and optimization of various parameters for building accurate profile Hidden Markov Models. The predictive webserver and database is freely available at http://nipgr.res.in/terzyme.html and would serve as a useful tool for deciphering the species-specific phytochemical potential of plant genomes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Seagrasses are marine angiosperms that live fully submerged in the sea. They evolved from land plant ancestors, with multiple species representing at least three independent return-to-the-sea events. This raises the question of whether these marine angiosperms followed the same adaptation pathway to allow them to live and reproduce under the hostile marine conditions. To compare the basis of marine adaptation between seagrass lineages, we generated genomic data for Halophila ovalis and compared this with recently published genomes for two members of Zosteraceae, as well as genomes of five non-marine plant species (Arabidopsis, Oryza sativa, Phoenix dactylifera, Musa acuminata, and Spirodela polyrhiza). Halophila and Zosteraceae represent two independent seagrass lineages separated by around 30 million years. Genes that were lost or conserved in both lineages were identified. All three species lost genes associated with ethylene and terpenoid biosynthesis, and retained genes related to salinity adaptation, such as those for osmoregulation. In contrast, the loss of the NADH dehydrogenase-like complex is unique to H. ovalis. Through comparison of two independent return-to-the-sea events, this study further describes marine adaptation characteristics common to seagrass families, identifies species-specific gene loss, and provides molecular evidence for convergent evolution in seagrass lineages.">

They represent one of the largest gene/protein families in the plant kingdom. The manual annotation of cytochrome P450 genes in the genome of Vitis vinifera PN40024 revealed 579 P450 sequences, including 279 complete genes. Most of the P450 sequences in grapevine genome are organized in physical clusters, resulting from tandem or segmental duplications. Although most of these clusters are small (2 to 35, median = 3), some P450 families, such as CYP76 and CYP82, underwent multiple duplications and form large clusters of homologous sequences. Analysis of gene expression revealed highly specific expression patterns, which are often the same within the genes in large physical clusters. Some of these genes are induced upon biotic stress, which points to their role in plant defense, whereas others are specifically activated during grape berry ripening and might be responsible for the production of berry-specific metabolites, such as aroma compounds. Our work provides an exhaustive and robust annotation including clear identification, structural organization, evolutionary dynamics and expression patterns for the grapevine cytochrome P450 families, paving the way to efficient functional characterization of genes involved in grapevine defense pathways and aroma biosynthesis.">

        <span class="abst" title="The sweet potato whitefly, &lt;i&gt;Bemisia tabaci&lt;/i&gt;, is one of the most invasive insect pests worldwide. The two most destructive whitefly cryptic species are MEAM1/B and MED/Q. Given that MED/Q has replaced MEAM1/B in China and the invasion of MED/Q has coincided with the outbreak of tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), we hypothesize that pre-infestation with viruliferous &lt;i&gt;B. tabaci&lt;/i&gt; will affect the subsequent host preferences. To test this hypothesis, we (1) conducted bioassays to compare the host preference of viruliferous and non-viruliferous MEAM1/B and MED/Q, respectively, on plants pre-infested with viruliferous and non-viruliferous MEAM1/B and MED/Q; (2) profiled plant volatiles using GC-MS; and (3) functionally characterized chemical cues could potentially modulate &lt;i&gt;B. tabaci&lt;/i&gt;-TYLCV-tomato interactions, including ρ-cymene, thujene and neophytadiene, using a Y-tube olfactometer. As a result, plants pre-infested with MEAM1/B whiteflies carrying TYLCV or not, did not attract more or less B or Q whiteflies. Plants pre-infested with non-viruliferous MED/Q resisted MEAM1/B but did not affect MED/Q. However, plants pre-infested with viruliferous MED/Q attracted more whiteflies. Feeding of viruliferous MED/Q reduced the production of ρ-cymene, and induced thujene and neophytadiene. Functionally analyses of these plant volatiles show that ρ-cymene deters while neophytadiene recruits whiteflies. These combined results suggest that pre-infestation with viruliferous MED/Q promotes the subsequent whitefly infestation and induces plant volatile neophytadiene which recruits whiteflies.">

Subcellular localization demonstrated that LiDXS and LiDXR are expressed in the chloroplasts. Ectopic expression in transgenic tobacco suggested that the flowers of &lt;i&gt;LiDXS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LiDXR&lt;/i&gt; transgenic lines accumulated substantially more diterpene, sclareol, compared to the plants transformed with empty vector. Surprisingly, increased content of the monoterpene, linalool and sesquiterpene, caryophyllene, were detected in the &lt;i&gt;LiDXR&lt;/i&gt; transgenic lines, whereas the emission of caryophyllene, increased in one of the &lt;i&gt;LiDXS&lt;/i&gt; transgenic tobacco lines, indicating that these two genes play significant roles in the synthesis of floral volatiles in the transgenic plants. These results demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;LiDXR&lt;/i&gt; can contribute to monoterpene biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;Lilium&lt;/i&gt; 'Siberia'; however, the role of &lt;i&gt;LiDXS&lt;/i&gt; in the biosynthesis of monoterpenes needs further study.">

        <span class="abst" title="The development of flower scents was a crucial event in biological evolution, providing olfactory signals by which plants can attract pollinators. In this study, bioinformatics, metabolomics, and biochemical and molecular methodologies were integrated to investigate the candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of volatile components in two cultivars of Freesia x hybrida, Red River® and Ambiance, which release different categories of compounds. We found that terpene synthase (TPS) genes were the pivotal genes determining spatiotemporal release of volatile compounds in both cultivars. Eight FhTPS genes were isolated and six were found to be functional: FhTPS1 was a single-product enzyme catalyzing the formation of linalool, whereas the other four FhTPS proteins were multi-product enzymes, among which FhTPS4, FhTPS6, and FhTPS7 could recognize geranyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate simultaneously. The FhTPS enzymatic products closely matched the volatile terpenes emitted from flowers, and significant correlations were found between release of volatile terpenes and FhTPS gene expression. Graphical models based on these results are proposed that summarize the biosynthesis of Freesia floral volatile terpenes. The characterization of FhTPS genes paves the way to decipher their roles in the speciation and fitness of Freesia, and this knowledge could also be used to introduce or enhance scent in other plants.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Osmanthus fragrans&lt;/i&gt;, or &quot;RiXiangGui&quot;, is an ornamental, woody, evergreen plant that is cultivated widely because it blooms recurrently and emits a strong fragrance. Recently, the germplasm resources, classification, and aroma compositions of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fragrans&lt;/i&gt; have been investigated. However, the molecular mechanisms of the floral scent formation and regulation have remained largely unknown. To obtain a global perspective on the molecular mechanism of the aroma formation during blooming, nine RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) libraries were constructed from three flowering stages: The initial, full, and final flowering stage. In short, a total of 523,961,310 high-quality clean reads were assembled into 136,611unigenes, with an average sequence length of 792 bp. About 47.43% of the unigenes (64,795) could be annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. A number of candidate genes were identified in the terpenoid metabolic pathways and 1327 transcription factors (TFs), which showed differential expression patterns among the floral scent formation stages, were also identified, especially &lt;i&gt;OfMYB1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;OfMYB6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;OfWRKY1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;OfWRKY3&lt;/i&gt;, which could play critical roles in the floral scent formation. These results indicated that the floral scent formation of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fragrans&lt;/i&gt; was a very complex process which involved a large number of TFs. This study provides reliable resources for further studies of the &lt;i&gt;O.fragrans&lt;/i&gt; floral scent formation.">

Their putative TPS proteins were phylogenetically positioned in a sole clade with the TPSs of other Camellia species. The obtained Tps genes, one of which was designated ChTps1 (ChTps1a), were introduced into mevalonate-pathway-engineered Escherichia coli, which carried the genes for utilizing acetoacetate as a substrate, and cultured in a medium including lithium acetoacetate. Volatile products generated in the E. coli cells transformed with ChTps1 were purified from the cell suspension culture, and analyzed by NMR. Consequently, the predominant product with ChTPS1 was identified as valerianol, indicating that the ChTps1 gene codes for valerianol synthase. This is the first report on a gene that can mediate the synthesis of valerianol. We next synthesized a Tps ortholog encoding ChTPS1variant R477H (named CsiTPS8), whose sequence had been isolated from a tea tree (Camellia sinensis), carried out similar culture experiment with the E. coli transformant including CsiTps8, and consequently found valerianol production equally. Furthermore, GC-MS analysis of several teas revealed that valerianol had been an unknown ingredient in green tea and black tea.">

Worldwide, more and more attention is deserved to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which establish symbioses with the roots of most land plants and facilitate plant nutrient uptake, by means of a large network of extraradical hyphae spreading from colonized roots to the surrounding soil and functioning as a supplementary absorbing system. AMF protect plants from biotic and abiotic stresses and are able to modulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (phytochemicals), such as polyphenols, anthocyanins, phytoestrogens and carotenoids, that play a fundamental role in promoting human health. An increasing number of studies focused on the use of AMF symbionts for the production of functional food, with enhanced nutritional and nutraceutical value. Yet, while several plant species were investigated, only few AMF were utilized, thus limiting the full exploitation of their wide physiological and genetic diversity. Here, we will focus on AMF effects on the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites with health-promoting activity, and on the criteria for a finely tuned, targeted selection of the best performing symbionts, to be utilized as sustainable biotechnological tools for the production of safe and healthy plant foods.">

Thus, understanding the molecular basis of terpene biosynthesis in some terpene-abundant Chinese medicinal plants is of great importance. Abundant in mono- and sesqui-terpenes, &lt;i&gt;Rhodomyrtus tomentosa&lt;/i&gt; (Ait.) Hassk, an evergreen shrub belonging to the family Myrtaceae, is widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, (+)-α-pinene and β-caryophyllene were detected to be the two major components in the leaves of &lt;i&gt;R. tomentosa&lt;/i&gt;, in which (+)-α-pinene is higher in the young leaves than in the mature leaves, whereas the distribution of β-caryophyllene is opposite. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of leaves identified 138 unigenes potentially involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. By integrating known biosynthetic pathways for terpenoids, 7 candidate genes encoding terpene synthase (RtTPS1-7) that potentially catalyze the last step in pinene and caryophyllene biosynthesis were further characterized. Sequence alignment analysis showed that RtTPS1, RtTPS3 and RtTPS4 do not contain typical N-terminal transit peptides (62-64aa), thus probably producing multiple isomers and enantiomers by terpenoid isomerization. Further enzyme activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; confirmed that RtTPS1-4 mainly produce (+)-α-pinene and (+)-β-pinene, as well as small amounts of (-)-α-pinene and (-)-β-pinene with GPP, while RtTPS1 and RtTPS3 are also active with FPP, producing β-caryophyllene, along with a smaller amount of α-humulene. Our results deepen the understanding of molecular mechanisms of terpenes biosynthesis in Myrtaceae.">

        <span class="abst" title="Tomato plants are attacked by diverse herbivorous arthropods, including by cell-content-feeding mites, such as the extreme generalist &lt;i&gt;Tetranychus urticae&lt;/i&gt; and specialists like &lt;i&gt;Tetranychus evansi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aculops lycopersici&lt;/i&gt;. Mite feeding induces plant defense responses that reduce mite performance. However, &lt;i&gt;T. evansi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. lycopersici&lt;/i&gt; suppress plant defenses via poorly understood mechanisms and, consequently, maintain a high performance on tomato. On a shared host, &lt;i&gt;T. urticae&lt;/i&gt; can be facilitated by either of the specialist mites, likely due to the suppression of plant defenses. To better understand defense suppression and indirect plant-mediated interactions between herbivorous mites, we used gene-expression microarrays to analyze the transcriptomic changes in tomato after attack by either a single mite species (&lt;i&gt;T. urticae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;T. evansi&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A. lycopersici&lt;/i&gt;) or two species simultaneously (&lt;i&gt;T. urticae&lt;/i&gt; plus &lt;i&gt;T. evansi&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;T. urticae&lt;/i&gt; plus &lt;i&gt;A. lycopersici&lt;/i&gt;). Additionally, we assessed mite-induced changes in defense-associated phytohormones using LC-MS/MS. Compared to non-infested controls, jasmonates (JAs) and salicylate (SA) accumulated to higher amounts upon all mite-infestation treatments, but the response was attenuated after single infestations with defense-suppressors. Strikingly, whereas 8 to 10% of tomato genes were differentially expressed upon single infestations with &lt;i&gt;T. urticae&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;A. lycopersici&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, only 0.1% was altered in &lt;i&gt;T. evansi&lt;/i&gt;-infested plants. Transcriptome analysis of dual-infested leaves revealed that &lt;i&gt;A. lycopersici&lt;/i&gt; primarily suppressed &lt;i&gt;T. urticae&lt;/i&gt;-induced JA defenses, while &lt;i&gt;T. evansi&lt;/i&gt; dampened &lt;i&gt;T. urticae&lt;/i&gt;-triggered host responses on a transcriptome-wide scale. The latter suggests that &lt;i&gt;T. evansi&lt;/i&gt; not solely down-regulates plant gene expression, but rather directs it back towards housekeeping levels. Our results provide valuable new insights into the mechanisms underlying host defense suppression and the plant-mediated facilitation of competing herbivores.">

The aroma, flavor and pharmaceutical value of Ocimum species is a significance of its essential oil, which contains most of the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. A large number of plants have been studied for characterization and identification of terpene synthase genes, involved in terpenoids biosynthesis. The goal of this study is to discover and identify the putative functional terpene synthase genes in O. sanctum. HMMER search was performed by using a set of 13 well sequenced and annotated plant genomes including the newly sequenced genome of O. sanctum with Pfam-A database locally, using HMMER 3.0 hmmsearch for the two Pfam domains (PF01397 and PF03936). Using this search method 81 putative terpene synthases genes (OsaTPS) were identified in O. sanctum; the study further reveals 47 OsaTPS were putatively functional genes, 19 partial OsaTPS, and 15 OsaTPS as probably pseudogenes. All these identified OsaTPS genes were compared with other plant species, and phylogenetic analysis reveals the subfamily classification of OsaTPS in TPS-a, -b, -c, -e, -f and TPS-g subfamilies clusters. This genome-wide identification of OsaTPS genes, their phylogenetic analysis and secondary metabolite pathway mapping predictions together provide a comprehensive understanding of the TPS gene family in Ocimum sanctum and offer opportunities for the characterization and functional validation of numbers of terpene synthase genes.">

We constructed a chromosome-level reference genome of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fragrans&lt;/i&gt; to assist in studies of the evolution, genetic diversity, and molecular mechanism of aroma development. A total of over 118 Gb of polished reads was produced from HiSeq (45.1 Gb) and PacBio Sequel (73.35 Gb), giving 100× depth coverage for long reads. The combination of Illumina-short reads, PacBio-long reads, and Hi-C data produced the final chromosome quality genome of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fragrans&lt;/i&gt; with a genome size of 727 Mb and a heterozygosity of 1.45 %. The genome was annotated using de novo and homology comparison and further refined with transcriptome data. The genome of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fragrans&lt;/i&gt; was predicted to have 45,542 genes, of which 95.68 % were functionally annotated. Genome annotation found 49.35 % as the repetitive sequences, with long terminal repeats (LTR) being the richest (28.94 %). Genome evolution analysis indicated the evidence of whole-genome duplication 15 million years ago, which contributed to the current content of 45,242 genes. Metabolic analysis revealed that linalool, a monoterpene is the main aroma compound. Based on the genome and transcriptome, we further demonstrated the direct connection between terpene synthases (TPSs) and the rich aromatic molecules in &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fragrans&lt;/i&gt;. We identified three new flower-specific &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes, of which the expression coincided with the production of linalool. Our results suggest that the high number of &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes and the flower tissue- and stage-specific &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes expressions might drive the strong unique aroma production of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fragrans&lt;/i&gt;.">

The santalene- and bergamotene-emitting transgenic tobacco plants thus generated were utilized to study host preference in the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae (Sulzer)). The results showed that co-expression of either 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) or truncated HMGR with santalene synthase led to the production of higher amounts of santalenes and bergamotene in transgenic tobacco plants, and that these santalene- and bergamotene-emitting plants were attractive to green peach aphids. We accordingly propose that such transgenic plants may have potential application in pest management as a trap crop to prevent green peach aphid infestation of wild-type tobacco plants.">

        <span class="abst" title="In nature, plants are frequently subjected to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses, resulting in a convergence of adaptive responses. We hypothesised that hormonal signalling regulating defences to different herbivores may interact with drought responses, causing distinct resistance phenotypes. To test this, we studied the hormonal and transcriptomic responses of &lt;i&gt;Solanum dulcamara&lt;/i&gt; subjected to drought and herbivory by the generalist &lt;i&gt;Spodoptera exigua&lt;/i&gt; (beet armyworm; BAW) or the specialist &lt;i&gt;Leptinotarsa decemlineata&lt;/i&gt; (Colorado potato beetle; CPB). Bioassays showed that the performance of BAW, but not CPB, decreased on plants under drought compared to controls. While drought did not alter BAW-induced hormonal responses, it enhanced the CPB-induced accumulation of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid (SA), and suppressed ethylene (ET) emission. Microarray analyses showed that under drought, BAW herbivory enhanced several herbivore-induced responses, including cell-wall remodelling and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and secondary metabolites. In contrast, CPB herbivory enhanced several photosynthesis-related and pathogen responses in drought-stressed plants. This may divert resources away from defence production and increase leaf nutritive value. In conclusion, while BAW suffers from the drought-enhanced defences, CPB may benefit from the effects of enhanced SA and reduced ET signalling. This suggests that the fine-tuned interaction between the plant and its specialist herbivore is sustained under drought.">

        <span class="abst" title="Genetic manipulation of genes to upregulate specific branches of metabolic pathways is a method that is commonly used to improve fruit quality. However, the use of a single gene to impact several metabolic pathways is difficult. Here, we show that overexpression of the single gene SlMYB75 (SlMYB75-OE) is effective at improving multiple fruit quality traits. In these engineered fruits, the anthocyanin content reached 1.86 mg g-1 fresh weight at the red-ripe stage, and these SlMYB75-OE tomatoes displayed a series of physiological changes, including delayed ripening and increased ethylene production. In addition to anthocyanin, the total contents of phenolics, flavonoids and soluble solids in SlMYB75-OE fruits were enhanced by 2.6, 4, and 1.2 times, respectively, compared to those of wild-type (WT) fruits. Interestingly, a number of aroma volatiles, such as aldehyde, phenylpropanoid-derived and terpene volatiles, were significantly increased in SlMYB75-OE fruits, with some terpene volatiles showing more than 10 times higher levels than those in WT fruits. Consistent with the metabolic assessment, transcriptomic profiling indicated that the genes involved in the ethylene signaling, phenylpropanoid and isoprenoid pathways were greatly upregulated in SlMYB75-OE fruits. Yeast one-hybrid and transactivation assays revealed that SlMYB75 is able to directly bind to the MYBPLANT and MYBPZM cis-regulatory elements and to activate the promoters of the LOXC, AADC2 and TPS genes. The identification of SlMYB75 as a key regulator of fruit quality attributes through the transcriptional regulation of downstream genes involved in several metabolic pathways opens new avenues towards engineering fruits with a higher sensory and nutritional quality.">

        <span class="abst" title="Whiteflies, Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera), are pests causing economic damage to many crops, capable of transmitting hundreds of plant vector-borne viruses. They are believed to secrete salivary protein effectors that can improve vector colonization and reproductive fitness in host plants. However, little is known about effector biology and the precise mechanism of action of whitefly effectors. Here, we report a functional screening of B. tabaci salivary effector proteins (Bsp) capable of modulating plant innate immunity triggered by plant endogenous pattern peptide Pep1. Four immunity suppressors and two elicitors were identified. Bsp9, the most effective immunity suppressor, was further identified to directly interact with an immunity regulator WRKY33. We provide evidence that Bsp9 may suppress plant immune signalling by interfering with the interaction between WRKY33 and a central regulator in the MAPK cascade. The interference by Bsp9 therefore reduces plant resistance to whitefly by inhibiting activation of WRKY33-regulated immunity-related genes. Further detailed analysis based on transgenic plants found that whitefly effector Bsp9 could promote whitefly preference and performance, increasing virus transmission. This study enriches our knowledge on insect effector biology. This article is part of the theme issue 'Biotic signalling sheds light on smart pest management'.">

In this study, integrative comparative analyses of transcriptomics and metabolomics data were performed to uncover the regulatory network in CI tomato fruit. Metabolite profiling analysis found that 7 amino acids, 27 organic acids, 16 of sugars and 22 other compounds had a significantly different content while transcriptomics data showed 1735 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were down-regulated and 1369 were up-regulated in cold-stored fruit. We found that the contents of citrate, cis-aconitate and succinate were increased, which were consistent with the expression of ATP-citrate synthase (ACS) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes in cold-treated tomato fruit. Cold stress promotes the expression of ACS and IDH which may increase the synthesis of citrate, cis-aconitate and succinate. Alanine and leucine had increased contents, which may result from alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BcAT)'s high expression levels, respectively. Overall the transcriptomics and metabolomics data in our study explain the molecular mechanisms of the chilling injury and expands our understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms of a metabolic network in response to chilling injury in tomato fruit.">

However, little is known about the role of terpenoids in response to various adverse environmental stresses as other plants do in the form of signals during plant-environment interactions.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, trace amounts of volatiles consisting of α-santalene, epi-β-santalene, β-santalene, α-santalol, β-santalol, (E)-α-bergamotene, (E)-β-farnesene and β-bisabolene were found in the leaves of mature S. album trees. We identified more than 40 candidate terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes by mining publicly-available RNA-seq data and characterized the enzymes encoded by three cDNAs: one mono-TPS catalyzes the formation of mostly α-terpineol, and two multifunctional sesqui-TPSs, one of which produces (E)-α-bergamotene and sesquisabinene as major products and another which catalyzes the formation of (E)-β-farnesene, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol as main products. Metabolite signatures and gene expression studies confirmed that santalol content is closely related with santalene synthase (SaSSY) transcripts in heartwood, which is key enzyme responsible for santalol biosynthesis. However, the expression of three new SaTPS genes differed significantly from SaSSY in the essential oil-producing heartwood. Increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, were detected in different tissues of S. album plants after applying 1 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 1 mM salicylic acid (SA), or exposure to 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity. MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of SaTPS1 and SaTPS2 in leaves. SaTPS1 to 3 transcripts were differentially activated among different tissues under adverse temperature and light stresses. In contrast, almost all SaSSY transcripts decreased in response to these environmental stresses, unlike SaTPS1 to 3.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Multifunctional enzymes were biochemically characterized, including one chloroplastic mono-TPS and two cytosolic sesqui-TPSs in sandalwood. Our results suggest the ecological importance of these three new SaTPS genes in defensive response to biotic attack and abiotic stresses in S. album.">

Arboviruses, including many bunyaviruses, manipulate vector behavior to accelerate their own transmission to vertebrates, birds, insects, and plants. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this manipulation remains elusive. Here, we report that the non-structural protein NSs of Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus, a prototype of the Tospoviridae family and the Orthotospovirus genus, is a key viral factor that indirectly modifies vector preference and increases vector performance. NSs suppresses the biosynthesis of plant volatile monoterpenes, which serve as repellents of the vector western flower thrips (WFT, Frankliniella occidentalis). NSs directly interacts with MYC2, the jasmonate (JA) signaling master regulator and its two close homologs MYC3 and MYC4, to disable JA-mediated activation of terpene synthase genes. The dysfunction of the MYCs subsequently attenuates host defenses, increases the attraction of thrips, and improves thrips fitness. Moreover, MYC2 associated with NSs of Tomato zonate spot orthotospovirus, another Euro/Asian-type orthotospovirus, suggesting that MYC2 is an evolutionarily conserved target of Orthotospovirus species for suppression of terpene-based resistance to promote vector performance. These findings elucidate the molecular mechanism through which an orthotospovirus indirectly manipulates vector behaviors and therefore facilitates pathogen transmission. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which Orthotospovirus NSs counteracts plant immunity for pathogen transmission.">

The growing experimental evidence on this latter topic looks promising, and paves the way toward the development of &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; strains and/or consortia active against multiple targets. However, the predictability and reproducibility of the effects that these beneficial fungi is still somewhat limited by the lack of an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the specificity of their interaction with different crop varieties, and on how the environmental factors modulate this interaction. To fill this research gap, here we studied the transcriptome changes in tomato plants (cultivar &quot;Dwarf San Marzano&quot;) induced by &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma harzianum&lt;/i&gt; (strain T22) colonization and subsequent infestation by the aphid &lt;i&gt;Macrosiphum euphorbiae&lt;/i&gt;. A wide transcriptome reprogramming, related to metabolic processes, regulation of gene expression and defense responses, was induced both by separate experimental treatments, which showed a synergistic interaction when concurrently applied. The most evident expression changes of defense genes were associated with the multitrophic interaction &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt;-tomato-aphid. Early and late genes involved in direct defense against insects were induced (i.e., &lt;i&gt;peroxidase, GST, kinases and polyphenol oxidase, miraculin, chitinase&lt;/i&gt;), along with indirect defense genes, such as &lt;i&gt;sesquiterpene synthase&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;geranylgeranyl phosphate synthase&lt;/i&gt;. Targeted and untargeted semi-polar metabolome analysis revealed a wide metabolome alteration showing an increased accumulation of isoprenoids in &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; treated plants. The wide array of transcriptomic and metabolomics changes nicely fit with the higher mortality of aphids when feeding on &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; treated plants, herein reported, and with the previously observed attractiveness of these latter toward the aphid parasitoid &lt;i&gt;Aphidius ervi&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; treated plants showed the over-expression of transcripts coding for several families of defense-related transcription factors (bZIP, MYB, NAC, AP2-ERF, WRKY), suggesting that the fungus contributes to the priming of plant responses against pest insects. Collectively, our data indicate that &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; treatment of tomato plants induces transcriptomic and metabolomic changes, which underpin both direct and indirect defense responses.">

        <span class="abst" title="Numerous microbial root symbionts are known to induce different levels of enhanced plant protection against a variety of pathogens. However, more recent studies have demonstrated that beneficial microbes are able to induce plant systemic resistance that confers some degree of protection against insects. Here, we report how treatments with the fungal biocontrol agent &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma atroviride&lt;/i&gt; strain P1 in tomato plants induce responses that affect pest insects with different feeding habits: the noctuid moth &lt;i&gt;Spodoptera littoralis&lt;/i&gt; (Boisduval) and the aphid &lt;i&gt;Macrosiphum euphorbiae&lt;/i&gt; (Thomas). We observed that the tomato plant-&lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; P1 interaction had a negative impact on the development of moth larvae and on aphid longevity. These effects were attributed to a plant response induced by &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; that was associated with transcriptional changes of a wide array of defense-related genes. While the impact on aphids could be related to the up-regulation of genes involved in the oxidative burst reaction, which occur early in the defense reaction, the negative performance of moth larvae was associated with the enhanced expression of genes encoding for protective enzymes (i.e., Proteinase inhibitor I (PI), Threonine deaminase, Leucine aminopeptidase A1, Arginase 2, and Polyphenol oxidase) that are activated downstream in the defense cascade. In addition, &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; P1 produced alterations in plant metabolic pathways leading to the production and release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are involved in the attraction of the aphid parasitoid &lt;i&gt;Aphidius ervi&lt;/i&gt;, thus reinforcing the indirect plant defense barriers. Our findings, along with the evidence available in the literature, indicate that the outcome of the tripartite interaction among plant, &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt;, and pests is highly specific and only a comprehensive approach, integrating both insect phenotypic changes and plant transcriptomic alterations, can allow a reliable prediction of its potential for plant protection.">

Although some terpene synthases have been characterized, terpenoids and their biosynthesis in wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;aestivum&lt;/i&gt; L.) still remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the identification of a terpene synthase gene in wheat. It encodes a sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes β-patchoulene formation with &lt;i&gt;E,E&lt;/i&gt;-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrate, thus named as TaPS. TaPS exhibits inducible expression in wheat in response to various elicitations. Particularly, alamethicin treatment strongly induces &lt;i&gt;TaPS&lt;/i&gt; gene expression and β-patchoulene accumulation in wheat. Overexpression of &lt;i&gt;TaPS&lt;/i&gt; in Arabidopsis successfully produces β-patchoulene, verifying the biochemical function of TaPS in planta. Furthermore, these transgenic Arabidopsis plants exhibit resistance against herbivory by repelling beet armyworm larvae feeding, thereby indicating anti-herbivory activity of β-patchoulene. The catalytic mechanism of TaPS is also explored by homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. Two key amino acids are identified to act in protonation and stability of intermediates and product formation. Taken together, one wheat sesquiterpene synthase is identified as β-patchoulene synthase. TaPS exhibits inducible gene expression and the sesquiterpene β-patchoulene is involved in repelling insect infestation.">

Infected plants accumulated begomoviral βC1 proteins in the phloem where they were bound to the plant transcription factor WRKY20. This viral hijacking of WRKY20 spatiotemporally redeployed plant chemical immunity within the leaf and had the asymmetrical benefiting effects on the begomoviruses and its whitefly vectors while negatively affecting two nonvector competitors. This type of interaction between a parasite and two types of herbivores, i.e., vectors and nonvectors, occurs widely in various natural and agricultural ecosystems; thus, our results have broad implications for the ecological significance of parasite-vector-host tripartite interactions.">

This is particularly evident in the case of monoterpenoid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the canonical terpene precursor geranyl diphosphate is tightly coupled to the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds essential for yeast viability. Here, we establish a synthetic orthogonal monoterpenoid pathway based on an alternative precursor, neryl diphosphate. We identify structural determinants of isomeric substrate selectivity in monoterpene synthases and engineer five different enzymes to accept the alternative substrate with improved efficiency and specificity. We combine the engineered enzymes with dynamic regulation of metabolic flux to harness the potential of the orthogonal substrate and improve the production of industrially-relevant monoterpenes by several-fold compared to the canonical pathway. This approach highlights the introduction of synthetic metabolism as an effective strategy for high-value compound production.">

Most &lt;i&gt;Thymus&lt;/i&gt; molecular research has focused on the determining the phylogenetic relationships between different species, but no published work has focused on the evolution of the transcriptome across the genus to elucidate genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Hence, in this study, the transcriptomes of five different &lt;i&gt;Thymus&lt;/i&gt; species were generated and analyzed to mine putative genes involved in thymol and carvacrol biosynthesis. High-throughput sequencing produced ~43 million high-quality reads per sample, which were assembled de novo using several tools, then further subjected to a quality evaluation. The best assembly for each species was used as queries to search within the UniProt, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) and TF (Transcription Factors) databases. Mining the transcriptomes resulted in the identification of 592 single-copy orthogroups used for phylogenetic analysis. The data showed strongly support a close genetic relationship between &lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Thymus daenensis.&lt;/i&gt; Additionally, this study dates the speciation events between 1.5-2.1 and 9-10.2 MYA according to different methodologies.

        <span class="abst" title="Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) play important ecological roles in defense against stresses. In contrast to model plants, reports on HIPV formation and function in crops are limited. Tea (&lt;i&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/i&gt;) is an important crop in China. α-Farnesene is a common HIPV produced in tea plants in response to different herbivore attacks. In this study, a &lt;i&gt;C. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; α-farnesene synthase (CsAFS) was isolated, cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized. The CsAFS recombinant protein produced in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was able to transform farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into α-farnesene and also convert geranyl diphosphate (GPP) to β-ocimene &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, transient expression analysis in &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; plants indicated that CsAFS was located in the cytoplasm and could convert FPP to α-farnesene in plants. Wounding, to simulate herbivore damage, activated jasmonic acid (JA) formation, which significantly enhanced the &lt;i&gt;CsAFS&lt;/i&gt; expression level and α-farnesene content. This suggested that herbivore-derived wounding induced α-farnesene formation in tea leaves. Furthermore, the emitted α-farnesene might act as a signal to activate antibacterial-related factors in neighboring undamaged tea leaves. This research advances our understanding of the formation and signaling roles of common HIPVs in crops such as tea plants.">

        <span class="abst" title="Tea aroma is a key indicator for evaluating tea quality. Although notable success in tea aroma improvement has been achieved with heterosis breeding technology, the molecular basis underlying heterosis remains largely unexplored. Thus, the present report studies the tea plant volatile heterosis using a high-throughput next-generation RNA-seq strategy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Phenotypically, we found higher terpenoid volatile and green leaf volatile contents by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the F1 hybrids than in their parental lines. Volatile heterosis was obvious in both F1 hybrids. At the molecular level, the comparative transcriptomics analysis revealed that approximately 41% (9027 of 21,995) of the genes showed non-additive expression, whereas only 7.83% (1723 of 21,995) showed additive expression. Among the non-additive genes, 42.1% showed high parental dominance and 17.6% showed over-dominance. Among different expression genes with high parental dominance and over-dominance expression patterns, KEGG and GO analyses found that plant hormone signal transduction, tea plant physiological process related pathways and most pathways associated with tea tree volatiles were enriched. In addition, we identified multiple genes (CsDXS, CsAATC2, CsSPLA2, etc.) and transcription factors (CsMYB1, CsbHLH79, CsWRKY40, etc.) that played important roles in tea volatile heterosis. Based on transcriptome and metabolite profiling, we conclude that non-additive action plays a major role in tea volatile heterosis. Genes and transcription factors involved in tea volatiles showing over-dominance expression patterns can be considered candidate genes and provide novel clues for breeding high-volatile tea varieties.">

However, the molecular basis of the production of pyrethrins by T. cinerariifolium has yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we present the 7.1-Gb draft genome of T. cinerariifolium, consisting of 2,016,451 scaffolds and 60,080 genes predicted with high confidence. Notably, analyses of transposable elements (TEs) indicated that TEs occupy 33.84% of the genome sequence. Furthermore, TEs of the sire and oryco clades were found to be enriched in the T. cinerariifolium-specific evolutionary lineage, occupying a total of 13% of the genome sequence, a proportion approximately 8-fold higher than that in other plants. InterProScan analysis demonstrated that biodefense-related toxic proteins (e.g., ribosome inactivating proteins), signal transduction-related proteins (e.g., histidine kinases), and metabolic enzymes (e.g., lipoxygenases, acyl-CoA dehydrogenases/oxygenases, and P450s) are also highly enriched in the T. cinerariifolium genome. Molecular phylogenetic analysis detected a variety of enzymes with genus-specific multiplication, including both common enzymes and others that appear to be specific to pyrethrin biosynthesis. Together, these data identify possible novel components of the pyrethrin biosynthesis pathway and provide new insights into the unique genomic features of T. cinerariifolium.">

        <span class="abst" title="Oolong tea is a popular and semi-fermented beverage. During the processing of tea leaves, withering is the first indispensable process for improving flavor. However, the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and the characteristic secondary metabolites during the withering of oolong tea leaves remain unknown. In this study, phytochemical analyses indicated that total polyphenols, flavonoids, catechins, epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin gallate (CG), gallocatechin gallate (GCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were all less abundant in the solar-withered leaves (SW) than in the fresh leaves (FL) and indoor-withered leaves (IW). In contrast, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) contents were higher in the SW than in the FL and IW. By analyzing the transcriptome data, we detected 32,036 lncRNAs. On the basis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, the flavonoid metabolic pathway, the terpenoid metabolic pathway, and the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway were enriched pathways. Additionally, 63 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) and 23 target genes were identified related to the three pathways. A comparison of the expression profiles of the DE-lncRNAs and their target genes between the SW and IW revealed four up-regulated genes (FLS, CCR, CAD, and HCT), seven up-regulated lncRNAs, four down-regulated genes (4CL, CHI, F3H, and F3'H), and three down-regulated lncRNAs related to flavonoid metabolism; nine up-regulated genes (DXS, CMK, HDS, HDR, AACT, MVK, PMK, GGPPS, and TPS), three up-regulated lncRNAs, and six down-regulated lncRNAs related to terpenoid metabolism; as well as six up-regulated genes (LOX, AOS, AOC, OPR, ACX, and MFP2), four up-regulated lncRNAs, and three down-regulated lncRNAs related to JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction. These results suggested that the expression of DE-lncRNAs and their targets involved in the three pathways may be related to the low abundance of the total polyphenols, flavonoids, and catechins (EGC, CG, GCG, ECG, and EGCG) and the high abundance of terpenoids in the SW. Moreover, solar irradiation, high JA and MeJA contents, and the endogenous target mimic (eTM)-related regulatory mechanism in the SW were also crucial for increasing the terpenoid levels. These findings provide new insights into the greater contribution of solar-withering to the high-quality flavor of oolong tea compared with the effects of indoor-withering.">

Totally 80 TPS-like genes were identified. Twenty-three CsTPS genes possessed a complete coding sequence and most likely were functional. The remaining 57 in the currently available database lack essential gene structure or full-length transcripts. Distinct tempo-spatial expression patterns of CsTPS genes were found in tea plants. 17 genes were substantially expressed in all the tested organs with a few exceptions. The other 17 were predominantly expressed in leaves whereas additional eight were primarily expressed in flowers. Under the treatments of cold acclimation, salt and polyethylene glycol, CsTPS67, -69 and -71 were all suppressed and the inhibited expression of many others were found in multiple stress treatments. However, methyl jasmonate resulted in the enhanced expression of the majority of CsTPS genes. These transcription data were largely validated using qPCR. Moreover, volatile terpenoid profiling with leaves, flowers and stress-treated plants revealed a general association between the abundances of mono- and sesqui-terpenoids and some CsTPS genes. These results provide vital information for future studies on CsTPS regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis.">

These events have mainly been studied in model plants, rather than crop plants. Our study showed that tea green leafhopper (Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Matsuda), a major pest infesting tea attack significantly induced the emission of geraniol from tea leaves, but did not affect the crude enzyme activity of geraniol synthase in tea leaves. An enzyme extract of E. (M.) onukii specifically produced geraniol from geraniol diphosphate. Furthermore, a terpene synthase (EoTPS) was isolated from E. (M.) onukii. This terpene synthase was able to convert geraniol diphosphate to geraniol in vitro. In addition, geraniol had in vitro ability to inhibit the growth of Acinetobacter johnsonii that is endobacterial isolated from E. (M.) onukii. This information illustrates that elicitors from piercing-sucking insects can induce the formation of volatiles from crop plants and advances our understanding of the roles of plant volatiles in the interaction among crops-insects-microorganisms.">

Forty-one terpenes including 26 monoterpenes, 14 sesquiterpenes and one triterpene were detected and 82 terpenes related genes were identified from five tissues of tea plants. Pearson correlation analysis resulted in genes to metabolites network. One terpene synthases whose expression positively correlated with farnesene were selected and its function was confirmed involved in the biosynthesis of α-farnesene, β-ocimene and β-farnesene, a very important and conserved alarm pheromone in response to aphids by both in vitro enzymatic assay in planta function analysis.

Here we report the 409-megabase genome sequence of the blue-petal water lily (Nymphaea colorata). Our phylogenomic analyses support Amborellales and Nymphaeales as successive sister lineages to all other extant angiosperms. The N. colorata genome and 19 other water lily transcriptomes reveal a Nymphaealean whole-genome duplication event, which is shared by Nymphaeaceae and possibly Cabombaceae. Among the genes retained from this whole-genome duplication are homologues of genes that regulate flowering transition and flower development. The broad expression of homologues of floral ABCE genes in N. colorata might support a similarly broadly active ancestral ABCE model of floral organ determination in early angiosperms. Water lilies have evolved attractive floral scents and colours, which are features shared with mesangiosperms, and we identified their putative biosynthetic genes in N. colorata. The chemical compounds and biosynthetic genes behind floral scents suggest that they have evolved in parallel to those in mesangiosperms. Because of its unique phylogenetic position, the N. colorata genome sheds light on the early evolution of angiosperms.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Matricaria recutita (German chamomile) and Chamaemelum nobile (Roman chamomile) belong to the botanical family Asteraceae. These two herbs are not only morphologically distinguishable, but their secondary metabolites - especially the essential oils present in flowers are also different, especially the terpenoids. The aim of this project was to preliminarily identify regulatory mechanisms in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathways that differ between German and Roman chamomile by performing comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. RESULTS:We determined the content of essential oils in disk florets and ray florets in these two chamomile species, and found that the terpenoid content in flowers of German chamomile is greater than that of Roman chamomile. In addition, a comparative RNA-seq analysis of German and Roman chamomile showed that 54% of genes shared &gt; 75% sequence identity between the two species. In particular, more highly expressed DEGs (differentially expressed genes) and TF (transcription factor) genes, different regulation of CYPs (cytochrome P450 enzymes), and rapid evolution of downstream genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway of German chamomile could be the main reasons to explain the differences in the types and levels of terpenoid compounds in these two species. In addition, a phylogenetic tree constructed from single copy genes showed that German chamomile and Roman chamomile are closely related to Chrysanthemum nankingense. CONCLUSION:This work provides the first insights into terpenoid biosynthesis in two species of chamomile. The candidate unigenes related to terpenoid biosynthesis will be important in molecular breeding approaches to modulate the essential oil composition of Matricaria recutita and Chamaemelum nobile.">

        <span class="abst" title="Allelochemicals that are present in trichome secretions of wild tomato species play a major role in mediating interactions with arthropods, often conferring a high level of resistance via antibiosis and antixenosis. Many accessions of the wild tomato relative, Solanum habrochaites (S.h), possess high levels of resistance to arthropods. The monocyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, 7-epi-zingiberene, is a major defensive component found in trichome secretions of certain accessions of S.h. We have used LA2329, an S.h. accession, as a donor in a breeding program designed to introgress zingiberene into cultivated tomato. However, the composition of trichome secretions in our population of LA2329 is segregating, with some individuals producing mainly 7-epi-zingiberene in their secretions while others producing two additional, unidentified compounds in their trichome secretions. To investigate if these other compounds may also contribute to arthropod resistance, trichome secretions were collected from plants of S.h LA2329 grown under greenhouse conditions and then major compounds were isolated by silica gel column chromatography and tested for their ability to repel two spotted-spider mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae. Isolation and identification of allelochemicals were aided by use of gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The results revealed the presence of three predominate chromatographic peaks: 7-epi-zingiberene, 9-hydroxy zingiberene, and 9-hydroxy,10,11-epoxy-zingiberene. Results of testing isolated compounds for repellency to TSSM using bridge bioassays revealed that the repellent activities of 9-hydroxy zingiberene and 9-hydroxy,10,11-epoxy-zingiberene were each significantly higher than that for 7-epi-zingiberene. These results support the idea that the degree of repellency may differ among plant allelochemicals and also emphasize the potential value of introgressing the presence of 9-hydroxy zingiberene and 9-hydroxy,10,11-epoxy-zingiberene into cultivated tomato to enhance its arthropod resistance.">

The metabolites from trichomes have been well characterized in tea products. However, little is known regarding the metabolites in fresh tea trichomes and the molecular differences in trichomes and tea leaves per se. In this study, we developed a method to collect trichomes from tea plant tender shoots, and their main secondary metabolites, including catechins, caffeine, amino acids, and aroma compounds, were determined. We found that the majority of these compounds were significantly less abundant in trichomes than in tea leaves. RNA-Seq was used to investigate the differences in the molecular regulatory mechanism between trichomes and leaves to gain further insight into the differences in trichomes and tea leaves. In total, 52.96 Gb of clean data were generated, and 6560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 4471 upregulated and 2089 downregulated genes, were identified in the trichomes vs. leaves comparison. Notably, the structural genes of the major metabolite biosynthesis pathways, transcription factors, and other key DEGs were identified and comparatively analyzed between trichomes and leaves, while trichome-specific genes were also identified. Our results provide new insights into the differences between tea trichomes and leaves at the metabolic and transcriptomic levels, and open up new doors to further recognize and re-evaluate the role of trichomes in tea quality formation and tea plant growth and development.">

Phylogenomic analyses show phylogenetic discordance at the position of Magnoliids, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting during the divergence of monocots, eudicots, and Magnoliids. An ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) event occurred just before the divergence of Laurales and Magnoliales; subsequently, independent WGDs occurred almost simultaneously in the three Lauralean lineages. The phylogenetic relationships within Lauraceae correspond to the divergence of inflorescences, as evidenced by the phylogeny of FUWA, a conserved gene involved in determining panicle architecture in Lauraceae. Monoterpene synthases responsible for production of specific volatile compounds in Lauraceae are functionally verified.

        <span class="abst" title="Crocus sativus, containing remarkably amounts of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, is the source of saffron with tremendous medicinal, economic and cultural importance. Here, we present a high-quality full-length transcriptome of the sterile triploid C. sativus, using the PacBio SMRT sequencing technology. This yields 31,755 high-confidence predictions of protein-coding genes, with 50.1% forming paralogous gene pairs. Analysis on distribution of Ks values suggests that the current genome of C. sativus is probably a product resulting from at least two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) events occurred at ~28 and ~114 million years ago (Mya), respectively. We provide evidence demonstrating that the recent β WGD event confers a major impact on family expansion of secondary metabolite genes, possibly leading to an enhanced accumulation of three distinct compounds: crocin, picrocrocin and safranal. Phylogenetic analysis unravels that the founding member (CCD2) of CCD enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of apocarotenoids in C. sativus might be evolved from the CCD1 family via the β WGD event. Based on the gene expression profiling, CCD2 is found to be expressed at an extremely high level in the stigma. These findings may shed lights on further genomic refinement of the characteristic biosynthesis pathways and promote germplasm utilization for the improvement of saffron quality.">

The short reads were assembled into contigs using the Trinity software and annotated against the Uniprot database. The reads were de novo assembled into 103,367 contigs, which represented 92.8% transcriptome completeness and a diverse set of Gene Ontology terms. Differential expression analysis identified 6151 and 8116 contigs significantly upregulated in the leaf and root tissues, respectively. In addition, we identified 30 contigs belonging to the Terpene synthase (TPS) family and demonstrated their evolutionary relationships to tomato TPS family members. Finally, we characterized the expression of &lt;i&gt;S. hispanica&lt;/i&gt; TPS members in leaves subjected to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments. Abscisic acid had the most pronounced effect on the expression of the TPS genes tested in this study. Our work provides valuable community resources for future studies aimed at improving and utilizing the beneficial constituents of this emerging healthy food source.">

In this study, a limonene production process was developed with metabolically engineered &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; at the bioreactor scale.

The feasibility of glycerol as the sole carbon source for cell growth and limonene synthesis was examined, and it was applied in an optimized fermentation setup.

D. carota tissues produce an essential oil that is rich in volatile terpenes and plays a major role in carrot aroma and flavor. Although terpene composition represents a critical quality attribute of carrots, little is known about the biosynthesis of terpenes in this crop. Here, we functionally characterized 19 terpene synthase (TPS) genes in an orange carrot (genotype DH1) and compared tissue-specific expression profiles and in vitro products of their recombinant proteins with volatile terpene profiles from DH1 and four other colored carrot genotypes. In addition to the previously reported (E)-β-caryophyllene synthase (DcTPS01), we biochemically characterized several TPS proteins with direct correlations to major compounds of carrot flavor and aroma including germacrene D (DcTPS7/11), γ-terpinene (DcTPS30) and α-terpinolene (DcTPS03). Random forest analysis of volatiles from colored carrot cultivars identified nine terpenes that were clearly distinct among the cultivars and likely contribute to differences in sensory quality. Correlation of TPS gene expression and terpene metabolite profiles supported the function of DcTPS01 and DcTPS03 in these cultivars. Our findings provide a roadmap for future breeding efforts to enhance carrot flavor and aroma.">

However, little is known about the molecular and genetic resources of this long-lived conifer. Herein, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four organs of &lt;i&gt;P. chienii&lt;/i&gt; using the PacBio Isoform Sequencing and Illumina RNA Sequencing platforms. Based on the PacBio Iso-Seq data, we obtained 44,896, 58,082, 50,485, and 67,638 full-length unigenes from the root, stem, leaf, and strobilus, respectively, with a mean length of 2692 bp, and a mean N50 length of 3010.75 bp. We then comprehensively annotated these unigenes. The number of organ-specific expressed unigenes ranged from 4393 in leaf to 9124 in strobilus, suggesting their special roles in physiological processes, organ development, and adaptability in the different four organs. A total of 16,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the four organs and clustered into six subclusters. The gene families related to biotic/abiotic factors, including the TPS, CYP450, and HSP families, were characterized. The expression levels of most DEGs in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and plant-pathogen interactions were higher in the root than in the three other organs, suggesting that root constitutes the main organ of defensive compound synthesis and accumulation and has a stronger ability to respond to stress. The sequences were analyzed to predict transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, and alternative splicing events. The expression levels of most DEGs of C2H2, C3H, bHLH, and bZIP families in the root and stem were higher than those in the leaf and strobilus, indicating that these TFs may play a crucial role in the survival of the root and stem. These results comprise the first comprehensive gene expression profiles obtained for different organs of &lt;i&gt;P. chienii&lt;/i&gt;. Our findings will facilitate further studies on the functional genomics, adaptive evolution, and phylogeny of &lt;i&gt;P. chienii&lt;/i&gt;, and lay the foundation for the development of conservation strategies for this endangered conifer.">

        <span class="abst" title="Wintersweet (&lt;i&gt;Chimonanthus praecox&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an ornamental and economically significant shrub known for its unique flowering characteristics, especially the emission of abundant floral volatile organic compounds. Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanism of the production of these compounds is necessary to create new breeds with high volatile production. In this study, two &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; transcription factors (&lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CpbHLH13&lt;/i&gt;) of Wintersweet H29 were functionally characterized to illustrate their possible role in the production of volatile compounds. The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CpbHLH13&lt;/i&gt; increased from the flower budding to full bloom stage, indicating that these two genes may play an essential role in blooming and aroma production in wintersweet. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis revealed that the overexpression of &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt; in arabidopsis (&lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;AtMYC2-2&lt;/i&gt; mutant (Salk_083483) and tobacco (&lt;i&gt;Nicotiana tabaccum&lt;/i&gt;) genotype Petit Havana SR1 significantly increased floral volatile monoterpene, especially linalool, while the overexpression of &lt;i&gt;CpbHLH13&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) and tobacco genotype SR1 increased floral sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene production in both types of transgenic plants respectively. High expression of terpene synthase (TPS) genes in transgenic &lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt; along with high expression of &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CpbHLH13&lt;/i&gt; in transgenic plants was also observed. The application of a combination of methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) showed an increment in linalool production in &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt;-overexpressing arabidopsis plants, and the high transcript level of TPS genes also suggested the involvement of &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2&lt;/i&gt; in the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway. These results indicate that both the &lt;i&gt;CpMYC2 and CpbHLH13&lt;/i&gt; transcription factors of wintersweet are possibly involved in the positive regulation and biosynthesis of monoterpene (linalool) and sesquiterpene (β-caryophyllene) in transgenic plants. This study also indicates the potential application of wintersweet as a valuable genomic material for the genetic modification of floral scent in other flowering plants that produce less volatile compounds.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Key message&lt;/h4&gt;Distinct catalytic features of the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily arose early in grass evolution and the reactions catalyzed have become more complex with time. The structural diversity of terpenes found in nature is mainly determined by terpene synthases (TPS). TPS enzymes accept ubiquitous prenyl diphosphates as substrates and convert them into the various terpene skeletons by catalyzing a carbocation-driven reaction. Based on their sequence similarity, terpene synthases from land plants can be divided into different subfamilies, TPS-a to TPS-h. In this study, we aimed to understand the evolution and functional diversification of the TPS-a subfamily in the Poaceae (the grass family), a plant family that contains important crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum. Sequence comparisons showed that aside from one clade shared with other monocot plants, the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily consists of five well-defined clades I-V, the common ancestor of which probably originated very early in the evolution of the grasses. A survey of the TPS literature and the characterization of representative TPS enzymes from clades I-III revealed clade-specific substrate and product specificities. The enzymes in both clade I and II function as sesquiterpene synthases with clade I enzymes catalyzing initial C10-C1 or C11-C1 ring closures and clade II enzymes catalyzing C6-C1 closures. The enzymes of clade III mainly act as monoterpene synthases, forming cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes. The reconstruction and characterization of clade ancestors demonstrated that the differences among clades I-III were already present in their ancestors. However, the ancestors generally catalyzed simpler reactions with less double-bond isomerization and fewer cyclization steps. Overall, our data indicate an early origin of key enzymatic features of TPS-a enzymes in the Poaceae, and the development of more complex reactions over the course of evolution.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox), an important ornamental plant, has evolved unique fragrant aroma and winter-flowering properties, which are critical for its successful sexual reproduction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these traits are largely unknown in this species. In addition, wintersweet is also a typical representative species of the magnoliids, where the phylogenetic position of which relative to eudicots and monocots has not been conclusively resolved.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Here, we present a chromosome-level wintersweet genome assembly with a total size of 695.36 Mb and a draft genome assembly of Calycanthus chinensis. Phylogenetic analyses of 17 representative angiosperm genomes suggest that Magnoliids and eudicots are sister to monocots. Whole-genome duplication signatures reveal two major duplication events in the evolutionary history of the wintersweet genome, with an ancient one shared by Laurales, and a more recent one shared by the Calycantaceae. Whole-genome duplication and tandem duplication events have significant impacts on copy numbers of genes related to terpene and benzenoid/phenylpropanoid (the main floral scent volatiles) biosynthesis, which may contribute to the characteristic aroma formation. An integrative analysis combining cytology with genomic and transcriptomic data reveals biological characteristics of wintersweet, such as floral transition in spring, floral organ specification, low temperature-mediated floral bud break, early blooming in winter, and strong cold tolerance.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;These findings provide insights into the evolutionary history of wintersweet and the relationships among the Magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots; the molecular basis underlying floral scent biosynthesis; and winter flowering, and highlight the utility of multi-omics data in deciphering important ornamental traits in wintersweet.">

Biochemical analysis has now identified the catalytic activities of all enzymes encoded by the 34 TPS genes: one isoprene synthase, 10 exclusively or predominantly monoterpene synthases, 17 sesquiterpene synthases and six diterpene synthases. Among the monoterpene and sesquiterpene and diterpene synthases, some use trans-prenyl diphosphates, some use cis-prenyl diphosphates and some use both. The isoprene synthase is cytosolic; six monoterpene synthases are plastidic, and four are cytosolic; the sesquiterpene synthases are almost all cytosolic, with the exception of one found in the mitochondria; and three diterpene synthases are found in the plastids, one in the cytosol and two in the mitochondria. New trans-prenyltransferases (TPTs) were characterised; together with previously characterised TPTs and cis-prenyltransferases (CPTs), tomato plants can make all cis and trans C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; , C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; prenyl diphosphates. Every type of plant tissue examined expresses some TPS genes and some TPTs and CPTs.

        <span class="abst" title="Terpene synthase (TPS) is a critical enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of terpenes, which possess diverse roles in plant growth and development. Although many terpenes have been reported in orchids, limited information is available regarding the genome-wide identification and characterization of the TPS family in the orchid, &lt;i&gt;Dendrobium officinale&lt;/i&gt;. By integrating the &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; genome and transcriptional data, 34 &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were found in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;. These were divided into four subfamilies (TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, and TPS-e/f). Distinct tempospatial expression profiles of &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were observed in 10 organs of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;. Most &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were predominantly expressed in flowers, followed by roots and stems. Expression of the majority of &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes was enhanced following exposure to cold and osmotic stresses. Recombinant DoTPS10 protein, located in chloroplasts, uniquely converted geranyl diphosphate to linalool in vitro. The &lt;i&gt;DoTPS10&lt;/i&gt; gene, which resulted in linalool formation, was highly expressed during all flower developmental stages. Methyl jasmonate significantly up-regulated &lt;i&gt;DoTPS10&lt;/i&gt; expression and linalool accumulation. These results simultaneously provide valuable insight into understanding the roles of the TPS family and lay a basis for further studies on the regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis by &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;.">

Genomic resequencing of 139 tea accessions from around the world is used to investigate the evolution and phylogenetic relationships of tea accessions. We find that hybridization has increased the heterozygosity and wide-ranging gene flow among tea populations with the spread of tea cultivation. Population genetic and transcriptomic analyses reveal that during domestication, selection for disease resistance and flavor in C. sinensis var. sinensis populations has been stronger than that in C. sinensis var. assamica populations.

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenoid metabolism plays vital roles in stress defense and the environmental adaptation of monocot crops. Here, we describe the identification of the terpene synthase (TPS) gene family of the panicoid food and bioenergy model crop foxtail millet (Setaria italica). The diploid S. italica genome contains 32 TPS genes, 17 of which were biochemically characterized in this study. Unlike other thus far investigated grasses, S. italica contains TPSs producing all three ent-, (+)- and syn-copalyl pyrophosphate stereoisomers that naturally occur as central building blocks in the biosynthesis of distinct monocot diterpenoids. Conversion of these intermediates by the promiscuous TPS SiTPS8 yielded different diterpenoid scaffolds. Additionally, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP99A17), which genomically clustered with SiTPS8, catalyzes the C19 hydroxylation of SiTPS8 products to generate the corresponding diterpene alcohols. The presence of syntenic orthologs to about 19% of the S. italica TPSs in related grasses supports a common ancestry of selected pathway branches. Among the identified enzyme products, abietadien-19-ol, syn-pimara-7,15-dien-19-ol and germacrene-d-4-ol were detectable in planta, and gene expression analysis of the biosynthetic TPSs showed distinct and, albeit moderately, inducible expression patterns in response to biotic and abiotic stress. In vitro growth-inhibiting activity of abietadien-19-ol and syn-pimara-7,15-dien-19-ol against Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium subglutinans may indicate pathogen defensive functions, whereas the low antifungal efficacy of tested sesquiterpenoids supports other bioactivities. Together, these findings expand the known chemical space of monocot terpenoid metabolism to enable further investigations of terpenoid-mediated stress resilience in these agriculturally important species.">

The monophagous beetle Agasicles hygrophila uses a volatile (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonanetriene (DMNT) to recognize its host plant Alternanthera philoxeroides. Alternanthera philoxeroides releases DMNT in response to A. hygrophila attack and nerolidol synthase (NES) is a key enzyme in DMNT biosynthesis; however, the effect of A. hygrophila on NES expression remains unclear. In this study, the A. philoxeroides transcriptome was sequenced and six putative NES genes belonging to the terpene synthase-g family were characterized. The expression of these NES genes was assayed at different times following A. hygrophila contact, feeding or mechanical wounding. Results showed that A. hygrophila contact and feeding induced NES expression more rapidly and more intensely than mechanical wounding alone. This may account for a large release of DMNT following A. hygrophila feeding in a previous study and subsequently facilitate A. hygrophila to find host plants. Our research provides a powerful genetic platform for studying invasive plants and lays the foundation for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between A. philoxeroides and its specialist A. hygrophila.">

In this study, three potential geraniol synthases were mined from the &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; genome. DoGES1, which was localized in chloroplasts, was characterized as a geraniol synthase. &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in flowers, especially in petals. &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; transcript levels were high in the budding stage of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; flowers at 11:00 a.m. DoGES1 catalyzed geraniol in vitro, and transient expression of &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; leaves resulted in the accumulation of geraniol in vivo. These findings on DoGES1 advance our understanding of geraniol biosynthesis in orchids, and lay the basis for genetic modification of floral scent in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; or in other ornamental orchids.">

The mapping analysis revealed overlapping QTLs on chromosome 4 for sabinene, α-thujene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, terpinen-4-ol and 4-carene. The genomic region of this locus includes a cluster of five terpene synthase genes (DcTPS04, DcTPS26, DcTPS27, DcTPS54 and DcTPS55). DcTPS04 and DcTPS54 displayed genotype- and tissue-specific variation in gene expression. Based on the QTL mapping results and the gene expression patterns, DcTPS04 and DcTPS54 were selected for functional characterization. In vitro enzyme assays showed that DcTPS54 is a single-product enzyme catalysing the formation of sabinene, whereas DcTPS04 is a multiple-product terpene synthase producing α-terpineol as a major product and four additional products including sabinene, β-limonene, β-pinene and myrcene. Furthermore, we developed a functional molecular marker that could discriminate carrot genotypes with different sabinene content in a set of 85 accessions.">

We studied VOC production from above and belowground organs of the eight parents of the Multi-Parent Advanced Generation Intercross population (MAGIC) tomato population, which exhibits a high genetic variability, in order to obtain more insight into the variability of constitutive VOC emissions from tomato plants under stress-free conditions. Foliage emissions were composed of terpenes, the majority of which were also stored in the leaves. Foliage emissions were very low, partly light-dependent, and differed significantly among genotypes, both in quantity and quality. Soil with roots emitted VOCs at similar, though more variable, rates than foliage. Soil emissions were characterized by terpenes, oxygenated alkanes, and alkenes and phenolic compounds, only a few of which were found in root extracts at low concentrations. Correlation analyses revealed that several VOCs emitted from foliage or soil are jointly regulated and that above and belowground sources are partially interconnected. With respect to VOC monitoring in tomato crops, our results underline that genetic variability, light-dependent de-novo synthesis, and belowground sources are factors to be considered for successful use in crop monitoring.">

SNPs of target carotenoid metabolic genes in 13 founders of the Japanese citrus breeding population were explored using the SureSelect target enrichment method. An independent allele was determined based on the presence or absence of reliable SNPs, using trio analysis to confirm inheritability between parent and offspring. Among the 13 founders, there were 7 PSY alleles, 7 HYb alleles, 11 ZEP alleles, 5 NCED alleles, and 4 alleles for the eQTL that control the transcription levels of PDS and ZDS among the ancestral species, indicating that some founders acquired those alleles from them. The carotenoid composition data of 263 breeding pedigrees in juice sac tissues revealed that the phenotypic variance of carotenoid composition was similar to that in the 13 founders, whereas the mean of total carotenoid content increased. This increase in total carotenoid content correlated with the increase in either or both β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin in juice sac tissues. Bayesian statistical analysis between allelic composition of target genes and carotenoid composition in 263 breeding pedigrees indicated that PSY-a and ZEP-e alleles at PSY and ZEP loci had strong positive effects on increasing the total carotenoid content, including β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin, in juice sac tissues. Moreover, the pyramiding of these alleles also increased the β-cryptoxanthin content. Interestingly, the offset interaction between the alleles with increasing and decreasing effects on carotenoid content and the epistatic interaction among carotenoid metabolic genes were observed and these interactions complexed carotenoid profiles in breeding population. These results revealed that allele composition would highly influence the carotenoid composition in citrus fruits. The allelic genotype information for the examined carotenoid metabolic genes in major citrus varieties and the trio-tagged SNPs to discriminate the optimum alleles (PSY-a and ZEP-e) from the rest would promise citrus breeders carotenoid enrichment in fruit via molecular breeding.">

To better understand the genetic basis of the terpenoid diversity in lavender, we present a high-quality reference genome for the Chinese lavender cultivar &quot;Jingxun 2&quot; using PacBio and Hi-C technologies to anchor the 894.50 Mb genome assembly into 27 pseudochromosomes. In addition to the γ triplication event, lavender underwent two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) during the Eocene-Oligocene (29.6 MYA) and Miocene-Pliocene (6.9 MYA) transitions. As a result of tandem duplications and lineage-specific WGDs, gene families related to terpenoid biosynthesis in lavender are substantially expanded compared to those of five other species in Lamiaceae. Many terpenoid biosynthesis transcripts are abundant in glandular trichomes. We further integrated the contents of ecologically functional terpenoids and coexpressed terpenoid biosynthetic genes to construct terpenoid-gene networks. Typical gene clusters, including TPS-TPS, TPS-CYP450, and TPS-BAHD, linked with compounds that primarily function as attractants or repellents, were identified by their similar patterns of change during flower development or in response to methyl jasmonate. Comprehensive analysis of the genetic basis of the production of volatiles in lavender could serve as a foundation for future research into lavender evolution, phytochemistry, and ecology.">

However, there is no information available regarding the role of the MYB gene family in &lt;i&gt;H. coronarium&lt;/i&gt;. In the current study, the MYB gene family was identified and extensively analyzed. The identified 253 &lt;i&gt;HcMYB&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly mapped on 17 chromosomes at a different density. Promoter sequence analysis showed numerous phytohormones related to &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-regulatory elements. The majority of &lt;i&gt;HcMYB&lt;/i&gt; genes contain two to three introns and motif composition analysis showed their functional conservation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HcMYBs could be classified into 15 distinct clades, and the segmental duplication events played an essential role in the expansion of the &lt;i&gt;HcMYB&lt;/i&gt; gene family. Tissue-specific expression patterns of &lt;i&gt;HcMYB&lt;/i&gt; genes displayed spatial and temporal expression. Furthermore, seven &lt;i&gt;HcMYB&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;HcMYB7/8/75/79/145/238/248&lt;/i&gt;) were selected for further investigation. Through RT-qPCR, the response of candidates &lt;i&gt;HcMYB&lt;/i&gt; genes toward jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and auxin was examined. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays revealed that candidate genes directly bind to the promoter of bottom structural volatile synthesis genes (&lt;i&gt;HcTPS1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HcTPS3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HcTPS10&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;HcBSMT2&lt;/i&gt;). Moreover, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay showed that HcMYB7/8/75/145/248 interact with HcJAZ1 protein. In &lt;i&gt;HcMYB7/8/79/145/248&lt;/i&gt;-silenced flowers, the floral volatile contents were decreased and downregulated the expression of key structural genes, suggesting that these genes might play crucial roles in floral scent formation in &lt;i&gt;H. coronarium&lt;/i&gt; by regulating the expression of floral scent biosynthesis genes. Collectively, these findings indicate that &lt;i&gt;HcMYB&lt;/i&gt; genes might be involved in the regulatory mechanism of terpenoids and benzenoid biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;H. coronarium&lt;/i&gt;.">

Tomato plants have evolved broad defense mechanisms regulated by the expression of defense genes, phytohormones, and secondary metabolites present constitutively and/or induced upon infestation. Although tomato defense mechanisms have been studied for more than three decades, only a few studies have compared domesticated cultivars' natural mite resistance at the molecular level. The main goal of our research was to reveal the molecular differences between two tomato cultivars with similar physical (trichome morphology and density) and agronomic traits (fruit size, shape, color, cluster architecture), but with contrasting TSSM susceptibility. A net house experiment indicated a mite-resistance difference between the cultivars, and a climate-controlled performance and oviposition bioassay supported these findings. A transcriptome analysis of the two cultivars after 3 days of TSSM infestation, revealed changes in the genes associated with primary and secondary metabolism, including salicylic acid and volatile biosynthesis (volatile benzenoid ester and monoterpenes). The &lt;i&gt;Terpene synthase&lt;/i&gt; genes, &lt;i&gt;TPS5, TPS7&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;TPS19/20&lt;/i&gt;, encoding enzymes that synthesize the monoterpenes linalool, β-myrcene, limonene, and β-phellandrene were highly expressed in the resistant cultivar. The volatile profile of these cultivars upon mite infestation for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days, revealed substantial differences in monoterpenoid and phenylpropanoid volatiles, results consistent with the transcriptomic data. Comparing the metabolic changes that occurred in each cultivar and upon mite-infestation indicated that monoterpenes are the main metabolites that differ between cultivars (constitutive levels), while only minor changes occurred upon TSSM attack. To test the effect of these volatile variations on mites, we subjected both the TSSM and its corresponding predator, &lt;i&gt;Phytoseiulus persimilis&lt;/i&gt;, to an olfactory choice bioassay. The predator mites were only significantly attracted to the TSSM pre-infested resistant cultivar and not to the susceptible cultivar, while the TSSM itself showed no preference. Overall, our findings revealed the contribution of constitutive and inducible levels of volatiles on mite performance. This study highlights monoterpenoids' function in plant resistance to pests and may inform the development of new resistant tomato cultivars.">

Metabolomics is an excellent platform for both understanding the complex plant-pathogen interactions and unraveling new chemical control strategies. GC-MS-based metabolomics, along with a phytohormone analysis of a compatible and incompatible interaction between tomato plants and &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; f. sp. &lt;i&gt;lycopersici,&lt;/i&gt; revealed the specific volatile chemical composition and the plant signals associated with them. The susceptible tomato plants were characterized by the over-emission of methyl- and ethyl-salicylate as well as some fatty acid derivatives, along with an activation of salicylic acid and abscisic acid signaling. In contrast, terpenoids, benzenoids, and 2-ethylhexanoic acid were differentially emitted by plants undergoing an incompatible interaction, together with the activation of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway. In accordance with this response, a higher expression of several genes participating in the biosynthesis of these volatiles, such as &lt;i&gt;MTS1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TomloxC,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;TomloxD,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AOS&lt;/i&gt;, as well as &lt;i&gt;JAZ7&lt;/i&gt;, a JA marker gene, was found to be induced by the fungus in these resistant plants.

However, studies on the evolution and genetic breeding potential of guava are hindered by the lack of a reference genome. Here, we present a chromosome-level genomic assembly of guava using PacBio sequencing and Hi-C technology. We found that the genome assembly size was 443.8 Mb with a contig N50 of ~15.8 Mb. We annotated a total of 25 601 genes and 193.2 Mb of repetitive sequences for this genome. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that guava has undergone a recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) event shared by all species in Myrtaceae. In addition, through metabolic analysis, we determined that the L-galactose pathway plays a major role in ascorbic acid biosynthesis in guava fruits. Moreover, the softening of fruits of guava may result from both starch and cell wall degradation according to analyses of gene expression profiles and positively selected genes. Our data provide a foundational resource to support molecular breeding of guava and represent new insights into the evolution of soft, fleshy fruits in Myrtaceae.">

Here, we present a phased chromosome-scale assembly for an elite oolong tea cultivar, &quot;Huangdan&quot;, that is well known for its high levels of aroma. Based on the two sets of haplotype genome data, we identified numerous genetic variations and a substantial proportion of allelic imbalance related to important traits, including aroma- and stress-related alleles. Comparative genomics revealed extensive structural variations as well as expansion of some gene families, such as terpene synthases (TPSs), that likely contribute to the high-aroma characteristics of the backbone parent, underlying the molecular basis for the biosynthesis of aroma-related chemicals in oolong tea. Our results uncovered the genetic basis of special features of this oolong tea cultivar, providing fundamental genomic resources to study evolution and domestication for the economically important tea crop.">

The whole-organism reconfiguration of aroma formation from the precursor to storage is poorly understood. In this study, we performed iTRAQ proteomic analysis and identified 337, 246, and 413 differentially expressed proteins in tea leaves primed with MeJA for 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h, respectively. Furthermore, a total of 266 nonvolatile and 100 volatile differential metabolites were identified by utilizing MS-based metabolomics. A novel approach that incorporated the integration of extended self-organizing map-based dimensionality was applied. The vivid time-scale changes tracing physiological responses in MeJA-primed tea leaves are marked in these maps. Jasmonates responded quickly to the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway in tea leaves, while hydroxyl and glycosyl jasmonates were biosynthesized simultaneously on a massive scale to compensate for the exhausted defense. The levels of α-linolenic acid, geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and phenylalanine, which are crucial aroma precursors, were found to be significantly changed in MeJA-primed tea leaves. Green leaf volatiles, volatile terpenoids, and volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids were spontaneously biosynthesized from responding precursors and subsequently converted to their corresponding glycosidic forms, which can be stably stored in tea leaves. This study elucidated the physiological response of tea leaves primed with exogenous methyl jasmonate and revealed the molecular basis of source and sink changes on tea aroma biosynthesis and catabolism in response to exogenous stimuli. The results significantly enhance our comprehensive understanding of tea plant responses to exogenous treatment and will lead to the development of promising biotechnologies to improve fresh tea leaf quality.">

Its flowers could be used as health care tea for its aroma flavor and medicinal value. Most recent studies demonstrated that terpenoids are the main components of the aromatic compounds in the flowers, but the biosynthesis of terpenoids is poorly understood in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;. In the experiment, the flowers from two cultivars of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; with different smells were collected. The transcriptome analysis and combined volatile terpenoids determination were performed to identify the genes related to the biosynthesis of the terpenoids. The results showed that the different products of volatile terpenoids are α-thujene, linalool, α-terpineol, α-phellandrene, γ-muurolene, α-patchoulene, and δ-elemene in two cultivar flowers. The transcriptome analysis detected 25,484 genes in the flowers. And 18,650 differentially expressed genes were identified between the two cultivars. Of these genes, 253 genes were mapped to the terpenoid metabolism pathway. Among these genes, 13 terpene synthase (TPS) genes may have correlations with AP2/ERF, WRKY, MYB, bHLH, and bZIP transcription factors by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The transcription factors have regulatory effects on TPS genes. These results may provide ideas for the terpenoid biosynthesis and regulatory network of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; flowers.">

        <span class="abst" title="Light is a key environmental aspect that regulates secondary metabolic synthesis. The essential oil produced in mint (&lt;i&gt;Mentha canadensis&lt;/i&gt; L.) leaves is used widely in the aromatics industry and in medicine. Under low-light treatment, significant reductions in peltate glandular trichome densities were observed. GC-MS analysis showed dramatically reduced essential oil and menthol contents. Light affected the peltate glandular trichomes' development and essential oil yield production. However, the underlying mechanisms of this regulation were elusive. To identify the critical genes during light-regulated changes in oil content, following a 24 h darkness treatment and a 24 h recovery light treatment, leaves were collected for transcriptome analysis. A total of 95,579 unigenes were obtained, with an average length of 754 bp. About 56.58% of the unigenes were annotated using four public protein databases: 10,977 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be involved in the light signaling pathway and monoterpene synthesis pathway. Most of the TPs showed a similar expression pattern: downregulation after darkness treatment and upregulation after the return of light. In addition, the genes involved in the light signal transduction pathway were analyzed. A series of responsive transcription factors (TFs) were identified and could be used in metabolic engineering as an effective strategy for increasing essential oil yields.">

Its dried roots (called bajitian in traditional Chinese medicine) are broadly used to treat various diseases, such as impotence and rheumatism. Here, we report a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly of M. officinalis using Nanopore single-molecule sequencing and Hi-C technology. The assembled genome size was 484.85 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 40.97 Mb, and 90.77% of the assembled sequences were anchored on eleven pseudochromosomes. The genome includes 27,698 protein-coding genes, and most of the assemblies are repetitive sequences. Genome evolution analysis revealed that M. officinalis underwent core eudicot γ genome triplication events but no recent whole-genome duplication (WGD). Likewise, comparative genomic analysis showed no large-scale structural variation after species divergence between M. officinalis and Coffea canephora. Moreover, gene family analysis indicated that gene families associated with plant-pathogen interactions and sugar metabolism were significantly expanded in M. officinalis. Furthermore, we identified many candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of major active components such as anthraquinones, iridoids and polysaccharides. In addition, we also found that the DHQS, GGPPS, TPS-Clin, TPS04, sacA, and UGDH gene families-which include the critical genes for active component biosynthesis-were expanded in M. officinalis. This study provides a valuable resource for understanding M. officinalis genome evolution and active component biosynthesis. This work will facilitate genetic improvement and molecular breeding of this commercially important plant.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Plants have evolved physical-chemical defense to prevent/diminish damage by their enemies. Chemical defense involves the synthesis' pathways of specialized toxic, repellent, or anti-nutritive metabolites to herbivores. Molecular evolutionary studies have revealed the origin of new genes, acquisition and functional diversification along time in different plant lineages.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Using bioinformatic tools we analyze gene divergence of tropane alkaloids (TAs) and terpene synthases (TPSs) in &lt;i&gt;Datura stramonium&lt;/i&gt; and other species of Solanaceae; compared gene and amino acids sequence of TAs and TPSs on genomes, cDNA and proteins sequences of Viridiplantae. We analyzed two recently assembled genomes of &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; (Ticumán and Teotihuacán), transcriptomes of &lt;i&gt;Datura metel&lt;/i&gt; and genomes of other Solanaceae. Hence, we analyzed variation of TAs and TPSs to infer genes involved in plant defense and plant responses before stress. We analyzed protein modeling and molecular docking to predict interactions between H6H and ligand; we translated the sequences (Teo19488, Tic8550 and Tic8549) obtained from the two genomes of &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; by using Swiss-Model and Ramachandran plot and MolProbity structure validation of Teo19488 protein model.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;For TAs, we detected an expansion event in the tropinone reductase II (TRII) and the ratio synonymous/non-synonymous substitutions indicate positive selection. In contrast, a contraction event and negative selection was detected in tropinone reductase I (TRI). In Hy-oscyamine 6 b-hydroxylase (H6H), enzyme involved in the production of tropane alkaloids atropine and scopolamine, the synonymous/non-synonymous substitution ratio in its dominion indicates positive selection. For terpenes (TPS), we found 18 DsTPS in &lt;i&gt;D. stramomiun&lt;/i&gt; and seven in &lt;i&gt;D. metel&lt;/i&gt;; evolutionary analyses detected positive selection in TPS10.1 and TPS10.2 of &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D. metel&lt;/i&gt;. Comparison of copies of TPSs in &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; detected variation among them in the binding site. Duplication events and differentiation of TAs and TPSs of &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt;, as compared to other Solanaceae, suggest their possible involvement on adaptive evolution of defense to herbivores. Protein modeling and docking show that the three protein structures obtained of DsH6H from Teo19488, Tic-8550 and Tic8549 maintain the same interactions and the union site of 2OG-FeII_Oxy with the Hy-o ligand as in 6TTM of &lt;i&gt;D. metel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our results indicate differences in the number of gene copies involved in the synthesis of tropane alkaloids, between the genomes of &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; from two Mexican populations. More copies of genes related to the synthesis of tropane alkaloids (TRI, TRII, H6H, PMT) are found in &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; as compared to Viridiplantae. Likewise, for terpene synthases (TPS), TPS-10 is duplicated in &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D. metel&lt;/i&gt;. Further studies should be directed to experimentally assess gain (overexpression) or loss (silencing) of function of duplicated genes.">

The expression of VvHMGRs in 'Kyoho' has tissue specificity, for example, VvHMGR1 keeps a higher expression, VvHMGR2 is the lowest, and VvHMGR3 gradually decreases as the fruit development. VvHMGR3 is closely related to CsHMGR1 and GmHMGR9 and has collinearity with CsHMGR2 and GmHMGR4. By the prediction of interaction protein, it can interact with HMG-CoA synthase, MVA kinase, FPP/GGPP synthase, diphosphate mevalonate decarboxylase, and participates in the synthesis and metabolism of terpenoids. VvHMGR3 have similar trends in expression with some of the genes of carotenoid biosynthesis and MEP pathways. VvHMGR3 responds to various environmental and phytohormone stimuli, especially salt stress and ultraviolet (UV) treatment. The expression level of VvHMGRs is diverse in grapes of different colors and aroma. VvHMGRs are significantly higher in yellow varieties than that in red varieties, whereas rose-scented varieties showed significantly higher expression than that of strawberry aroma. The expression level is highest in yellow rose-scented varieties, and the lowest in red strawberry scent varieties, especially 'Summer Black' and 'Fujiminori'.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This study confirms the important role of VvHMGR3 in the process of grape fruit coloring and aroma formation, and provided a new idea to explain the loss of grape aroma and poor coloring during production. There may be an additive effect between color and aroma in the HMGR expression aspect.">

Arthropod resistance in the tomato wild relative Solanum habrochaites LA1777 is linked to specific sesquiterpene biosynthesis. The Sesquiterpene synthase 2 (SsT2) gene cluster on LA1777 chromosome 8 controls plastid-derived sesquiterpene synthesis. The main genes at SsT2 are Z-prenyltransferase (zFPS) and Santalene and Bergamotene Synthase (SBS), which produce α-santalene, β-bergamotene, and α-bergamotene in LA1777 round-shaped type-VI glandular trichomes. Cultivated tomatoes have mushroom-shaped type-VI trichomes with much smaller glands that contain low levels of monoterpenes and cytosolic-derived sesquiterpenes, not presenting the same pest resistance as in LA1777. We successfully transferred zFPS and SBS from LA1777 to cultivated tomato (cv. Micro-Tom, MT) by a backcrossing approach. The trichomes of the MT-Sst2 introgressed line produced high levels of the plastid-derived sesquiterpenes. The type-VI trichome internal storage-cavity size increased in MT-Sst2, probably as an effect of the increased amount of sesquiterpenes, although it was not enough to mimic the round-shaped LA1777 trichomes. The presence of high amounts of plastid-derived sesquiterpenes was also not sufficient to confer resistance to various tomato piercing-sucking pests, indicating that the effect of the sesquiterpenes found in the wild S. habrochaites can be insect specific. Our results provide for a better understanding of the morphology of S. habrochaites type-VI trichomes and paves the way to obtain insect-resistant tomatoes.">

Specialized metabolites are often produced during these associations and play important roles in the symbiosis between the plant and the fungus, as well as in the establishment of additional interactions between the symbionts and other organisms present in the niche. &lt;i&gt;Serendipita indica&lt;/i&gt;, a root endophytic fungus from the phylum Basidiomycota, is able to colonize a wide range of plant species, conferring many benefits to its hosts. The genome of &lt;i&gt;S. indica&lt;/i&gt; possesses only few genes predicted to be involved in specialized metabolite biosynthesis, including a putative terpenoid synthase gene (&lt;i&gt;SiTPS&lt;/i&gt;). In our experimental setup, &lt;i&gt;SiTPS&lt;/i&gt; expression was upregulated when the fungus colonized tomato roots compared to its expression in fungal biomass growing on synthetic medium. Heterologous expression of &lt;i&gt;SiTPS&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; showed that the produced protein catalyzes the synthesis of a few sesquiterpenoids, with the alcohol viridiflorol being the main product. To investigate the role of &lt;i&gt;SiTPS&lt;/i&gt; in the plant-endophyte interaction, an &lt;i&gt;SiTPS&lt;/i&gt;-over-expressing mutant line was created and assessed for its ability to colonize tomato roots. Although overexpression of &lt;i&gt;SiTPS&lt;/i&gt; did not lead to improved fungal colonization ability, an in vitro growth-inhibition assay showed that viridiflorol has antifungal properties. Addition of viridiflorol to the culture medium inhibited the germination of spores from a phytopathogenic fungus, indicating that &lt;i&gt;SiTPS&lt;/i&gt; and its products could provide &lt;i&gt;S. indica&lt;/i&gt; with a competitive advantage over other plant-associated fungi during root colonization.">

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenoids are a large and diverse class of plant metabolites that also includes volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes which are involved in biotic interactions of plants. Due to the limited natural availability of these terpenes and the tight regulation of their biosynthesis, there is strong interest to introduce or enhance their production in crop plants by metabolic engineering for agricultural, pharmaceutical and industrial applications. While engineering of monoterpenes has been quite successful, expression of sesquiterpene synthases in engineered plants frequently resulted in production of only minor amounts of sesquiterpenes. To identify bottlenecks for sesquiterpene engineering in plants, we have used two nearly identical terpene synthases, snapdragon (&lt;i&gt;Antirrhinum majus&lt;/i&gt;) nerolidol/linalool synthase-1 and -2 (AmNES/LIS-1/-2), that are localized in the cytosol and plastids, respectively. Since these two bifunctional terpene synthases have very similar catalytic properties with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), their expression in target tissues allows indirect determination of the availability of these substrates in both subcellular compartments. Both terpene synthases were expressed under control of the ripening specific &lt;i&gt;PG&lt;/i&gt; promoter in tomato fruits, which are characterized by a highly active terpenoid metabolism providing precursors for carotenoid biosynthesis. As &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-2&lt;/i&gt; fruits produced the monoterpene linalool, &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-1&lt;/i&gt; fruits were found to exclusively produce the sesquiterpene nerolidol. While nerolidol emission in &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-1&lt;/i&gt; fruits was 60- to 584-fold lower compared to linalool emission in &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-2&lt;/i&gt; fruits, accumulation of nerolidol-glucosides in &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-1&lt;/i&gt; fruits was 4- to 14-fold lower than that of linalool-glucosides in &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-2&lt;/i&gt; fruits. These results suggest that only a relatively small pool of FPP is available for sesquiterpene formation in the cytosol. To potentially overcome limitations in sesquiterpene production, we transiently co-expressed the key pathway-enzymes hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), as well as the regulator isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK). While HMGR and IPK expression increased metabolic flux toward nerolidol formation 5.7- and 2.9-fold, respectively, DXS expression only resulted in a 2.5-fold increase.">

Nevertheless, the possible gene-regulatory roles of transcription factors (TFs) in &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt;'s monoterpenoid biosynthesis remained unknown. Here, a joint analysis of the transcriptome and terpenoid metabolome of &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt; induced by mechanical damage (MD) was used to comprehensively explore the interaction between TFs and terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes that might participate in monoterpene biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis detected 14 monoterpenes and seven sesquiterpenes. All but two monoterpenes underwent a significantly increased accumulation after the MD treatment. RNA sequencing data revealed that 10 TPS, 82 MYB, 70 AP2/ERF, 38 BHLH, 31 WRKY, and 29 bZIP unigenes responded to the MD treatment. A correlation analysis revealed that three monoterpene synthase genes (CcTPS1, CcTPS3, CcTPS4) highly correlated with multiple monoterpenes, namely D-borneol, camphor, and bornyl acetate, which could be responsible for monoterpenoid biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, five WRKY, 15 MYB, 10 ERF/AP2, five bZIP, and two BHLH genes had strong, positive correlations with &lt;i&gt;CcTPS1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;CcTPS4&lt;/i&gt;, judging by their high coefficient values (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0.8). The bioinformatics results were verified by quantitative real-time PCR.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This study provides insight into the genes involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of monoterpene in &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt; and thus provides a pool of candidate genes for future mechanistic analyses of how monoterpenes accumulate in &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt;.">

Recent studies have shown that endophytic fungi are also able to produce volatiles and this raises the question of whether these fungal volatiles influence plant-insect interactions. Here, we qualitatively investigated the volatiles released from 13 endophytic fungal species isolated from leaves of mature black poplar (&lt;i&gt;Populus nigra&lt;/i&gt;) trees. The volatile blends of these endophytes grown on agar medium consist of typical fungal compounds, including aliphatic alcohols, ketones and esters, the aromatic alcohol 2-phenylethanol and various sesquiterpenes. Some of the compounds were previously reported as constituents of the poplar volatile blend&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; For one endophyte, a species of &lt;i&gt;Cladosporium&lt;/i&gt;, we isolated and characterized two sesquiterpene synthases that can produce a number of mono- and sesquiterpenes like (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-ocimene and (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-caryophyllene, compounds that are dominant components of the herbivore-induced volatile bouquet of black poplar trees. As several of the fungus-derived volatiles like 2-phenylethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and the sesquiterpene (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-caryophyllene, are known to play a role in direct and indirect plant defense, the emission of volatiles from endophytic microbial species should be considered in future studies investigating tree-insect interactions.">

In the ornamental plant &lt;i&gt;Hedychium coronarium&lt;/i&gt;, linalool and methyl benzoate are biosynthesized by the terpene synthase (TPS) HcTPS5 and the benzoic/salicylic acid methyltransferase (BSMT) HcBSMT2, respectively. However, the transcriptional regulation of this process remains unclear. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the R2R3-MYB transcription factors HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 in regulating the biosynthesis of these floral aroma compounds. &lt;i&gt;HcMYB1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HcMYB2&lt;/i&gt; are specifically expressed in flowers, their expression is correlated with the emission of volatile compounds in flowers, and is induced by auxin. Moreover, HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 interact with the &lt;i&gt;HcBSMT2&lt;/i&gt; promoter region. HcMYB2 activates the expression of the linalool synthase gene &lt;i&gt;HcTPS5&lt;/i&gt;. In flowers with &lt;i&gt;HcMYB1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;HcMYB2&lt;/i&gt; silenced, the levels of floral scent compounds were significantly reduced, and &lt;i&gt;HcBSMT2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HcTPS5&lt;/i&gt; were downregulated compared with the wild type. Moreover, HcMYB1 form protein-protein interaction with key scent-related HcIAA4 protein to regulate floral aroma production. Taken together, these results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 play crucial roles in regulating the formation of scent compounds in &lt;i&gt;Hedychium coronarium (H. coronarium)&lt;/i&gt; flowers in response to auxin signaling.">

A case study on the dwarf tomato model Micro-Tom is here presented in which the response to salt stress (NaCl 200 mM) was investigated to shed light on the changes occurring at the expression level in genes involved in cell wall-related processes, phenylpropanoid pathway, stress response, volatiles' emission and secondary metabolites' production. In particular, the response was analyzed by sampling older/younger leaflets positioned at different stem heights (top and bottom of the stem) and locations along the rachis (terminal and lateral) with the goal of identifying the most responsive one(s). Tomato plants cv. Micro-Tom responded to increasing concentrations of NaCl (0-100-200-400 mM) by reducing the leaf biomass, stem diameter and height. Microscopy revealed stronger effects on leaves sampled at the bottom and the expression analysis identified clusters of genes expressed preferentially in older or younger leaflets. Stress-related genes displayed a stronger induction in lateral leaflets sampled at the bottom. In conclusion, in tomato cv. Micro-Tom subjected to salt stress, the bottom leaflets showed stronger stress signs and response, while top leaflets were less impacted by the abiotic stressor and had an increased expression of cell wall-related genes involved in expansion.">

        <span class="abst" title="Gene families involved in specialised metabolism play a key role in a myriad of ecophysiological and biochemical functions. The &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; sesquiterpene synthases represent the largest subfamily of grapevine terpene synthase (&lt;i&gt;VviTPS&lt;/i&gt;) genes and are important volatile metabolites for wine flavour and aroma, as well as ecophysiological interactions. The functional characterisation of &lt;i&gt;VviTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes is complicated by a reliance on a single reference genome that greatly underrepresents this large gene family, exacerbated by extensive duplications and paralogy. The recent release of multiple phased diploid grapevine genomes, as well as extensive whole-genome resequencing efforts, provide a wealth of new sequence information that can be utilised to overcome the limitations of the reference genome. A large cluster of sesquiterpene synthases, localised to chromosome 18, was explored by means of comparative sequence analyses using the publicly available grapevine reference genome, three PacBio phased diploid genomes and whole-genome resequencing data from multiple genotypes. Two genes, &lt;i&gt;VviTPS04&lt;/i&gt; and -&lt;i&gt;10&lt;/i&gt;, were identified as putative paralogues and/or allelic variants. Subsequent gene isolation from multiple grapevine genotypes and characterisation by means of a heterologous in planta expression and volatile analysis resulted in the identification of genotype-specific structural variations and polymorphisms that impact the gene function. These results present novel insight into how grapevine domestication likely shaped the &lt;i&gt;VviTPS&lt;/i&gt; landscape to result in genotype-specific functions.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Magnolia officinalis&lt;/i&gt;, a representative tall aromatic tree of the Magnoliaceae family, is a medicinal plant that is widely used in diverse industries from medicine to cosmetics. We report a chromosome-scale draft genome of &lt;i&gt;M. officinalis&lt;/i&gt;, in which ∼99.66% of the sequences were anchored onto 19 chromosomes with the scaffold N50 of 76.62 Mb. We found that a high proportion of repetitive sequences was a common feature of three Magnoliaceae with known genomic data. Magnoliids were a sister clade to eudicots-monocots, which provided more support for understanding the phylogenetic position among angiosperms. An ancient duplication event occurred in the genome of &lt;i&gt;M. officinalis&lt;/i&gt; and was shared with Lauraceae. Based on RNA-seq analysis, we identified several key enzyme-coding gene families associated with the biosynthesis of lignans in the genome. The construction of the &lt;i&gt;M. officinalis&lt;/i&gt; genome sequence will serve as a reference for further studies of &lt;i&gt;Magnolia,&lt;/i&gt; as well as other Magnoliaceae.">
