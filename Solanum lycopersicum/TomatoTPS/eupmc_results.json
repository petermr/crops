Its flowers could be used as health care tea for its aroma flavor and medicinal value. Most recent studies demonstrated that terpenoids are the main components of the aromatic compounds in the flowers, but the biosynthesis of terpenoids is poorly understood in <i>D. officinale</i>. In the experiment, the flowers from two cultivars of <i>D. officinale</i> with different smells were collected. The transcriptome analysis and combined volatile terpenoids determination were performed to identify the genes related to the biosynthesis of the terpenoids. The results showed that the different products of volatile terpenoids are \u03b1-thujene, linalool, \u03b1-terpineol, \u03b1-phellandrene, \u03b3-muurolene, \u03b1-patchoulene, and \u03b4-elemene in two cultivar flowers. The transcriptome analysis detected 25,484 genes in the flowers. And 18,650 differentially expressed genes were identified between the two cultivars. Of these genes, 253 genes were mapped to the terpenoid metabolism pathway.

Its flowers could be used as health care tea for its aroma flavor and medicinal value. Most recent studies demonstrated that terpenoids are the main components of the aromatic compounds in the flowers, but the biosynthesis of terpenoids is poorly understood in <i>D. officinale</i>. In the experiment, the flowers from two cultivars of <i>D. officinale</i> with different smells were collected. The transcriptome analysis and combined volatile terpenoids determination were performed to identify the genes related to the biosynthesis of the terpenoids. The results showed that the different products of volatile terpenoids are \u03b1-thujene, linalool, \u03b1-terpineol, \u03b1-phellandrene, \u03b3-muurolene, \u03b1-patchoulene, and \u03b4-elemene in two cultivar flowers. The transcriptome analysis detected 25,484 genes in the flowers. And 18,650 differentially expressed genes were identified between the two cultivars. Of these genes, 253 genes were mapped to the terpenoid metabolism pathway. Among these genes, 13 terpene synthase (TPS) genes may have correlations with AP2/ERF, WRKY, MYB, bHLH, and bZIP transcription factors by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).

Protein modeling and docking show that the three protein structures obtained of DsH6H from Teo19488, Tic-8550 and Tic8549 maintain the same interactions and the union site of 2OG-FeII_Oxy with the Hy-o ligand as in 6TTM of <i>D. metel.</i><h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results indicate differences in the number of gene copies involved in the synthesis of tropane alkaloids, between the genomes of <i>D. stramonium</i> from two Mexican populations. More copies of genes related to the synthesis of tropane alkaloids (TRI, TRII, H6H, PMT) are found in <i>D. stramonium</i> as compared to Viridiplantae. Likewise, for terpene synthases (TPS), TPS-10 is duplicated in <i>D. stramonium</i> and <i>D. metel</i>. Further studies should be directed to experimentally assess gain (overexpression) or loss (silencing) of function of duplicated genes.", "Keywords": ["Solanaceae", "Phylogeny", "Tropane alkaloids", "Terpene synthase", "Datura stramonium", "H6h", "Tropinone Reductase", "Plant Defense To Herbivores", "Gene Duplication And Contraction"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8212831?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "PeerJ", "authorinfo": ["Vel\u00e1zquez-M\u00e1rquez S", "De-la-Cruz IM", "Tapia-L\u00f3pez R", "N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Farf\u00e1n J"], "title": "Tropane alkaloids and terpenes synthase genes of <i>Datura stramonium</i> (Solanaceae)."}, "PMC8255067": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "34249483", "source": "MED", "pmid": "34249483", "pmcid": "PMC8255067", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC8255067"}, "doi": "10.7717/peerj.11465", "title": "Metabolism and transcriptome profiling provides insight into the genes and transcription factors involved in monoterpene biosynthesis of borneol chemotype of <i>Cinnamomum camphora</i> induced by mechanical damage.", "authorString": "Yang Z, Xie C, Huang Y, An W, Liu S, Huang S, Zheng X.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Yang Z", "firstName": "Zerui", "lastName": "Yang", "initials": "Z", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Xie C", "firstName": "Chunzhu", "lastName": "Xie", "initials": "C", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Huang Y", "firstName": "Yuying", "lastName": "Huang", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}}}, {"fullName": "An W", "firstName": "Wenli", "lastName": "An", "initials": "W", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Liu S", "firstName": "Shanshan", "lastName": "Liu", "initials": "S", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Huang S", "firstName": "Song", "lastName": "Huang", "initials": "S", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Zheng X", "firstName": "Xiasheng", "lastName": "Zheng", "initials": "X", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}}}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "supporting_data"}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "9", "journalIssueId": "3101216", "dateOfPublication": "2021", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"title": "PeerJ", "ISOAbbreviation": "PeerJ", "medlineAbbreviation": "PeerJ", "NLMid": "101603425", "ISSN": "2167-8359", "ESSN": "2167-8359"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "pageInfo": "e11465", "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>The borneol chemotype of <i>Cinnamomum camphora</i> (<i>BCC</i>), a monoterpene-rich woody plant species, is the sole source prescribed by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia for the production of natural D-borneol, a major monoterpene in <i>BCC</i> used for millennia as a topical analgesic in China.

To potentially overcome limitations in sesquiterpene production, we transiently co-expressed the key pathway-enzymes hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), as well as the regulator isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK).

In particular, the response was analyzed by sampling older/younger leaflets positioned at different stem heights (top and bottom of the stem) and locations along the rachis (terminal and lateral) with the goal of identifying the most responsive one(s). Tomato plants cv. Micro-Tom responded to increasing concentrations of NaCl (0-100-200-400 mM) by reducing the leaf biomass, stem diameter and height.

Tomato is moderately sensitive to salinity and shows adaptive mechanisms to this abiotic stressor. A case study on the dwarf tomato model Micro-Tom is here presented in which the response to salt stress (NaCl 200 mM) was investigated to shed light on the changes occurring at the expression level in genes involved in cell wall-related processes, phenylpropanoid pathway, stress response, volatiles' emission and secondary metabolites' production. In particular, the response was analyzed by sampling older/younger leaflets positioned at different stem heights (top and bottom of the stem) and locations along the rachis (terminal and lateral) with the goal of identifying the most responsive one(s). Tomato plants cv. Micro-Tom responded to increasing concentrations of NaCl (0-100-200-400 mM) by reducing the leaf biomass, stem diameter and height.

The essential oil produced in mint (<i>Mentha canadensis</i> L.) leaves is used widely in the aromatics industry and in medicine. Under low-light treatment, significant reductions in peltate glandular trichome densities were observed. GC-MS analysis showed dramatically reduced essential oil and menthol contents. Light affected the peltate glandular trichomes' development and essential oil yield production. However, the underlying mechanisms of this regulation were elusive. To identify the critical genes during light-regulated changes in oil content, following a 24 h darkness treatment and a 24 h recovery light treatment, leaves were collected for transcriptome analysis. A total of 95,579 unigenes were obtained, with an average length of 754 bp. About 56.58% of the unigenes were annotated using four public protein databases: 10,977 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be involved in the light signaling pathway and monoterpene synthesis pathway. Most of the TPs showed a similar expression pattern: downregulation after darkness treatment and upregulation after the return of light.

The essential oil produced in mint (<i>Mentha canadensis</i> L.) leaves is used widely in the aromatics industry and in medicine. Under low-light treatment, significant reductions in peltate glandular trichome densities were observed. GC-MS analysis showed dramatically reduced essential oil and menthol contents. Light affected the peltate glandular trichomes' development and essential oil yield production. However, the underlying mechanisms of this regulation were elusive. To identify the critical genes during light-regulated changes in oil content, following a 24 h darkness treatment and a 24 h recovery light treatment, leaves were collected for transcriptome analysis. A total of 95,579 unigenes were obtained, with an average length of 754 bp. About 56.58% of the unigenes were annotated using four public protein databases: 10,977 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be involved in the light signaling pathway and monoterpene synthesis pathway. Most of the TPs showed a similar expression pattern: downregulation after darkness treatment and upregulation after the return of light.

Chia leaves contain plethora of secondary metabolites with medicinal properties. In this study, we sequenced chia leaf and root transcriptomes using the Illumina platform. The short reads were assembled into contigs using the Trinity software and annotated against the Uniprot database. The reads were de novo assembled into 103,367 contigs, which represented 92.8% transcriptome completeness and a diverse set of Gene Ontology terms. Differential expression analysis identified 6151 and 8116 contigs significantly upregulated in the leaf and root tissues, respectively.

The remaining 57 in the currently available database lack essential gene structure or full-length transcripts. Distinct tempo-spatial expression patterns of CsTPS genes were found in tea plants. 17 genes were substantially expressed in all the tested organs with a few exceptions. The other 17 were predominantly expressed in leaves whereas additional eight were primarily expressed in flowers. Under the treatments of cold acclimation, salt and polyethylene glycol, CsTPS67, -69 and -71 were all suppressed and the inhibited expression of many others were found in multiple stress treatments. However, methyl jasmonate resulted in the enhanced expression of the majority of CsTPS genes. These transcription data were largely validated using qPCR. Moreover, volatile terpenoid profiling with leaves, flowers and stress-treated plants revealed a general association between the abundances of mono- and sesqui-terpenoids and some CsTPS genes.

understanding terpenoid volatile production in Camellia sinensis, global terpenoid synthase gene (TPS) transcription analysis was conducted based on transcriptomic data combined with terpenoid metabolic profiling under different abiotic stress conditions. Totally 80 TPS-like genes were identified. Twenty-three CsTPS genes possessed a complete coding sequence and most likely were functional. The remaining 57 in the currently available database lack essential gene structure or full-length transcripts. Distinct tempo-spatial expression patterns of CsTPS genes were found in tea plants. 17 genes were substantially expressed in all the tested organs with a few exceptions. The other 17 were predominantly expressed in leaves whereas additional eight were primarily expressed in flowers. Under the treatments of cold acclimation, salt and polyethylene glycol, CsTPS67, -69 and -71 were all suppressed and the inhibited expression of many others were found in multiple stress treatments. However, methyl jasmonate resulted in the enhanced expression of the majority of CsTPS genes. These transcription data were largely validated using qPCR. Moreover, volatile terpenoid profiling with leaves, flowers and stress-treated plants revealed a general association between the abundances of mono- and sesqui-terpenoids and some CsTPS genes. These results provide vital information for future studies on CsTPS regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6976640?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Scientific reports", "authorinfo": ["Zhou HC", "Shamala LF", "Yi XK", "Yan Z", "Wei S"], "title": "Analysis of Terpene Synthase Family Genes in Camellia sinensis with an Emphasis on Abiotic Stress Conditions."}, "PMC7422722": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31943222", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31943222", "pmcid": "PMC7422722", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7422722"}, "doi": "10.1111/nph.16431", "title": "The complete functional characterisation of the terpene synthase family in tomato.", "authorString": "Zhou F, Pichersky E.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Zhou F", "firstName": "Fei", "lastName": "Zhou", "initials": "F", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2992-0380"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Pichersky E", "firstName": "Eran", "lastName": "Pichersky", "initials": "E", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-4343-1535"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-4343-1535"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2992-0380"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["related_data", "supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "5", "volume": "226", "journalIssueId": "2948471", "dateOfPublication": "2020 Jun", "monthOfPublication": "6", "yearOfPublication": "2020", "printPublicationDate": "2020-06-01", "journal": {"title": "The New phytologist", "ISOAbbreviation": "New Phytol", "medlineAbbreviation": "New Phytol", "NLMid": "9882884", "ISSN": "0028-646X", "ESSN": "1469-8137"}}, "pubYear": "2020", "pageInfo": "1341-1360", "abstractText": "Analysis of the updated reference tomato genome found 34 full-length TPS genes and 18 TPS pseudogenes.

The structural diversity of terpenes found in nature is mainly determined by terpene synthases (TPS). TPS enzymes accept ubiquitous prenyl diphosphates as substrates and convert them into the various terpene skeletons by catalyzing a carbocation-driven reaction. Based on their sequence similarity, terpene synthases from land plants can be divided into different subfamilies, TPS-a to TPS-h. In this study, we aimed to understand the evolution and functional diversification of the TPS-a subfamily in the Poaceae (the grass family), a plant family that contains important crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum. Sequence comparisons showed that aside from one clade shared with other monocot plants, the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily consists of five well-defined clades I-V, the common ancestor of which probably originated very early in the evolution of the grasses. A survey of the TPS literature and the characterization of representative TPS enzymes from clades I-III revealed clade-specific substrate and product specificities. The enzymes in both clade I and II function as sesquiterpene synthases with clade I enzymes catalyzing initial C10-C1 or C11-C1 ring closures and clade II enzymes catalyzing C6-C1 closures. The enzymes of clade III mainly act as monoterpene synthases, forming cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes.

The structural diversity of terpenes found in nature is mainly determined by terpene synthases (TPS). TPS enzymes accept ubiquitous prenyl diphosphates as substrates and convert them into the various terpene skeletons by catalyzing a carbocation-driven reaction. Based on their sequence similarity, terpene synthases from land plants can be divided into different subfamilies, TPS-a to TPS-h. In this study, we aimed to understand the evolution and functional diversification of the TPS-a subfamily in the Poaceae (the grass family), a plant family that contains important crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum. Sequence comparisons showed that aside from one clade shared with other monocot plants, the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily consists of five well-defined clades I-V, the common ancestor of which probably originated very early in the evolution of the grasses. A survey of the TPS literature and the characterization of representative TPS enzymes from clades I-III revealed clade-specific substrate and product specificities. The enzymes in both clade I and II function as sesquiterpene synthases with clade I enzymes catalyzing initial C10-C1 or C11-C1 ring closures and clade II enzymes catalyzing C6-C1 closures. The enzymes of clade III mainly act as monoterpene synthases, forming cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes. The reconstruction and characterization of clade ancestors demonstrated that the differences among clades I-III were already present in their ancestors. However, the ancestors generally catalyzed simpler reactions with less double-bond isomerization and fewer cyclization steps. Overall, our data indicate an early origin of key enzymatic features of TPS-a enzymes in the Poaceae, and the development of more complex reactions over the course of evolution.", "Keywords": ["Evolution", "Maize", "Grasses", "Terpene synthase", "Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7417412?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Plant molecular biology", "authorinfo": ["Luck K", "Chen X", "Norris AM", "Chen F", "Gershenzon J", "K\u00f6llner TG"], "title": "The reconstruction and biochemical characterization of ancestral genes furnish insights into the evolution of terpene synthase function in the Poaceae."}, "PMC6239295": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "30444870", "source": "MED", "pmid": "30444870", "pmcid": "PMC6239295", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6239295"}, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0207097", "title": "Genome-wide detection of terpene synthase genes in holy basil (Ocimum sanctum L.).", "authorString": "Kumar Y, Khan F, Rastogi S, Shasany AK.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Kumar Y", "firstName": "Yogesh", "lastName": "Kumar", "initials": "Y", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-7835-7972"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Metabolic and Structural Biology Dept, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow (U.P.), INDIA."}}}, {"fullName": "Khan F", "firstName": "Feroz", "lastName": "Khan", "initials": "F", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2704-5925"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Metabolic and Structural Biology Dept, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow (U.P.), INDIA."}}}, {"fullName": "Rastogi S", "firstName": "Shubhra", "lastName": "Rastogi", "initials": "S", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow (U.P.), INDIA."}}}, {"fullName": "Shasany AK", "firstName": "Ajit Kumar", "lastName": "Shasany", "initials": "AK", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow (U.P.), INDIA."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-7835-7972"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2704-5925"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "11", "volume": "13", "journalIssueId": "2743553", "dateOfPublication": "2018", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2018", "printPublicationDate": "2018-01-01", "journal": {"title": "PloS one", "ISOAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "medlineAbbreviation": "PLoS One", "NLMid": "101285081", "ISSN": "1932-6203", "ESSN": "1932-6203"}}, "pubYear": "2018", "pageInfo": "e0207097", "abstractText": "Holy basil (Ocimum sanctum L.) and sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) are the most commonly grown basil species in India for essential oil production and biosynthesis of potentially volatile and non-volatile phytomolecules with commercial significance.

We demonstrate that this aminoacylation activity could be a common secondary activity in plant CHSs by validating the activity in vitro with variants from <i>S. lycopersicum</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Our work demonstrates yeast as a platform for characterizing putative plant gene clusters with the potential for compound structure and enzymatic activity discovery.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7608815?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Science advances", "authorinfo": ["Kong D", "Li S", "Smolke CD"], "title": "Discovery of a previously unknown biosynthetic capacity of naringenin chalcone synthase by heterologous expression of a tomato gene cluster in yeast."}, "PMC7221582": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "32325737", "source": "MED", "pmid": "32325737", "pmcid": "PMC7221582", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7221582"}, "doi": "10.3390/molecules25081881", "title": "A Gram-Scale Limonene Production Process with Engineered <i>Escherichia coli</i>.", "authorString": "Rolf J, Julsing MK, Rosenthal K, L\u00fctz S.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Rolf J", "firstName": "Jascha", "lastName": "Rolf", "initials": "J", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-8394-6795"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Chair for Bioprocess Engineering, Department of Biochemical and Chemical Engineering, TU Dortmund University, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany."}}}, {"fullName": "Julsing MK", "firstName": "Mattijs K", "lastName": "Julsing", "initials": "MK", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1871-762X"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Chair for Bioprocess Engineering, Department of Biochemical and Chemical Engineering, TU Dortmund University, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany."}, {"affiliation": "Wageningen Food & Biobased Research, Wageningen University & Research, 6708 WG Wageningen, The Netherlands."}]}}, {"fullName": "Rosenthal K", "firstName": "Katrin", "lastName": "Rosenthal", "initials": "K", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6176-6224"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Chair for Bioprocess Engineering, Department of Biochemical and Chemical Engineering, TU Dortmund University, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany."}}}, {"fullName": "L\u00fctz S", "firstName": "Stephan", "lastName": "L\u00fctz", "initials": "S", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8534-0554"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Chair for Bioprocess Engineering, Department of Biochemical and Chemical Engineering, TU Dortmund University, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-8534-0554"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1871-762X"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6176-6224"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-8394-6795"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "8", "volume": "25", "journalIssueId": "2942494", "dateOfPublication": "2020 Apr", "monthOfPublication": "4", "yearOfPublication": "2020", "printPublicationDate": "2020-04-01", "journal": {"title": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Molecules", "medlineAbbreviation": "Molecules", "NLMid": "100964009", "ISSN": "1420-3049", "ESSN": "1420-3049"}}, "pubYear": "2020", "abstractText": "Monoterpenes, such as the cyclic terpene limonene, are valuable and important natural products widely used in food, cosmetics, household chemicals, and pharmaceutical applications.

Here, we describe the identification of the terpene synthase (TPS) gene family of the panicoid food and bioenergy model crop foxtail millet (Setaria italica). The diploid S. italica genome contains 32 TPS genes, 17 of which were biochemically characterized in this study. Unlike other thus far investigated grasses, S. italica contains TPSs producing all three ent-, (+)- and syn-copalyl pyrophosphate stereoisomers that naturally occur as central building blocks in the biosynthesis of distinct monocot diterpenoids. Conversion of these intermediates by the promiscuous TPS SiTPS8 yielded different diterpenoid scaffolds. Additionally, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP99A17), which genomically clustered with SiTPS8, catalyzes the C19 hydroxylation of SiTPS8 products to generate the corresponding diterpene alcohols. The presence of syntenic orthologs to about 19% of the S. italica TPSs in related grasses supports a common ancestry of selected pathway branches.

Here, we describe the identification of the terpene synthase (TPS) gene family of the panicoid food and bioenergy model crop foxtail millet (Setaria italica). The diploid S. italica genome contains 32 TPS genes, 17 of which were biochemically characterized in this study. Unlike other thus far investigated grasses, S. italica contains TPSs producing all three ent-, (+)- and syn-copalyl pyrophosphate stereoisomers that naturally occur as central building blocks in the biosynthesis of distinct monocot diterpenoids. Conversion of these intermediates by the promiscuous TPS SiTPS8 yielded different diterpenoid scaffolds. Additionally, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP99A17), which genomically clustered with SiTPS8, catalyzes the C19 hydroxylation of SiTPS8 products to generate the corresponding diterpene alcohols. The presence of syntenic orthologs to about 19% of the S. italica TPSs in related grasses supports a common ancestry of selected pathway branches. Among the identified enzyme products, abietadien-19-ol, syn-pimara-7,15-dien-19-ol and germacrene-d-4-ol were detectable in planta, and gene expression analysis of the biosynthetic TPSs showed distinct and, albeit moderately, inducible expression patterns in response to biotic and abiotic stress.

These results support the idea that the degree of repellency may differ among plant allelochemicals and also emphasize the potential value of introgressing the presence of 9-hydroxy zingiberene and 9-hydroxy,10,11-epoxy-zingiberene into cultivated tomato to enhance its arthropod resistance.", "Keywords": ["Insect resistance", "Breeding", "Tomato", "Trichome", "antixenosis", "7-Epi-zingiberene", "9-Hydroxy-zingiberene", "Mite Repellency"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7047219?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Frontiers in plant science", "authorinfo": ["Dawood MH", "Snyder JC"], "title": "The Alcohol and Epoxy Alcohol of Zingiberene, Produced in Trichomes of Wild Tomato, Are More Repellent to Spider Mites Than Zingiberene."}, "PMC5777606": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "29367791", "source": "MED", "pmid": "29367791", "pmcid": "PMC5777606", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC5777606"}, "doi": "10.1016/j.envexpbot.2016.08.003", "title": "Mono- and sesquiterpene release from tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves upon mild and severe heat stress and through recovery: from gene expression to emission responses.", "authorString": "Pazouki L, Kanagendran A, Li S, K\u00e4nnaste A, Memari HR, Bichele R, Niinemets \u00dc.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Pazouki L", "firstName": "Leila", "lastName": "Pazouki", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Kreutzwaldi 1, Tartu 51014, Estonia."}}}, {"fullName": "Kanagendran A", "firstName": "Arooran", "lastName": "Kanagendran", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Kreutzwaldi 1, Tartu 51014, Estonia."}}}, {"fullName": "Li S", "firstName": "Shuai", "lastName": "Li", "initials": "S", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2545-7763"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Kreutzwaldi 1, Tartu 51014, Estonia."}}}, {"fullName": "K\u00e4nnaste A", "firstName": "Astrid", "lastName": "K\u00e4nnaste", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Kreutzwaldi 1, Tartu 51014, Estonia."}}}, {"fullName": "Memari HR", "firstName": "Hamid Rajabi", "lastName": "Memari", "initials": "HR", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Biotechnology and Life Science Center and School of Agriculture, Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran."}}}, {"fullName": "Bichele R", "firstName": "Rudolf", "lastName": "Bichele", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Molecular Pathology, Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia."}}}, {"fullName": "Niinemets \u00dc", "firstName": "\u00dclo", "lastName": "Niinemets", "initials": "\u00dc", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3078-2192"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Kreutzwaldi 1, Tartu 51014, Estonia."}, {"affiliation": "Estonian Academy of Sciences, Kohtu 6, 10130 Tallinn, Estonia."}]}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3078-2192"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-9753-7677"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2545-7763"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "supporting_data"}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "132", "journalIssueId": "2643526", "dateOfPublication": "2016 Dec", "monthOfPublication": "12", "yearOfPublication": "2016", "printPublicationDate": "2016-12-01", "journal": {"title": "Environmental and experimental botany", "ISOAbbreviation": "Environ Exp Bot", "medlineAbbreviation": "Environ Exp Bot", "NLMid": "7610775", "ISSN": "0098-8472"}}, "pubYear": "2016", "pageInfo": "1-15", "abstractText": "Plants frequently experience heat ramps of various severities, but how and to what degree plant metabolic activity recovers from mild and severe heat stress is poorly understood.

Here, we report the high-quality, chromosome-scale genomes of the tetraploid (Perilla frutescens) and the AA diploid progenitor (Perilla citriodora). Comparative analyses suggest post Neolithic allotetraploidization within 10,000 years, and nucleotide mutation in tetraploid is 10% more than in diploid, both of which are dominated by G:C\u2009\u2192\u2009A:T transitions.

However, little is known about the role of terpenoids in response to various adverse environmental stresses as other plants do in the form of signals during plant-environment interactions.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, trace amounts of volatiles consisting of \u03b1-santalene, epi-\u03b2-santalene, \u03b2-santalene, \u03b1-santalol, \u03b2-santalol, (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene, (E)-\u03b2-farnesene and \u03b2-bisabolene were found in the leaves of mature S. album trees. We identified more than 40 candidate terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes by mining publicly-available RNA-seq data and characterized the enzymes encoded by three cDNAs: one mono-TPS catalyzes the formation of mostly \u03b1-terpineol, and two multifunctional sesqui-TPSs, one of which produces (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and sesquisabinene as major products and another which catalyzes the formation of (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol as main products. Metabolite signatures and gene expression studies confirmed that santalol content is closely related with santalene synthase (SaSSY) transcripts in heartwood, which is key enzyme responsible for santalol biosynthesis. However, the expression of three new SaTPS genes differed significantly from SaSSY in the essential oil-producing heartwood. Increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, were detected in different tissues of S. album plants after applying 1 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 1 mM salicylic acid (SA), or exposure to 4\u00b0C, 38\u00b0C and high light intensity. MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of SaTPS1 and SaTPS2 in leaves. SaTPS1 to 3 transcripts were differentially activated among different tissues under adverse temperature and light stresses. In contrast, almost all SaSSY transcripts decreased in response to these environmental stresses, unlike SaTPS1 to 3.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Multifunctional enzymes were biochemically characterized, including one chloroplastic mono-TPS and two cytosolic sesqui-TPSs in sandalwood. Our results suggest the ecological importance of these three new SaTPS genes in defensive response to biotic attack and abiotic stresses in S. album.", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of South China

However, little is known about the role of terpenoids in response to various adverse environmental stresses as other plants do in the form of signals during plant-environment interactions.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, trace amounts of volatiles consisting of \u03b1-santalene, epi-\u03b2-santalene, \u03b2-santalene, \u03b1-santalol, \u03b2-santalol, (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene, (E)-\u03b2-farnesene and \u03b2-bisabolene were found in the leaves of mature S. album trees. We identified more than 40 candidate terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes by mining publicly-available RNA-seq data and characterized the enzymes encoded by three cDNAs: one mono-TPS catalyzes the formation of mostly \u03b1-terpineol, and two multifunctional sesqui-TPSs, one of which produces (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and sesquisabinene as major products and another which catalyzes the formation of (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol as main products. Metabolite signatures and gene expression studies confirmed that santalol content is closely related with santalene synthase (SaSSY) transcripts in heartwood, which is key enzyme responsible for santalol biosynthesis. However, the expression of three new SaTPS genes differed significantly from SaSSY in the essential oil-producing heartwood. Increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, were detected in different tissues of S. album plants after applying 1 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 1 mM salicylic acid (SA), or exposure to 4\u00b0C, 38\u00b0C and high light intensity. MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of SaTPS1 and SaTPS2 in leaves. SaTPS1 to 3 transcripts were differentially activated among different tissues under adverse temperature and light stresses. In contrast, almost all SaSSY transcripts decreased in response to these environmental stresses, unlike SaTPS1 to 3.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Multifunctional enzymes were biochemically characterized, including one chloroplastic mono-TPS and two cytosolic sesqui-TPSs in sandalwood. Our results suggest the ecological importance of these three new SaTPS genes in defensive response to biotic attack and abiotic stresses in S. album.", "Keywords": ["Salicylic acid", "Sesquiterpene",

This approach highlights the introduction of synthetic metabolism as an effective strategy for high-value compound production.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6707142?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Nature communications", "authorinfo": ["Ignea C", "Raadam MH", "Motawia MS", "Makris AM", "Vickers CE", "Kampranis SC"], "title": "Orthogonal monoterpenoid biosynthesis in yeast constructed on an isomeric substrate."}, "PMC6352525": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "30804629", "source": "MED", "pmid": "30804629", "pmcid": "PMC6352525", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6352525"}, "doi": "10.1007/s12298-018-0612-6", "title": "Terpene profiling, transcriptome analysis and characterization of <i>cis</i>-\u03b2-terpineol synthase from <i>Ocimum</i>.", "authorString": "Anand A, Jayaramaiah RH, Beedkar SD, Dholakia BB, Lavhale SG, Punekar SA, Gade WN, Thulasiram HV, Giri AP.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Anand A", "firstName": "Atul", "lastName": "Anand", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "1Plant Molecular Biology Unit, Division of Biochemical Sciences, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, 411008 Maharashtra India."}, {"affiliation": "2Chemical Biology Unit, Division of Organic Chemistry, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, 411008 Maharashtra India."}]}}, {"fullName": "Jayaramaiah RH", "firstName": "Ramesha H", "lastName": "Jayaramaiah", "initials": "RH", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "1Plant Molecular Biology Unit, Division of Biochemical Sciences, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, 411008 Maharashtra India."}}}, {"fullName": "Beedkar SD", "firstName": "Supriya D", "lastName": "Beedkar", "initials": "SD", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "2Chemical Biology Unit, Division of Organic Chemistry, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, 411008 Maharashtra India."}, {"affiliation": "3Department of Biotechnology, Savitribai Phule Pune University (Formerly University of Pune), Pune, 411007 Maharashtra India."}]}}, {"fullName": "Dholakia BB", "firstName": "Bhushan B", "lastName": "Dholakia", "initials": "BB", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "1Plant Molecular Biology Unit, Division of Biochemical Sciences, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, 411008 Maharashtra India."}}}, {"fullName": "Lavhale SG", "firstName": "Santosh G", "lastName": "Lavhale", "initials": "SG", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-7757-8378"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "1Plant Molecular Biology Unit, Division of Biochemical Sciences, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, 411008 Maharashtra India."}}}, {"fullName": "Punekar SA", "firstName": "Sachin A", "lastName": "Punekar", "initials": "SA", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Biospheres, Eshwari, 52/403, Laxminagar, Parvati, Pune, 411 009 Maharashtra India."}}}, {"fullName": "Gade WN", "firstName": "Wasudeo N", "lastName": "Gade", "initials": "WN", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "3Department of Biotechnology, Savitribai Phule Pune University (Formerly University of Pune), Pune, 411007 Maharashtra India."}}}, {"fullName": "Thulasiram HV", "firstName": "Hirekodathakallu V", "lastName": "Thulasiram", "initials": "HV", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "2Chemical Biology Unit, Division of Organic Chemistry, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, 411008 Maharashtra India."}, {"affiliation": "5CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Mall Road, New Delhi, 110007 India."}]}}, {"fullName": "Giri AP", "firstName": "Ashok P", "lastName": "Giri", "initials": "AP", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "1Plant Molecular Biology Unit, Division of Biochemical Sciences, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, 411008 Maharashtra India."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-7757-8378"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-4237-9664"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["related_data", "supporting_data"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "25", "journalIssueId": "2786299", "dateOfPublication": "2019 Jan", "monthOfPublication": "1", "yearOfPublication": "2019", "printPublicationDate": "2019-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Physiology and molecular biology of plants : an international journal of functional plant biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Physiol Mol Biol Plants", "medlineAbbreviation": "Physiol Mol Biol Plants", "NLMid": "101304333", "ISSN": "0971-5894", "ESSN": "0974-0430"}}, "pubYear": "2019", "pageInfo": "47-57", "abstractText": "<i>Ocimum</i> species produces a varied mix of different metabolites that imparts immense medicinal properties.

Transgenic plants generated by employing such methods offer the prospect of low-cost sustainable pest management; in this regard, we used chloroplast targeting and cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway enhancement in this study to investigate the interaction of santalenes and bergamotene with insects.

However, studies on the evolution and genetic breeding potential of guava are hindered by the lack of a reference genome. Here, we present a chromosome-level genomic assembly of guava using PacBio sequencing and Hi-C technology. We found that the genome assembly size was 443.8\u00a0Mb with a contig N50 of ~15.8\u00a0Mb. We annotated a total of 25\u00a0601 genes and 193.2\u00a0Mb of repetitive sequences for this genome.

Furthermore, the information on time-dependent modifications in VOC release during recovery from a combined stress is very limited. We studied the modifications in photosynthetic characteristics and constitutive and stress-induced volatile emissions in response to single and combined applications of acute ozone (4, 5, and 6 ppm) and wounding treatments through recovery (0.5-75 h) in a constitutive isoprene and mono- and sesquiterpene emitter <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i>. Overall, the photosynthetic characteristics were surprisingly resistant to all ozone and wounding treatments. Constitutive isoprene emissions were strongly upregulated by ozone and combined ozone and wounding treatments and remained high through recovery phase, but wounding applied alone reduced isoprene emission. All stress treatments enhanced emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles (LOX), mono- and sesquiterpenes, saturated aldehydes (C7-C10), benzenoids, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) pathway volatiles. Once elicited, GGDP volatile, saturated aldehyde and benzenoid emissions remained high through the recovery period. In contrast, LOX emissions, and total mono- and sesquiterpene emissions decreased through recovery period. However, secondary rises in total sesquiterpene emissions at 75 h and in total monoterpenes at 25-50 h were observed.

Furthermore, the information on time-dependent modifications in VOC release during recovery from a combined stress is very limited. We studied the modifications in photosynthetic characteristics and constitutive and stress-induced volatile emissions in response to single and combined applications of acute ozone (4, 5, and 6 ppm) and wounding treatments through recovery (0.5-75 h) in a constitutive isoprene and mono- and sesquiterpene emitter <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i>. Overall, the photosynthetic characteristics were surprisingly resistant to all ozone and wounding treatments. Constitutive isoprene emissions were strongly upregulated by ozone and combined ozone and wounding treatments and remained high through recovery phase, but wounding applied alone reduced isoprene emission. All stress treatments enhanced emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles (LOX), mono- and sesquiterpenes, saturated aldehydes (C7-C10), benzenoids, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) pathway volatiles. Once elicited, GGDP volatile, saturated aldehyde and benzenoid emissions remained high through the recovery period. In contrast, LOX emissions, and total mono- and sesquiterpene emissions decreased through recovery period. However, secondary rises in total sesquiterpene emissions at 75 h and in total monoterpenes at 25-50 h were observed. Overall, acute ozone and wounding treatments synergistically altered gas exchange characteristics and stress volatile emissions. Through the treatments and recovery period, stomatal ozone uptake rate and volatile emission rates were poorly correlated, reflecting possible ozone-scavenging effect of volatiles and thus, reduction of effective ozone dose and elicitation of induced defense by the acute ozone concentrations applied.

In addition to anthocyanin, the total contents of phenolics, flavonoids and soluble solids in SlMYB75-OE fruits were enhanced by 2.6, 4, and 1.2 times, respectively, compared to those of wild-type (WT) fruits. Interestingly, a number of aroma volatiles, such as aldehyde, phenylpropanoid-derived and terpene volatiles, were significantly increased in SlMYB75-OE fruits, with some terpene volatiles showing more than 10 times higher levels than those in WT fruits. Consistent with the metabolic assessment, transcriptomic profiling indicated that the genes involved in the ethylene signaling, phenylpropanoid and isoprenoid pathways were greatly upregulated in SlMYB75-OE fruits. Yeast one-hybrid and transactivation assays revealed that SlMYB75 is able to directly bind to the MYBPLANT and MYBPZM cis-regulatory elements and to activate the promoters of the LOXC, AADC2 and TPS genes. The identification of SlMYB75 as a key regulator of fruit quality attributes through the transcriptional regulation of downstream genes involved in several metabolic pathways opens new avenues towards engineering fruits with a higher sensory and nutritional quality.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6355774?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Horticulture research", "authorinfo": ["Jian W", "Cao H", "Yuan S", "Liu Y", "Lu J", "Lu W", "Li N", "Wang J", "Zou J", "Tang N", "Xu C", "Cheng Y", "Gao Y", "Xi W", "Bouzayen M", "Li Z"], "title": "SlMYB75, an MYB-type transcription factor, promotes anthocyanin accumulation and enhances volatile aroma production in tomato fruits."}, "PMC6941427": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31929782", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31929782", "pmcid": "PMC6941427", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6941427"}, "doi": "10.3389/fpls.2019.01638", "title": "Transcriptome and Phytochemical Analyses Provide New Insights Into Long Non-Coding RNAs Modulating Characteristic Secondary Metabolites of Oolong Tea (Camellia sinensis) in Solar-Withering.", "authorString": "Zhu C, Zhang S, Fu H, Zhou C, Chen L, Li X, Lin Y, Lai Z, Guo Y.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Zhu C", "firstName": "Chen", "lastName": "Zhu", "initials": "C", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5844-4662"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}, {"affiliation": "Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}]}}, {"fullName": "Zhang S", "firstName": "Shuting", "lastName": "Zhang", "initials": "S", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}, {"affiliation": "Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}]}}, {"fullName": "Fu H", "firstName": "Haifeng", "lastName": "Fu", "initials": "H", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Zhou C", "firstName": "Chengzhe", "lastName": "Zhou", "initials": "C", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Chen L", "firstName": "Lan", "lastName": "Chen", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Li X", "firstName": "Xiaozhen", "lastName": "Li", "initials": "X", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Lin Y", "firstName": "Yuling", "lastName": "Lin", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}, {"affiliation": "Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}]}}, {"fullName": "Lai Z", "firstName": "Zhongxiong", "lastName": "Lai", "initials": "Z", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}, {"affiliation": "Institute of Horticultural Biotechnology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}]}}, {"fullName": "Guo Y", "firstName": "Yuqiong", "lastName": "Guo", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-5844-4662"}}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "10", "journalIssueId": "2777619", "dateOfPublication": "2019", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2019", "printPublicationDate": "2019-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Frontiers in plant science", "ISOAbbreviation": "Front Plant Sci", "medlineAbbreviation": "Front Plant Sci", "NLMid": "101568200", "ISSN": "1664-462X", "ESSN": "1664-462X"}}, "pubYear": "2019", "pageInfo": "1638", "abstractText": "Oolong tea is a popular and semi-fermented beverage.

Here we show that maximal expression of all three genes occurs in the petiolule part of the leaf, but little expression of these genes occurs in the trichomes present on the petiolules. While lycosantalene or lycosantalonol cannot be detected in the petiolules of wild-type plants (or anywhere else in the plant), lycosantalene and lycosantalonol are detected in petiolules of transgenic tomato plants expressing CPT2 under the control of the 35S CaMV promoter. These results suggest that lycosantalene and lycosantalonol are produced in the petiolules and perhaps in other tissues of wild-type plants, but that low rate of synthesis, controlled by the rate-limiting enzyme CPT2, results in product levels that are too low for detection under our current methodology. It is also possible that these compounds are further modified in the plant. The involvement of CPT2, TPS21 and CYP71BN1 in a diterpenoid biosynthetic pathway outside the trichomes, together with the involvement of other genes in the cluster in the synthesis of monoterpenes in

Here the analysis of the transcriptome of S. elaeagnifolium is presented, as a means to explore the biology of this species and to identify genes related to its adaptation to environmental stress. One of the basic mechanisms by which plants respond to environmental stress is through the synthesis of specific secondary metabolites that protect the plant from herbivores and microorganisms, or serve as signaling molecules.

Functional characterization of two of the TPSs showed that one produced the sesquiterpene (E)-caryophyllene and the second produced the monoterpene camphene. Analysis of wounded S. elaeagnifolium leaves has shown significant increase of the concentration of (E)-caryophyllene and geranyl linalool, two terpenes implicated in stress responses. The increased production of (E)-caryophyllene was matched to the induced expression of the corresponding TPS gene. Wounding also led to the increased expression of the putative 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 2 (DXS2) gene, a key enzyme of the MEP pathway, corroborating the overall increased output of terpene biosynthesis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The reported S. elaeagnifolium de novo transcriptome provides a valuable sequence database that could facilitate study of this invasive weed and contribute to our understanding of the highly diverse Solanaceae family.

Floral scents are a key factor in plant-insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to \u03b2-thujene, sabinene, \u03b2-pinene, and \u03b1-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate.

Floral scents are a key factor in plant-insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to \u03b2-thujene, sabinene, \u03b2-pinene, and \u03b1-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate. The other two TPSs were identified as sesqui-TPSs. CoTPS3 catalysed the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to \u03b1-bergamotene, whereas CoTPS2 was found to be a multifunctional and novel TPS that could catalyse the synthesis of three sesquiterpenes, \u03b2-ylangene, \u03b2-copaene, and \u03b2-cubebene.

Amborellales, Nymphaeales and Austrobaileyales together form the so-called ANA-grade of angiosperms, which are extant representatives of lineages that diverged the\u00a0earliest from the lineage leading to the extant mesangiosperms<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we report the 409-megabase genome sequence of the blue-petal water lily (Nymphaea colorata). Our phylogenomic analyses support Amborellales and Nymphaeales as successive sister lineages to all other extant angiosperms. The N. colorata genome and 19 other water lily transcriptomes reveal a Nymphaealean whole-genome duplication event, which is shared by Nymphaeaceae and possibly Cabombaceae. Among the genes retained from this whole-genome duplication are homologues of genes that regulate flowering transition and flower development. The broad expression of homologues of floral ABCE genes in N. colorata might support a similarly broadly active ancestral ABCE model of floral organ determination in early angiosperms.

Here we report the 409-megabase genome sequence of the blue-petal water lily (Nymphaea colorata). Our phylogenomic analyses support Amborellales and Nymphaeales as successive sister lineages to all other extant angiosperms. The N. colorata genome and 19 other water lily transcriptomes reveal a Nymphaealean whole-genome duplication event, which is shared by Nymphaeaceae and possibly Cabombaceae. Among the genes retained from this whole-genome duplication are homologues of genes that regulate flowering transition and flower development. The broad expression of homologues of floral ABCE genes in N. colorata might support a similarly broadly active ancestral ABCE model of floral organ determination in early angiosperms. Water lilies have evolved attractive floral scents and colours, which are features shared with mesangiosperms, and we identified their putative biosynthetic genes in N. colorata.

Therefore, it is essential that plants are capable of sensing and differentiating mechanical injury from herbivore injury. Studies have shown that oral secretions (OS) from caterpillars contain elicitors of induced plant responses. However, studies that shows whether these elicitors originated from salivary glands or from other organs associated with feeding, such as the ventral eversible gland (VEG) are limited. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the secretions from the VEG gland of Spodoptera exigua caterpillars contain elicitors that induce plant defenses by regulating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other defense-related genes. To test this hypothesis, we quantified and compared the activity of defense-related enzymes, transcript levels of defense-related genes and VOC emission in tomato plants damaged by S. exigua caterpillars with the VEG intact (VEGI) versus plants damaged by caterpillars with the VEG ablated (VEGA).<h4>Results</h4>The quantified defense-related enzymes (i.e. peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and lipoxigenase) were expressed in significantly higher amounts in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars than in plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars. Similarly, the genes that encode for the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and terpene synthase genes that regulate production of terpene VOCs, were up-regulated in plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars. Moreover, the OS of VEGA caterpillars were less active in inducing the expression of defense genes in tomato plants. Increased emissions of VOCs were detected in the headspace of plants damaged by VEGI caterpillars compared to plants damaged by VEGA caterpillars.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results suggest that the VEG of S. exigua caterpillars contains elicitors of late plant defense signaling in tomato which trigger defense-related enzymatic activity, regulate expression of defense-related genes, and induce emission of plant VOCs.

These signaling cascades may have important ramifications for plant-insect and tritrophic interactions.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4032488?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "BMC plant biology", "authorinfo": ["Zebelo S", "Piorkowski J", "Disi J", "Fadamiro H"], "title": "Secretions from the ventral eversible gland of Spodoptera exigua caterpillars activate defense-related genes and induce emission of volatile organic compounds in tomato, Solanum lycopersicum."}, "PMC5777602": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "29367792", "source": "MED", "pmid": "29367792", "pmcid": "PMC5777602", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC5777602"}, "doi": "10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.03.014", "title": "Disproportionate photosynthetic decline and inverse relationship between constitutive and induced volatile emissions upon feeding of Quercus robur leaves by large larvae of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar).", "authorString": "Copolovici L, Pag A, K\u00e4nnaste A, Bodescu A, Tomescu D, Copolovici D, Soran ML, Niinemets \u00dc.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Copolovici L", "firstName": "Lucian", "lastName": "Copolovici", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Faculty of Food Engineering, Tourism and Environmental Protection, Research Center in Technical and Natural Sciences, \"Aurel Vlaicu\" University, Romania, 2 Elena Dragoi, Arad 310330, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "Pag A", "firstName": "Andreea", "lastName": "Pag", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Technical and Natural Sciences Research-Development of \"Aurel Vlaicu\" University, Romania, 2 Elena Dragoi, Arad 310330, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "K\u00e4nnaste A", "firstName": "Astrid", "lastName": "K\u00e4nnaste", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Kreutzwaldi 1, Tartu 51014, Estonia."}}}, {"fullName": "Bodescu A", "firstName": "Adina", "lastName": "Bodescu", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Faculty of Food Engineering, Tourism and Environmental Protection, Research Center in Technical and Natural Sciences, \"Aurel Vlaicu\" University, Romania, 2 Elena Dragoi, Arad 310330, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "Tomescu D", "firstName": "Daniel", "lastName": "Tomescu", "initials": "D", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Technical and Natural Sciences Research-Development of \"Aurel Vlaicu\" University, Romania, 2 Elena Dragoi, Arad 310330, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "Copolovici D", "firstName": "Dana", "lastName": "Copolovici", "initials": "D", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Faculty of Food Engineering, Tourism and Environmental Protection, Research Center in Technical and Natural Sciences, \"Aurel Vlaicu\" University, Romania, 2 Elena Dragoi, Arad 310330, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "Soran ML", "firstName": "Maria-Loredana", "lastName": "Soran", "initials": "ML", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-3770-9702"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "National Institute of Research and Development for Isotopic and Molecular Technologies, Cluj-Napoca 400293, Romania."}}}, {"fullName": "Niinemets \u00dc", "firstName": "\u00dclo", "lastName": "Niinemets", "initials": "\u00dc", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3078-2192"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Kreutzwaldi 1, Tartu 51014, Estonia."}, {"affiliation": "Estonian Academy of Sciences, Kohtu 6, 10130 Tallinn, Estonia."}]}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-3078-2192"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-9753-7677"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-3770-9702"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "altmetrics"}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "138", "journalIssueId": "2546295", "dateOfPublication": "2017 Jun", "monthOfPublication": "6", "yearOfPublication": "2017", "printPublicationDate": "2017-06-01", "journal": {"title": "Environmental and experimental botany", "ISOAbbreviation": "Environ Exp Bot", "medlineAbbreviation": "Environ Exp Bot", "NLMid": "7610775", "ISSN": "0098-8472"}}, "pubYear": "2017", "pageInfo": "184-192", "abstractText": "Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L., Lymantriinae) is a major pest of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) forests in Europe, but how its infections scale with foliage physiological characteristics, in particular with photosynthesis rates and emissions of volatile organic compounds has not been studied.

Several terpene modules could be assigned to previously identified terpene synthase (TPS) activities that included members of the TPS-e/f subfamily that utilize the unusual cis-prenyl diphosphate substrates neryl diphosphate and 2z,6z-farnesyl diphosphate. DNA sequencing and in vitro enzyme activity analysis of TPS-e/f members from S.\u00a0habrochaites identified three previously unassigned enzyme activities that utilize these cisoid substrates. These produce either the monoterpenes \u03b1-pinene and limonene, or the sesquiterpene 7-epizingiberene, with the in vitro analyses that recapitulated the trichome chemistry found in planta. Comparison of the distribution of S.\u00a0habrochaites accessions with terpene content revealed a strong preference for the presence of particular TPS20 alleles at distinct geographic locations.

revealed the presence of 21 mono- and sesquiterpenes that exhibit a range of qualitative and quantitative variation. Hierarchical clustering identified distinct terpene phenotypic modules with shared patterns of terpene accumulation across accessions. Several terpene modules could be assigned to previously identified terpene synthase (TPS) activities that included members of the TPS-e/f subfamily that utilize the unusual cis-prenyl diphosphate substrates neryl diphosphate and 2z,6z-farnesyl diphosphate. DNA sequencing and in vitro enzyme activity analysis of TPS-e/f members from S.\u00a0habrochaites identified three previously unassigned enzyme activities that utilize these cisoid substrates. These produce either the monoterpenes \u03b1-pinene and limonene, or the sesquiterpene 7-epizingiberene, with the in vitro analyses that recapitulated the trichome chemistry found in planta. Comparison of the distribution of S.\u00a0habrochaites accessions with terpene content revealed a strong preference for the presence of particular TPS20 alleles at distinct geographic locations. This study reveals that the unusually high intra-specific variation of volatile terpene synthesis in glandular trichomes of S.\u00a0habrochaites is due at least in part to evolution at the TPS20

We hypothesised that hormonal signalling regulating defences to different herbivores may interact with drought responses, causing distinct resistance phenotypes. To test this, we studied the hormonal and transcriptomic responses of <i>Solanum dulcamara</i> subjected to drought and herbivory by the generalist <i>Spodoptera exigua</i> (beet armyworm; BAW) or the specialist <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i> (Colorado potato beetle; CPB). Bioassays showed that the performance of BAW, but not CPB, decreased on plants under drought compared to controls. While drought did not alter BAW-induced hormonal responses, it enhanced the CPB-induced accumulation of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid (SA), and suppressed ethylene (ET) emission. Microarray analyses showed that under drought, BAW herbivory enhanced several herbivore-induced responses, including cell-wall remodelling and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and secondary metabolites. In contrast, CPB herbivory enhanced several photosynthesis-related and pathogen responses in drought-stressed plants. This may divert resources away from defence production and increase leaf nutritive value.

We hypothesised that hormonal signalling regulating defences to different herbivores may interact with drought responses, causing distinct resistance phenotypes. To test this, we studied the hormonal and transcriptomic responses of <i>Solanum dulcamara</i> subjected to drought and herbivory by the generalist <i>Spodoptera exigua</i> (beet armyworm; BAW) or the specialist <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i> (Colorado potato beetle; CPB). Bioassays showed that the performance of BAW, but not CPB, decreased on plants under drought compared to controls. While drought did not alter BAW-induced hormonal responses, it enhanced the CPB-induced accumulation of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid (SA), and suppressed ethylene (ET) emission. Microarray analyses showed that under drought, BAW herbivory enhanced several herbivore-induced responses, including cell-wall remodelling and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and secondary metabolites. In contrast, CPB herbivory enhanced several photosynthesis-related and pathogen responses in drought-stressed plants. This may divert resources away from defence production and increase leaf nutritive value. In conclusion, while BAW suffers from the drought-enhanced defences, CPB may benefit from the effects of enhanced SA and reduced ET signalling. This suggests that the fine-tuned interaction between the plant and its specialist herbivore is sustained under drought.", "Keywords": ["Transcriptional regulation", "Spodoptera exigua", "Plant defence", "Leptinotarsa decemlineata", "Drought Response", "Hormonal Signalling", "Solanum Dulcamara"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6321310?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "International journal of molecular sciences", "authorinfo": ["Nguyen D", "Poeschl Y", "Lortzing T", "Hoogveld R", "Gogol-D\u00f6ring A", "Cristescu SM", "Steppuhn A", "Mariani C", "Rieu I", "van Dam NM"], "title": "Interactive Responses of <i>Solanum Dulcamara</i> to Drought and Insect Feeding are Herbivore Species-Specific."}, "PMC4464248": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "26062733", "source": "MED", "pmid": "26062733", "pmcid": "PMC4464248", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC4464248"}, "doi": "10.1186/s12864-015-1598-x", "title": "The Eucalyptus terpene synthase gene family.", "authorString": "K\u00fclheim C, Padovan A, Hefer C, Krause ST, K\u00f6llner TG, Myburg AA, Degenhardt J, Foley WJ.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "K\u00fclheim C", "firstName": "Carsten", "lastName": "K\u00fclheim", "initials": "C", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Research School of Biology, College of Medicine, Biology and the Environment, Australian National University, Canberra, 0200, Australia.

Trichomes of many plants in the nightshade family (Solanaceae) produce O-acylsugars, and in cultivated and wild tomatoes these are mixtures of aliphatic esters of sucrose and glucose of varying structures and quantities documented to contribute to insect defense. We characterized the first two enzymes of acylsucrose biosynthesis in the cultivated tomato Solanum lycopersicum. These are type I/IV trichome-expressed BAHD acyltransferases encoded by Solyc12g006330--or S. lycopersicum acylsucrose acyltransferase 1 (Sl-ASAT1)--and Solyc04g012020 (Sl-ASAT2).
