We analyzed the transcriptome of Alphonso mango through Illumina sequencing from seven stages of fruit development and ripening as well as flower. Total transcriptome data from these stages ranged between 65 and 143&#x02009;Mb. Importantly, 20,755 unique transcripts were annotated and 4,611 were assigned enzyme commission numbers, which encoded 142 biological pathways. These included ethylene and flavor related secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, as well as those involved in metabolism of starch, sucrose, amino acids and fatty acids. Differential regulation (p-value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05) of thousands of transcripts was evident in various stages of fruit development and ripening. Novel transcripts for biosynthesis of mono-terpenes, sesqui-terpenes, di-terpenes, lactones and furanones involved in flavor formation were identified. Large number of transcripts encoding cell wall modifying enzymes was found to be steady in their expression, while few were differentially regulated through these stages. Novel 79 transcripts of inhibitors of cell wall modifying enzymes were simultaneously detected throughout Alphonso fruit development and ripening, suggesting controlled activity of these enzymes involved in fruit softening.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Mango (<italic>Mangifera indica</italic> L.) is one of the most popular and highly favored fruit. Global mango production was reported to be 43.3 million metric tons in 2013 preceding banana, apple, grape and orange.

There are thousands of mango cultivars worldwide, among which Alphonso, Keitt, Kent, Lilli, Zill, Osteen, Haden, Kesar, Pairi, Dashehari, Langra and Banganapalli are well known. These varieties vary in their fruit color, size, shape, flavor, taste and ripening period and pattern. To understand the composition and biosynthesis of their unique flavor and complex ripening process various studies have been carried out at metabolic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, proteomic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, genetic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and post-harvest processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> levels. Whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) are the two important high throughput technologies recently adopted to understand the complex cellular and physiological processes in fruits such as citrus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, tomato<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and strawberry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> as well as domestication and diseases tolerance in citrus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Although mango genome sequence is yet not available, few recent studies have described the transcriptomic analysis from various tissues of few mango cultivars. The first report from Zill mango<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> provided extensive transcriptomic and proteomic profiling from pulp and skin tissues of four fruit developing stages using pooled RNA but not stage specific and differentially expressed transcripts. Another study of leaf transcriptome and chloroplast genome sequencing from cultivar Langra provided information about the production of several bioactive compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Transcriptome analysis from two (raw and ripe) and three (raw, mid ripe and ripe) stages of Kent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and Dashehari fruit pulp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, respectively provided important insights into the ripening process and flavor biogenesis in these mango cultivars.</p><p id="Par3">India is the largest producer and exporter of mango with 40.6% share in international mango market (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fao.org">http://www.fao.org</ext-link>). Among the Indian mango cultivars Alphonso is globally favored and highly exported mango due to its unique and attractive flavor, low fiber containing pulp and high carotene content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The ripening duration of Alphonso mango is 15 days from harvest, which is the highest among all mango cultivars; for example, the ripening duration for Kent and Dashehari mango fruit is 10 and 6 days, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Fruit ripening in Alphonso mango progresses from skin towards the stone leading to attractive skin color and easy monitoring of ripening progress. On the other hand various mango varieties, <italic>viz</italic>. Haden, Keitt, Kent, Tommy Atkins (National Mango Board, USA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mango.org">http://www.mango.org</ext-link>) and Dashehari<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> show polarity of their ripening from fruit stone to skin, making it difficult to identify ripened fruits. Longer ripening duration and shelf life of Alphonso mango provides sufficient time for its transportation globally. The mechanisms underlying these unique properties of Alphonso mango need to be explored in depth at spatial and temporal level of fruit development and ripening using transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic approaches as they can be correlated to the specific phenotype. In the present study, we performed transcriptome analysis of Alphonso mango through eight different tissues such as flower, whole fruit at 30 and 60 DAP (Days After Pollination), pulp and skin of 90 DAP fruit (mature raw fruit) and pulp from three fruit ripening stages i.e. 5 DAH (Days After Harvest): table green stage; 10 DAH: mid ripe stage and 15 DAH: ripe stage to analyze various fruit developing and ripening processes in Alphonso mango.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Alphonso mango transcriptome</title><p id="Par4">Alphonso mango transcriptome was screened through eight tissue samples.

These studies have identified genes encoding multiple enzymes involved in various pathways of primary and secondary metabolism such as, citrate cycle, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis from carbohydrate metabolism; fatty acid biosynthesis, beta oxidation and salicylic acid biosynthesis from fatty acid metabolism; biosynthesis and degradation of various amino acids as well as ethylene biosynthesis from methionine. Genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis, vitamin biosynthesis (&#x003b2;-carotene and &#x003b1;-tocopherols) as well as terpenoid backbone synthesis (mevalonate pathway) have also been well explored. In the present study genes involved in all these pathways were identified and their differential expression was also evident through various stages of the Alphonso mango fruit development and ripening (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">ST1</xref>).

In this study, we identified six, five and three genes encoding mono-terpene synthases (MTPS), sesqui- terpene synthases (STPS) and di-terpene synthases (DTPS), respectively that are involved in biosynthesis of specific terpene molecules (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SF9</xref>). These genes were abundant in the flower tissue followed by 30 DAP stage. Further, the transcript abundance of many of these terpene synthase genes in the present study has been depicted to be idiosyncratic to the developing stages, leading to their least expression in the ripening stages of Alphonso fruit (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SF7</xref> and Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">ST2</xref>). Previous aroma volatile analysis from Alphonso mango supports this observation wherein flower had the highest concentration of mono-terpenes, oxygenated mono-terpenes and sesqui-terpenes which decreased through the fruit development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">Another flavor related pathway is lipoxygenase (LOX) followed by HPL pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which produces C6 GLVs and lactones through peroxygenase pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

In spite of their biological significance, none of the previous transcriptome studies on mango could determine the presence of peroxygenase and epoxide hydrolase genes. On the other hand in the current study various contigs encoding novel EH (three contigs), EH2 (four contigs) and peroxygenase (three contigs) were detected. Similarly, multiple transcripts encoding <italic>enone oxidoreductase</italic> and <italic>O-methyltransferase</italic>&#x000a0;having role in furanone biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> were also identified and expression profiles of many of them were shown to be ripening specific (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SF7</xref>). Abundance and ripening related expression of large number of these unique flavor related genes in Alphonso mango (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SF7</xref>) signifies their role in synthesis of diverse aroma volatiles and their unique blend giving sweet and fruity flavor in Alphonso as shown by our previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">Fruit ripening is a complex physiological process and can be characterized by means of fruit softening due to changes in the cell wall structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, increased sugar content by polysaccharide hydrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and changes in the aroma volatiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

Only one transcript coding for &#x003b1;-amylase (contig_1439) was down-regulated through flower to 30 DAP fruit transition while others were expressed throughout the fruit developing and ripening stages. On the other hand, transcriptome analysis of Kent mango revealed identification of four &#x003b2;-amylase and three &#x003b1;-amylase transcripts out of which only two &#x003b2;-amylase coding transcripts were found to be up-regulated in ripe tissue, none of the other showed differential expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">In addition, we also detected large number of PL, PG and PE encoding transcripts known to be responsible for degradation of complex hetero-polysaccharide, pectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> were detected (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">ST4</xref>). Most of these had stable expression and only few were differentially expressed in Alphonso mango. These results are in contrast to the observations from Kent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and Dashehari<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> mango transcriptomic data in terms of the number of unigenes detected and their differential regulation. In case of Dashehari mango four PL and none of the PE or PG encoding transcripts were up-regulated; whereas in Kent, four PL, six PE and six PG encoding unigenes were up-regulated. These results signify controlled and steady activity of pectin degradation leading to slow and balanced transitions during Alphonso fruit ripening and this might be one of the reasons for its longer shelf life.</p><p id="Par29">Another interesting observation in our study was, the identification of 79 contigs encoding 20 different inhibitor classes from Alphonso mango (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">SF8</xref>).

As a representative example the balance between pectinesterases and their inhibitors during Alphonso fruit development and ripening has been demonstrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> as heatmap and area chart of expression of PE and PEI.

Among these some transcripts were uniquely found at 15 DAH stage (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">ST2</xref>) suggesting accelerated primary metabolism. Moreover, contig 6946 encoding cytokinin riboside 5 -monophosphate phosphoribohydrolase was uniquely observed at 15 DAH stage.

On the other hand contig_6770 encoding phospholipase-D (PLD) involved in degradation of important cell membrane component i.e. phospholipids was observed to be upregulated (3.4fold). A key role of PLD in softening was well explained in tomato plants transformed with antisense PLD cDNA which showed delayed ripening and increased firmness in tomato fruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.

Briefly, 1&#x02009;ug of total RNA from each sample was used to prepare eight individual libraries and mRNA was purified using polyT oligo beads. The purified mRNA was fragmented in the range of 100 to 140 bases with optimum at around 120 bases and the cDNA was synthesized. End repair, A-Tailing, Adapter ligation and the library preparation were performed using Tru Seq RNA sample preparation kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, USA) as per manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. PCR enrichment was performed for 15 cycles and the sample was validated on the Bioanalyzer 2100. Libraries were sequenced in a Paired End 100 base run, using TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS (Catalog No.: FC-401-3001) for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq. 1000 platform according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommended protocols.
