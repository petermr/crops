Furthermore, the information on time-dependent modifications in VOC release during recovery from a combined stress is very limited. We studied the modifications in photosynthetic characteristics and constitutive and stress-induced volatile emissions in response to single and combined applications of acute ozone (4, 5, and 6 ppm) and wounding treatments through recovery (0.5-75 h) in a constitutive isoprene and mono- and sesquiterpene emitter <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i>. Overall, the photosynthetic characteristics were surprisingly resistant to all ozone and wounding treatments. Constitutive isoprene emissions were strongly upregulated by ozone and combined ozone and wounding treatments and remained high through recovery phase, but wounding applied alone reduced isoprene emission. All stress treatments enhanced emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles (LOX), mono- and sesquiterpenes, saturated aldehydes (C7-C10), benzenoids, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) pathway volatiles. Once elicited, GGDP volatile, saturated aldehyde and benzenoid emissions remained high through the recovery period. In contrast, LOX emissions, and total mono- and sesquiterpene emissions decreased through recovery period. However, secondary rises in total sesquiterpene emissions at 75 h and in total monoterpenes at 25-50 h were observed. Overall, acute ozone and wounding treatments synergistically altered gas exchange characteristics and stress volatile emissions. Through the treatments and recovery period, stomatal ozone uptake rate and volatile emission rates were poorly correlated, reflecting possible ozone-scavenging effect of volatiles and thus, reduction of effective ozone dose and elicitation of induced defense by the acute ozone concentrations applied.
