Many accessions of the wild tomato relative, <italic>Solanum habrochaites</italic> (<italic>S.h</italic>), possess high levels of resistance to arthropods. The monocyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, 7-epi-zingiberene, is a major defensive component found in trichome secretions of certain accessions of <italic>S.h</italic>. We have used LA2329, an <italic>S.h</italic>. accession, as a donor in a breeding program designed to introgress zingiberene into cultivated tomato. However, the composition of trichome secretions in our population of LA2329 is segregating, with some individuals producing mainly 7-epi-zingiberene in their secretions while others producing two additional, unidentified compounds in their trichome secretions. To investigate if these other compounds may also contribute to arthropod resistance, trichome secretions were collected from plants of <italic>S.h</italic> LA2329 grown under greenhouse conditions and then major compounds were isolated by silica gel column chromatography and tested for their ability to repel two spotted-spider mite (TSSM), <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic>. Isolation and identification of allelochemicals were aided by use of gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The results revealed the presence of three predominate chromatographic peaks: 7-epi-zingiberene, 9-hydroxy zingiberene, and 9-hydroxy,10,11-epoxy-zingiberene. Results of testing isolated compounds for repellency to TSSM using bridge bioassays revealed that the repellent activities of 9-hydroxy zingiberene and 9-hydroxy,10,11-epoxy-zingiberene were each significantly higher than that for 7-epi-zingiberene. These results support the idea that the degree of repellency may differ among plant allelochemicals and also emphasize the potential value of introgressing the presence of 9-hydroxy zingiberene and 9-hydroxy,10,11-epoxy-zingiberene into cultivated tomato to enhance its arthropod resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>breeding</kwd><kwd>insect resistance</kwd><kwd>7-epi-zingiberene</kwd><kwd>9-hydroxy-zingiberene</kwd><kwd>tomato</kwd><kwd>mite repellency</kwd><kwd>antixenosis</kwd><kwd>trichome</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="6023"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tomato, <italic>Solanum lycopersicum,</italic> is one of the most widely grown and important vegetables produced worldwide (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dorais et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Numerous factors can affect tomato productivity dramatically. One of these factors is arthropod infestation, resulting in direct damage and/or disease transmission (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nault and Speese III, 2002</xref>). Most cultivated tomatoes are susceptible to diseases and pests, leading growers to apply pesticides and insecticides (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Letourneau and Goldstein, 2001</xref>) to control these problems. Breeding for resistance may provide an alternative to extensive pesticide use.</p><p>Tomato has been greatly improved by introgression of disease resistance genes from wild relatives (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hajjar and Hodgkin, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Firdaus et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). There are wild tomato accessions that are highly resistant to a wide range of arthropod pests (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Freitas et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>), but introgression of arthropod resistance into commercially accepted tomato varieties remains an unfulfilled goal.</p><p>High levels of resistance to arthropods exist in several wild species of tomato and in many cases, resistance has been associated with trichomes and trichome secretions (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Snyder et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Schilmiller et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ekanayaka et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). For example, acyl sugars secreted by trichomes on <italic>S. pennellii, S. galapagense,</italic> and <italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic> have been associated with resistance to an array of arthropods (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Shapiro et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Liedl et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Mutschler et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Alba et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">de Resende et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dias et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).

For other accessions of <italic>S.h</italic>, resistance has been attributed to the presence of sesquiterpenes in their trichome secretions (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Carter et&#x000a0;al., 1989a</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Weston et&#x000a0;al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Eigenbrode et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chatzivasileiadis and Sabelis, 1997</xref>).</p><p>It has been known for more than 25 years that trichomes on certain accessions of <italic>S. h</italic>. were associated with the production of sesquiterpenes and that there was structural diversity among sesquiterpenes produced (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Guo et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>). Additionally, oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, mainly carboxy acids of sesquiterpenes have been documented in <italic>S.h</italic>. often as predominate components of trichome secretions (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Coates et&#x000a0;al., 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Snyder et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>). More recently diversity and details of terpene production, especially those terpenes present in trichome secretions has been elucidated in <italic>S.h</italic>. Much of the chemical diversity of trichome secretions in <italic>S. h.</italic> has been associated with sequence variation of sesquiterpene or monoterpene synthases associated with the TPS20 locus located on chromosome 8 of tomato. All of these enzymes utilize cisoid substrates, either neryl diphosphate for monoterpene production or 2z,6z-farnesyl diphosphate for sesquiterpene production (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">van der Hoeven et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Besser et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Sallaud et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Schilmiller et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Falara et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). </p><p>There is an extensive collection of wild tomato germplasm curated by the Tomato Genetics Resource Center (TGRC), located in Davis, California. Over a period of many years, <italic>S.h</italic>. has been systematically collected over its natural geographic range. This extensive and valuable resource is maintained for researchers worldwide. <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Gonzales&#x02010;Vigil et&#x000a0;al. (2012)</xref> have surveyed 79 accessions of <italic>S.h</italic>. from the collection at TGRC for diversity of trichome-associated terpene production. Trichome secretions on these accessions were predominated either by sesquiterpenes or by monoterpenes. 21 different terpenes were detected among these 79 accessions. And the accessions could be grouped by the predominate sesquiterpene present in the trichome secretions. For example, trichome secretions on more than &#x000bd; of the accessions were predominated by 7-epi-zingberene <bold>[1]</bold>. The sesquiterpene gamma-elemene was predominate on 19 accessions, beta caryophyllene was predominate on nine accessions and trichome secretions on 8 of the 79 accessions were predominated by monoterpenes, either &#x003b2;-phellandrene or limonene. How this chemical diversity may relate to arthropod resistance has not been well characterized</p><p>Among accessions, there is an array of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons produced by trichomes on <italic>S.h.</italic> (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ekanayaka et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). However, the presence of 7-epi-zingiberene <bold>[1]</bold> has frequently been associated with pest resistance (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Carter et&#x000a0;al., 1989b</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Antonious and Kochhar, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bleeker et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">&#x000c1;lvarez Gil, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">de Oliveira et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Recently at the University of Kentucky, we have been attempting to introgress the presence of high levels of <bold>[1]</bold> and high type IV trichome density from <italic>S.h.</italic> LA2329 into cultivated tomato. We have been successful in the introgression of <bold>[1]</bold> from wild to cultivated tomato, and currently possess several advanced breeding BC3F7 lines having yields and seed set similar to the recurrent parent with levels of <bold>[1]</bold> similar to that in the wild donor parent (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Snyder et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). As part of this breeding program we have worked extensively with the <italic>S.h.</italic> donor line LA2329. Associated operations have included seed increase and monitoring production of <bold>[1]</bold>. Several years ago, we discovered that the composition of trichome secretions varied within our population of LA2329, with some plants having one major component and others having three major components as determined by gas chromatography. All plants produced <bold>[1]</bold>, but some of the plants also produced two additional abundant compounds of unknown identity that were later eluting than <bold>[1]</bold> when separated by gas chromatography. We have maintained these two distinct chemotypes by selfing or sib-mating within chemotypes. Leaves of the two chemotypes appeared to be equally resistant to spider mites when bioassayed. However, after an unintended infestation of whiteflies <italic>(Bemisia</italic> spp.) in our greenhouse we observed that the plants having the three major compounds were less preferred than those with <bold>[1]</bold> alone. This difference in whitefly preference between chemotypes could have been related to quantitative or qualitative chemical differences in the chemotypes, or to other, unmeasured differences.</p><p>Based on these observations, we were particularly interested in assessing the potential for qualitative differences of antixenotic activity of the three major compounds present in LA2329. Because the bridge bioassay has the ability to demonstrate differences in antixenotic activity or repellency to spider mites among closely related compounds (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Snyder et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), the goal of this research was to isolate and evaluate the spider mite repellency of the three major compounds present in trichome secretions of LA2329. We wanted to know whether these three compounds differed in their degree of repellency to spider mites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Biological Materials</title><p>Seeds of <italic>S.h.</italic> accessions LA2329 and LA2167 were obtained from the Tomato Genetics Resource Center, Davis, CA and seeds of PI127826 were obtained from USDA-ARS, Geneva NY.

To prepare leaflet washes the center 1/3 portion of each of three leaflets from the third leaf position of a plant was placed into a 20 ml vial and then 2.0 ml of <italic>n-</italic>hexane was added. The vials were vortexed for 30 s and then the extract was analyzed by GC-FID using procedures outlined below. The area of extracted leaf tissue was determined by using the open-source image analysis software ImageJ/Fiji (ImageJ 1.47v, National Institutes of Health, USA).

After the <italic>n</italic>-hexane evaporated, a very small strip of &#x0fb01;lter paper (2 &#x000d7; 10 mm) was used as a bridge between the two rectangles of filter paper. Then an adult female spider mite was placed on the center of the bridge and mite movement was visually tracked. The filter paper over which the mite exited from the bridge was recorded, and the mite was removed. Subsequently, a new (naive) spider mite was placed on the bridge. Two bridges constructed side-by-side permitted testing one concentration of a solution with 30 mites in less than 30 min. For these 30 mites, the sums of the exits over treatment and over control rectangles, was expressed as a ratio - the exit ratio.

This indicates that the secretion composition of PI127826 and LA2167 was more similar to that on LA2329-A than to that on LA2329-B. In terms of the quality of trichome secretions, the quality of the secretion from LA2329-A was nearly the same as the trichome secretion qualities on PI127826 and LA2167, and was very different from the quality of the secretion on LA2329-B.</p><fig id="f1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Chromatogram (GC-FID) of <italic>n</italic>-hexane leaflet wash from: (1) the LA2329-B chemotype showing a single major component at retention time of 6.00 min; (2) the LA2329-A chemotype showing three major components at retention times of 6.00, 6.91, and 7.23 min; (3) LA2167 showing three major components at retention times of 6.00, 6.91, and 7.23 min; (4) PI127826 showing three major components at retention times of 6.00, 6.91, and 7.23 min.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-11-00035-g001"/></fig><p>When data for component abundances were analyzed by ANOVA, abundance of <bold>[1]</bold> (F = 6.15, P = 0.029), <bold>[2]</bold> (F = 61.87, P &#x0003c; 0.0001), and <bold>[3]</bold> (F = 42.25, P = 0.0002) varied significantly among plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">

That we uncovered variation in trichome secretion composition within LA2329 is not surprising because it has been noted that there is more genetic variability within a single accession of self-incompatible wild tomato such LA2329 than there is in all of cultivated tomato (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bai and Lindhout, 2007</xref>). It is likely that a systematic search of the other wild tomato accessions would uncover chemical diversity in their trichome secretions. Also, it is likely that variation for presence of <bold>[2]</bold> and <bold>[3]</bold> in our population of LA2329 was directly connected to variation associated with the zingiberene polyoxidase locus.</p><p>Because of the apparent greater repellent activity of the oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, <bold>[2]</bold> and <bold>[3],</bold> plant breeders should consider introgression of these compounds into cultivated tomato, with a view toward additional evaluation of the role of these compounds in arthropod resistance of tomato. Hopefully, tomato plants that produce these more repellent compounds would demonstrate greater resistance to spider mites, and perhaps, to other arthropods.</p><p>Introgression of zingiberene oxidase may be a relatively straightforward breeding task. Likely a single enzyme, a cytochrome P450, is responsible for producing these two compounds from 7-epi-zingiberene (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Anonymous, 2017</xref>). Thus, introgression may be particularly direct when using a recurrent parent such as one of our advanced breeding lines that produce high concentrations of <bold>[1]</bold> in their trichomes. Introgression of the ability to produce the alcohol <bold>[2]</bold> and epoxide <bold>[3]</bold> may also lead to greater production of total sesquiterpenoids on tomato, similar to the difference of sesquiterpenoid production between the LA2329-A and LA2329-B chemotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">

</xref>).</p><p>The bridge or springboard bioassay has been demonstrated as sufficiently sensitive to detect differences in repellency of molecules having subtle structural differences, such as the presence or absence of a double bond (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Snyder et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). The results reported here support the conclusion that the bridge bioassay can be used to demonstrate differences of repellency between a sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, <bold>[1]</bold>, and two oxygenated derivatives of zingiberene, <bold>[2]</bold> and <bold>[3]</bold>. However, this bioassay did not demonstrate any difference in repellent activity between the two oxygenated derivatives of <bold>[1]</bold>.</p><p>Volatile substances present in plant glandular trichomes can prevent and/or reduce interactions with arthropod vectors of viral diseases (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aharoni et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), thereby reducing disease incidence. For example, the presence of exogenously applied <bold>[1]</bold> seems to repel the whitefly (<italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>) from tomato plants. Because <italic>B. tabaci</italic> is a begomovirus vector (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Rosen et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>), <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bleeker et&#x000a0;al. (2012)</xref> suggested that introduction of the biosynthetic pathway for production of <bold>[1]</bold> would provide protection against virus transmission. Introduction of the ability of the plant to produce <bold>[2]</bold> and/or <bold>[3]</bold> could be even more beneficial if these oxygenated forms of zingiberene are more effective than <bold>[1]</bold> in repelling whiteflies, similar to our findings with TSSM.</p><p>Some wild tomato species are known as having very high levels of arthropod resistance (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Rick, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Simmons and Gurr, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Barrantes et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). While the existence of these genetic resources is valuable, complete delineation of a resistant phenotype for a highly resistant individual can be difficult. For example, evaluation by bioassay of causes of resistance in a plant having high levels of antixenosis could mask mechanisms of antibiosis. Likewise, presence of multiple active compounds such as in the A chemotype of LA2329, can considerably complicate delineation of causes of resistance. Although there are many wild sources of resistance to arthropods, the lack of released varieties having high levels of resistance is a good indication of difficulty of using these genetic resources.</p><p>Results of the research have implications not only for tomato breeders but also for chemical ecologists, and plant evolutionists as well. This research was prompted by the presence of two chemotypes within our locally maintained population of LA2329 and an observation that one chemotype appeared more resistant to whitefly than the other. According to the Tomato Genetics Resource Center (tgrc.ucdavis.edu) the <italic>S.h</italic>. accession LA2329 is allogamous-self-incompatible. However, our population of LA2329 was established from just a few plants, and because of this, as we have produced subsequent seed generations, we have also likely inbred some of the plants which could have allowed expression of recessive genes. That we uncovered variation for composition of trichome secretions within an accession of <italic>S.h</italic>. is not surprising, given the genetic variability available in wild tomato accessions (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bai and Lindhout, 2007</xref>). We believe that this is the first report of qualitative variation of trichome secretion composition within an accession of <italic>S.h.</italic> Furthermore, it is likely that the chemotypic variability observed in our population of LA2329 is associated with the variability in the expression or activity of the P450 oxidase responsible for production of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids <bold>[2]</bold> and <bold>[3]</bold> as described by <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Anonymous (2017)</xref>. Furthermore, given the extensive genetic variability that exists within wild tomato accessions, it is likely that components of trichome secretions may be variable within other accessions of <italic>S.h</italic>. The potential for variability of sesquiterpenoids in trichome sections of <italic>S.h</italic>. should attract research interest by chemical ecologists, plant evolutionists as well at those interested practical aspects of plant-arthropod interactions, such as entomologists and plant breeders.</p><p>In conclusion, the preparative separation and purification of <bold>[1]</bold>, <bold>[2]</bold> and <bold>[3]</bold> were successfully accomplished. After identification and purification, the three major allelochemical components were tested for TSSM repellency in the bridge bioassay. All allelochemical components repelled spider mites. Yet, the activities of <bold>[2]</bold> and <bold>[3]</bold> were both much higher than that for <bold>[1]</bold>. Future research should center on introgression of these sesquiterpenoids into cultivated tomato and evaluation of their antibiotic and antixenotic activities on arthropods other than TSSM. Future studies should also utilize these three allelochemical components to minimize pesticide use and guarantee long-term pest management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MD conducted the experiments, performed the laboratory experiment by separating and purifying the allelochemical compounds, performed the bioassay tests and wrote the manuscript.
