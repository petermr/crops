Here, a joint analysis of the transcriptome and terpenoid metabolome of <i>BCC</i> induced by mechanical damage (MD) was used to comprehensively explore the interaction between TFs and terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes that might participate in monoterpene biosynthesis in <i>BCC</i>.<h4>Results</h4>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis detected 14 monoterpenes and seven sesquiterpenes.
