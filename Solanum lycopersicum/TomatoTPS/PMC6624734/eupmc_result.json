However, more recent studies have demonstrated that beneficial microbes are able to induce plant systemic resistance that confers some degree of protection against insects. Here, we report how treatments with the fungal biocontrol agent <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain P1 in tomato plants induce responses that affect pest insects with different feeding habits: the noctuid moth <i>Spodoptera littoralis</i> (Boisduval) and the aphid <i>Macrosiphum euphorbiae</i> (Thomas). We observed that the tomato plant-<i>Trichoderma</i> P1 interaction had a negative impact on the development of moth larvae and on aphid longevity. These effects were attributed to a plant response induced by <i>Trichoderma</i> that was associated with transcriptional changes of a wide array of defense-related genes. While the impact on aphids could be related to the up-regulation of genes involved in the oxidative burst reaction, which occur early in the defense reaction, the negative performance of moth larvae was associated with the enhanced expression of genes encoding for protective enzymes (i.e., Proteinase inhibitor I (PI), Threonine deaminase, Leucine aminopeptidase A1, Arginase 2, and Polyphenol oxidase) that are activated downstream in the defense cascade. In addition, <i>Trichoderma</i> P1 produced alterations in plant metabolic pathways leading to the production and release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are involved in the attraction of the aphid parasitoid <i>Aphidius ervi</i>, thus reinforcing the indirect plant defense barriers.
