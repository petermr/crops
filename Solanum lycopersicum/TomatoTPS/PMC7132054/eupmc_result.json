Here, we present a high-quality full-length transcriptome of the sterile triploid C. sativus, using the PacBio SMRT sequencing technology. This yields 31,755 high-confidence predictions of protein-coding genes, with 50.1% forming paralogous gene pairs. Analysis on distribution of Ks values suggests that the current genome of C. sativus is probably a product resulting from at least two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) events occurred at ~28 and ~114 million years ago (Mya), respectively. We provide evidence demonstrating that the recent \u03b2 WGD event confers a major impact on family expansion of secondary metabolite genes, possibly leading to an enhanced accumulation of three distinct compounds: crocin, picrocrocin and safranal. Phylogenetic analysis unravels that the founding member (CCD2) of CCD enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of apocarotenoids in C. sativus might be evolved from the CCD1 family via the \u03b2 WGD event. Based on the gene expression profiling, CCD2 is found to be expressed at an extremely high level in the stigma.
