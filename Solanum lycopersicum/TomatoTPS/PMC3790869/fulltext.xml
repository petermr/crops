Here, we report the identification of a new monoterpene synthase gene, <italic>GmNES</italic>, from soybean. The transcription of <italic>GmNES</italic> was up-regulated in soybean plants that were infested with cotton leafworm (<italic>Prodenia litura</italic>), mechanically wounded or treated with salicylic acid (SA). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that recombinant GmNES enzyme exclusively produced nerol, generated from a newly identified substrate for monoterpene synthase: neryl diphosphate (NPP). This finding indicates that <italic>GmNES</italic> is a nerol synthase gene in soybean. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions showed that GmNES localized to the chloroplasts. Transgenic tobacco overexpressing <italic>GmNES</italic> was generated. In dual-choice assays, the <italic>GmNES</italic>-expressing tobacco lines significantly repelled cotton leafworm. In feeding tests with transgenic plants, the growth and development of cotton leafworm were significantly retarded. This study confirms the ecological role of terpenoids and provides new insights into their metabolic engineering in transgenic plants.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (2010CB125906, 2009CB118400) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (30800692, 31000718).

In plants, the well-known role of terpenes is in the interaction between plants and the environment, with terpenes serving as defensive compounds against herbivores and pathogens <xref rid="pone.0075972-Wittstock1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The wide spectrum of terpenes&#x02019; indirect defense activities has been well investigated, i.e. terpenoid compounds can act as pollinator attractants <xref rid="pone.0075972-Dobson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, or feeding deterrents or insect toxins <xref rid="pone.0075972-Aharoni1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075972-Raffa1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and are toxic to bacteria <xref rid="pone.0075972-Chorianopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and fungi <xref rid="pone.0075972-Terzi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Terpenoids are synthesized from the C<sub>5</sub> building blocks isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethyl allyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Two independent biosynthetic pathways can produce IPP: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway localized to the cytosol, and the 2C-methyl erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway localized to plastids <xref rid="pone.0075972-Rohmer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Although these two pathways function independently, there is bounds of evidence that crosstalk occurs <xref rid="pone.0075972-Laule1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Based on the number of C<sub>5</sub> units, terpenes are classified into hemiterpenes (C<sub>5</sub>), monoterpenes (C<sub>10</sub>), sesquiterpenes (C<sub>15</sub>), and diterpenes (C<sub>20</sub>) <xref rid="pone.0075972-Dudareva1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Geranyl diphosphate (GPP) is the widely accepted common substrate for monoterpene biosynthesis. Previous labeling studies showed that conversion of GPP to its <italic>cis</italic>-isomer neryl diphosphate (NPP) is not necessary before cyclization <xref rid="pone.0075972-Croteau1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, research on monoterpene in tomato glands contradicted the traditional view of GPP, proving that NPP could serve as a precursor for the synthesis of monoterpenes <xref rid="pone.0075972-Schilmiller1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Similarly, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) are two common substrates for sesquiterpene and diterpene biosynthesis, respectively. The corresponding substrates are converted into a wide range of terpenes by the action of terpene synthases <xref rid="pone.0075972-Tholl1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>To date, terpene synthases have been identified and characterized in many species including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>

<xref rid="pone.0075972-Arimura1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, little is known about the enzyme in soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> L. Merr.), one of the most important legume plants. In our previous work, we successfully isolated the <italic>DXS</italic> and <italic>DXR</italic> genes, which are the committed enzymes of the MEP pathway, from soybean <xref rid="pone.0075972-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075972-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, indicating that the MEP pathway may play an important role in soybean self-defense. Until now, however, no monoterpene synthases have been characterized in soybean. In this work, we describe a novel gene, designated as <italic>GmNES</italic>, that encodes a nerol synthase that acts on NPP instead of the common substrate GPP for monoterpene biosynthesis. The expression and subcellular localization of <italic>GmNES</italic>, and the effects of <italic>GmNES</italic>-overexpressing plants on insects are also examined.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification and Cloning of the <italic>GmNES</italic> Gene</title><p>First, known monoterpene synthases (mono-TPSs) were used to screen the soybean expressed sequence tag (EST) database to identify homologous sequences. A 1106 bp EST contig for a putative mono-TPS was identified. To determine the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends, multiple rounds of 5&#x02032; rapid identification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3&#x02032;-RACE were performed, which resulted in 750 bp and 350 bp sequence fragments, respectively. Based on these two fragments and the previous partial sequence, PCR primers were then designed to amplify the full-length cDNA sequence, named <italic>GmNES,</italic> which was deposited in GenBank (accession number JF758895). <italic>GmNES</italic> encodes a predicted protein of 565 amino acids (aa), with a calculated molecular mass of 66 kDa and a predicted pI of 5.6. The cDNA sequence was further aligned with the soybean genome sequence (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net">http://www.phytozome.net</ext-link>), and the organization of the <italic>GmNES</italic> gene was revealed, showing that the <italic>GmNES</italic> gene maps to chromosome 13 and contains six exons and five introns with a total length of 3.7 kb.</p><p>To characterize the sequence of <italic>GmNES</italic>, the protein sequence of GmNES was aligned with the sequences of certain known plant monoterpene synthases.

Several aspects of the <italic>GmNES</italic> gene have been addressed in the present work: the enzymatic activity of the recombinant protein, the expression profile of the gene, the subcellular localization of the encoded protein and the ecological significance of <italic>GmNES</italic>-expressing plants.</p><p>Both geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and neryl diphosphate (NPP) can be used as substrates for monoterpene synthases. However, it is widely accepted that GPP is the &#x02018;universal&#x02019; substrate of monoterpene synthases <xref rid="pone.0075972-Bohlmann2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> because these enzymes can perform the necessary isomerization before cyclization <xref rid="pone.0075972-Croteau2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and several studies have described the use of GPP by monoterpene synthases <xref rid="pone.0075972-NaviaGin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075972-Arimura1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Using a cell-free assay it was demonstrated that NPP can be converted into several monoterpenes <xref rid="pone.0075972-Croteau3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, no specific enzymes have been identified and no additional information on NPP was documented until Schilmiller et al. <xref rid="pone.0075972-Schilmiller1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> reported their findings. The authors discovered the <italic>NDPS1</italic> gene, encoding an NPP synthase, in tomato, and the <italic>PHS1</italic> gene, encoding phellandrene synthase, which uses NPP as substrate to produce monoterpenes, was also reported. These results provided evidence that NPP is indeed a substrate for monoterpene synthases. In agreement with these findings, we demonstrated that NPP can be used by the monoterpene synthase GmNES to catalyze the formation of nerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075972-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), further supporting NPP&#x02019;s role as a substrate. The difference between our results and those of Schilmiller et al. <xref rid="pone.0075972-Schilmiller1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> is that the major product of GmNES with NPP, nerol, is acyclic which is the same as the products of GPP, whereas the major products of PHS1 with NPP are cyclic. Hence, we could not conclude that the products of NPP are cyclic and/or that those of GPP are acyclic. To explain this discrepancy, the reaction mechanism of terpene synthases needs to be further investigated. Additionally, because the <italic>NDPS1</italic> gene, encoding an NPP synthase, was the first reported enzyme of this type <xref rid="pone.0075972-Schilmiller1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075972-Bohlmann2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, to identify a potential NPP synthase in soybean, we screened the fully sequenced database of the <italic>Glycine max</italic> genome using <italic>NDPS1</italic> as the query sequence, which resulted in several sequences with high similarity (&#x0003e;80%). The BLAST result provides further evidence that indicates the existence of NPP in soybean. Subsequent gene cloning, protein expression and activity assays for soybean NPP synthases will be performed in the future.</p><p>Previous phylogenetic analyses of plant TPS protein sequences revealed seven TPS gene subfamilies, designated Tps-a through Tps-g <xref rid="pone.0075972-Bohlmann1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075972-Dudareva2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075972-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The identified soybean nerol synthase GmNES is closely related to <italic>Medicago</italic> terpene synthases and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtTPS14 (At1g61680). These synthases, together with the snapdragon monoterpene synthases, were previously defined as the TPS-g subfamily, indicating that GmNES is a member of the TPS-g family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075972-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Lacking the RRx<sub>8</sub>W motif and the prevalence of acyclic products are the two prominent features of the members of the TPS-g group <xref rid="pone.0075972-Dudareva2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075972-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. According to sequence alignment and functional characterization, the RRx<sub>8</sub>W motif was missing in GmNES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075972-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and GmNES specifically produced acyclic monoterpene nerol from the substrate NPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075972-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, PHS <xref rid="pone.0075972-Schilmiller1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, TPS19 from cultivated tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0075972-Matsuba1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and <italic>cis</italic>-sesquiterpene TPS from wild tomato (<italic>Solanum habrochaites</italic>) (ShSBS) <xref rid="pone.0075972-Sallaud1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, which were previously shown to catalyze the formation of phellandrenes and several other monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes from NPP, are known to fall into the TPS-e subfamily. The phylogenetic result indicated that although the old substrates NPP could be used for catalyzing the formation of new enzymes for terpenoid biosynthesis, and although most of these terpene syntheses fell into the same subfamily (TPS-e subfamily), the substrate NPP could not be defined as a common feature of the enzymes in a TPS subfamily.</p><p>Multiproduction is an important feature of monoterpene synthases in many other plant species. For example, (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene synthase in <italic>M. truncatula</italic> converts GPP into three monoterpenes, with (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene as the major product, and trace amounts of two other compounds: (<italic>Z</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene and myrcene <xref rid="pone.0075972-NaviaGin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. PHS1 in tomato catalyzes NPP to form five monoterpenes, with &#x003b2;-phellandrene as the main product <xref rid="pone.0075972-Schilmiller1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In contrast, GmNES can exclusively synthesize the monoterpene nerol from NPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075972-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Among other characterized monoterpene synthases in plants, nerol synthase in soybean (GmNES) is the only identified enzyme that can produce nerol, which makes the enzyme atypical. Apart from multiproduction, another feature of terpene synthases is that different substrates (GPP or FPP) can be converted into corresponding terpene compounds by the same enzyme. AdAFS1, a sesquiterpene synthase identified in <italic>Actinidia deliciosa</italic>, can function as both a sesquiterpene synthase and a monoterpene synthase because AdAFS1 exclusively produces the sesquiterpene &#x003b1;-farnesene from FPP and the monoterpene (<italic>E</italic>)-&#x003b2;-ocimene from GPP <xref rid="pone.0075972-Nieuwenhuizen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In contrast, our results showed that <italic>GmNES</italic> could exclusively convert NPP and could not catalyze the formation of any monoterpenes and/or sesquiterpenes when GPP or FPP was employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075972-g004">Figures 4C, 4D</xref>). Thus the specificity of the substrate and terpene product of <italic>GmNES</italic> should be of prime interest when strategies for the metabolic engineering of monoterpene biosynthesis in plants are considered for industrial utilization.</p><p>Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes have been shown to be of ecological significance in plant defense <xref rid="pone.0075972-Degenhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075972-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In this study, via dual-choice assay, we found that the monoterpene nerol, which is produced by <italic>GmNES</italic>-expressing plants, influences the behavior of cotton leafworm. Similar results were previously reported, showing the repellence of <italic>M. persicae</italic> aphids by linalool <xref rid="pone.0075972-Aharoni1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075972-Hori1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In addition, based on feeding tests, we found that the growth and/or development of cotton leafworm was retarded when feeding on <italic>GmNES</italic>-expressing tobacco leaves compared with leafworm feeding on wild-type plants. These results suggested biological roles for the monoterpene nerol. One major explanation for the insects&#x02019; repellence and growth inhibition might be a toxic effect of the high level of nerol produced, as many monoterpenes have been demonstrated to be of ecological significance in plant defense <xref rid="pone.0075972-Aharoni1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0075972-Degenhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our observation that nerol might repel cotton leafworm larvae from feeding on <italic>GmNES</italic>-expressing plants will be valuable in understanding direct plant defense against insect herbivores and useful for studying the indirect defense of plants, such as the altered behavior of insects caused by the production of specific volatile substances. Moreover, the hypothesis regarding the antimicrobial activity of terpenes <xref rid="pone.0075972-Schilmiller1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> produced by enzymes of the MEP pathway and the effects of nerol on insect behavior indicate that the monoterpene nerol, synthesized by GmNES, could be a good source of plant insecticide.</p><p>Taken together, the results of the present study provide additional evidence that NPP is indeed a stable native monoterpene intermediate, revealing a way to discover new functions of terpene synthases and new products with substrate acceptance. This work will aid understanding of the diversity of the metabolic regulation and formation of terpene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Material, Insect and Microbial Maintenance</title><p>Soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> cv. &#x02018;<italic>Bogao&#x02019;</italic>) seeds were grown in the experimental field of Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, P.
