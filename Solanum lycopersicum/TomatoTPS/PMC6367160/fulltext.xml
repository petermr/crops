pests causing economic damage to many crops, capable of transmitting hundreds of plant vector-borne viruses. They are believed to secrete salivary protein effectors that can improve vector colonization and reproductive fitness in host plants. However, little is known about effector biology and the precise mechanism of action of whitefly effectors. Here, we report a functional screening of <italic>B. tabaci</italic> salivary effector proteins (Bsp) capable of modulating plant innate immunity triggered by plant endogenous pattern peptide Pep1. Four immunity suppressors and two elicitors were identified. Bsp9, the most effective immunity suppressor, was further identified to directly interact with an immunity regulator WRKY33. We provide evidence that Bsp9 may suppress plant immune signalling by interfering with the interaction between WRKY33 and a central regulator in the MAPK cascade. The interference by Bsp9 therefore reduces plant resistance to whitefly by inhibiting activation of WRKY33-regulated immunity-related genes. Further detailed analysis based on transgenic plants found that whitefly effector Bsp9 could promote whitefly preference and performance, increasing virus transmission. This study enriches our knowledge on insect effector biology.</p><p>This article is part of the theme issue &#x02018;Biotic signalling sheds light on smart pest management&#x02019;.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>whitefly</kwd><kwd>TYLCV</kwd><kwd>salivary effector</kwd><kwd>WRKY33</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>Bsp9</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31522046</award-id><award-id>31672001</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB11040300</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>March 4, 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Piercing/sucking feeding insects cause extensive crop losses directly [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Besides ingesting plant sap, phloem-feeding insects, such as whitefly, transmit 80% of known plant vector-borne pathogens and cause huge economic loss indirectly. During feeding, insects secrete salivary protein into plant cells together with virus particles. Although, for plant and animal microbes, it is well established that effectors target host proteins to manipulate host cell processes and promote infection and disease [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], understanding the effector biology of insects is still at a very early stage. So far, only a small number of salivary effectors from aphid species have been identified and a few of them have been confirmed by their functions in plant&#x02013;insect interactions [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among these insects with identified effectors, the broad host range aphid <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> is the most researched species. Some of effectors from <italic>M. persicae</italic> and homologues from other aphid species have been successfully identified through genomics. A few of them, such as Mp1 (PIntO1) and Mp2 (PIntO1), Mp10, Mp42, Mp55, Mp56, Mp57, Mp58 and others, have been functionally characterized to target host plant proteins to modulate immunity for enhancing aphid fitness [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSTB20180313C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the effectors from other insects, such as planthopper and whitefly, remain elusive.</p><p>Whitefly, <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (Hemiptera), is a polyphagous insect and a supervector, transmitting more than 300 plant virus species, that is a threat for many crops across the globe [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Whitefly might mediate the suppression of plant defences by secreting protein effectors to improve host colonization and reproductive fitness [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20180313C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The whitefly-transmitted monopartite geminivirus begomoviruses are frequently associated with pandemic crop diseases such as tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and tomato yellow leaf curl China virus [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We have shown that geminiviruses could repress defensive responses in infected plants leading to an improved fitness of their vector, whitefly, thereby promoting vector performance and, in turn, facilitating pathogen spread [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but it is unknown whether the infestation of whitefly could affect plant immunity, possibly by secreting salivary effectors.</p><p>Plants fend off attacks from herbivores and pathogens in various ways, e.g. via physical barriers, volatile or non-volatile compounds, and through induction of defensive responses mainly controlled by phytohormones and innate immunities [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSTB20180313C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The phytohormone jasmonate (JA) is known to be indirectly manipulated by viruses to promote whitefly performance [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20180313C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Plant innate immunity includes two major types of resistance mechanisms against pathogens and herbivores. The first layer is the pathogen-associated molecular pattern or damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-triggered immunity, so-called pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). The second layer is a more specific effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSTB20180313C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. PTI is a multistep response, which is triggered upon plant pattern recognition receptors recognizing the conserved pathogen molecules or endogenous peptide elicitors such as Pep1&#x02013;Pep7 family [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20180313C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. PEPR1 and PEPR2 encode receptors to recognize Pep1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The AtPep&#x02013;PEPR system has been reported to be induced by <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> feeding. Thus, Pep peptides function as DAMPs in response to wound- and herbivory-induced stresses [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSTB20180313C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Subsequently, many downstream signalling events are initiated, including activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and the transcription of defensive genes, especially anti-pest defensin gene (<italic>PDF1.2</italic>) in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSTB20180313C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Whiteflies are important agricultural pests, but little is known about their effector biology. The goal of this study was to establish an efficient functional screening system of whitefly effectors and to elucidate the precise mechanism of whitefly effectors in the interaction with host and virus. Here, we identify a whitefly salivary protein Bsp9 (whose expression is induced by TYLCV) that can effectively inhibit the plant defence response to whitefly infestation. Bsp9 interacts with a resistance-related transcription factor WRKY33. The plant immune regulation by Bsp9 affects whitefly fitness, thereby leading to a possible enhancement of virus transmission. Our research uncovered how begomoviruses manipulate whitefly effectors to promote virus transmission for worldwide invasion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>(a) Plant and insect materials</title><p>Tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>, Heinz 1706-BG, LA4345) seeds were ordered from Tomato Genetic Resource Center, University of California, Davis, USA, and propagated.

The de novo assembly of RNA-seq was conducted using the Trinity platform. Illumina sequence data were selectively filtered using SolexaQA to remove read lengths less than 35 bp and low-quality sequence at each nucleotide. Clean reads of Illumina sequence data were mapped by Bowtie2. Raw counts for each predicted gene were calculated as reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped fragments (FPKM). Based on these statistical analyses, genes with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 and log2 (fold change) value of RPKM greater than 1 were considered to be significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs between viruliferous and virus-free whiteflies were identified and mapped to whitefly salivary gland transcriptome using tBLASTn. Finally, we got unigenes upregulated by TYLCV in salivary glands. Trinotate and ORF (opening reading frame) Finder were used for performing the functional annotation of unigenes and ORFs. We narrowed the range of the genes by the length of ORFs between 200 and 600 bp. SignalP 4.0 program was used to predict the presence of signal peptides and cleavage sites in the amino acid sequences encoded by the ORFs found in salivary gland ESTs. Subsequently, proteins with a signal peptide were predicted to contain at least one transmembrane domain by TMHMM Server2.0 and therefore more likely to remain in the membrane of the salivary gland cell during secretion. Besides these, a protein without or with one transmembrane domain included in the part of predicted signal peptide would be considered as a secreted protein, as well as a potential salivary protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>(c) Virus inoculation</title><p>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV-SH2; GenBank accession no.

To identify candidate whitefly salivary effectors induced by TYLCV, we firstly undertook a comparative transcriptomic analysis of viruliferous whitefly versus virus-free whitefly (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). High-quality total RNA samples of viruliferous whitefly and virus-free MEAM1 whitefly were extracted, and de novo sequencing was conducted with the Illumina sequencing platform. Through filtering the adaptors and low-quality sequences, assembling by Trinity and mapping by Bowtie2, we finally got 86 428 unigenes based on the raw data of scaffolds. Among them, expression levels of 53 353 unigenes were induced by TYLCV at least twofold. Comparing with the whitefly salivary gland dataset, only 1.4% of TYLCV-induced unigenes (778/53 353) were found in salivary glands [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Taking into consideration that most effectors are putative secreted proteins which possess a suitable opening reading frame size, an N-terminal signal peptide and have no transmembrane regions, finally, we cloned 10 full-length cDNA of TYLCV-induced candidate salivary effector proteins for further functional characterizations (electronic supplementary material, table S2).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>(c) Whitefly salivary protein Bsp9 suppresses plant immune response</title><p>As a functional analysis platform for whitefly salivary proteins has rarely been reported, we sought to establish a suitable screening and reporter system to identify whitefly effectors.

Accordingly, we developed a novel system consisting of an effector and a reporter system together to functionally identify a whitefly salivary immunity regulator (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180313F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref><italic>c</italic>).

[<xref rid="RSTB20180313C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In this report, we provide a new layer of insight, in which a virus-induced whitefly salivary effector Bsp9 benefits both vector and virus. We have provided several lines of evidence that Bsp9 is a critical salivary effector in enhancing virus transmission. First, Bsp9 can effectively suppress the plant immune response activated by whitefly infestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180313F2">figure&#x000a0;2</xref>). Second, Bsp9 can be secreted into plants and interacts with the transcription factor WRKY33 (figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180313F2">2</xref><italic>e</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180313F3">3</xref>; electronic supplementary material, figure S4). Third, Bsp9 alters the localization of WRKY33 and affects the interaction between WRKY33 and MPK6, interfering with the WRKY33-mediated plant innate immunity against pathogen and insects (figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180313F3">3</xref><italic>b</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180313F4">4</xref>). Fourth, Bsp9 can effectively increase whitefly preference, performance and also TYLCV transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180313F4">figure&#x000a0;4</xref>; electronic supplementary material, figure S5). Fifth, genomic analysis shows that Bsp9 is highly conserved in two invasive species of whitefly, MEAM1 and MED (electronic supplementary material, table S3). The coding region of the Bsp9 gene is highly conserved in these two whitefly species and there is only one non-synonymous mutation, indicating the critical role of Bsp9 for whitefly fitness on host plant adaption. Meanwhile, the high mutation rates in intron and untranslational regions suggest that a possible transcriptional level regulation may play an important role for whiteflies in response to biotic stresses, e.g. TYLCV infection in this report. Nevertheless, it is essential to clone Bsp9 homologues from native whiteflies and other Aleyrodoidea for understanding its role in whitefly invasion and begomoviral diseases pandemic in the world. With the rapid development of CRISPR/CAS-based single-base gene-editing technology [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], it is very interesting to look at the significance of single nucleotide differences of <italic>Bsp9</italic> for the tripartite interactions of whitefly&#x02013;plant&#x02013;virus and environmental stress responses between MEAM1 and MED whiteflies.</p><p>While microbial pathogen effectors have been extensively studied for a long time, a number of functional approaches to identify effectors secreted by insects have only recently attracted attention [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSTB20180313C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the majority of the salivary gland transcripts encode small proteins, which lack sequence similarity to function-annotated proteins. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of aphid salivary glands or aphid saliva, combined in some cases with RNAi and plant stable overexpression approaches, have revealed the presence of potential effector proteins, such as Mp1 (PIntO1) and Mp2 (PIntO1), Mp10, Mp42, Mp55, Mp56, Mp57 and Mp58 in aphids [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20180313C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSTB20180313C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

For example, in most of these analyses, host immune responses are triggered by applying a pathogen-derived elicitor such as flg22 or elf18 [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], like aphid effector Mp10, which was functionally identified by the suppression of the oxidative burst induced by the bacterial elicitor flg22 [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. But, this does not reflect the nature of plant&#x02013;insect interaction. In the interaction between insects and plants upon feeding damage, DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) are more likely to reflect the real situation of plant&#x02013;insect interaction. In our study, we found that a DAMP Pep1 treatment could mimic the whitefly infestation on a plant, and the expression level of <italic>PDF1.2</italic> may reflect changes of plant defence specific to whitefly. We developed a novel screening platform and successfully identified four candidate effectors, from the invasive MEAM1 whitefly, which can suppress Pep1-induced expression of <italic>PDF1.2</italic>. Among them, Bsp9, which has the strongest suppression efficacy of plant immune responses, has been demonstrated as a functionally characterized whitefly salivary protein able to disrupt WRKY33-mediated immune signalling. Nevertheless, in the future, it will be promising to check <italic>Bsp9</italic> knockout/down whitefly to look for other roles in whitefly biology and whitefly&#x02013;plant interaction. Also, it will be interesting to check the effect of <italic>wrky33</italic> mutation on the <italic>Bsp9</italic> overexpression lines to further confirm whether WRKY33 is the major target of Bsp9.</p><p>Previously published studies show that WRKY33 is a pathogen-inducible transcription factor, whose expression is regulated by the MPK3/MPK6 cascade. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, WRKY33 functions in response to PTI signalling and also reprogramming of the expression of camalexin biosynthetic genes. <italic>WRKY33</italic> expression is regulated by the MAPK cascades [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Previous studies found that MAPKs can be activated by whitefly-mediated inoculation of TYLCV [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20180313C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. MPK3/MPK6 can phosphorylate WRKY33, the latter then binds to not only its own promoter but also the <italic>PAD3</italic> promoter and positively regulates the expression of its bound genes. WRKY33 binds camalexin biosynthetic genes which encode proteins to produce defensive metabolites for pathogen resistance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20180313C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. WRKY33 drives the metabolic flow to camalexin production challenged by pathogens. The interaction between WRKY33 and MPK3/6 in the nucleus cells plays an important role in the MAPK&#x02013;WRKY33 cascade. WRKY33 is subject to post-translational modification by MAPK4 that is involved in salicylic acid-mediated responses as well [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20180313C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this study, WRKY33 is identified as regulating plant immune response against whitefly in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Interestingly, we also show that WRKY33 is involved in the regulation of biosynthesis of terpenes, the major chemical communication signals between plant and whitefly. Both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<italic>TPS10</italic> and <italic>TPS14</italic> encode synthases of &#x003b2;-myrcene, which is an efficient repellent against MEAM1 whitefly. The deficiency of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
<italic>TPS10</italic> due to mutation of <italic>WRKY33</italic> is more attractive to whitefly, coincidentally with the reduced <italic>TPS10</italic> expression in another transcriptional regulator <italic>MYC2</italic> mutant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. WRKY33 controls toxic camalexin production through its interaction with MPK3/6, as well as another MAPK, MPK4, which in turn activates the expression of <italic>PAD3</italic> [<xref rid="RSTB20180313C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="RSTB20180313C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, WRKY33 may participate in the biosynthesis regulation of the phytoalexin camalexin to mediate resistance to both pathogens and whiteflies.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><label>5.</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we identify a new strategy for vector-borne viruses to conquer host immunity. In a healthy plant, whitefly feeding activates the PTI which triggers the activation of MAPKs and the expression of plant defensive genes. In begomovirus-infected whiteflies, whitefly saliva proteins can be induced by TYLCV and are secreted into plants during feeding. One of whitefly effectors Bsp9 can effectively suppress the expression of marker gene <italic>PDF1.2</italic>. Bsp9 interacts with plant transcription factor WRKY33 and interferes with the interaction of WRKY33 and MPK6, and therefore, suppresses the WRKY33-induced immune response. Thus, begomovirus might manipulate saliva effectors to suppress host immune responses to benefit whitefly fitness and virus spread. However, the detailed mechanism of how TYLCV promotes the transcription of whitefly <italic>Bsp9</italic> is still a subject of study in the laboratory.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary information</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="rstb20180313supp1.docx" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1457" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Profs Xueping Zhou (Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences, China) and Jinlong Qiu (Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China) for providing the infectious clone of TYLCV-SH2 and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
