        <span class="abst" title="Early plants began colonizing the terrestrial earth approximately 450 million years ago. Their success on land has been partially attributed to the evolution of specialized metabolic systems from core metabolic pathways, the former yielding structurally and functionally diverse chemicals to cope with a myriad of biotic and abiotic ecological pressures. Over the past two decades, functional genomics, primarily focused on flowering plants, has begun cataloging the biosynthetic players underpinning assorted classes of plant specialized metabolites. However, the molecular mechanisms enriching specialized metabolic pathways during land plant evolution remain largely unexplored. Selaginella is an extant lycopodiophyte genus representative of an ancient lineage of tracheophytes. Notably, the lycopodiophytes diverged from euphyllophytes over 400 million years ago. The recent completion of the whole-genome sequence of an extant lycopodiophyte, S. moellendorffii, provides new genomic and biochemical resources for studying metabolic evolution in vascular plants. 400 million years of independent evolution of lycopodiophytes and euphyllophytes resulted in numerous metabolic traits confined to each lineage. Surprisingly, a cadre of specialized metabolites, generally accepted to be restricted to seed plants, have been identified in Selaginella. Initial work suggested that Selaginella lacks obvious catalytic homologs known to be involved in the biosynthesis of well-studied specialized metabolites in seed plants. Therefore, these initial functional analyses suggest that the same chemical phenotypes arose independently more commonly than anticipated from our conventional understanding of the evolution of metabolism. Notably, the emergence of analogous and homologous catalytic machineries through convergent and parallel evolution, respectively, seems to have occurred repeatedly in different plant lineages.">

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenoid synthases constitute a highly diverse gene family producing a wide range of cyclic and acyclic molecules consisting of isoprene (C5) residues. Often a single terpene synthase produces a spectrum of molecules of given chain length, but some terpene synthases can use multiple substrates, producing products of different chain length. Only a few such enzymes has been characterized, but the capacity for multiple-substrate use can be more widespread than previously thought. Here we focused on germacrene A synthase (GAS) that is a key cytosolic enzyme in the sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis pathway in the important medicinal plant Achillea millefolium (AmGAS). The full length encoding gene was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), functionally characterized, and its in vivo expression was analyzed. The recombinant protein catalyzed formation of germacrene A with the C15 substrate farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), while acyclic monoterpenes were formed with the C10 substrate geranyl diphosphate (GDP) and cyclic monoterpenes with the C10 substrate neryl diphosphate (NDP). Although monoterpene synthesis has been assumed to be confined exclusively to plastids, AmGAS can potentially synthesize monoterpenes in cytosol when GDP or NDP become available. AmGAS enzyme had high homology with GAS sequences from other Asteraceae species, suggesting that multi-substrate use can be more widespread among germacrene A synthases than previously thought. Expression studies indicated that AmGAS was expressed in both autotrophic and heterotrophic plant compartments with the highest expression levels in leaves and flowers. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the cloning and characterization of germacrene A synthase coding gene in A. millefolium, and multi-substrate use of GAS enzymes.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Tea (Camellia sinensis) has long been consumed worldwide for its amazing flavor and aroma. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which acts as an effective elicitor among the plant kingdom, could mostly improve the quality of tea aroma by promoting flavor volatiles in tea leaves. Although a variety of volatile secondary metabolites that contribute to aroma quality have been identified, our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of these compounds has remained largely incomplete. Therefore, information aboaut the transcriptome of tea leaves and, specifically, details of any changes in gene expression in response to MeJA, is required for a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of MeJA-mediated volatiles biosynthesis. Moreover, MeJA treatment could exaggerate the responses of secondary metabolites and some gene expression which offer a better chance to figure out the mechanism.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The results of two-dimensional gas-chromatograph mass-spectrometry showed that the terpenoids content in MeJA-treated tea leaves increased, especially linalool, geraniol, and phenylethyl alcohol. More importantly, we carried out RNA-seq to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to volatiles biosynthesis pathways induced by MeJA treatment (0 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h) in tea leaves. We identified 19245, 18614, 11890 DEGs respectively in the MeJA_12h, MeJA_24 h and MeJA_48 h samples. The α-Lenolenic acid degradation pathway was firstly responded resulting in activating the JA-pathway inner tea leaves, and the MEP/DOXP pathway significantly exaggerated. Notably, the expression level of jasmonate O-methyltransferase, which is associated with the central JA biosynthesis pathway, was increased by 7.52-fold in MeJA_24 h tea leaves. Moreover, the genes related to the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway showed different expression patterns compared with the untreated leaves. The expression levels of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-phosphate synthase (DXS), all-trans-nonaprenyl-diphosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl reductase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (type II), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase increased by approximately 2-4-fold.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The results of two-dimension gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry analysis suggested that exogenous application of MeJA could induce the levels of volatile components in tea leaves, especially the geraniol, linalool and its oxides. Moreover, the transcriptome analysis showed increased expression of genes in α-Lenolenic acid degradation pathway which produced massive jasmonic acid and quickly activated holistic JA-pathway inner tea leaves, also the terpenoid backbones biosynthesis pathway was significantly affected after MeJA treatment. In general, MeJA could greatly activate secondary metabolism pathways, especially volatiles. The results will deeply increase our understanding of the volatile metabolites biosynthesis pathways of tea leaves in response to MeJA.">

Less attention has been paid to effect of light wavelength on formation of plant metabolites. The objective of this study was to investigate whether formation of volatiles in preharvest and postharvest tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves can be regulated by light wavelength. In the present study, in contrast to the natural light or dark treatment, blue light (470 nm) and red light (660 nm) significantly increased most endogenous volatiles including volatile fatty acid derivatives (VFADs), volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids (VPBs), and volatile terpenes (VTs) in the preharvest tea leaves. Furthermore, blue and red lights significantly up-regulated the expression levels of 9/13-lipoxygenases involved in VFADs formation, phenylalanine ammonialyase involved in VPBs formation, and terpene synthases involved in VTs formation. Single light wavelength had less remarkable influences on formation of volatiles in the postharvest leaves compared with the preharvest leaves. These results suggest that blue and red lights can be promising technology for remodeling the aroma of preharvest tea leaves. Furthermore, our study provided evidence that light wavelength can activate the expression of key genes involved in formation of plant volatiles for the first time.">

Despite a long history of cultivation, the genetics and molecular biology of S. oblata are poorly understood. Transcriptome and expression profiling data are needed to identify genes and to better understand the biological mechanisms of floral pigments and scents in this species. Nine cDNA libraries were obtained from three replicates of three developmental stages: inflorescence with enlarged flower buds not protruded, inflorescence with corolla lobes not displayed, and inflorescence with flowers fully opened and emitting strong fragrance. Using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique, 319,425,972 clean reads were obtained and were assembled into 104,691 final unigenes (average length of 853 bp), 41.75% of which were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Among the annotated unigenes, 36,967 were assigned to gene ontology categories and 19,956 were assigned to eukaryoticorthologous groups. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database, 12,388 unigenes were sorted into 286 pathways. Based on these transcriptomic data, we obtained a large number of candidate genes that were differentially expressed at different flower stages and that were related to floral pigment biosynthesis and fragrance metabolism. This comprehensive transcriptomic analysis provides fundamental information on the genes and pathways involved in flower secondary metabolism and development in S. oblata, providing a useful database for further research on S. oblata and other plants of genus Syringa.">

New therapeutic properties for the Central Nervous System have emerged. We explored the neurobehavioral and antioxidant effects of an ethanolic extract of yellow propolis (EEYP) rich in triterpenoids, primarily lupeol and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-amyrin. Male Wistar rats, 3 months old, were intraperitoneally treated with Tween 5% (control), EEYP (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg), or diazepam, fluoxetine, and caffeine (positive controls) 30 min before the assays. Animals were submitted to open field, elevated plus maze, forced swimming, and inhibitory avoidance tests. After behavioral tasks, blood samples were collected through intracardiac pathway, to evaluate the oxidative balance. The results obtained in the open field and in the elevated plus maze assay showed spontaneous locomotion preserved and anxiolytic-like activity. In the forced swimming test, EEYP demonstrated antidepressant-like activity. In the inhibitory avoidance test, EEYP showed mnemonic activity at 30 mg/kg. In the evaluation of oxidative biochemistry, the extract reduced the production of nitric oxide and malondialdehyde without changing level of total antioxidant, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, induced by behavioral stress. Our results highlight that EEYP emerges as a promising anxiolytic, antidepressant, mnemonic, and antioxidant natural product.">

        <span class="abst" title="In field conditions, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, tea plants are often simultaneously exposed to various abiotic stresses such as cold and drought, which have profound effects on leaf senescence process and tea quality. However, most studies of gene expression in stress responses focus on a single inciting agent, and the confounding effect of multiple stresses on crop quality and leaf senescence remain unearthed. Here, global transcriptome profiles of tea leaves under separately cold and drought stress were compared with their combination using RNA-Seq technology. This revealed that tea plants shared a large overlap in unigenes displayed &quot;similar&quot; (26%) expression pattern and avoid antagonistic responses (lowest level of &quot;prioritized&quot; mode: 0%) to exhibit very congruent responses to co-occurring cold and drought stress; 31.5% differential expressed genes and 38% of the transcriptome changes in response to combined stresses were unpredictable from cold or drought single-case studies. We also identified 319 candidate genes for enhancing plant resistance to combined stress. We then investigated the combined effect of cold and drought on tea quality and leaf senescence. Our results showed that drought-induced leaf senescence were severely delayed by (i) modulation of a number of senescence-associated genes and cold responsive genes, (ii) enhancement of antioxidant capacity, (iii) attenuation of lipid degradation, (iv) maintenance of cell wall and photosynthetic system, (v) alteration of senescence-induced sugar effect/sensitivity, as well as (vi) regulation of secondary metabolism pathways that significantly influence the quality of tea during combined stress. Therefore, care should be taken when utilizing a set of stresses to try and maximize leaf longevity and tea quality.">

This study was conducted to sequence, assemble, annotate, and characterize the root transcriptomes of three caladium cultivars (&lt;i&gt;Caladium&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;hortulanum&lt;/i&gt;) using RNA-Seq. The caladium cultivars used in this study have different levels of resistance to &lt;i&gt;Pythium&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;myriotylum&lt;/i&gt;, the most damaging necrotrophic pathogen to caladium roots. Forty-six to 61 million clean reads were obtained for each caladium root transcriptome. De novo assembly of the reads resulted in approximately 130,000 unigenes. Based on bioinformatic analysis, 71,825 (52.3%) caladium unigenes were annotated for putative functions, 48,417 (67.4%) and 31,417 (72.7%) were assigned to Gene Ontology (GO) and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), respectively, and 46,406 (64.6%) unigenes were assigned to 128 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. A total of 4518 distinct unigenes were observed only in &lt;i&gt;Pythium&lt;/i&gt;-resistant &quot;Candidum&quot; roots, of which 98 seemed to be involved in disease resistance and defense responses. In addition, 28,837 simple sequence repeat sites and 44,628 single nucleotide polymorphism sites were identified among the three caladium cultivars. These root transcriptome data will be valuable for further genetic improvement of caladium and related aroids.">

In this study, approximately 6.6 Gb of raw data were generated from the transcriptome of S. officinalis leaves using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing. After filtering and removing the adapter sequences from the raw data, the number of reads reached 21 million, comprising 98 million of high-quality nucleotide bases. 48,671 unigenes were assembled de novo and annotated for establishing a valid database for studying terpenoid biosynthesis. We identified 135 unigenes that are putatively involved in terpenoid metabolism, including 70 mevalonate and methyl-erythritol phosphate pathways, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis genes, and 65 terpene synthase genes. Moreover, five terpene synthase genes were studied for their functions in terpenoid biosynthesis by using transgenic tobacco; most transgenic tobacco plants expressing these terpene synthetic genes produced increased amounts of terpenoids compared with wild-type control. The combined data analyses from the transcriptome and metabolome provide new insights into our understanding of the complex metabolic genes in terpenoid-rich sage, and our study paves the way for the future metabolic engineering of the biosynthesis of useful terpene compounds in S. officinalis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Forest trees use various strategies to cope with drought stress and these strategies involve complex molecular mechanisms. Pinus halepensis Miller (Aleppo pine) is found throughout the Mediterranean basin and is one of the most drought-tolerant pine species. In order to decipher the molecular mechanisms that P. halepensis uses to withstand drought, we performed large-scale physiological and transcriptome analyses. We selected a mature tree from a semi-arid area with suboptimal growth conditions for clonal propagation through cuttings. We then used a high-throughput experimental system to continuously monitor whole-plant transpiration rates, stomatal conductance and the vapor pressure deficit. The transcriptomes of plants were examined at six physiological stages: pre-stomatal response, partial stomatal closure, minimum transpiration, post-irrigation, partial recovery and full recovery. At each stage, data from plants exposed to the drought treatment were compared with data collected from well-irrigated control plants. A drought-stressed P. halepensis transcriptome was created using paired-end RNA-seq. In total, ~6000 differentially expressed, non-redundant transcripts were identified between drought-treated and control trees. Cluster analysis has revealed stress-induced down-regulation of transcripts related to photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging through the ascorbic acid (AsA)-glutathione cycle, fatty acid and cell wall biosynthesis, stomatal activity, and the biosynthesis of flavonoids and terpenoids. Up-regulated processes included chlorophyll degradation, ROS-scavenging through AsA-independent thiol-mediated pathways, abscisic acid response and accumulation of heat shock proteins, thaumatin and exordium. Recovery from drought induced strong transcription of retrotransposons, especially the retrovirus-related transposon Tnt1-94. The drought-related transcriptome illustrates this species' dynamic response to drought and recovery and unravels novel mechanisms.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Isoprene is a five-carbon chemical that is an important starting material for the synthesis of rubber, elastomers, and medicines. Although many plants produce huge amounts of isoprene, it is very difficult to obtain isoprene directly from plants because of its high volatility and increasing environmental regulations. Over the last decade, microorganisms have emerged as a promising alternative host for efficient and sustainable bioisoprene production. Isoprene synthase (IspS) has received much attention for the conversion of isoprene from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Herein, we isolated a highly expressible novel IspS gene from Metrosideros polymorpha (MpIspS), which was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, using a plant cDNA library and characterized its molecular and biochemical properties.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The signal sequence deleted MpIspS was cloned and expressed in E. coli as a 65-kDa monomer. The maximal activity of the purified MpIspS was observed at pH 6.0 and 55 °C in the presence of 5 mM Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;, and k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; for DMAPP as a substrate were 8.11 mM, 21 min&lt;sup&gt;- 1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 2.59 mM&lt;sup&gt;- 1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;- 1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. MpIspS was expressed along with the exogenous mevalonate pathway to produce isoprene in E. coli. The engineered cells produced isoprene concentrations of up to 23.3 mg/L using glycerol as the main carbon source.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;MpIspS was expressed in large amounts in E. coli, which led to increased enzymatic activity and resulted in isoprene production in vivo. These results demonstrate a new IspS enzyme that is useful as a key biocatalyst for bioisoprene production in engineered microbes.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Tea plants [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] can produce one of the three most widely popular non-alcoholic beverages throughout the world. Polyphenols and volatiles are the main functional ingredients determining tea's quality and flavor; however, the biotic or abiotic factors affecting tea polyphenol biosynthesis are unclear. This paper focuses on the molecular mechanisms of sucrose on polyphenol biosynthesis and volatile composition variation in tea plants.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Metabolic analysis showed that the total content of anthocyanins, catechins, and proanthocyanidins(PAs) increased with sucrose, and they accumulated most significantly after 14 days of treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 8384 and 5571 differentially expressed genes in 2-day and 14-day sucrose-treated tea plants compared with control-treated plants. Most of the structural genes and transcription factors (TFs) involved in polyphenol biosynthesis were significantly up-regulated after 2d. Among these transcripts, the predicted genes encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST), ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters), and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporters (MATE transporters) appeared up regulated. Correspondingly, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS) analysis revealed that the content of non-galloylated catechins and oligomeric PAs decreased in the upper-stem and increased in the lower-stem significantly, especially catechin (C), epicatechin (EC), and their oligomeric PAs. This result suggests that the related flavonoids were transported downward in the stem by transporters. GC/MS data implied that four types of volatile compounds, namely terpene derivatives, aromatic derivatives, lipid derivatives, and others, were accumulated differently after in vitro sucrose treatment.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our data demonstrated that sucrose regulates polyphenol biosynthesis in Camellia sinensis by altering the expression of transcription factor genes and pathway genes. Additionally, sucrose promotes the transport of polyphenols and changes the aroma composition in tea plant.">

Their putative TPS proteins were phylogenetically positioned in a sole clade with the TPSs of other Camellia species. The obtained Tps genes, one of which was designated ChTps1 (ChTps1a), were introduced into mevalonate-pathway-engineered Escherichia coli, which carried the genes for utilizing acetoacetate as a substrate, and cultured in a medium including lithium acetoacetate. Volatile products generated in the E. coli cells transformed with ChTps1 were purified from the cell suspension culture, and analyzed by NMR. Consequently, the predominant product with ChTPS1 was identified as valerianol, indicating that the ChTps1 gene codes for valerianol synthase. This is the first report on a gene that can mediate the synthesis of valerianol. We next synthesized a Tps ortholog encoding ChTPS1variant R477H (named CsiTPS8), whose sequence had been isolated from a tea tree (Camellia sinensis), carried out similar culture experiment with the E. coli transformant including CsiTps8, and consequently found valerianol production equally. Furthermore, GC-MS analysis of several teas revealed that valerianol had been an unknown ingredient in green tea and black tea.">

However, the molecular genetic basis of terpene biosynthesis pathways is virtually unknown. In this study, approximately 4 Gb of raw data were generated from the transcriptome of S. guaranitica leaves using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing. After filtering and removing the adapter sequences from the raw data, the number of reads reached 32 million, comprising 186 million of high-quality nucleotide bases. A total of 61,400 unigenes were assembled de novo and annotated for establishing a valid database for studying terpenoid biosynthesis. We identified 267 unigenes that are putatively involved in terpenoid metabolism (including, 198 mevalonate and methyl-erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis genes and 69 terpene synthases genes). Moreover, three terpene synthase genes were studied for their functions in terpenoid biosynthesis by using transgenic Arabidopsis; most transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing these terpene synthetic genes produced increased amounts of terpenoids compared with wild-type control. The combined data analyses from the transcriptome and metabolome provide new insights into our understanding of the complex metabolic genes in terpenoid-rich blue anise sage, and our study paves the way for the future metabolic engineering of the biosynthesis of useful terpene compounds in S. guaranitica.">

Defense responses elicited by laminarin in tea include the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and WRKY, the burst of H2O2, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid, and the accumulation of direct-defense chemicals (including chitinase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, callose, polyphenol oxidase, and flavonol synthase), as well as the production of volatile compounds. The laminarin-treated tea plants reduced the performance of TLH and enhanced the attractiveness to the egg parasitoid wasp of TLH, Stethynium empoascae Subba Rao. In the field experiment, laminarin application effectively reduced the number of TLH by attracting parasitoids. These results suggest that laminarin can induce protection against TLH by regulating signaling pathways in tea plant. Our study also proposes an environment friendly strategy for the integrated management of an economically important piercing pest.">

        <span class="abst" title="Lycoris longituba, belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family, is a perennial bulb bearing flowers with diverse colors and fragrance. Selection of cultivars with excellent colored and scented flowers has always been the breeding aim for ornamental plants. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying color fading and aroma production during flower expansion in L. longituba remain unclear. Therefore, to systematically investigate these important biological phenomena, the tepals of L. longituba from different developmental stages were used to screen and analyze the metabolic components and relevant genes. Utilizing the Illumina platform, a total of 144,922 unigenes were obtained from the RNA-Seq libraries. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicated that the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways might play important roles during color and aroma changes. Metabolomic analysis identified 29 volatile organic components (VOCs) from different developmental stages of L. longituba tepals, and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed that trans-β-ocimene-a terpene-was the most important aroma compound. Meanwhile, we found the content of anthocyanin was significantly reduced during the tepal color fading process. Then, we identified two dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) and three terpene synthase (TPS) genes, for which expression changes coincided with the production patterns of anthocyanins and trans-β-ocimene, respectively. Furthermore, a number of MYB and bHLH transcription factors (TFs) which might be involved in color- and aroma-formation were also identified in L. longituba tepal transcriptomes. Taken together, this is the first comprehensive report of the color and fragrance in tepals of L. longituba and these results could be helpful in understanding these characteristics and their regulation networks.">

In contrast to model plants, reports on HIPV formation and function in crops are limited. Tea (&lt;i&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/i&gt;) is an important crop in China. α-Farnesene is a common HIPV produced in tea plants in response to different herbivore attacks. In this study, a &lt;i&gt;C. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; α-farnesene synthase (CsAFS) was isolated, cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized. The CsAFS recombinant protein produced in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was able to transform farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into α-farnesene and also convert geranyl diphosphate (GPP) to β-ocimene &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, transient expression analysis in &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; plants indicated that CsAFS was located in the cytoplasm and could convert FPP to α-farnesene in plants. Wounding, to simulate herbivore damage, activated jasmonic acid (JA) formation, which significantly enhanced the &lt;i&gt;CsAFS&lt;/i&gt; expression level and α-farnesene content. This suggested that herbivore-derived wounding induced α-farnesene formation in tea leaves. Furthermore, the emitted α-farnesene might act as a signal to activate antibacterial-related factors in neighboring undamaged tea leaves. This research advances our understanding of the formation and signaling roles of common HIPVs in crops such as tea plants.">

        <span class="abst" title="Tea aroma is a key indicator for evaluating tea quality. Although notable success in tea aroma improvement has been achieved with heterosis breeding technology, the molecular basis underlying heterosis remains largely unexplored. Thus, the present report studies the tea plant volatile heterosis using a high-throughput next-generation RNA-seq strategy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Phenotypically, we found higher terpenoid volatile and green leaf volatile contents by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the F1 hybrids than in their parental lines. Volatile heterosis was obvious in both F1 hybrids. At the molecular level, the comparative transcriptomics analysis revealed that approximately 41% (9027 of 21,995) of the genes showed non-additive expression, whereas only 7.83% (1723 of 21,995) showed additive expression. Among the non-additive genes, 42.1% showed high parental dominance and 17.6% showed over-dominance. Among different expression genes with high parental dominance and over-dominance expression patterns, KEGG and GO analyses found that plant hormone signal transduction, tea plant physiological process related pathways and most pathways associated with tea tree volatiles were enriched. In addition, we identified multiple genes (CsDXS, CsAATC2, CsSPLA2, etc.) and transcription factors (CsMYB1, CsbHLH79, CsWRKY40, etc.) that played important roles in tea volatile heterosis. Based on transcriptome and metabolite profiling, we conclude that non-additive action plays a major role in tea volatile heterosis. Genes and transcription factors involved in tea volatiles showing over-dominance expression patterns can be considered candidate genes and provide novel clues for breeding high-volatile tea varieties.">

The glycosides of these monoterpenes accumulate throughout flowering, leading to considerable storage of potential aroma constituents that account for the majority of non-volatile aroma compounds. However, the UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) responsible for the glycosylation of linalool and its oxides has not been clarified. Four candidate &lt;i&gt;OfUGTs&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;UGT85A82&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;UGT85A83&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;UGT85AF3&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;UGT85A84&lt;/i&gt;) with high homology to the known terpenoid UGTs were screened by transcriptome sequencing. Over-expression of the candidate &lt;i&gt;OfUGTs&lt;/i&gt; in tobacco showed that UGT85A84 glycosylated linalool oxides &lt;i&gt;in planta&lt;/i&gt;. Since the transcript levels of &lt;i&gt;UGT85A84&lt;/i&gt; were positively correlated with glycoside accumulation, the recombinant UGT85A84 protein was subjected to reactions with aglycones and sugar donors. Two formate adducts were exclusively detected in UDP-Glc with linalool and linalool oxide reactions by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), indicating that UDP-Glc was the specific sugar donor. The kinetic parameters demonstrated that UGT85A84 glycosylated both linalool and lianlool oxides &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Further analysis demonstrated that the transcription levels of MEP pathway genes might play an important role in mediating terpenoid glycosylation. Our findings unraveled the mechanism underlying the glycosylation of essential aroma compounds in flowers.

        <span class="abst" title="Oolong tea is a popular and semi-fermented beverage. During the processing of tea leaves, withering is the first indispensable process for improving flavor. However, the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and the characteristic secondary metabolites during the withering of oolong tea leaves remain unknown. In this study, phytochemical analyses indicated that total polyphenols, flavonoids, catechins, epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin gallate (CG), gallocatechin gallate (GCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were all less abundant in the solar-withered leaves (SW) than in the fresh leaves (FL) and indoor-withered leaves (IW). In contrast, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) contents were higher in the SW than in the FL and IW. By analyzing the transcriptome data, we detected 32,036 lncRNAs. On the basis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, the flavonoid metabolic pathway, the terpenoid metabolic pathway, and the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway were enriched pathways. Additionally, 63 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) and 23 target genes were identified related to the three pathways. A comparison of the expression profiles of the DE-lncRNAs and their target genes between the SW and IW revealed four up-regulated genes (FLS, CCR, CAD, and HCT), seven up-regulated lncRNAs, four down-regulated genes (4CL, CHI, F3H, and F3'H), and three down-regulated lncRNAs related to flavonoid metabolism; nine up-regulated genes (DXS, CMK, HDS, HDR, AACT, MVK, PMK, GGPPS, and TPS), three up-regulated lncRNAs, and six down-regulated lncRNAs related to terpenoid metabolism; as well as six up-regulated genes (LOX, AOS, AOC, OPR, ACX, and MFP2), four up-regulated lncRNAs, and three down-regulated lncRNAs related to JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction. These results suggested that the expression of DE-lncRNAs and their targets involved in the three pathways may be related to the low abundance of the total polyphenols, flavonoids, and catechins (EGC, CG, GCG, ECG, and EGCG) and the high abundance of terpenoids in the SW. Moreover, solar irradiation, high JA and MeJA contents, and the endogenous target mimic (eTM)-related regulatory mechanism in the SW were also crucial for increasing the terpenoid levels. These findings provide new insights into the greater contribution of solar-withering to the high-quality flavor of oolong tea compared with the effects of indoor-withering.">

        <span class="abst" title="For a better understanding terpenoid volatile production in Camellia sinensis, global terpenoid synthase gene (TPS) transcription analysis was conducted based on transcriptomic data combined with terpenoid metabolic profiling under different abiotic stress conditions. Totally 80 TPS-like genes were identified. Twenty-three CsTPS genes possessed a complete coding sequence and most likely were functional. The remaining 57 in the currently available database lack essential gene structure or full-length transcripts. Distinct tempo-spatial expression patterns of CsTPS genes were found in tea plants. 17 genes were substantially expressed in all the tested organs with a few exceptions. The other 17 were predominantly expressed in leaves whereas additional eight were primarily expressed in flowers. Under the treatments of cold acclimation, salt and polyethylene glycol, CsTPS67, -69 and -71 were all suppressed and the inhibited expression of many others were found in multiple stress treatments. However, methyl jasmonate resulted in the enhanced expression of the majority of CsTPS genes. These transcription data were largely validated using qPCR. Moreover, volatile terpenoid profiling with leaves, flowers and stress-treated plants revealed a general association between the abundances of mono- and sesqui-terpenoids and some CsTPS genes. These results provide vital information for future studies on CsTPS regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Tea green leafhopper [Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Matsuda] is one of the most devastating pests of tea plants (Camellia sinensis), greatly impacting tea yield and quality. A thorough understanding of the interactions between the tea green leafhopper and the tea plant would facilitate a better pest management. To gain more insights into the molecular and biochemical mechanisms behind their interactions, a combined analysis of the global transcriptome and metabolome reconfiguration of the tea plant challenged with tea green leafhoppers was performed for the first time, complemented with phytohormone analysis. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF MS), together with quantifications by ultra-performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ MS), revealed a marked accumulation of various flavonoid compounds and glycosidically bound volatiles but a great reduction in the level of amino acids and glutathione upon leaf herbivory. RNA-Seq data analysis showed a clear modulation of processes related to plant defense. Genes pertaining to the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids, plant-pathogen interactions, and the biosynthesis of cuticle wax were significantly up-regulated. In particular, the transcript level for a CER1 homolog involved in cuticular wax alkane formation was most drastically elevated and an increase in C29 alkane levels in tea leaf waxes was observed. The tea green leafhopper attack triggered a significant increase in salicylic acid (SA) and a minor increase in jasmonic acid (JA) in infested tea leaves. Moreover, transcription factors (TFs) constitute a large portion of differentially expressed genes, with several TFs families likely involved in SA and JA signaling being significantly induced by tea green leafhopper feeding. This study presents a valuable resource for uncovering insect-induced genes and metabolites, which can potentially be used to enhance insect resistance in tea plants.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Zanthoxylum armatum (Z. armatum) is a highly economically important tree that presents a special numbing taste. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of the numbing taste remains poorly understood. Thus, the elucidation of the key genes associated with numbing taste biosynthesis pathways is critical for providing genetic information on Z. armatumand the breeding of high-quality germplasms of this species. RESULTS:Here, de novo transcriptome assembly was performed for the five major organs of Z. armatum, including the roots, stems, leaf buds, mature leaves and fruits. A total of 111,318 unigenes were generated with an average length of 1014 bp. Additionally, a large number of SSRs were obtained to improve our understanding of the phylogeny and genetics of Z. armatum. The organ-specific unigenes of the five major samples were screened and annotated via GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. A total of 53 and 34 unigenes that were exclusively upregulated in fruit samples were identified as candidate unigenes for terpenoid biosynthesis or fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation and degradation pathways, respectively. Moreover, 40 days after fertilization (Fr4 stage) could be an important period for the accumulation of terpenoid compounds during the fruit development and maturation of Z. armatum. The Fr4 stage could be a key point at which the first few steps of the fatty acid biosynthesis process are promoted, and the catalysis of subsequent reactions could be significantly induced at 62 days after fertilization (Fr6 stage). CONCLUSIONS:The present study realized de novo transcriptome assembly for the five major organs of Z. armatum. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive analysis revealing the genes underlying the special numbing taste of Z. armatum. The assembled transcriptome profiles expand the available genetic information on this species and will contribute to gene functional studies, which will aid in the engineering of high-quality cultivars of Z. armatum.">

These events have mainly been studied in model plants, rather than crop plants. Our study showed that tea green leafhopper (Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Matsuda), a major pest infesting tea attack significantly induced the emission of geraniol from tea leaves, but did not affect the crude enzyme activity of geraniol synthase in tea leaves. An enzyme extract of E. (M.) onukii specifically produced geraniol from geraniol diphosphate. Furthermore, a terpene synthase (EoTPS) was isolated from E. (M.) onukii. This terpene synthase was able to convert geraniol diphosphate to geraniol in vitro. In addition, geraniol had in vitro ability to inhibit the growth of Acinetobacter johnsonii that is endobacterial isolated from E. (M.) onukii. This information illustrates that elicitors from piercing-sucking insects can induce the formation of volatiles from crop plants and advances our understanding of the roles of plant volatiles in the interaction among crops-insects-microorganisms.">

Phenolics are extraordinarily abundant in Camellia sinensis leaves and are considered, together with pleasant volatile terpenoids, as primary flavor determinants in tea beverages. In this study, we focused on the effects of UV-B exposure (at 35 μW cm-2 for 0, 0.5, 2, and 8 h) on tea transcriptional and metabolic alterations, specifically related to tea flavor metabolite production. Out of 34,737 unigenes, a total of 18,081 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) due to UV-B treatments were identified. Additionally, the phenylpropanoid pathway was found as one of the most significantly UV-B affected top 20 KEGG pathways while flavonoid and monoterpenoid pathway-related genes were enhanced at 0.5 h. In the UVR8-signal transduction pathway, UVR8 was suppressed at both short and long exposure of UV-B with genes downstream differentially expressed. Divergent expression of MYB4 at different treatments could have differentially altered structural and regulatory genes upstream of flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Suppression of MYB4-1&amp;3 at 0.5 h could have led to the up-regulation of structural CCOAOMT-1&amp;2, HST-1&amp;2, DFR-4, ANR-2, and LAR-1&amp;3 genes resulting in accumulation of specialized metabolites at a shorter duration of UV-B exposure. Specialized metabolite profiling revealed the correlated alterations in the abundances of catechins and some volatile terpenoids in all the treatments with significant accumulation of specialized metabolites at 0.5 h treatment. A significant increase in specialized metabolites at 0.5 h treatment and no significant alteration observed at longer UVB treatment suggested that shorter exposure to UV-B led to different display in gene expression and accumulation of specialized metabolites in tea shoots in response to UV-B stress. Taken together, our results indicated that the UV-B treatment applied in this study differentially altered the UVR8-signal transduction, flavonoid and terpenoid pathways at transcriptional and metabolic levels in tea plants. Our results show strong potential for UV-B application in flavor improvement in tea at the industrial level.">

        <span class="abst" title="Trichomes, which develop from epidermal cells, are regarded as one of the key features that are involved in the evaluation of tea quality and tea germplasm resources. The metabolites from trichomes have been well characterized in tea products. However, little is known regarding the metabolites in fresh tea trichomes and the molecular differences in trichomes and tea leaves per se. In this study, we developed a method to collect trichomes from tea plant tender shoots, and their main secondary metabolites, including catechins, caffeine, amino acids, and aroma compounds, were determined. We found that the majority of these compounds were significantly less abundant in trichomes than in tea leaves. RNA-Seq was used to investigate the differences in the molecular regulatory mechanism between trichomes and leaves to gain further insight into the differences in trichomes and tea leaves. In total, 52.96 Gb of clean data were generated, and 6560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 4471 upregulated and 2089 downregulated genes, were identified in the trichomes vs. leaves comparison. Notably, the structural genes of the major metabolite biosynthesis pathways, transcription factors, and other key DEGs were identified and comparatively analyzed between trichomes and leaves, while trichome-specific genes were also identified. Our results provide new insights into the differences between tea trichomes and leaves at the metabolic and transcriptomic levels, and open up new doors to further recognize and re-evaluate the role of trichomes in tea quality formation and tea plant growth and development.">

        <span class="abst" title="Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a part of the sunlight reaching Earth surface. The UV spectrum of solar radiation is by convention divided into three parts: UV-A: 310–400 nm, UV-B: 280–310 nm and UV-C: less than 280 nm. UV-B is the most energetic component reaching Earth surface because the stratospheric ozone layer effectively absorbs completely wavelengths below 290 nm. UV-B is an increasing threat due to increasing UV-B levels on Earth surface as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric O3. In general, the effects of atmospheric UV-B radiation are negative for biological life. Enhanced levels of UV-B radiation can indeed negatively change plant physiological processes, growth and productivity. However, while studying UV-B effects on medicinal plants, some interesting phenomena have been discovered. For example, basil plants respond positively to UV-B radiation by increasing oil yield (Chang et al. J Horticult For 1:27–31, 2009). In other studies medicinal plants show beneficial aspects in term of increase in volatile oil yield and secondary metabolite production (Kumari et al. Ecotoxicol Environ Safety 72:2013–2019, 2009c, 2010). Medicinal herbs have great market value in India and worldwide. The medicinal value of plants depends upon phenolics, antioxidants and volatile yield. Therefore further UV-B experiments increasing the levels of these compounds are needed. Here we review the effect of UV-B exposure on metabolites, volatiles, and antioxidants potential in medicinal plants. This chapter reports: (1) aspects of the global market for medicinal and aromatic plants in India in order to assist the medicinal plant industry to make informed decisions. (2) The biodiversity loss due to wild harvesting of plants, and as an alternative the cultivation strategy of medicinal plants. (3) Main medicinal plant species having rich antioxidant potential. (4) Main secondary metabolites of plant origin such as phenylpropanoids, terpenes, alkaloids, and volatile oil, and other important metabolites containing high antioxidant level used in human diet and health. (5) UV-B factors that enhance the quality of medicinal plant by increasing the content of secondary bioactive products. (6) Secondary metabolic pathways involving regulation of key enzymes, chalcone synthase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase. Understanding of UV-B responses on secondary plant metabolites expand new opportunities for plant enriched in medicinal active compounds.">

        <span class="abst" title="Crocus sativus, containing remarkably amounts of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, is the source of saffron with tremendous medicinal, economic and cultural importance. Here, we present a high-quality full-length transcriptome of the sterile triploid C. sativus, using the PacBio SMRT sequencing technology. This yields 31,755 high-confidence predictions of protein-coding genes, with 50.1% forming paralogous gene pairs. Analysis on distribution of Ks values suggests that the current genome of C. sativus is probably a product resulting from at least two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) events occurred at ~28 and ~114 million years ago (Mya), respectively. We provide evidence demonstrating that the recent β WGD event confers a major impact on family expansion of secondary metabolite genes, possibly leading to an enhanced accumulation of three distinct compounds: crocin, picrocrocin and safranal. Phylogenetic analysis unravels that the founding member (CCD2) of CCD enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of apocarotenoids in C. sativus might be evolved from the CCD1 family via the β WGD event. Based on the gene expression profiling, CCD2 is found to be expressed at an extremely high level in the stigma. These findings may shed lights on further genomic refinement of the characteristic biosynthesis pathways and promote germplasm utilization for the improvement of saffron quality.">

        <span class="abst" title="Insect herbivores have dramatic effects on the chemical composition of plants. Many of these induced metabolites contribute to the quality (e.g., flavor, human health benefits) of specialty crops such as the tea plant (&lt;i&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/i&gt;). Induced chemical changes are often studied by comparing plants damaged and undamaged by herbivores. However, when herbivory is quantitative, the relationship between herbivore pressure and induction can be linearly or non-linearly density dependent or density independent, and induction may only occur after some threshold of herbivory. The shape of this relationship can vary among metabolites within plants. The tea green leafhopper (&lt;i&gt;Empoasca onukii&lt;/i&gt;) can be a widespread pest on tea, but some tea farmers take advantage of leafhopper-induced metabolites in order to produce high-quality &quot;bug-bitten&quot; teas such as Eastern Beauty oolong. To understand the effects of increasing leafhopper density on tea metabolites important for quality, we conducted a manipulative experiment exposing tea plants to feeding by a range of &lt;i&gt;E. onukii&lt;/i&gt; densities. After &lt;i&gt;E. onukii&lt;/i&gt; feeding, we measured volatile and non-volatile metabolites, and quantified percent damaged leaf area from scanned leaf images. &lt;i&gt;E. onukii&lt;/i&gt; density had a highly significant effect on volatile production, while the effect of leaf damage was only marginally significant. The volatiles most responsive to leafhopper density were mainly terpenes that increased in concentration monotonically with density, while the volatiles most responsive to leaf damage were primarily fatty acid derivatives and volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids. In contrast, damage (percent leaf area damaged), but not leafhopper density, significantly reduced total polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and theobromine concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. The shape of induced responses varied among metabolites with some changing linearly with herbivore pressure and some responding only after a threshold in herbivore pressure with a threshold around 0.6 insects/leaf being common. This study illustrates the importance of measuring a diversity of metabolites over a range of herbivory to fully understand the effects of herbivores on induced metabolites. Our study also shows that any increases in leafhopper density associated with climate warming, could have dramatic effects on secondary metabolites and tea quality.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Pseudotaxus chienii&lt;/i&gt;, a rare tertiary relict species with economic and ecological value, is a representative of the monotypic genus &lt;i&gt;Pseudotaxus&lt;/i&gt; that is endemic to China. &lt;i&gt;P. chienii&lt;/i&gt; can adapt well to habitat isolation and ecological heterogeneity under a variety of climate and soil conditions, and is able to survive in harsh environments. However, little is known about the molecular and genetic resources of this long-lived conifer. Herein, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four organs of &lt;i&gt;P. chienii&lt;/i&gt; using the PacBio Isoform Sequencing and Illumina RNA Sequencing platforms. Based on the PacBio Iso-Seq data, we obtained 44,896, 58,082, 50,485, and 67,638 full-length unigenes from the root, stem, leaf, and strobilus, respectively, with a mean length of 2692 bp, and a mean N50 length of 3010.75 bp. We then comprehensively annotated these unigenes. The number of organ-specific expressed unigenes ranged from 4393 in leaf to 9124 in strobilus, suggesting their special roles in physiological processes, organ development, and adaptability in the different four organs. A total of 16,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the four organs and clustered into six subclusters. The gene families related to biotic/abiotic factors, including the TPS, CYP450, and HSP families, were characterized. The expression levels of most DEGs in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and plant-pathogen interactions were higher in the root than in the three other organs, suggesting that root constitutes the main organ of defensive compound synthesis and accumulation and has a stronger ability to respond to stress. The sequences were analyzed to predict transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, and alternative splicing events. The expression levels of most DEGs of C2H2, C3H, bHLH, and bZIP families in the root and stem were higher than those in the leaf and strobilus, indicating that these TFs may play a crucial role in the survival of the root and stem. These results comprise the first comprehensive gene expression profiles obtained for different organs of &lt;i&gt;P. chienii&lt;/i&gt;. Our findings will facilitate further studies on the functional genomics, adaptive evolution, and phylogeny of &lt;i&gt;P. chienii&lt;/i&gt;, and lay the foundation for the development of conservation strategies for this endangered conifer.">

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these traits are largely unknown in this species. In addition, wintersweet is also a typical representative species of the magnoliids, where the phylogenetic position of which relative to eudicots and monocots has not been conclusively resolved.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Here, we present a chromosome-level wintersweet genome assembly with a total size of 695.36 Mb and a draft genome assembly of Calycanthus chinensis. Phylogenetic analyses of 17 representative angiosperm genomes suggest that Magnoliids and eudicots are sister to monocots. Whole-genome duplication signatures reveal two major duplication events in the evolutionary history of the wintersweet genome, with an ancient one shared by Laurales, and a more recent one shared by the Calycantaceae. Whole-genome duplication and tandem duplication events have significant impacts on copy numbers of genes related to terpene and benzenoid/phenylpropanoid (the main floral scent volatiles) biosynthesis, which may contribute to the characteristic aroma formation. An integrative analysis combining cytology with genomic and transcriptomic data reveals biological characteristics of wintersweet, such as floral transition in spring, floral organ specification, low temperature-mediated floral bud break, early blooming in winter, and strong cold tolerance.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;These findings provide insights into the evolutionary history of wintersweet and the relationships among the Magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots; the molecular basis underlying floral scent biosynthesis; and winter flowering, and highlight the utility of multi-omics data in deciphering important ornamental traits in wintersweet.">

Although many terpenes have been reported in orchids, limited information is available regarding the genome-wide identification and characterization of the TPS family in the orchid, &lt;i&gt;Dendrobium officinale&lt;/i&gt;. By integrating the &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; genome and transcriptional data, 34 &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were found in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;. These were divided into four subfamilies (TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, and TPS-e/f). Distinct tempospatial expression profiles of &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were observed in 10 organs of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;. Most &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were predominantly expressed in flowers, followed by roots and stems. Expression of the majority of &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes was enhanced following exposure to cold and osmotic stresses. Recombinant DoTPS10 protein, located in chloroplasts, uniquely converted geranyl diphosphate to linalool in vitro. The &lt;i&gt;DoTPS10&lt;/i&gt; gene, which resulted in linalool formation, was highly expressed during all flower developmental stages. Methyl jasmonate significantly up-regulated &lt;i&gt;DoTPS10&lt;/i&gt; expression and linalool accumulation. These results simultaneously provide valuable insight into understanding the roles of the TPS family and lay a basis for further studies on the regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis by &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;.">

Genomic resequencing of 139 tea accessions from around the world is used to investigate the evolution and phylogenetic relationships of tea accessions. We find that hybridization has increased the heterozygosity and wide-ranging gene flow among tea populations with the spread of tea cultivation. Population genetic and transcriptomic analyses reveal that during domestication, selection for disease resistance and flavor in C. sinensis var. sinensis populations has been stronger than that in C. sinensis var. assamica populations.

Actual, theoretical, and moisture-adjusted yield increased linearly with percentage of Jersey milk. This was also associated with increased fat and protein recoveries and lower yield of whey. The composition of whey was also affected by the percentage of Jersey milk, with lower whey protein and higher whey lactose and solids. Cutting time was lower when Jersey milk was used, but the cutting to milling time was higher because of slower acidity development. Hence, overall cheesemaking time was not affected by the use of Jersey milk. Using Jersey milk increased cheese fat content in autumn, winter, and spring and decreased cheese moisture in spring and summer. Cheese protein, salt, and pH levels were not affected. Cheese was analyzed for texture and color, and it was professionally graded at 3 and 8mo. The effect of Jersey on cheese sensory quality was an increase in cheese yellowness during summer and a higher total grading score at 3mo in winter; no other difference in cheese quality was found. The study indicates that using Jersey milk is a valid method of improving Cheddar cheese yield.">

In this study, three potential geraniol synthases were mined from the &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; genome. DoGES1, which was localized in chloroplasts, was characterized as a geraniol synthase. &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in flowers, especially in petals. &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; transcript levels were high in the budding stage of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; flowers at 11:00 a.m. DoGES1 catalyzed geraniol in vitro, and transient expression of &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; leaves resulted in the accumulation of geraniol in vivo. These findings on DoGES1 advance our understanding of geraniol biosynthesis in orchids, and lay the basis for genetic modification of floral scent in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; or in other ornamental orchids.">

        <span class="abst" title="In this study, tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) in vitro culture was established from seeds collected from natural populations. The multiplication of plantlets was conducted through shoot tips that exhibited potent apical growth and regeneration capacities on basal medium (BM), without the addition of any plant growth regulators (PGRs). PGRs were also omitted for the establishment and cultivation of tansy root cultures. Both abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces of in vitro micropropagated plantlets were covered with glandular biseriate trichomes. Histochemical staining showed that glandular secretions were rich in lipid and terpene compounds, confirmed by GC-MS analysis of essential oil (EO). In the total EO, similar portions of oxygenated monoterpenes (38.5% m/m) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (22.6% m/m) were detected. Chemical profiles of methanol extracts of in vitro cultured tansy shoots and roots varied in quantity and quality from those obtained from wild-growingtansy. HPLC analysis indicated that the methanol extracts of in vitro cultured roots were the richest in 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-O-DCQA), in which the concentration was 6 times higher (10.220 mg/g DW) than that in the extract obtained from roots of wild-growing tansy (1.684 mg/g DW). This result is noticeable in the manner of industrial production of biologically active 3,5-O-DCQA that has been shown to have antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antiviral, antimutagenic, and immunomodulatory activity. Biotechnological interventions on secondary metabolite production taking place in trichomes could further enhance the production of some important tansy metabolites and further investigation will be directed toward the elucidation of the pharmaceutical potential of tansy in vitro obtained metabolites, as mixtures or single moieties.">

Although several chromosome-level tea plant genomes have been published, they collapsed the two haplotypes and ignored a large number of allelic variations that may underlie important biological functions in this species. Here, we present a phased chromosome-scale assembly for an elite oolong tea cultivar, &quot;Huangdan&quot;, that is well known for its high levels of aroma. Based on the two sets of haplotype genome data, we identified numerous genetic variations and a substantial proportion of allelic imbalance related to important traits, including aroma- and stress-related alleles. Comparative genomics revealed extensive structural variations as well as expansion of some gene families, such as terpene synthases (TPSs), that likely contribute to the high-aroma characteristics of the backbone parent, underlying the molecular basis for the biosynthesis of aroma-related chemicals in oolong tea. Our results uncovered the genetic basis of special features of this oolong tea cultivar, providing fundamental genomic resources to study evolution and domestication for the economically important tea crop.">

        <span class="abst" title="In response to preharvest priming with exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA), tea plants adjust their physiological behavior at the molecular level. The whole-organism reconfiguration of aroma formation from the precursor to storage is poorly understood. In this study, we performed iTRAQ proteomic analysis and identified 337, 246, and 413 differentially expressed proteins in tea leaves primed with MeJA for 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h, respectively. Furthermore, a total of 266 nonvolatile and 100 volatile differential metabolites were identified by utilizing MS-based metabolomics. A novel approach that incorporated the integration of extended self-organizing map-based dimensionality was applied. The vivid time-scale changes tracing physiological responses in MeJA-primed tea leaves are marked in these maps. Jasmonates responded quickly to the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway in tea leaves, while hydroxyl and glycosyl jasmonates were biosynthesized simultaneously on a massive scale to compensate for the exhausted defense. The levels of α-linolenic acid, geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and phenylalanine, which are crucial aroma precursors, were found to be significantly changed in MeJA-primed tea leaves. Green leaf volatiles, volatile terpenoids, and volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids were spontaneously biosynthesized from responding precursors and subsequently converted to their corresponding glycosidic forms, which can be stably stored in tea leaves. This study elucidated the physiological response of tea leaves primed with exogenous methyl jasmonate and revealed the molecular basis of source and sink changes on tea aroma biosynthesis and catabolism in response to exogenous stimuli. The results significantly enhance our comprehensive understanding of tea plant responses to exogenous treatment and will lead to the development of promising biotechnologies to improve fresh tea leaf quality.">
