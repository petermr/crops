This chapter reviews traditional and scientific approaches to the use of herbal medicine in treating an array of conditions by system.</p><p id="para167">Clinically, it is common to find more than one system affected, so it is important to consider the whole patient and not just the diagnosis or system. In this section formulas are offered as starting points; however, it is intended that they should be modified to match the needs of the individual patient wherever possible (see Chapter 19).</p><p id="para168">Frequently treatment with orthodox medicine has already been implemented. In the authors' experience herbal medicines can frequently be used alongside the conventional approach but can also be used instead in many instances, particularly for complicated or chronic conditions. Care should always be taken to consider possible drug-herb interactions and herb-herb interactions, dosing, and the vitality of the patient. Inexperienced veterinary herbalists are advised to cross reference with the monographs and chapters pertaining to prescribing and pharmacology. In many cases below, studies are described that involve experimental animal models and herb extracts (as opposed to whole herbs). It is important to maintain proper perspective on if and how these studies relate to clinical patients, whether they are safe in the species of interest, and how dosing of an herb might differ from doses described in the studies.</p><sec id="cesec1"><title>HERBS FOR BLOOD AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS</title><p id="para169">Of all the systems discussed in this section, the immune system is at once the most difficult and the most self-evident to treat. Practitioners are frequently asked how to &#x0201c;stimulate the immune system,&#x0201d; yet herbalists and scientists alike realize that the complexity of immune function makes this effort at least na&#x000ef;ve and at best inadvisable. Immune function represents an ecologic balance within the body that is attained with contributions from endocrine and neurologic activities. It has even been recognized that the &#x0201c;invaders&#x0201d; fought by the immune system are not all bad&#x02014;we may even need our viruses to help us fend off the development of tumors and our bacteria to maintain normal immune function.</p><p id="para170">So any attempt to modify immune function must take into account the relationship between the patient and all functions of the immune system, as well as the environment and its microbial influences that interface with the forward defenses of the immune system. In this sense, traditional concepts of clinical disease and empirically determined treatments may be even more useful than evidence-based guidance, simply because our knowledge of the complexities of immune function is so limited. We truly must treat an entire patient, instead of bone marrow and secondary immune organs.</p><p id="para171">Similarly, disorders of the blood are about more than just the bone marrow. For instance, hyperlipidemia in people is surely not just a problem with the blood&#x02014;it is a lifestyle problem in many cases. Although this section is all about blood and immune disorders, every condition that is listed requires a global approach to treatment. Herbs inherently provide complex actions that address more than one deranged process in the body.</p><sec id="cesec2"><title>Mechanisms of Interest</title><sec id="cesec3"><title>Adaptogens</title><p id="para172">These plants have been noted both traditionally and in human clinical trials and animal studies to increase resistance to stress, which predisposes animals to disease, including infection. Adaptogens generally work by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, but many have other effects as well, such as modulation of immune function.</p><sec id="cesec4"><title>ASIAN GINSENG (PANAX GINSENG):</title><p id="para173">Hundreds of scientific papers have established that <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> has numerous clinical effects. In laboratory animals, these include central nervous system (CNS) stimulation; protection against exogenous damage from radiation, toxins, and infection; protection from physical and psychological stress; and an influence on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and immune stimulation. All of these may bear on an animal's response to stress. Recently, investigators have developed rat models of stress that have resulted in measurable physical and chemical changes. In these studies, pretreatment with ginseng attenuated the stress-induced rise in corticosterone, hyperglycemia, immune suppression, increased adrenal gland weight, gastric ulceration, and other signs of chronic stress (<xref rid="bib588" ref-type="bibr">Rai, 2003b</xref>; <xref rid="bib370" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 2003</xref>).

Most clinical studies in humans have involved upper respiratory infection and, in fact, Echinacea may shorten the duration of the common cold (<xref rid="bib566" ref-type="bibr">Percival, 2000</xref>), depending on the form administered. Echinacea is often recommended for chronic recurrent viral upper respiratory infection in cats, and some practitioners use Echinacea to treat patients with retroviral infection. Although some practitioners caution against the long-term use of Echinacea because toxicity or autoimmune conditions may result, this concern has not been well documented. However, immunostimulants are probably best used as pulsed treatments if they are administered on a long-term basis, because full response to treatment is probably reached in a few weeks and does not continue to increase. In a 4-day observational study conducted at the Ohio Eclectic College in 1935, students were administered Echinacea before meals and at bedtime. Leukocyte counts increased 24 to 48 hours after initiation of treatment. Short-term (2- to 4-week), on-off administration is most sensible.

<bold>Tonic and adaptogenic herbs.</bold> These include Panax, Eleutherococcus, and Ashwagandha. As a general guide, stimulating herbs should be avoided during the acute phase of an infection. This is perhaps derived from traditional Chinese medicine, wherein stimulating and tonic herbs are contraindicated in Deficient Yin patterns with Heat signs&#x02014;typically, fever and inflammation or infection. One study on Eleutherococcus showed that administration before induced listeriosis infection in rabbits and mice increased resistance to infection. However, when administration occurred simultaneously with an induced infection, the severity of disease was exacerbated (Farnsworth, 1966). Despite this, Eleutherococcus is frequently found in low doses in formulations for acute infection such as cold and flu.</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem23"><label>3.</label><p id="para238">
<bold>Bitter herbs.</bold> Gentiana or any of the bitters described under the gastrointestinal system should be considered; these are generally cooling herbs.

One of the proposed theories for the benefit of bitters is the general improvement that occurs in digestive function, hence enhanced gut-associated lymphoid tissue function. Better immunity at the gut level (T helper 3 cell mediated) helps to moderate and regulate T helper 1 and T helper 2 cells, thereby improving immune balance systemically.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="para239">Echinacea and Astragalus are two of the most popular &#x0201c;immune&#x0201d; herbs in human herbal medicine. Echinacea improves phagocytosis and generally enhances immune surveillance. It must be used in high doses during acute infections, such as infected wounds or viral infections. In humans, doses of 20 to 30 mL per day can be taken; it takes about 3 days for phagocytic activity to peak. Many studies that detract from the benefits of Echinacea are flawed by incorrect dosing and improper extract type. Echinacea can be used for chronic bacterial and viral infections, postviral syndromes, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome resulting from feline leukemia virus (FAIDS), in the appropriate formulas, autoimmune disease and long-term allergies and intolerances. It can be used during chemotherapy or pneumonia, and for chronic purulent or pyodermic skin infection&#x02014;at relatively high doses in all cases (in humans, 15 mL per day for serious chronic states of immune deficiency). Doses as high as 40 mL on the first day followed by 16 mL daily were used in one positive clinical trial (<xref rid="bib237" ref-type="bibr">Goel, 2004</xref>). Astragalus, on the other hand, is more appropriately used as a preventive measure during disease outbreaks or for chronic immune incompetence and autoimmune disease (especially nephritis). The dose in humans is between 20 and 40 mL per week. High dosing in the case of Echinacea is an important consideration because it does influence efficacy.</p><p id="para240">A prescription for general immune support follows:<table-wrap position="float" id="cetable8"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">Echinacea</td><td align="left">40%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Oregon grape root</td><td align="left">20%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Astragalus</td><td align="left">20%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Licorice</td><td align="left">20%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

Cellular mutation may occur as a result of free radical damage (with activation of oncogenes or suppression of tumor suppressor genes) and genetic susceptibility and toxicity (e.g., hepatopathogenic toxins). In traditional herbal medicine, cancer is nearly always viewed as a sign of systemic toxicity. However, immune dysregulation has to be considered, and can occur with stress, toxin, heavy metal and pesticide exposure, dysbiosis, hormonal imbalance, nutrient imbalance, infection, inflammation, and radiation. Chemotherapy is also a major cause of immune dysregulation; for example, vincristine is weakly myelosuppressive, and cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids are strongly myelopsuppressive.</p><p id="para255">Many chemotherapeutic drugs currently in use in medicine were first identified in plants, including taxol, vinblastine and vincristine, and etoposide and teniposide (<xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Boik, 1996</xref>). Herbs offer a rational potential in the treatment of cancer in animals; however, it is important to note that herbs may be used for purposes other than direct antitumor activity. On the other hand, just about any selection of herbs prescribed to treat a patient will more than likely have some anticancer activity because of the presence of widely occurring anticancer constituents like flavonoids.</p><p id="para256">Although little research has been conducted in cats and dogs specifically, a plethora of research pertains to rats, mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs. At least pocket pets are amply catered to if they are diagnosed with cancer! Herbs can be used to help manage the effects of chemotherapy; to assist in recuperation after chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery; to complement conventional cancer treatment; to provide an alternative to conventional treatment in some cases; to assist in cancer prevention; and to support various systems that are affected by cancer. One of the approaches used by veterinary herbalists is to treat cancer as a chronic disease, with emphasis on improving the health of the whole body, regardless of the presence of cancer. Anecdotal evidence from veterinary herbalists indicates that herbs offer improved quality of life and may support remission in some cases.</p><p id="para257">The rational use of herbal medicine for the treatment of patients with cancer depends on a growing understanding of the biological mechanisms by which cancer cells proliferate, maintain life, and die. These include differentiation (the maturation process of cells), angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels into tumors), apoptosis (programmed cell death), invasion (the spread of the tumor mass into adjacent tissue), metastasis (the spread of tumor cells to distant locations), mitosis (the proliferation of cells), and evasion of the immune system. As these mechanisms have become elucidated, their weak points have been identified and have become the targets of research that is both conventional and complementary (<xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Boik, 1996</xref>). The selection of several herbs that have different mechanisms of action provides a broad spectrum of anticancer activity. A holistic strategy that incorporates all elements discussed here is proposed under &#x0201c;Review of Strategies for Cancer Prescriptions&#x0201d; at the end of this section.</p></sec><sec id="cesec55"><title>Mechanisms of Interest</title><sec id="cesec56"><title>Antineoplastic/cytotoxic actions</title><p id="para258">It is logical to select herbs is on the basis of cancer biology. An extremely comprehensive review of anticancer plants and natural compounds is provided in John Boik's book, <italic>Natural Compounds in Cancer Therapy</italic> (2001). This book explains in great detail the mechanisms of action of many plants and their constituents. It is important to note that most herbs have many actions, and this list is merely indicative of the wide range of such mechanisms that have been documented. (Search Medline for more information; use the herb name and cancer or activity as search terms.)</p><p id="para259">Boik highlights the importance of synergism as a strategy by which lower doses can be used without reduced efficacy; he also discusses the use of herbs with different antineoplastic mechanisms for targeting events that take place in the progression of cancer. Choosing compounds that have direct-acting, indirect-acting, and immune-stimulating activities is likely to inhibit procancer events. Constituents like flavonoids can target multiple aspects of tumor biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cesec57"><title>Adaptogens</title><p id="para260">This strategy recognizes that a patient can live with cancer as opposed to having to die of cancer. Many of our elderly animal patients, in particular, have never been in better health than when they are on herbal and nutritional treatment, even though they have cancer, because the prescriptions that they are given promote overall health. Herbs should be used to strengthen body resistance, and vitality is enhanced through the use of adaptogens. Most adaptogens also have anticancer activity.</p><p id="para261">

However, when the outcomes are likely to be palliative, or when they are unknown, then herbal &#x0201c;chemotherapy&#x0201d; is a viable alternative to conventional chemotherapy after risks and benefits of treatment have been weighed. Even with grave prognoses, many cases have demonstrated that improvement in health and longevity is possible, despite the presence of cancer.</p><p id="para463">The known mechanisms of herbal actions can be integrated in a holistic approach to cancer care through a strategy that incorporates tradition and science. By using a variety of herbs with different anticancer activities, veterinarians are using, in effect, a form of &#x0201c;polyvalent herbal chemotherapy.&#x0201d; At the same time, traditional herbal medicine treatment is aimed at treating the patient, rather than the disease.

Unfortunately, a number of physiologic adverse effects of these therapies (e.g., doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, cisplatin-induced nephrotoxity, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis) are related to oxidative damage (<xref rid="bib153" ref-type="bibr">Conklin, 2000</xref>). Evidence is accumulating that antioxidants are helpful in attenuating these side effects (<xref rid="bib211" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira, 2004</xref>), (<xref rid="bib771" ref-type="bibr">Weijl, 2004</xref>). Careful selection of herbs that help reduce these adverse effects and protect these organs and systems (see relevant system herbs) can be used. Because antioxidant activity is inherent in many herbs, two options with chemotherapy and radiation therapy are available, if the theoretical concern exists. Herbal treatment should be stopped just before conventional treatment is begun (24-48 hours) and recommenced in approximately 5-7 days depending on the half life of the chemotherapeutic drug (or longer for radiation therapy); or herbal treatment should be continued concurrently. In the authors' experience, concurrent treatment helps to reduce the adverse effects of treatment and to maintain &#x0201c;wellness.&#x0201d;</p><p id="para483">Much has been made in the medical literature of drug-herb interactions, and specifically the CYP450 hepatic microsomal system which is responsible for metabolizing many commonly prescribed drugs.

This is the proper course of clinical herbal research&#x02014;investigators should (1) note that a plant in long use may actually have clinical effects, (2) document these effects well, and (3) publish findings for others to put them to the test. Many of the plants discussed in this section have been used as traditional treatments for heart failure, and some have undergone scientific investigation.

It results from interaction among the heart and neuroendocrine and vascular systems. The heart may increasingly lose capacity to pump blood at a rate that can maintain tissue metabolism requirements, or it may do so at elevated filling pressures, resulting in impaired organ function. Therapy must address inciting causes (if known), improve myocardial function, reduce volume overload, or reduce pressure overload. Drug therapies for myocardial failure are &#x0201c;Band-Aid therapies&#x0201d; that palliate the effects of heart disease for a short duration but do little to address the primary disease process. Some goals of drug therapy are to reduce pulmonary venous pressure and augment systolic performance. In addition, therapy is increasingly targeting neurohormonal changes that hasten the progression of heart failure, including activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system. It is worth noting that some herbs traditionally used for heart failure (such as hawthorn and linden) have mild anxiolytic activity, which may reduce sympathetic nervous system activity.</p></sec><sec id="cesec197"><title>Mechanisms of Interest</title><sec id="cesec198"><title>Cardiotonic and cardioprotective herbs</title><p id="para487">Cardiotonic and cardioprotective herbs are generally rich in flavonoids, which may reduce oxidative stress and reduce capillary fragility.

These are generally determined during the processes of history taking and diagnosis, and awareness of them helps the clinician to gain an understanding of the pathogenesis of the skin disorder. However, the treatment of patients with skin disorders in herbal medicine draws on some different traditional concepts.</p><p id="para577">Skin disorders are considered manifestations of deeper disease processes and therefore indicate metabolic imbalance somewhere in the body. Hence, topical herbs are employed judiciously but represent only a superficial approach. It is important to note that the skin should not be treated in isolation but as a tissue that is intimately connected to and affected by other organ systems. In many cases, a skin lesion is considered a valid attempt by the body to discharge or metabolize toxic agents, so paradoxically, medications that suppress this process (e.g., corticosteroids) are sometimes considered counterproductive over the long term.</p><p id="para578">Traditional and modern phytotherapeutic concepts that are relevant to chronic skin disease and that help to clarify the issues of &#x0201c;toxicity&#x0201d; include toxemia, leaky gut syndrome, and dysbiosis.</p></sec><sec id="cesec260"><title>Mechanisms of Interest</title><p id="para579">Topical vulnerary, astringent, and emollient herbs are discussed under the section &#x0201c;Herbs for Topical Use.&#x0201d; From a phytotherapy perspective, topical treatment alleviates skin conditions, but for chronic skin disease, systemic treatment is usually necessary.</p><sec id="cesec261"><title>Toxemia and chronic skin disease</title><p id="para580">Traditionally, chronic skin disease was considered a sign of internal toxicity that indicated that the body had failed to eliminate fully. In toxemia, normal elimination through the liver, gut, and kidneys is impaired, allowing the accumulation of toxic metabolites. In the case of chronic dermatitis, the eliminative process most frequently impaired is considered the digestive system. The aim of therapy was always to remove toxins by enhancing and supporting the eliminatory functions of the body. The most useful herbs that have been employed traditionally are the alteratives, also known as depuratives or &#x0201c;blood cleansers.&#x0201d; These herbs effect changes in metabolic processes within the body and usually have mild laxative or diuretic actions, among others, so it can be seen that the approach of improving &#x0201c;elimination&#x0201d; has some merit if toxemia is present. Other herbs facilitate the various detoxification mechanisms used by the body and can help restore normal metabolism and immune function.</p><p id="para581">Although this theory of toxemia is a traditional one, perhaps some scientific support can be provided for it. Incomplete digestion, inflammation, and failure of the local immune response (for systemic tolerance) facilitate gut absorption of macromolecules with high antigenicity (<xref rid="bib269" ref-type="bibr">Halliwell, 1995</xref>). These can bind to immunoglobulin (Ig)E and precipitate mast cell degranulation or activate the complement cascade via the alternate pathway (thus allowing the subsequent development of food sensitivities and allergies). They can also combine with antibodies to form immune complexes that promote inflammation.</p><p id="para582">Inflammation of the gut from any cause can make the gut more permeable to macromolecules, causing hyperpermeability, or leaky gut syndrome. Predisposing factors for leaky gut include use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or steroids, allergy or intolerance to food, and environmental sensitivities. Similarly, impaired liver function can reduce hepatic detoxification and allow toxins and free radical metabolic intermediates to enter the circulation, thereby contributing to widespread cellular damage (including damage within the epithelium).</p><p id="para583">Food substances and consequently food allergies and food intolerances are typically associated with chronic dermatitis, alongside exposure to common drugs (especially those that impair liver function or inflame the gut wall) and chemicals that enter the body (through the skin, mouth, or lungs). When subclinical allergy occurs, the potential exists for histamine-releasing foods to become mediators of histamine release, thereby initiating clinical disease (<xref rid="bib269" ref-type="bibr">Halliwell, 1995</xref>).</p><p id="para584">Thus, although food allergies (involving an immune reaction) are not considered common in veterinary medicine (less than 10% of atopic dogs are considered to have food allergy [<xref rid="bib269" ref-type="bibr">Halliwell, 1995</xref>]), food intolerance or adverse reactions to food may go unrecognized. In a study of dogs with allergic dermatoses (excluding flea allergy dermatitis) and not considered to have food intolerance or food allergy, 45.7% improved on a commercial chicken and rice elimination diet. Of the dogs that improved, 68.8% were finally diagnosed with atopic dermatitis (Nagata, <xref rid="bib205" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Although the mechanism involved was unclear, this demonstrates the importance of dietary manipulation in the treatment of patients with chronic dermatitis, even when it would not seem obvious in conventional veterinary medicine.</p></sec><sec id="cesec262"><title>Leaky gut syndrome and chronic skin disease</title><p id="para585">Another concept employed in herbal medicine is that of &#x0201c;leaky gut syndrome.&#x0201d; A major task of the intestine is to form a defensive barrier that prevents absorption of damaging substances from the external environment. In human medicine, inert, nonmetabolized sugars such as mannitol, rhamnose, or lactulose are used to measure the permeability barrier or the degree of leakiness of the intestinal mucosa. Permeability is increased in a number of gastrointestinal tract diseases (such as parasitic infestation, infection, inflammation) and can be increased through trauma, burns, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The major determinant of the rate of intestinal permeability is the opening or closure of the tight junctions between enterocytes in the paracellular space (Hollander, <xref rid="bib205" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>).</p><p id="para586">Increasing evidence suggests that a leaky, more permeable bowel wall may lead to translocation of bacteria or endotoxin, which may be an important stimulus for inflammatory cytokine activation (<xref rid="bib393" ref-type="bibr">Krack, 2005</xref>) and may increase the level of toxic insult to the liver. Leakage of imperfectly digested proteins (peptides) through an incompetent intestinal lining is thought to be the most common cause of environmental sensitivities, acquired food allergies, and an underlying contributing factor to many chronic and degenerative diseases.</p><p id="para587">Although this syndrome is not yet recognized in veterinary medicine, attention to correcting the &#x0201c;leaky gut&#x0201d; can improve overall health, reduce allergies, and help eliminate one of the major contributing factors to chronic disease.</p></sec><sec id="cesec263"><title>Dysbiosis theory and chronic skin disease</title><p id="para588">Related to the theory of the leaky gut syndrome is dysbiosis, which is thought to be a major contributing factor to chronic disease, including skin disorders and food allergies (<xref rid="bib219" ref-type="bibr">Fratkin, 1996</xref>). It follows the use of antibiotics, other medications, or diets that adversely alter the normal flora, or it may be associated with conditions that allow pathogenic microbes to multiply, producing endotoxins that challenge and deplete the immune system and increase gut permeability (thus predisposing to food allergies and sensitivities). Conditions and symptoms of dysbiosis recognized in human medicine that can be associated with this disturbance include allergies, anxiety, constipation or diarrhea, decreased liver function, decreased pancreatic function, food allergies, muscle pain, pain or swelling in the joints, autoimmune disease, cancer, chemical sensitivities, hyperactivity, chronic hepatitis and pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, urticaria, and acne.</p><p id="para589">Dysbiosis could be an important unrecognized contributing factor to chronic skin disease, leading to low levels of normal flora (influencing digestion and removal of biodegradable toxins), increased intestinal permeability (toxic overload to liver, lymphatics, interstitial fluids; food sensitivities; autoimmune disease), suppressed immune function, and allergy. Attention to correcting a suspected dysbiosis is worthwhile, and the approach is relatively straightforward.</p><p id="para590">Therefore, in the treatment of patients with chronic skin disease, whether autoimmune, atopic, infected, or simply chronic, attention must be paid not just to the diagnosis, but to the myriad of contributing factors, such as leaky gut syndrome, dysbiosis, and toxemia, as well as diet, stress levels, drug administration, and so forth. Emphasis is placed on improving systemic health&#x02014;not just skin health.</p><p id="para591">When appropriate, herbal interventions may involve the regulation or enhancement of specific body systems, organs, or tissues, or they may require that imbalances be corrected, nutrition optimized, detoxification enhanced, and the energy of the body increased through enhanced vitality (attained with the use of tonics and adaptogens). In chronic disease, an important goal is the stimulation of detoxification, particularly when poor organ function or increased toxic loading is suspected. Detoxification can be achieved by stimulating both the eliminatory organs and the detoxifying processes.</p><p id="para592">As an informal rule of thumb, chronic skin disease cannot be corrected quickly.

<bold>Authors' note:</bold> The use of immune-enhancing herbs in autoimmune disease is very controversial. The German Commission E monograph recommends that Echinacea not be used in patients with autoimmune disease because of the risk that its immune-stimulating effects could lead to exacerbation of autoimmune illness. Despite several adverse event reports associated with the use of Echinacea in patients with autoimmune disease, the risk has not been adequately studied. The British Herbal Pharmacopoeia (1983) and the British Herbal Compendium offer no contraindications for Echinacea. In fact, it is proposed (<xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Bone, 1997</xref>) that molecular mimicry by infectious organisms may be causative in autoimmune disease, and that Echinacea may be benefical in decreasing the chronic presence of microorganisms. Echinacea increases phagocytic activity and increases immune surveillance. This may assist the body in eliminating organisms or neutralizing their imbalancing effects on the immune system, thereby downregulating an inappropriate immune response.</p></boxed-text>

Of 20 patients treated with Boswellia, 14 went into remission (70%, compared with 40% for sulfasalazine) (<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Bone, 1999</xref>).

Only when gentian was given by mouth (i.e., tasted) did it cause a marked increase in gastric secretion of acid and pepsin content, and this effect occurred only after normal feeding. These effects provide rational explanations for the traditional use of bitters for liver and digestive complaints, poor appetite, debility, and a wide range of other conditions. It has been postulated that bitters applied to the mouth before a meal have a priming effect on upper digestive function, which is most marked in states in which digestion is below optimum. The increase in digestive function is probably mediated by a nerve reflex caused by the bitter taste buds and involves an increase in vagal stimulation (ACP, <xref rid="bib205" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Vagal stimulation causes an increase in gastric acid secretion, a transient rise in gastrin, an increase in pepsin secretion, a slight increase in gallbladder motility, and priming of the pancreas.</p><p id="para837">Bitters can be used to (1) stimulate the appetite (anorexia or poor appetite), (2) increase the flow of digestive juices, (3) reduce the risk of enteric infection and improve the microenvironment of the gut, (4) promote bile flow, (5) regulate the secretion of insulin and glucagons, and (6) stimulate repair of the gut wall lining; bitters are not necessarily contraindicated in ulcer or other erosive conditions. In short, the action of bitters can be seen to enhance the whole upper digestive function and to improve assimilation of nutrients into the system.</p><p id="para838">In traditional medicine, this property was highly regarded as leading to a real tonic improvement in health. Bitters were seen as &#x0201c;cooling,&#x0201d; that is, reducing fever by switching blood flow to the breakdown of food and reducing toxin resorption in such conditions, but in a more general way, improving nourishment at the expense of &#x0201c;circulatory heat.&#x0201d; Bitters were therefore prescribed in &#x0201c;hot&#x0201d; conditions&#x02014;those in which the patient feels the heat; the patient experiences thirst; the tongue is dry and red; and nervous agitation, restlessness, and tension are observed. The bitter option is one of the most central choices facing the herbalist (<xref rid="bib496" ref-type="bibr">Mills, 1989</xref>).</p><p id="para839">Because they act locally on the taste buds, bitters must be administered in the form of a tea, powder, or tincture. Tablets, pills, and capsules bypass the taste buds. They should be administered 5 to 15 minutes before feeding, or should actually be mixed in with food. Dogs and cats usually object to the taste, and meat or meat extracts are probably more useful as salivary or gastric stimulants. In convalescing cattle and horses, gentian can be mixed with bran mashes (<xref rid="bib165" ref-type="bibr">Daykin, 1960</xref>).</p><p id="para840">The two most famous bitters are Gentian and Wormwood <italic>(Artemisia absinthium),</italic> the latter of which is the central ingredient in Angostura bitters.</p><sec id="cesec439"><title>GENTIAN <italic>(GENTIANA LUTEA):</italic></title><p id="para841">Elevation of gastric secretion by up to 30% has been reported following the administration of gentian tincture to dogs.

A standardized extract perfused into the stomachs of anesthetized rats increased gastric secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Lower doses caused no changes in gastric pH, whereas higher doses increased pH from 4.25 to 4.85. A dose of 0.5 mL/kg did not affect the incidence of gastric ulceration in rats (EMEA, 2002).

Other actions that result are the relaxation of the gastrointestinal tract musculature, but particularly the cardiac sphincter, for a period of up to 30 minutes, which probably plays a large part in releasing gases from the stomach.

</p><p id="para917">Laxatives include mechanical stimulants, bulk purgatives, irritant purgatives, and neuromuscular purgatives. Mechanical stimulants like paraffin oil may hinder absorption of nutrients by coating the mucosa. Chronic constipation or impaction will not benefit and may be aggravated; in small animals, liquid paraffin may actively encourage the continued existence of fecoliths because the oil facilitates the passage of soft feces past solid masses.</p><p id="para918">Bulk laxatives increase the volume of intestinal contents, causing distention of the intestines, which induces a reflex that initiates contraction of the musculature and an increase in the power and speed of peristalsis. Wheat bran, plantain seeds (psyllium), and seaweeds fall into this group. The swelling properties of mucilage in herbs also enable it to absorb water in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby increasing the volume of the feces and promoting peristalsis. These laxatives have only mild stimulant effects and are particularly useful when sharp foreign bodies (e.g., needles, sharp bones, stones) have been swallowed. Bulk laxatives lower transit time through the gastrointestinal tract and therefore may delay the absorption of other drugs.</p><p id="para919">Vegetable oils are probably the most efficient and safe of the direct irritant purgatives. As a group, they act by combining in a saponification process with alkaline bile salts of the small intestine. This process produces monobasic, dibasic, and tribasic soaps that exert irritant effects. Glycerol is a by-product of this process and is useful in lubricating and breaking up fecal masses; it also assists in defecation by exerting strong osmotic pressure to retain fluid within and possibly attract fluid into the intestinal lumen. The soaps produced by these oils differ in their irritant properties, so olive oil produces oliveic acid, castor oil ricinoleates, and linseed oil linoleates and linolenates&#x02014;all of which are relatively strong irritants. Small quantities of stearates and palmitates are also produced (<xref rid="bib165" ref-type="bibr">Daykin, 1960</xref>).</p><p id="para920">The effect is seen within 4 to 8 hours in smaller species and in 12 to 18 hours in the horse. An almost complete clearance of the intestines results when these oils are used. Defecation is temporarily suspended until sufficient bulk reaches the colon again; therefore, oleaginous purgatives are not recommended for chronic constipation.</p><p id="para921">Indirect irritant purgatives contain precursors that are broken down to anthrones and anthraquinones, which themselves pass unchanged through the colon; there, they exert an irritant action and stimulate intestinal movement. Systemic absorption is limited, especially in the case of whole anthraquinone glycosides. Their main effects probably involve stimulation of active chloride secretion, which is electrochemically and osmotically balanced by an increase in sodium and water secretion&#x02014;an effect that is counteracted by morphine, with 5-HT as a likely mediator.</p></sec><sec id="cesec477"><title>Neuromuscular Purgatives:</title><p id="para922">A separate effect of anthraquinones is observed in increasing gut motility of the bowel musculature&#x02014;a response that may be more sensitive than changes in secretion. Bowel flora metabolism has been firmly implicated in the action of sennosides in the gut (<xref rid="bib497" ref-type="bibr">Mills, 1997</xref>).

The emodins (anthraquinones) of Aloes are excreted in the large intestine and are of greatest value in those animals that suffer from impaction of the large intestine. The horse with its numerous colon flexures and its decrease in diameter at the pelvic flexure benefits from this type of purgative. Purgation in the horse is delayed for at least 18 hours. In other animals, the action is far more rapid (<xref rid="bib165" ref-type="bibr">Daykin, 1960</xref>). The glycosides are metabolized by glycosidases in the intestinal flora to form active anthrones. The laxative action is due to increased motility of the large intestine attained by inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump and chloride ion channels; enhanced fluid secretion occurs because of stimulation of secretion of mucus and chloride ion (ESCP, 1997).</p></sec><sec id="cesec479"><title>SENNA POD <italic>(CASSIA ANGUSTIFOLIA):</italic></title><p id="para924">At very small doses, this herb produces sublaxative effects, whereby bowel motions are made comfortable, normal, and soft. At larger doses, it produces a laxative or purgative effect. The effects of sennosides on colonic motility were investigated in eight conscious dogs. Oral sennosides (30 mg/kg) inhibited colonic motility for 12 to 18 hours after a 3- to 6-hour delay and were associated with giant contractions and diarrhea. The minimal oral dose of sennosides needed to produce such changes varied from 5 to 15 mg/kg. Intracolonic sennosides at the minimal effective dose and at 30 mg/kg reproduced the effects of oral sennosides, but with a shorter latency (0.5-1.5 h). This study suggested that colonic motor actions of sennosides are mediated through local prostaglandin synthesis because they were blocked by cyclooxygenase inhibitor and reproduced by PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bib691" ref-type="bibr">Staumont, 1988</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec480"><title>PARSLEY <italic>(PETROSELINUM CRISPUM):</italic></title><p id="para925">The mechanism of action for the purported laxative effects of parsley has been investigated. In rat colon, an aqueous extract of parsley seeds significantly reduced net water absorption from the colon, as compared with controls. Results suggest that parsley acts by inhibiting sodium and consequently water absorption through inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, by stimulating the NaKCl transporter, and by increasing electrolyte and water secretions (<xref rid="bib397" ref-type="bibr">Kreydiyyeh, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec481"><title>RHUBARB <italic>(RHEUM OFFICINALE):</italic></title><p id="para926">The laxative action of anthraquinone derivatives is well recognized.

This is generally associated with joint irregularities (hypermobility, instability, arthrosis, bony proliferation, ligamentous thickening) and muscle changes (spasms, both acute and chronic; atrophy). Goals of therapy include normalizing joint and muscle function and controlling pain. Joint instability itself may require surgical intervention; however, herbal analgesics and anti-inflammatory herbs may be useful in acute situations. In chronic situations, chondroprotectives, anti-inflammatories, alteratives, and analgesics are required. In older patients and those with chronic joint disease, muscle spasm is a dramatic but rarely recognized clinical finding. Deep palpation of thoracic, lumbar, and upper limb muscles reveals sensitivity that indicates massage therapy and antispasmodic herbs. Other useful therapies include physiotherapy, as well as chiropractic treatment and acupuncture.</p><p id="para1133">In earlier times, arthritis was sometimes viewed as resulting from abnormal accumulations of metabolic toxins, which could be cleared with dietary changes, diuretics, and hepatics. There may be reason to connect toxin accumulation with pain and inflammation, and the more modern concept of &#x0201c;leaky gut&#x0201d; can explain why herbalists generally direct some efforts toward normalizing gut function, as well as directly addressing joint and muscle pain and inflammation. Leaky gut occurs in animals that may be older and stressed because of chronic pain or disease, especially when steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (which may often lead to mucosal inflammation) change normal gut permeability. When the gut mucosa is altered in this way, large proteins such as food as well as bacterial, and self antigens may gain access to the submucosa and possibly even the portal circulation. The normal gut is responsible for making primary immune responses, but it also makes significant neuroendocrine responses, including the production of serotonin, benzodiazepines, glutamate, enkephalins, nitric oxide, and dopamine. The end clinical response is increased immune responsiveness, systemic inflammation and perhaps altered behavior (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 20-2</xref>

Animals have receptors for plant chemicals&#x02014;opioid receptors, named for the opium poppy, as well as cannabinoid receptors, benzodiazepine receptors, and vanilloid receptors (for cayenne's constituent, capsaicin).

It is curious that veterinary herbalists have much less experience in targeting herbs toward animal reproductive diseases, even though infertility and false pregnancy are common reasons for clients to seek herbal medicine treatment. Differences in female reproductive cycle types are likely one factor. In addition, our inability to evaluate sensations that go along with the physiologic processes of ovulation, gestation, and ejaculation, or clinical signs such as uterine bleeding or lack of libido in animals, undoubtedly contribute to this deficiency in herbal tools. This brief section attempts to pull together some clinical targets in human medicine and suggests possible strategies for the future in veterinary reproductive medicine.</p></sec><sec id="cesec742"><title>Mechanisms of Interest</title><sec id="cesec743"><title>Emmenagogues</title><p id="para1420">This traditional term refers to any plant that stimulates the menstrual process in women; it may apply to stimulation of menstrual bleeding or to normalization of the menstrual cycle in general.

The berries of this plant are used primarily in women for complaints of premenstrual syndrome. Animal studies have shown that vitex inhibits prolactin and appears to selectively stimulate D<sub>2</sub>-type dopamine receptors. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in men showed no dose-dependent changes in serum prolactin, but studies in women with mastodynia showed that treatment with vitex reduced serum prolactin levels.

The root of the plant is used primarily in women for menopausal symptoms. Experiments have demonstrated that black cohosh contains compounds with antiestrogenic properties, and that the herb reduces levels of luteinizing hormone (which induces ovulation), with no changes in follicle-stimulating hormone. The triterpene glycosides also affect the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, potentially leading to a variety of secondary effects on the reproductive, nervous, and circulatory systems. Traditionally, black cohosh is considered a uterine tonic and nervine as well. To our knowledge, the herb is not recommended in historic veterinary texts for reproductive or hormonal disorders, and any clear indication for its use in animals is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="cesec748"><title>FENNEL <italic>(FOENICULUM VULGARE):</italic></title><p id="para1428">Fennel extracts have been shown in mice to trigger a mating response, induce estrus, and increase the size of mammary glands, cervix, vagina, endometrium, and myometrium.

Similar to conventional medicine, symptomatic management is the mainstay of treatment, and a diagnosis assists herbalists in treating the underlying pathophysiology.</p><p id="para1533">One of the first signs of respiratory disease is coughing, which in itself may be beneficial. Generally, coughs should be treated when they are unproductive, or when they keep the owner awake at night. Herbal treatment for respiratory disease may include tinctures, but steam inhalation and cough syrups are also useful. Herbs are commonly found in many cough syrups used in conventional medicine. Some of the actions we look for in treating respiratory disease include expectorants, which help remove excess mucus; demulcents, which reduce irritation;. antitussives, to prevent or reduce the severity of coughing; suppressants, which inhibit the coughing reflex; antimicrobials, to reduce infection; and, more recently, herbal antihistamines and immune modulators, to treat allergic respiratory disease.</p><sec id="cesec809"><title>Mechanisms of Interest</title><sec id="cesec810"><title>Antitussive herbs</title><p id="para1534">Coughing is a complex reflex that originates in peripheral cough receptors, which are most concentrated in the epithelium of the upper and lower respiratory tracts but are also found in the external auditory meatus, tympanic membrane, esophagus, stomach, pericardium, and diaphragm. Vagal afferent nerves carry signals from irritants and mechanoreceptors to the central medullary cough center (or centers), and efferent signals reach bronchial smooth muscle through the vagal, phrenic, and spinal motor nerves. Stimulation at any point in this reflex arc may lead to a cough.</p><p id="para1535">Antitussives work through central or peripheral means. Central-acting antitussives act on the central cough center. Conventional drugs with central antitussive activity include opioid agonists; however, few herbs with demonstrated opioid activity are also used as antitussives. One source (<xref rid="bib498" ref-type="bibr">Mills, 2000</xref>) claims that cyanogenic glycosides have central antitussive activity&#x02014;the premier herb in this case is wild cherry bark. Peripheral antitussives may have bronchodilator, expectorant, demulcent, or anti-inflammatory activity; these are discussed in their respective sections.</p><p id="para1536">Swallowing itself helps to suppress coughing.

A protective effect is exerted by ginkgolides on platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced bronchoconstriction and airway hyperactivity. Oral or intravenous injection of ginkgolide B antagonizes cardiovascular impairments and bronchoconstriction induced by PAF. Ginkgolide B does not appear to interfere with cyclooxygenase, but it does have an effect in an earlier step involving PAF receptors and phospholipase activation. Eosinophil infiltration occurs in asthma and in allergic reactions, the number of eosinophils increasing during late phase. Because PAF is a potent activator of eosinophil function, it has been argued that ginkgolide B may interfere with the late-phase response (<xref rid="bib301" ref-type="bibr">Hosford, 1988</xref>).

This related reflex is not surprising when one considers the common embryologic origin of the bronchial and alimentary epithelium, as well as the shared vagal innervation.

For example, carbenoxolone, derived from licorice, was shown to provide a protective effect in laboratory-induced lower urinary tract infection in the rabbit model; in the same way, it is used to treat peptic ulcers in people (<xref rid="bib507" ref-type="bibr">Mooreville, 1983</xref>).</p><sec id="cesec927"><title>MARSHMALLOW <italic>(ALTHAEA OFFICINALIS):</italic></title><p id="para1706">Mucilage content ranges from 10% to 20%, and this herb may work through a reflex effect.</p></sec><sec id="cesec928"><title>COUCH GRASS <italic>(AGROPYRON REPENS):</italic></title><p id="para1707">This plant contains both triticum 3% to 8%&#x02014;a polysaccharide related to inulin&#x02014;and 8% to 10% mucilage.</p></sec><sec id="cesec929"><title>CORN SILK <italic>(ZEA MAYS):</italic></title><p id="para1708">This plant contains allantoin, which is a vulnerary.</p></sec><sec id="cesec930"><title>Licorice <italic>(Glycyrrhiza glabra):</italic></title><p id="para1709">This herb may provide reflex demulcency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cesec931"><title>Urinary antiseptics/antimicrobials</title><p id="para1710">These herbs produce metabolites that are excreted in urine, and they exert their antiseptic effects there.

Initially, it was thought that the antibacterial effect of cranberry juice was a result of its ability to acidify urine and, therefore, to inhibit bacterial growth. However, recent work has focused on the effects of cranberry in inhibiting bacterial adherence and on the effects of antiadhesion agents in cranberry juice. Bacterial adherence to mucosal surfaces is considered to be an important step in the development of urinary tract infection (<xref rid="bib593" ref-type="bibr">Reid, 1987</xref>). It is facilitated by fimbriae on the bacterial cell wall, which produce adhesins that attach to specific receptors on uroepithelial cells (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Beachey, 1981</xref>). Proanthocyanidins extracted from cranberries have been shown to inhibit the adherence of P-fimbriated <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to uroepithelial cell surfaces, suggesting that proanthocyanidins may be important for the stated effects of cranberry in urinary tract infection (Howell, 1998).

The antiseptic and diuretic properties claimed for uva ursi can be attributed to its hydroquinone derivatives, especially the constituent arbutin. Arbutin is absorbed intact from the gastrointestinal tract and during renal excretion is hydrolyzed to yield the active principle, hydroquinone, which exerts antiseptic and astringent actions on the urinary mucous membranes (<xref rid="bib482" ref-type="bibr">Matsuda, 1992b</xref>). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, 57 women with more than three episodes of cystitis in the previous year received herbal extract or placebo. The herbal medicine consisted of bearberry and dandelion root and leaf.

No adverse effects were reported (<xref rid="bib413" ref-type="bibr">Larsson, 1993</xref>). It should be noted that alkaline urine is necessary for arbutin to work.
