The production of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>armatum</italic> is currently a billions of dollars commercially, and this species has a long history of cultivation in China because it is one of the eight main spices used in Chinese cuisine and is an essential ingredient in Sichuan hot-pot, with a special numbing taste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of the genes associated with the numbing taste remains poorly understood. <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>armatum</italic> is also an important medicinal plant prioritized by the governments of some countries for economic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Its fruit berries can be used for the treatment of abdominal pain, rheumatism, and skin diseases, and as a carminative and antispasmodic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The seeds are employed as an aromatic tonic for conditions such as fever, dyspepsia, toothache, and stomach ache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, the elucidation of the keygenes associated with numbing taste biosynthesis pathways, especially those responsible for the accumulation of the main compounds involved, is critical for revealing genetic information for this species and breeding high-quality <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>armatum</italic> germplasms.</p><p id="Par34">In previous studies, the numbing taste was found to be associated with the presence of volatile oils, alkaloids, coumarins, acid amide phenol components and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which accumulate at high levels in the fruits, leaves, stems, and roots of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>armatum</italic>, especially in the pericarps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. More than 140 components related to aromatic compounds and fatty acid biosynthesis have been gradually identified in different tissues of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>armatum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Various terpenoid substances are among the main components associated with the numbing taste of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>armatum</italic>, including linalool (29.30%), limonene (14.30%), myrcene (6.02%), cineole (1.32%) and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Terpenoids are a large category of necessary secondary metabolites in plants, includingmonoterpenes, diterpenes, sesquiterpenes, triterpenoids and other terpenoid-quinone compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. All of these downstream products accumulate from the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway. The five key enzymes, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase 2 (ACAT2), hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS), hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), mevalonate kinase (MVK), and diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase (MVD) are required for the only pathway producing isopentenyl-<italic>PP</italic> upstream of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Subsequently, the production of dimethylallyl-<italic>PP</italic> from isopentenyl-<italic>PP</italic> can be catalysed by isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase (IDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, dimethylallyl-<italic>PP</italic> can be produced via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Next, isopentenyl-<italic>PP</italic> and dimethylallyl-<italic>PP</italic> are transformed into farnesyl-<italic>PP</italic> and geranyl-geranyl-<italic>PP</italic>, which are then used to produce various terpenoids, catalysed by different diphosphate synthases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Fatty acids are also important productsfound in the fruit of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>armatum</italic>. Abundant unsaturated fatty acids have been detected in the seeds of <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> (approximately 25%), among which linolenic acid, linoleic acid and oleic acid account for 78.63% (mass percentage) of the total, while the main saturated fatty acid is hexadecanoic acid (13.18%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The production of fatty acids is involved in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation and degradation pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathways, acetyl-CoA is produced and used to form malonyl-ACP, catalysed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and malonyl-transferase (MCMT). Subsequently, malonyl-ACP can be converted to a long-chain acyl-ACP catalysed by several enzymes with an acyl carrier protein (ACP) as a co-factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Three main enzymes that play an important role during this series of reactions include ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (KASII), ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (KASI), and oxoacyl-acyl-carrier protein reductase (FabG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, ACP desaturase 5 (AAD5), also known asstearoyl-ACP desaturase (SAD), removes two hydrogen atoms from stearic acid to form oleic acid in unsaturated fatty acid production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Finally, <italic>N</italic>-acyl-ACP (C8 to C18) is hydrolysed to release free fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus far, many studies on <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> have mainly dealt with plant breeding, physiological investigations, tissue culture and chemical component identification and extraction in the fruits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A recent study identified the key genes in the synthesis pathway of volatile terpenoids in the fruit of <italic>Zanthoxylum bungeanum</italic> (red Sichuan pepper) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the crucial genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoid compounds and fatty acids have not been reported in <italic>Z. armatum</italic>.</p><p id="Par35">Comparative transcriptome analysis is an important method for rapidly obtaining a large amount of genetic information and putative candidate genes related to target traits by examining different tissue samples. Although transcriptome sequencing analyses have rarely been reported in <italic>Z. armatum</italic>, they have been conducted frequently in other tree species. The de novo transcriptome sequencing of eight major organs of <italic>Plukenetia volubilis</italic> was performed to identify candidate genes involved in &#x003b1;-linolenic acid metabolism, thereby expanding the genetic information available for functional genome studies of <italic>P. volubilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Through the transcriptome sequencing analysis of roots, stems, leaves, arils and kernel samples of two <italic>Torreya grandis</italic> cultivars, six candidate unigenes encoding sciadonic acid elongase and desaturases were identified to improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in gymnosperm species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] conducted a detailed transcriptional sequencing analysis of two orange varieties at different fruit development stages to elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanism of sucrose and citrate accumulation in the ripening of the fruits, especially during the fruit delayed-harvest stage. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] explored the key regulatory factors involved in starch and sucrose metabolism in <italic>Castanea mollissima</italic> via transcriptome sequencing of seeds at various developmental stages. However, only a single study has reported transcriptome profiles obtained using a mixture of the leaves and inflorescences of <italic>Z. armatum</italic> to isolate the viruses associated with flower yellowing disease in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">In the present study, the de novo transcriptome sequencing of five major organs was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. The key candidate genes associated with terpenoid compounds and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism were identified from the RNA-seq dataset in <italic>Z. armatum</italic>. Furthermore, samples from different stages in the fruit development and maturation process were selected to identify the expression patterns of the key candidate genes through qRT-PCR analysis. To the best of our knowledge, ours is first comprehensive analysis to reveal the genes underlying the special numbing taste of <italic>Z. armatum</italic>. The assembled transcriptome profiles expand the available genetic information for <italic>Z. armatum</italic> and provide an improved understanding for gene function studies, which will aid in the engineering of high-quality varieties of <italic>Z. armatum</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly of <italic>Z. armatum</italic></title><p id="Par37">The total RNA of five major sample types, including roots (Ro), stems (St), leaf buds (LB), mature leaves (ML) and fruits (Fr), was isolated to construct the comprehensive transcriptome of <italic>Z. armatum</italic>. The quality of the RNA was determined using the OD260/OD280 ratio (1.88&#x02013;2.21) and RIN (7.60&#x02013;10.00) (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). A total of 126.89&#x02009;G of paired-end raw reads were produced by transcriptome sequencing. After trimming adapters and low-quality bases, 7.92&#x02013;9.91&#x02009;G of clean bases were produced from 15 cDNA libraries in this study (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2). The error rate of RNA-seq was only approximately 0.02%, all of the Q30 values were greater than 93.90%, and the GC content was above 43% in each sample. In addition, an assembly of 350,625 transcripts was achieved, with a mean length of 1219&#x02009;bp for the <italic>Z. armatum</italic> transcriptome (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1a).

The length of the unigenes ranged from 301 to 17,299&#x02009;bp, with an average of 1014&#x02009;bp, and the lengths of more than half of the unigenes in the total assembly were greater than 1454&#x02009;bp (<italic>N</italic>50&#x02009;=&#x02009;1454).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Identification of simple sequence repeats</title><p id="Par38">In recent years, various molecular markers have been widely developed in different plants to construct plant genetic maps, perform gene localization, determine hybrid purity, and examine other aspects. To obtain abundant molecular markers for the genetic analysis and marker-assisted selection breeding of <italic>Z. armatum</italic>, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified in our transcriptome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

A total of 46,098 SSR loci were characterized, among which mononucleotide repeats were the most abundant (30,266, 65.66%), followed by dinucleotides (8528, 18.50%). Moreover, at least 9&#x02013;12 repeats were detected among the monomer nucleotide SSRs. However, di- to hexanucleotide SSRs were explored mostly in the context of 5 to 8 repeats.

Four unigenes were annotated to <italic>FabG</italic> in the KEGG pathways, which can reduce 3-Oxo-<italic>N</italic>-ACP to form 3-hydroxy-<italic>N</italic>-ACP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, the genetic information and gene names of these unigenes were not annotated in the TAIR10 database. The family members of <italic>AAD5</italic>are responsible for long-chain unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and are predominantly expressed throughout seed developmental stages. The <italic>aad5</italic> mutation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> can cause a significant reduction in the concentration of C18:1 fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The present study showed that <italic>ZaKASII</italic> was significantly upregulated in the Fr4 stage, whereas both <italic>ZaAAD5</italic> genes were exclusively upregulated in the Fr6 stage. Additionally, <italic>ZaFabG</italic> showed two expression peaks, not only being upregulated in the Fr4 stage but also showing high expression in the Fr6-Fr8 stages. DEGs related to the fatty acid degradation pathway were also identified in fruit development and maturation stages, including <italic>ZaLACS</italic>, <italic>ZaACX3</italic>, <italic>ZaKATII</italic> and <italic>ZaACAT2</italic>. Multiple studies have explored the genetic functions of these genes involved in fatty acid accumulation and degradation in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and other plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>ACAT2</italic> is typically related to terpenoid biosynthesis in the mevalonate pathway, where it can reversibly catalyse formation of acetyl-CoA from acetoacetyl-CoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is worth noting that almost all of these genes exhibited two upregulation peaks in the Fr4 and Fr6 stages, except for <italic>ZaLACS1,</italic> which was only very significantly upregulated in the Fr4 stage. These results were consistent with the expression patterns of the genes in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways detected in this study (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In a previous study, genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis were grouped into two categories and detected in the early or later stages of seed development in tree peony [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Similarly, the coordinated regulation of multiple genes has been shown to promote the high accumulation of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids in the seeds of tea oil camellia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and consistent results have been obtained in <italic>Brassica napus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], <italic>Glycine max</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], and <italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Above all, the present results indicated that 40 days after fertilization could be a key point at which the first few steps of fatty acid biosynthesis are promoted in <italic>Z. armatum</italic>, and the subsequent reactions could be catalysed and completed in the stage occurring 62 days after fertilization, especially for long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis.</p><p id="Par56">The present study only investigated the expression patterns of certain crucial candidate genes involved in terpenoid compound and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism. Further study could focus on identifying the relative expression levels of more genes related to the pathways of alkaloids, coumarins, acid amide phenol components and so on from the present transcriptome dataset. Additionally, a further study could be devoted to confirming the molecular functions of these genes via the overexpression of the genes driven by the 35S promoter and/or their silencing by hairpin RNAs in transgenic <italic>Z. armatum</italic> plants, which might reveal more genetic information underlying the regulatory mechanism associated with the special aromatic taste of <italic>Z. armatum</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par57">The present study achieved de novo transcriptome assembly for five major organs in <italic>Z. armatum</italic>. A total of 111,318 nonredundant unigenes were generated, with an average length of 1014&#x02009;bp, 73,426 of which could be functionally annotated in at least one database. Additionally, a large number of SSRs were obtained to improve our understanding of the phylogeny and genetics of some important traits of <italic>Z. armatum</italic>. The organ-specific unigenes of the five major samples were screened and annotated via GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. Additionally, 1876 unigenes were found to be exclusively up- or downregulated in fruit samples, 53 of which were identified as candidate unigenes for 12 enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, 34 of which were significantly annotated to fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation and degradation pathways. Furthermore, qRT-PCR detection was conducted in eight fruit development and maturation stages. Forty days after fertilization could be a crucial period for the initiation of the biosynthesis of terpenoid compounds and their accumulation in the fruit development and maturation process of <italic>Z. armatum</italic>. However, the Fr4 stage could be a key point at which the upstream steps of fatty acid biosynthesis are promoted in <italic>Z. armatum</italic>, and the subsequent reactions could be significantly activated in the Fr6 stage, especially long-chain unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis.</p><p id="Par58">The present dataset provides a reference transcriptome for the genomic database of <italic>Z. armatum</italic> for future studies.
