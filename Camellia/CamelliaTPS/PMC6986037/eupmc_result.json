However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of the numbing taste remains poorly understood. Thus, the elucidation of the key genes associated with numbing taste biosynthesis pathways is critical for providing genetic information on Z. armatumand the breeding of high-quality germplasms of this species. RESULTS:Here, de novo transcriptome assembly was performed for the five major organs of Z. armatum, including the roots, stems, leaf buds, mature leaves and fruits. A total of 111,318 unigenes were generated with an average length of 1014\u2009bp. Additionally, a large number of SSRs were obtained to improve our understanding of the phylogeny and genetics of Z. armatum. The organ-specific unigenes of the five major samples were screened and annotated via GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. A total of 53 and 34 unigenes that were exclusively upregulated in fruit samples were identified as candidate unigenes for terpenoid biosynthesis or fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation and degradation pathways, respectively. Moreover, 40 days after fertilization (Fr4 stage) could be an important period for the accumulation of terpenoid compounds during the fruit development and maturation of Z. armatum. The Fr4 stage could be a key point at which the first few steps of the fatty acid biosynthesis process are promoted, and the catalysis of subsequent reactions could be significantly induced at 62 days after fertilization (Fr6 stage). CONCLUSIONS:The present study realized de novo transcriptome assembly for the five major organs of Z. armatum. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive analysis revealing the genes underlying the special numbing taste of Z. armatum. The assembled transcriptome profiles expand the available genetic information on this species and will contribute to gene functional studies, which will aid in the engineering of high-quality cultivars of Z. armatum.", "affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Ecological Forestry Engineering of Sichuan Province, College of Forestry, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "2018YFD1000605", "agency": "the National Key Research and Development Program of China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "2016NYZ0035", "agency": "the Forest and Bamboo Breeding Project of Sichuan Province for the Fifth Year Plan", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Zanthoxylum", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Terpenes", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Fatty Acids", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Computational Biology", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "MT", "qualifierName": "methods", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Organ Specificity"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Microsatellite Repeats"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Annotation"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Transcriptome"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Aromatic compounds", "Fatty acid", "Zanthoxylum Armatum", "De Novo Transcriptome"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": [{"name": "Fatty Acids", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "Terpenes", "registryNumber": "0"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-6521-4"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6986037"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6986037?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "Y", "dbCrossReferenceList": {"dbName": "EMBL"}, "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2020-09-28", "dateOfCreation": "2020-01-30", "firstIndexDate": "2020-01-30", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-09", "dateOfRevision": "2020-09-28", "electronicPublicationDate": "2020-01-28", "firstPublicationDate": "2020-01-28"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6986037", "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Zanthoxylum armatum (Z. armatum) is a highly economically important tree that presents a special numbing taste.
