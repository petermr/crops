The UV spectrum of solar radiation is by convention divided into three parts: UV-A: 310\u2013400 nm, UV-B: 280\u2013310 nm and UV-C: less than 280 nm. UV-B is the most energetic component reaching Earth surface because the stratospheric ozone layer effectively absorbs completely wavelengths below 290 nm. UV-B is an increasing threat due to increasing UV-B levels on Earth surface as a consequence of depletion of stratospheric O3. In general, the effects of atmospheric UV-B radiation are negative for biological life. Enhanced levels of UV-B radiation can indeed negatively change plant physiological processes, growth and productivity. However, while studying UV-B effects on medicinal plants, some interesting phenomena have been discovered. For example, basil plants respond positively to UV-B radiation by increasing oil yield (Chang et al. J Horticult For 1:27\u201331, 2009). In other studies medicinal plants show beneficial aspects in term of increase in volatile oil yield and secondary metabolite production (Kumari et al. Ecotoxicol Environ Safety 72:2013\u20132019, 2009c, 2010). Medicinal herbs have great market value in India and worldwide. The medicinal value of plants depends upon phenolics, antioxidants and volatile yield. Therefore further UV-B experiments increasing the levels of these compounds are needed. Here we review the effect of UV-B exposure on metabolites, volatiles, and antioxidants potential in medicinal plants.
