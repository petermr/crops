<italic>Osmanthus fragrans</italic> Lour., one of the most popular ornamental plants in China, is particularly appreciated for its unique and pleasant aroma (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). The aroma compounds in flowers not only play important roles in attracting pollinators and promoting defense, but also largely determine the commercial value of the flowers. The <italic>O. fragrans</italic> flowers are widely utilized as ingredients in tea, food, wine, and cosmetic products due to the strong aroma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">
<bold>Figure S8D</bold>
</xref>). Aroma compounds have been extensively studied for decades. More than 70 volatiles have been identified to date, including terpenoids, benzenoids and their derivatives, and esters (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). Among all the volatiles, aroma-active compounds are the essential contributors to the olfactory features of flowers. Previous studies have shown that terpenoids, such as linalool, ionone, ocimene, and their derivatives are the key characteristic aroma-active compounds in both natural fresh flowers and in artificial industrial products (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). Ionone and its derivatives are abundantly accumulated only in some cultivars of <italic>O. fragrans</italic> flowers (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>); while &#x003b2;-Ocimene is widely present in fresh flowers it is rarely detected in flower products. However, linalool and its oxides account for a large proportion of aroma-active compounds in all <italic>O. fragrans</italic> cultivars. In addition, they impart floral and citrus notes to the flowers and corresponding products. Therefore, they are identified as the principle desirable aroma compounds (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Linalool, as a typical monoterpene, is derived from the plastidial 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Jozwiak et al., 2017</xref>) and undergoes a cascade of oxidation, cyclization, acylation, hydroxylation, and/or methylation reactions to produce a variety of oxides, alcohols, and ketones (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Boachon et al., 2015</xref>). A fraction of volatile aroma compounds is released, while the rest are stored as free components or are further transformed into glycosylated conjugates (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Lucker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Friedericke et al., 2014a</xref>). Glycosylated conjugates are generally more abundant than volatile and free aglycones in many fruits, and they tend to be liberated during product processing, making them potential contributors to aroma quality (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Tina et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated a ripening-related pattern of glycoside accumulation in some fruits and flowers (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yar-Khing et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;;Onofrio et al., 2017</xref>). Our previous study revealed that in <italic>O. fragrans</italic> flowers, the emission of volatile linalool and its oxides increased significantly from the initial to full blossoming stage, followed by a subsequent decrease at the late blossoming stage. However, the accumulation of free and glycosylated conjugates did not follow this pattern. Glycosylated 8-hydroxylinalool and linalool oxide showed continuous increase throughout the whole blossoming stage, and more than 75% of non-volatile linalool derivatives were converted into glycosides at the late blossoming stage (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that there were common mechanisms for the glycosylation of aroma compounds (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yar-Khing et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Glycosylation reactions are central to numerous biological processes. In general, glycosylation involves sugar polymerization or sugar conjunction with other biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and other small molecules (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et al., 2016</xref>). The addition of sugar donors to these aglycones can change their solubility, chemical properties, compartmentation, biological activity, and membrane transportation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Yonekura-Sakakibara and Hanada, 2001</xref>). Uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases (UGTs, EC 2.4.x.y) are the key enzymes catalyzing glycosylation, and they are widely present in plants (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2018</xref>). All known UGT enzymes contain a universal motif of 44 amino acids (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Caputil et al., 2012</xref>). They can utilize a variety of sugar donors including UDP-glucose, UDP-xylose, UDP-rhamnose, and UDP-galactose. However, UGTs often show a preference for specific sugar donors (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Shoji et al., 2015</xref>). Although the UGTs could catalyze the reactions between sugar donors and a wide range of substrates, the terpenoid UGT sequences are comparatively conserved. For example, AdGT4 from grape (<italic>Vitis vinefera</italic>), which catalyzes terpenes and primary alcohols, shows high amino acid homology to the iridoid-specific UGT85A42 from <italic>Gardenia jasminoides</italic> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Nagatoshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yar-Khing et al., 2014</xref>) and a cyanohydrin mandelonitrile-specific UGT85A19 from <italic>Prunus dulcis</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Franks et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, an effective strategy to identify candidate terpenoid UGT genes is to compare the current transcriptome profiling with the known UGT sequences in arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>), grape (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>), tea (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>), kiwi (<italic>Actinidia deliciosa</italic>), and other plants (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Yar-Khing et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Friedericke et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Shoji et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we conducted the transcriptome sequencing and identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in four blossoming stages of <italic>O. fragrans</italic> flowers to select putative <italic>OfUGT</italic> genes involved in the glycosylation of linalool and its oxides. We also investigated possible relations between gene expression and aroma compound glycosylation. The candidate <italic>OfUGT</italic> gene was subjected to further functional characterization. Previous studies of UGTs mainly focused on fruits and leaves respectively used for wine and tea. Flowers have become important ingredients in food and health industries. However, the mechanism underlying aroma compound glycosylation in flowers remains unclear. Our findings elucidate the glycosylation of crucial aroma compounds in flowers. This study provides new information for improving aroma quality in ornamental plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Plant Materials</title><p>
<italic>O. fragrans</italic> &#x02018;Liuye Jingui&#x02019; was cultivated on the campus of Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, China. Flowers were all harvested at 09:00 in October. The blossoming stage of a single flower lasts for approximate 7 days and is divided into four stages: bud, initial blossoming stage, full blossoming stage, and late blossoming stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">

The duration of the full blossoming stage was relatively stable and the flowers from this stage were collected at 06:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 00:00 h for 3 successive days for analysis of <italic>OfUGT</italic> expression.

Ltd (Beijing) for transcriptome sequencing. 1.5 &#x000b5;g RNA per sample was used as input material. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra&#x02122; RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (NEB, USA) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendation, and index codes were added to distinguish sequences from each sample. The library quality was assessed in the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed in a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumia) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction. The clusters were sequenced on an Illumina Hi-seq platform and paired-end reads were generated. A total of approximately 50 million raw reads were sequenced in the library. After the removal of the reads with adapters, poly-N, low-quality reads, and clean reads were obtained for further analysis (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>). The base error rate was 0.01%&#x02013;0.02% and the average Q20 and Q30 were higher than 97% and 92%, respectively. In addition, the average GC content was higher than 43%, suggesting that this Illumina sequencing was of high quality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">

After incubation of the mixture at 37&#x000b0;C for 16 h, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 &#x000b5;l of 24% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Except for the concentrations of substrates, the same assay conditions were used for measuring the UGT85A84 kinetic parameters. To determine the kinetic parameters of linalool and linalool oxide, the concentration of aglycones was set within the range from 5 &#x000b5;M to 50 mM (linalool) or to 5mM (linalool oxide), with a constant UDP-glucose concentration of 0.5 mM. To determine the kinetic parameters of UDP-glucose, UDP-glucose concentration was set from 25 &#x000b5;M to 10 mM with a constant linalool or linalool oxide concentration of 0.5 mM.

Although the odorless non-volatile forms are less concerned compared to the volatiles, the glycosylation of aroma compounds impact the flowers in at least two significant ways. On the one hand, it reduces the abundance of volatiles, resulting in the decreased aroma of fresh flowers; on the other hand, the glycosides can be hydrolyzed during industrial processing, thereby enhancing the aroma of products (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2018</xref>). For example, the glycosylated terpenoids in tomato paste are hydrolyzed into their volatile forms during processing and the corresponding volatiles confer a strong aroma (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Simona et al., 2009</xref>). For another example, most terpenoids are conjugated to sugars in aromatic grapevines and can be a potential source of wine aroma (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">B&#x000f6;nisch et al., 2014</xref>). The predominant volatile aromatic compounds in oolong tea (<italic>C. sinensis</italic>), including linalool, geraniol, and 2-phenylethanol, can only be artificially released during full fermentation because these aroma compounds typically accumulate in the form of water-soluble glycosides in fresh tea leaves (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Shoji et al., 2015</xref>).

</xref>). For example, VvGT15b showed significantly higher affinity than other VvUGTs towards terpenoids in grape (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Friedericke et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Friedericke et al., 2014b</xref>). In this study, the <italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub> values of UGT85A84 for linalool and linalool oxide was 135.71&#x000b5;M and 202.36&#x000b5;M, respectively, indicating that UGT85A84 had higher activity towards linalool than linalool oxide. However, UGT85A84 showed better affinity compared to PpUGT85A2 in peach (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although its glycosylation function was confirmed, <italic>UGT85A84</italic> transcript levels did not exhibit synergistic change with the glycoside accumulation patterns during flowering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM9">
<bold>Figure S8A</bold>
</xref>). This inconsistency may be explained as follows: firstly, UGT enzymes could catalyze a broad range of substrates (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Friedericke et al., 2014b</xref>). For example, CsGT1 from <italic>C. sinensis</italic> is active towards a variety of substrates, including geraniol (100%), eugenol (84%), (Z)-3-hexenol (62%), benzyl alcohol (48%), 2-PE (9.2%), and linalool (1.4%) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Shoji et al., 2015</xref>). Secondly, due to the high stability derived from sugar conjugation, glycosylated terpenoids are less likely to undergo further modifications, thus they are prone to accumulation regardless of the variation of UGTs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Friedericke et al., 2014a</xref>). Thirdly, the transcripts of UGTs might accumulate before enzyme accumulation, thereby leading to nonsynchronous changes between transcript level and glycoside content. Moreover, MEP pathway genes and linalool synthase genes are important for linalool formation and conversion. The expression of upstream MEP pathway genes showed a significant increase from the initial to the full blossoming stage, which was consistent with the rapid increase in glycosides of linalool and its oxides. In addition, OfLIS1 and OfLIS2, which directly catalyzed the formation of linalool, exhibited high transcript levels at the late blossoming stage, suggesting they might facilitate the formation of corresponding glycosides (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, transcriptional control and posttranslational modification may lead to the lack of close correlation between the glycoside levels and the expression of <italic>UGT85A84</italic>, as has been reported for other flowers and fruits. For example, in the grape berry exocarp, the amount of geranyl and neryl glycosides were reported to increase continuously from week 6 to week 17, whereas the mRNA levels of <italic>VvGT7</italic> fluctuated with two peaks during development (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Friedericke et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Linalool and its oxides are essential characteristic aroma-active compounds in <italic>O. fragrans</italic> flowers, which are often glycosylated by UGTs and continuously accumulated during blossoming. This conversion not only directly reduces their emission, but also leads to the storage of glycosylated terpenoids as potential contributors to the aroma of industrial products. This study demonstrated that UGT85A84 is capable of glycosylating linalool and its oxides both <italic>in planta</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> with UDP-Glc as the specific sugar donor. Although previous studies have unraveled some terpenoid UGTs responsible for fruit and tea leave aroma (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2018</xref>), little has been known about the important role of UGTs in regulating the aroma qualities of ornamental flowers that were widely applied in industry. Our findings provide an insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the glycosylation of aroma compounds in flowers and offer new information for manipulating the aroma quality of flowers in future.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets supporting the conclusions of this study can be found in NCBI using accession number PRJNA564449 (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA564449">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA564449</uri>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>RZ and CW conceived and designed the research.
