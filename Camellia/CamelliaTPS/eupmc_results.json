The whole-organism reconfiguration of aroma formation from the precursor to storage is poorly understood. In this study, we performed iTRAQ proteomic analysis and identified 337, 246, and 413 differentially expressed proteins in tea leaves primed with MeJA for 12\u2009h, 24\u2009h, and 48\u2009h, respectively. Furthermore, a total of 266 nonvolatile and 100 volatile differential metabolites were identified by utilizing MS-based metabolomics. A novel approach that incorporated the integration of extended self-organizing map-based dimensionality was applied. The vivid time-scale changes tracing physiological responses in MeJA-primed tea leaves are marked in these maps. Jasmonates responded quickly to the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway in tea leaves, while hydroxyl and glycosyl jasmonates were biosynthesized simultaneously on a massive scale to compensate for the exhausted defense. The levels of \u03b1-linolenic acid, geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and phenylalanine, which are crucial aroma precursors, were found to be significantly changed in MeJA-primed tea leaves.

The whole-organism reconfiguration of aroma formation from the precursor to storage is poorly understood. In this study, we performed iTRAQ proteomic analysis and identified 337, 246, and 413 differentially expressed proteins in tea leaves primed with MeJA for 12\u2009h, 24\u2009h, and 48\u2009h, respectively. Furthermore, a total of 266 nonvolatile and 100 volatile differential metabolites were identified by utilizing MS-based metabolomics. A novel approach that incorporated the integration of extended self-organizing map-based dimensionality was applied. The vivid time-scale changes tracing physiological responses in MeJA-primed tea leaves are marked in these maps. Jasmonates responded quickly to the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway in tea leaves, while hydroxyl and glycosyl jasmonates were biosynthesized simultaneously on a massive scale to compensate for the exhausted defense. The levels of \u03b1-linolenic acid, geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and phenylalanine, which are crucial aroma precursors, were found to be significantly changed in MeJA-primed tea leaves. Green leaf volatiles, volatile terpenoids, and volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids were spontaneously biosynthesized from responding precursors and subsequently converted to their corresponding glycosidic forms, which can be stably stored in tea leaves. This study elucidated the physiological response of tea leaves primed with exogenous methyl jasmonate and revealed the molecular basis of source and sink changes on tea aroma biosynthesis and catabolism in response to exogenous stimuli.

plant volatiles (HIPVs) play important ecological roles in defense against stresses. In contrast to model plants, reports on HIPV formation and function in crops are limited. Tea (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>) is an important crop in China. \u03b1-Farnesene is a common HIPV produced in tea plants in response to different herbivore attacks. In this study, a <i>C. sinensis</i> \u03b1-farnesene synthase (CsAFS) was isolated, cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized. The CsAFS recombinant protein produced in <i>Escherichia coli</i> was able to transform farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into \u03b1-farnesene and also convert geranyl diphosphate (GPP) to \u03b2-ocimene <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, transient expression analysis in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> plants indicated that CsAFS was located in the cytoplasm and could convert FPP to \u03b1-farnesene in plants. Wounding, to simulate herbivore damage, activated jasmonic acid (JA) formation, which significantly enhanced the <i>CsAFS</i> expression level and \u03b1-farnesene content.

In contrast to model plants, reports on HIPV formation and function in crops are limited. Tea (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>) is an important crop in China. \u03b1-Farnesene is a common HIPV produced in tea plants in response to different herbivore attacks. In this study, a <i>C. sinensis</i> \u03b1-farnesene synthase (CsAFS) was isolated, cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized. The CsAFS recombinant protein produced in <i>Escherichia coli</i> was able to transform farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into \u03b1-farnesene and also convert geranyl diphosphate (GPP) to \u03b2-ocimene <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, transient expression analysis in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> plants indicated that CsAFS was located in the cytoplasm and could convert FPP to \u03b1-farnesene in plants. Wounding, to simulate herbivore damage, activated jasmonic acid (JA) formation, which significantly enhanced the <i>CsAFS</i> expression level and \u03b1-farnesene content. This suggested that herbivore-derived wounding induced \u03b1-farnesene formation in tea leaves.

ornamental plant, has evolved unique fragrant aroma and winter-flowering properties, which are critical for its successful sexual reproduction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these traits are largely unknown in this species. In addition, wintersweet is also a typical representative species of the magnoliids, where the phylogenetic position of which relative to eudicots and monocots has not been conclusively resolved.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a chromosome-level wintersweet genome assembly with a total size of 695.36\u2009Mb and a draft genome assembly of Calycanthus chinensis. Phylogenetic analyses of 17 representative angiosperm genomes suggest that Magnoliids and eudicots are sister to monocots.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these traits are largely unknown in this species. In addition, wintersweet is also a typical representative species of the magnoliids, where the phylogenetic position of which relative to eudicots and monocots has not been conclusively resolved.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a chromosome-level wintersweet genome assembly with a total size of 695.36\u2009Mb and a draft genome assembly of Calycanthus chinensis. Phylogenetic analyses of 17 representative angiosperm genomes suggest that Magnoliids and eudicots are sister to monocots. Whole-genome duplication signatures reveal two major duplication events in the evolutionary history of the wintersweet genome, with an ancient one shared by Laurales, and a more recent one shared by the Calycantaceae.

Our study also shows that any increases in leafhopper density associated with climate warming, could have dramatic effects on secondary metabolites and tea quality.", "Keywords": ["Secondary metabolites", "Camellia sinensis", "Catechins", "herbivory", "Induced Responses", "Crop Quality", "Plant Vocs", "Empoasca Onukii"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7272924?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Frontiers in plant science", "authorinfo": ["Scott ER", "Li X", "Wei JP", "Kfoury N", "Morimoto J", "Guo MM", "Agyei A", "Robbat A Jr", "Ahmed S", "Cash SB", "Griffin TS", "Stepp JR", "Han WY", "Orians CM"], "title": "Changes in Tea Plant Secondary Metabolite Profiles as a Function of Leafhopper Density and Damage."}, "PMC6473938": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "30823447", "source": "MED", "pmid": "30823447", "pmcid": "PMC6473938", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6473938"}, "doi": "10.3390/plants8030053", "title": "Integrating Transcriptomic and GC-MS Metabolomic Analysis to Characterize Color and Aroma Formation during Tepal Development in Lycoris longituba.", "authorString": "Yue Y, Liu J, Shi T, Chen M, Li Y, Du J, Jiang H, Yang X, Hu H, Wang L.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Yue Y", "firstName": "Yuanzheng", "lastName": "Yue", "initials": "Y", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-2599-6900"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Landscape Architecture, Jiangsu Province, College of Landscape Architecture, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China. yueyuanzheng@njfu.edu.cn."}}}, {"fullName": "Liu J", "firstName": "Jiawei", "lastName": "Liu", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Landscape Architecture, Jiangsu Province, College of Landscape Architecture, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China. ljw040018@sina.com."}}}, {"fullName": "Shi T", "firstName": "Tingting", "lastName": "Shi", "initials": "T", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Landscape Architecture, Jiangsu Province, College of Landscape Architecture, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China. tingtingspx@163.com."}}}, {"fullName": "Chen M", "firstName": "Min", "lastName": "Chen", "initials": "M", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Landscape Architecture, Jiangsu Province, College of Landscape Architecture, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China. xiaoximao2009@sina.com."}}}, {"fullName": "Li Y", "firstName": "Ya", "lastName": "Li", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Landscape Architecture, Jiangsu Province, College of Landscape Architecture, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China.

O. Kuntze] can produce one of the three most widely popular non-alcoholic beverages throughout the world. Polyphenols and volatiles are the main functional ingredients determining tea's quality and flavor; however, the biotic or abiotic factors affecting tea polyphenol biosynthesis are unclear. This paper focuses on the molecular mechanisms of sucrose on polyphenol biosynthesis and volatile composition variation in tea plants.<h4>Results</h4>Metabolic analysis showed that the total content of anthocyanins, catechins, and proanthocyanidins(PAs) increased with sucrose, and they accumulated most significantly after 14\u00a0days of treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 8384 and 5571 differentially expressed genes in 2-day and 14-day sucrose-treated tea plants compared with control-treated plants. Most of the structural genes and transcription factors (TFs) involved in polyphenol biosynthesis were significantly up-regulated after 2d. Among these transcripts, the predicted genes encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST), ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters), and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporters (MATE transporters) appeared up regulated. Correspondingly, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS) analysis revealed that the content of non-galloylated catechins and oligomeric PAs decreased in the upper-stem and increased in the lower-stem significantly, especially catechin (C), epicatechin (EC), and their oligomeric PAs.

O. Kuntze] can produce one of the three most widely popular non-alcoholic beverages throughout the world. Polyphenols and volatiles are the main functional ingredients determining tea's quality and flavor; however, the biotic or abiotic factors affecting tea polyphenol biosynthesis are unclear. This paper focuses on the molecular mechanisms of sucrose on polyphenol biosynthesis and volatile composition variation in tea plants.<h4>Results</h4>Metabolic analysis showed that the total content of anthocyanins, catechins, and proanthocyanidins(PAs) increased with sucrose, and they accumulated most significantly after 14\u00a0days of treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 8384 and 5571 differentially expressed genes in 2-day and 14-day sucrose-treated tea plants compared with control-treated plants. Most of the structural genes and transcription factors (TFs) involved in polyphenol biosynthesis were significantly up-regulated after 2d. Among these transcripts, the predicted genes encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST), ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters), and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporters (MATE transporters) appeared up regulated. Correspondingly, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS) analysis revealed that the content of non-galloylated catechins and oligomeric PAs decreased in the upper-stem and increased in the lower-stem significantly, especially catechin (C), epicatechin (EC), and their oligomeric PAs. This result suggests that the related flavonoids were transported downward in the stem by transporters. GC/MS data implied that four types of volatile compounds, namely terpene derivatives, aromatic derivatives, lipid derivatives, and others, were accumulated differently after in vitro sucrose treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data demonstrated that sucrose regulates polyphenol biosynthesis in Camellia sinensis by altering the expression of transcription factor genes and pathway genes.

The combined data analyses from the transcriptome and metabolome provide new insights into our understanding of the complex metabolic genes in terpenoid-rich blue anise sage, and our study paves the way for the future metabolic engineering of the biosynthesis of useful terpene compounds in S. guaranitica.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6289780?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "DNA research : an international journal for rapid publication of reports on genes and genomes", "authorinfo": ["Ali M", "Hussain RM", "Rehman NU", "She G", "Li P", "Wan X", "Guo L", "Zhao J"], "title": "De novo transcriptome sequencing and metabolite profiling analyses reveal the complex metabolic genes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis in Blue Anise Sage (Salvia guaranitica L.)."}, "PMC6902048": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31849999", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31849999", "pmcid": "PMC6902048", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6902048"}, "doi": "10.3389/fpls.2019.01376", "title": "UGT85A84 Catalyzes the Glycosylation of Aromatic Monoterpenes in <i>Osmanthus fragrans</i> Lour.

Although many plants produce huge amounts of isoprene, it is very difficult to obtain isoprene directly from plants because of its high volatility and increasing environmental regulations. Over the last decade, microorganisms have emerged as a promising alternative host for efficient and sustainable bioisoprene production. Isoprene synthase (IspS) has received much attention for the conversion of isoprene from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Herein, we isolated a highly expressible novel IspS gene from Metrosideros polymorpha (MpIspS), which was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, using a plant cDNA library and characterized its molecular and biochemical properties.<h4>Results</h4>The signal sequence deleted MpIspS was cloned and expressed in E. coli as a 65-kDa monomer. The maximal activity of the purified MpIspS was observed at pH\u00a06.0 and 55\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence of 5\u00a0mM Mn<sup>2+</sup>.

MpIspS was expressed along with the exogenous mevalonate pathway to produce isoprene in E. coli. The engineered cells produced isoprene concentrations of up to 23.3\u00a0mg/L using glycerol as the main carbon source.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MpIspS was expressed in large amounts in E. coli, which led to increased enzymatic activity and resulted in isoprene production in vivo.

However, little is known about the molecular and genetic resources of this long-lived conifer. Herein, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four organs of <i>P. chienii</i> using the PacBio Isoform Sequencing and Illumina RNA Sequencing platforms. Based on the PacBio Iso-Seq data, we obtained 44,896, 58,082, 50,485, and 67,638 full-length unigenes from the root, stem, leaf, and strobilus, respectively, with a mean length of 2692 bp, and a mean N50 length of 3010.75 bp. We then comprehensively annotated these unigenes. The number of organ-specific expressed unigenes ranged from 4393 in leaf to 9124 in strobilus, suggesting their special roles in physiological processes, organ development, and adaptability in the different four organs. A total of 16,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the four organs and clustered into six subclusters. The gene families related to biotic/abiotic factors, including the TPS, CYP450, and HSP families, were characterized. The expression levels of most DEGs in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and plant-pathogen interactions were higher in the root than in the three other organs, suggesting that root constitutes the main organ of defensive compound synthesis and accumulation and has a stronger ability to respond to stress. The sequences were analyzed to predict transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, and alternative splicing events. The expression levels of most DEGs of C2H2, C3H, bHLH, and bZIP families in the root and stem were higher than those in the leaf and strobilus, indicating that these TFs may play a crucial role in the survival of the root and stem. These results comprise the first comprehensive gene expression profiles obtained for different organs of <i>P. chienii</i>.

chienii</i>, a rare tertiary relict species with economic and ecological value, is a representative of the monotypic genus <i>Pseudotaxus</i> that is endemic to China. <i>P. chienii</i> can adapt well to habitat isolation and ecological heterogeneity under a variety of climate and soil conditions, and is able to survive in harsh environments. However, little is known about the molecular and genetic resources of this long-lived conifer. Herein, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four organs of <i>P. chienii</i> using the PacBio Isoform Sequencing and Illumina RNA Sequencing platforms. Based on the PacBio Iso-Seq data, we obtained 44,896, 58,082, 50,485, and 67,638 full-length unigenes from the root, stem, leaf, and strobilus, respectively, with a mean length of 2692 bp, and a mean N50 length of 3010.75 bp. We then comprehensively annotated these unigenes. The number of organ-specific expressed unigenes ranged from 4393 in leaf to 9124 in strobilus, suggesting their special roles in physiological processes, organ development, and adaptability in the different four organs. A total of 16,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the four organs and clustered into six subclusters. The gene families related to biotic/abiotic factors, including the TPS, CYP450, and HSP families, were characterized. The expression levels of most DEGs in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and plant-pathogen interactions were higher in the root than in the three other organs, suggesting that root constitutes the main organ of defensive compound synthesis and accumulation and has a stronger ability to respond to stress. The sequences were analyzed to predict transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, and alternative splicing events. The expression levels of most DEGs of C2H2, C3H, bHLH, and bZIP families in the root and stem were higher than those in the leaf and strobilus, indicating that these TFs may play a crucial role in the survival of the root and stem. These results comprise the first comprehensive gene expression profiles obtained for different organs of <i>P. chienii</i>. Our findings will facilitate further studies on the functional genomics, adaptive evolution, and phylogeny of <i>P. chienii</i>, and lay the foundation for the development of conservation strategies for this endangered conifer.", "Keywords": ["Pseudotaxus chienii", "Transcriptome", "Multiple Organs", "Plant\u2013pathogen Interactions", "Pacbio Iso-seq", "Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis Pathway"],

Thus, the elucidation of the key genes associated with numbing taste biosynthesis pathways is critical for providing genetic information on Z. armatumand the breeding of high-quality germplasms of this species. RESULTS:Here, de novo transcriptome assembly was performed for the five major organs of Z. armatum, including the roots, stems, leaf buds, mature leaves and fruits. A total of 111,318 unigenes were generated with an average length of 1014\u2009bp. Additionally, a large number of SSRs were obtained to improve our understanding of the phylogeny and genetics of Z. armatum. The organ-specific unigenes of the five major samples were screened and annotated via GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. A total of 53 and 34 unigenes that were exclusively upregulated in fruit samples were identified as candidate unigenes for terpenoid biosynthesis or fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation and degradation pathways, respectively. Moreover, 40 days after fertilization (Fr4 stage) could be an important period for the accumulation of terpenoid compounds during the fruit development and maturation of Z. armatum. The Fr4 stage could be a key point at which the first few steps of the fatty acid biosynthesis process are promoted, and the catalysis of subsequent reactions could be significantly induced at 62 days after fertilization (Fr6 stage). CONCLUSIONS:The present study realized de novo transcriptome assembly for the five major organs of Z. armatum. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive analysis revealing the genes underlying the special numbing taste of Z. armatum.

A total of 53 and 34 unigenes that were exclusively upregulated in fruit samples were identified as candidate unigenes for terpenoid biosynthesis or fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation and degradation pathways, respectively. Moreover, 40 days after fertilization (Fr4 stage) could be an important period for the accumulation of terpenoid compounds during the fruit development and maturation of Z. armatum. The Fr4 stage could be a key point at which the first few steps of the fatty acid biosynthesis process are promoted, and the catalysis of subsequent reactions could be significantly induced at 62 days after fertilization (Fr6 stage). CONCLUSIONS:The present study realized de novo transcriptome assembly for the five major organs of Z. armatum. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive analysis revealing the genes underlying the special numbing taste of Z. armatum. The assembled transcriptome profiles expand the available genetic information on this species and will contribute to gene functional studies, which will aid in the engineering of high-quality cultivars of Z. armatum.", "Keywords": ["Aromatic compounds", "Fatty acid", "Zanthoxylum Armatum", "De Novo Transcriptome"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6986037?pdf=render",

Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which acts as an effective elicitor among the plant kingdom, could mostly improve the quality of tea aroma by promoting flavor volatiles in tea leaves. Although a variety of volatile secondary metabolites that contribute to aroma quality have been identified, our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of these compounds has remained largely incomplete. Therefore, information aboaut the transcriptome of tea leaves and, specifically, details of any changes in gene expression in response to MeJA, is required for a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of MeJA-mediated volatiles biosynthesis. Moreover, MeJA treatment could exaggerate the responses of secondary metabolites and some gene expression which offer a better chance to figure out the mechanism.<h4>Results</h4>The results of two-dimensional gas-chromatograph mass-spectrometry showed that the terpenoids content in MeJA-treated tea leaves increased, especially linalool, geraniol, and phenylethyl alcohol. More importantly, we carried out RNA-seq to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to volatiles biosynthesis pathways induced by MeJA treatment (0\u00a0h, 12\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h) in tea leaves. We identified 19245, 18614, 11890 DEGs respectively in the MeJA_12h, MeJA_24\u00a0h and MeJA_48\u00a0h samples. The \u03b1-Lenolenic acid degradation pathway was firstly responded resulting in activating the JA-pathway inner tea leaves, and the MEP/DOXP pathway significantly exaggerated. Notably, the expression level of jasmonate O-methyltransferase, which is associated with the central JA biosynthesis pathway, was increased by 7.52-fold in MeJA_24\u00a0h tea leaves. Moreover, the genes related to the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway showed different expression patterns compared with the untreated leaves. The expression levels of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-phosphate synthase (DXS), all-trans-nonaprenyl-diphosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl reductase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (type II), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase increased by approximately 2-4-fold.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of two-dimension gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry analysis suggested that exogenous application of MeJA could induce the levels of volatile components in tea leaves, especially the geraniol, linalool and its oxides. Moreover, the transcriptome analysis showed increased expression of genes in \u03b1-Lenolenic acid degradation pathway which produced massive jasmonic acid and quickly activated holistic JA-pathway inner tea leaves, also the terpenoid backbones biosynthesis pathway was significantly affected after MeJA treatment. In general, MeJA could greatly activate secondary metabolism pathways, especially volatiles.

This study was conducted to sequence, assemble, annotate, and characterize the root transcriptomes of three caladium cultivars (<i>Caladium</i> \u00d7 <i>hortulanum</i>) using RNA-Seq. The caladium cultivars used in this study have different levels of resistance to <i>Pythium</i><i>myriotylum</i>, the most damaging necrotrophic pathogen to caladium roots. Forty-six to 61 million clean reads were obtained for each caladium root transcriptome. De novo assembly of the reads resulted in approximately 130,000 unigenes. Based on bioinformatic analysis, 71,825 (52.3%) caladium unigenes were annotated for putative functions, 48,417 (67.4%) and 31,417 (72.7%) were assigned to Gene Ontology (GO) and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), respectively, and 46,406 (64.6%) unigenes were assigned to 128 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways.

Using Jersey milk increased cheese fat content in autumn, winter, and spring and decreased cheese moisture in spring and summer. Cheese protein, salt, and pH levels were not affected. Cheese was analyzed for texture and color, and it was professionally graded at 3 and 8mo.
