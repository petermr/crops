This study was conducted to sequence, assemble, annotate, and characterize the root transcriptomes of three caladium cultivars (<i>Caladium</i> \u00d7 <i>hortulanum</i>) using RNA-Seq. The caladium cultivars used in this study have different levels of resistance to <i>Pythium</i><i>myriotylum</i>, the most damaging necrotrophic pathogen to caladium roots. Forty-six to 61 million clean reads were obtained for each caladium root transcriptome. De novo assembly of the reads resulted in approximately 130,000 unigenes. Based on bioinformatic analysis, 71,825 (52.3%) caladium unigenes were annotated for putative functions, 48,417 (67.4%) and 31,417 (72.7%) were assigned to Gene Ontology (GO) and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), respectively, and 46,406 (64.6%) unigenes were assigned to 128 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. A total of 4518 distinct unigenes were observed only in <i>Pythium</i>-resistant \"Candidum\" roots, of which 98 seemed to be involved in disease resistance and defense responses.
