The metabolites from trichomes have been well characterized in tea products. However, little is known regarding the metabolites in fresh tea trichomes and the molecular differences in trichomes and tea leaves per se. In this study, we developed a method to collect trichomes from tea plant tender shoots, and their main secondary metabolites, including catechins, caffeine, amino acids, and aroma compounds, were determined. We found that the majority of these compounds were significantly less abundant in trichomes than in tea leaves. RNA-Seq was used to investigate the differences in the molecular regulatory mechanism between trichomes and leaves to gain further insight into the differences in trichomes and tea leaves. In total, 52.96 Gb of clean data were generated, and 6560 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 4471 upregulated and 2089 downregulated genes, were identified in the trichomes vs. leaves comparison. Notably, the structural genes of the major metabolite biosynthesis pathways, transcription factors, and other key DEGs were identified and comparatively analyzed between trichomes and leaves, while trichome-specific genes were also identified. Our results provide new insights into the differences between tea trichomes and leaves at the metabolic and transcriptomic levels, and open up new doors to further recognize and re-evaluate the role
