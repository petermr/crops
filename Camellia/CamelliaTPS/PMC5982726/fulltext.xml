In order to decipher the molecular mechanisms that <italic>P. halepensis</italic> uses to withstand drought, we performed large-scale physiological and transcriptome analyses. We selected a mature tree from a semi-arid area with suboptimal growth conditions for clonal propagation through cuttings. We then used a high-throughput experimental system to continuously monitor whole-plant transpiration rates, stomatal conductance and the vapor pressure deficit. The transcriptomes of plants were examined at six physiological stages: pre-stomatal response, partial stomatal closure, minimum transpiration, post-irrigation, partial recovery and full recovery. At each stage, data from plants exposed to the drought treatment were compared with data collected from well-irrigated control plants. A drought-stressed <italic>P. halepensis</italic> transcriptome was created using paired-end RNA-seq. In total, ~6000 differentially expressed, non-redundant transcripts were identified between drought-treated and control trees. Cluster analysis has revealed stress-induced down-regulation of transcripts related to photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging through the ascorbic acid (AsA)-glutathione cycle, fatty acid and cell wall biosynthesis, stomatal activity, and the biosynthesis of flavonoids and terpenoids. Up-regulated processes included chlorophyll degradation, ROS-scavenging through AsA-independent thiol-mediated pathways, abscisic acid response and accumulation of heat shock proteins, thaumatin and exordium. Recovery from drought induced strong transcription of retrotransposons, especially the retrovirus-related transposon <italic>Tnt1</italic>-94.

To cope with drought conditions, forest trees rely on their genetic toolkit, which has developed over the course of their evolution. Drought-resistance mechanisms vary among tree species and have been shown to differ between angiosperms (broadleaf plants) and gymnosperms (needle-leaf plants) (<xref rid="tpx137C89" ref-type="bibr">Niinemets 2001</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C23" ref-type="bibr">Choat et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C3" ref-type="bibr">Anderegg et al. 2016</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C16" ref-type="bibr">Cailleret et al. 2016</xref>). The evolutionary distance of 285 million years between conifers and angiosperms (<xref rid="tpx137C110" ref-type="bibr">Savard et al. 1994</xref>) suggests that these groups of plants may have both common and unique mechanisms for drought resistance. Whereas, molecular responses to drought stress have been extensively studied in broadleaf species, studies of needle-leaf species have been limited.</p><p>Response to water deficit begins with reduction in cell growth due to turgor loss, which was found to be accompanied by a high expression level of Histidine Kinase 1 (HK1) in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> (<xref rid="tpx137C67" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2001</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C120" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al. 2007</xref>). In order to maintain high turgor, plants make active osmotic adjustments by producing osmolytes such as free amino acids, various ions, soluble sugars and free polyamines, while the free amino acid proline is the most common osmolyte (<xref rid="tpx137C57" ref-type="bibr">Krasensky and Jonak 2012</xref>). In order to stabilize membranes that are negatively affected by drought stress, plants induce expression of late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, heat shock proteins (HSP) and dehydrins, all of which may have an important role in the stabilization of membranes (<xref rid="tpx137C47" ref-type="bibr">Harfouche et al. 2014</xref>). As drought continues, increasing level of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) causes a decrease in stomatal conductance, which is inevitably accompanied by lower rates of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and reduced photosynthesis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are produced following reductions in photosynthesis, damage many cell components but can also act as an alarm signal that triggers the plant&#x02019;s defense pathways and responses. Reactive oxygen species production evokes one or more of the antioxidant defense systems such as CATALASE (CAT), the ascorbic acid-glutathione (AsA-GSH) pathway and two AsA-independent thiol-mediated pathways, the peroxiredoxin/thioredoxin (Prx/Trx) and the glutathione peroxidase/glutathione S-transferase (GPX/GST) (<xref rid="tpx137C93" ref-type="bibr">Noctor et al. 2014</xref>). In addition, hormonal changes seem to be involved in all of these reactions. Decrease in cytokinin levels and increased levels of ABA and auxin have been documented in angiosperms and in gymnosperms in response to drought (<xref rid="tpx137C95" ref-type="bibr">Peleg and Blumwald 2011</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C30" ref-type="bibr">De Diego et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>Secondary metabolites, which are known to be induced upon biotic and abiotic stresses, have been shown to be affected by drought stress. Increase in terpenoids levels was documented in <italic>Quercus ilex</italic> and in <italic>Pinus</italic> Miller <italic>halepensis</italic> under drought stress (<xref rid="tpx137C9" ref-type="bibr">Blanch et al. 2009</xref>). In <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, two types of terpenes were decreased in response to drought (<xref rid="tpx137C75" ref-type="bibr">McKiernan et al. 2014</xref>), however, no alteration was detected in the levels of isoprenoids, mono- and sesquiterpenes (<xref rid="tpx137C76" ref-type="bibr">McKiernan et al. 2016</xref>). Concentrations of phenolic compounds were found to decrease in response to drought in <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> (<xref rid="tpx137C75" ref-type="bibr">McKiernan et al. 2014</xref>). These and other studies suggest that involvement of secondary metabolites in drought response is complex and depends on various parameters such as stress intensity and duration and tree developmental stage (<xref rid="tpx137C90" ref-type="bibr">Niinemets 2016</xref>).</p><p>Another aspect of response to drought stress is epigenetic changes, which refers to modifications affecting gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself, and mainly include DNA methylation and histone modifications (<xref rid="tpx137C103" ref-type="bibr">Rey et al. 2016</xref>). Methylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9me) have been shown to induce expression of drought-related genes such as RD20, which mediates stomatal closure via ABA response (<xref rid="tpx137C6" ref-type="bibr">Aubert et al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C52" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2015</xref>). DNA methylation in <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> under drought stress has also been shown to occur in transposable elements (TE) (<xref rid="tpx137C60" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al. 2014</xref>). Transposable elements are a principal component of nuclear DNA. Their mobility induces changes in genome structure, thereby inducing changes in gene expression in the majority of eukaryotic organisms (<xref rid="tpx137C63" ref-type="bibr">Lippman et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C15" ref-type="bibr">Butelli et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C80" ref-type="bibr">Mita and Boeke 2016</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C87" ref-type="bibr">Negi et al. 2016</xref>). The relevant biological significance of TEs in relation to drought response is not fully understood.</p><p>Molecular responses are controlled by multiple layers of regulation starting at the DNA level and extending through the RNA and protein-function levels. RNA concentration is the most frequently measured genetic element in most plant species and had been examined in pine species in response to drought. <xref rid="tpx137C21" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al. (1996)</xref> identified four differentially expressed (DE) genes out of 15,000 in a cDNA library of loblolly pine (<italic>Pinus taeda</italic>). These included: S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (sams), an intermediate in the synthesis of ethylene; an ABA-inducible gene; a type I copper-containing glycoprotein; and a glycine-rich protein similar to cell wall proteins (<xref rid="tpx137C21" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 1996</xref>). <xref rid="tpx137C130" ref-type="bibr">Watkinson et al. (2003)</xref> used a cDNA library of 2173 clones and demonstrated differential expression of genes encoding HSP, LEA proteins, aromatic amino acids and flavonoids upon mild drought stress in loblolly pine. <xref rid="tpx137C70" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et al. (2006)</xref> succeeded in building a cDNA library of more than 6000 unique transcripts from drought-treated root tissue and identified several genes that had been characterized previously, including dehydrins and LEA gene products. A later publication that utilized an improved microarray of 26,496 cDNA sequences demonstrated 2445 DE genes in response to drought stress in loblolly pine roots (<xref rid="tpx137C69" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et al. 2011</xref>). Among the DE genes a number of central nodes were identified including 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), which is involved in the biosynthesis of ABA, zeatin <italic>O</italic>-glucosyltransferase, which regulates the cytokinin homeostasis, and ABA-responsive protein (<xref rid="tpx137C69" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et al. 2011</xref>). Microarray analysis of the molecular response to drought stress in <italic>P</italic><italic>inus pinaster</italic> and <italic>P</italic><italic>inus</italic><italic> pinea</italic> revealed 113 inducible genes. Genes that were common in both species were considered as general candidate genes and included glycosyltransferases, galactosidases, sugar transporters, dehydrins and transcription factors (<xref rid="tpx137C96" ref-type="bibr">Perdiguero et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>The large size of the genomes of members of the Pinaceae (22&#x02013;30 Gb) presents challenges, with the result that research in Pinaceae tree genomics has lagged behind that of other systems (<xref rid="tpx137C84" ref-type="bibr">Neale and Kremer 2011</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C99" ref-type="bibr">Plomion et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C100" ref-type="bibr">Prunier et al. 2015</xref>). However, the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which began in the last decade, has facilitated Pinaceae genomic research (<xref rid="tpx137C85" ref-type="bibr">Neale et al. 2013</xref>). Moreover, NGS allows us to investigate the transcriptome (all expressed genes in a given tissue at a given time) of any species even in the absence of any other genetic information (<xref rid="tpx137C40" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin et al. 2016</xref>). This approach provides expression profiles, gene networks and regulators, which are useful for the dissection of temporal and spatial responses to drought at the molecular level. Next-generation sequencing has been used to uncover the transcriptomic profile of several pine species including <italic>P. pinaster</italic>, <italic>P</italic><italic>inus patula</italic>, <italic>P</italic><italic>inus</italic><italic> densiflora</italic> and <italic>P</italic><italic>inus</italic><italic> tabuliformis</italic> (<xref rid="tpx137C72" ref-type="bibr">Mackay et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C92" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C17" ref-type="bibr">Canales et al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C65" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C126" ref-type="bibr">Visser et al. 2015</xref>). These profiles were generated from various tissues including cones, cambium and needles under normal growth conditions or in response to disease in the case of <italic>P. patula</italic>. However, NGS tools to study the response to drought stress and recovery in pines have not been extensively used.</p><p>Marginal forest populations may contain unique genetic properties that allow for plant survival under otherwise unsuitable conditions (<xref rid="tpx137C22" ref-type="bibr">Channell and Lomolino 2000</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C49" ref-type="bibr">Holliday et al. 2012</xref>). These populations provide a unique opportunity to study tree adaptation to climate change (<xref rid="tpx137C36" ref-type="bibr">Fady et al. 2016</xref>). A planted forest in a semi-arid region of Israel (annual precipitation of less than 300 mm) was extensively established during the last century with <italic>P. halepensis</italic>, a species known for its eco-physiological capabilities for drought tolerance (<xref rid="tpx137C111" ref-type="bibr">Schiller 2000</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C106" ref-type="bibr">Rotenberg and Yakir 2010</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C54" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C122" ref-type="bibr">Ungar et al. 2013</xref>). Although planted forests have grown normally over the years, the impact of climate change is now evident in increased tree mortality in Israeli forests, similar to that which has been reported for other Mediterranean <italic>Pinus</italic> spp. plantations (<xref rid="tpx137C56" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000f6;rner et al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C34" ref-type="bibr">Dorman et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C38" ref-type="bibr">Gazol et al. 2017</xref>). The ability of <italic>P. halepensis</italic> to grow under suboptimal climate conditions makes it an ideal candidate for the study of drought responses in conifers (<xref rid="tpx137C73" ref-type="bibr">Maseyk et al. 2008</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C54" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C29" ref-type="bibr">David-Schwartz et al. 2016</xref>). The molecular response of <italic>P. halepensis</italic> roots to drought stress was studied by <xref rid="tpx137C109" ref-type="bibr">Sathyan et al. (2005)</xref>. They used a cDNA library of 21,500 clones from the root of <italic>P. halepensis</italic> and revealed 212 DE clones, of which only 14 clones were further characterized. These included LEA gene and genes that code for a chitinase, a cyclophilin (CYC), sucrose synthase (SUS), an inorganic pyrophosphatase and an MYB transcription factor (TF).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to comprehensively characterize the dynamics of the physiological and molecular responses to drought stress in <italic>P. halepensis</italic> needles and to identify key factors in this response. To that end, we utilized a high-throughput experimental platform to simultaneously and continuously evaluate physiological responses. Six physiological stages were selected for transcriptome analysis: pre-stomatal closure, partial stomatal closure, minimum transpiration, post-irrigation, partial recovery and full recovery. Changes in RNA transcript profiles over the course of the experiment were indicative of the dynamic response of <italic>P. halepensis</italic> to drought stress and recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="tpx137s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="tpx137s2a"><title>Plant material and clonal propagation</title><p>In order to avoid genetic variation and to preserve mature-tree characteristics, we selected one tree for clonal propagation. To ensure that the genotype to be studied would possess drought-adaptation mechanisms, we selected a 20-year-old tree with a relatively large diameter at breast height from the Yatir Forest in Israel, which is a semi-arid forest characterized by suboptimal conditions (270 mm of annual precipitation and an aridity index of 0.18). Shoots were harvested in December 2013 and were used for clonal propagation through rooted cuttings, as described by J. Riov (personal communication). In short, 15-cm twigs that each possessed a vegetative shoot apex were collected from the upper part of the tree and stored at 4 &#x000b0;C in a humid environment. After 4 weeks, the twigs were cut and their lowermost part was immersed in rooting solution [5 ppm 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid-glycine conjugate, 400 ppm indole-3-butiric acid (IBA), 0.025% Amistar fungicide (Syngenta)] for 4 h. The twigs were set in a closed rooting bed that contained 1:1 vermiculite:styrofoam white beads. They were kept at 25 &#x000b0;C and every 10 min fogging was applied for 10 s. Rooted cuttings were obtained after 6&#x02013;8 weeks and moved into separate small pots. A total of 10 rooted clones were grown for 18 months before being subjected to the drought experiment. At the beginning of the drought experiment, the average height of the clones was 31.65 &#x000b1; 3.2 cm and their average weight was 167 &#x000b1; 7.73 g.

That treatment consisted of stopping irrigation at Day 7 for 34 days. At the same time, five control clones were regularly watered (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F1">1</xref>). Plants were watered every day at 4:00 a.m. to field capacity. Physiological parameters were monitored using a high-throughput system of lysimeters (temperature-compensated load cells) set up in a greenhouse at the Faculty of Agriculture, Rehovot, Israel (<xref rid="tpx137C5" ref-type="bibr">Attia et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C45" ref-type="bibr">Halperin et al. 2016</xref>). The plants were grown in 3.8-l pots in a greenhouse with semi-controlled conditions from late August through early November 2015. The soil surface was covered with white plastic to prevent water loss from soil. The weight of each pot was monitored every 30 s and an average read for each 3-min period was logged with a Campbell Scientific CR1000 Data Logger (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). Simultaneously, temperature, ambient radiance and the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in the greenhouse were continuously recorded. At the end of the experiment, all of the needles were removed from each tree and their weight (at full turgor) was used to normalize the observed transpiration rate.

Transcripts that were significantly up-regulated at D3 were grouped together in Cluster 7 and include transcripts related to ABA signaling (PP2C 25 and PP2C 37), protein degradation (E3 ubiquitin-ligase RGLG1), hydrogen peroxide generation (20 kDa chloroplastic-positive regulator of superoxide dismutase), carbohydrate metabolism (sucrose synthase) and a chloroplast proteases (Do-like protease).</p><p>Transcripts that are down-regulated at Stage D3 were grouped together in Cluster 1 and include transcripts that are involved in protein degradation (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase and E3 SUMO ligase SIZ1), sugar transport (sugar transporter ERD6), response to auxin (auxin-induced 15 A), DNA replication (DNA replication licensing factor MCM4), DNA repair (CISIN), oxidation-reduction (ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase) and protein degradation (Do-like 9).</p><p>The analysis of transcripts involved in gradual responses to drought included transcripts whose expression gradually increased or decreased over the course of the drought treatment, as compared with the control. This pattern is similar to the stomata behavior as measured by the <italic>g</italic><sub>sc</sub> and therefore, some of the processes are expected to correlate with stomatal conductance. Gradually up-regulated transcripts were grouped in Clusters 14, 17 and 22, and are up-regulated mostly at Stages D2&#x02013;D5. This group includes transcripts related to ROS scavenging (superoxide dismutase), detoxification of ROS via AsA-independent thiol-mediated pathways (glutathione peroxidases, glutaredoxin and thioredoxin), carbon fixation (ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase units), sucrose degradation (sucrose synthase), chlorophyll degradation (chlorophyllases), ethylene response (ethylene-responsive transcription factors), stomatal movement (RING finger and CHY zinc finger protein1) and ABA signaling (serine threonine-kinase SRK2E and PP2C 37, ABI5). This category also includes up-regulated transcripts related to aromatic amino acid biosynthetic processes (3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase 2 and phenylalanine hydroxylases), lipid hydrolysis (lipase-like PAD4), DNA binding (lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 homolog 3) and auxin responses (auxin aluminum responsive, auxin down-regulated partial and auxin-repressed). In addition, HSPs, inositol transporters, dehydrins and LEA transcripts were also up-regulated. Increased expression of sucrose synthases and thaumatin, as well as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was negatively correlated with stomatal conductance.</p><p>Gradually down-regulated transcripts were grouped in Clusters 19, 21 and 26, which include transcripts that are down-regulated mainly at Stages D3&#x02013;D5. The down-regulated transcripts are related to the synthesis of terpenoid backbone (geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase), mono- and diterpenoids, flavonoids (chalcone isomerase (CHI) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase), phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. We also noted the down-regulation of transcripts related to the AsA-GSH cycle of ROS removal (ascorbate peroxidase and monodehydroascorbate reductases), cytokinin degradation (cytokinin dehydrogenase), methylation (lysine-specific demethylase JMJ706-like isoform x1), starch degradation (isoamylases, alpha and beta amylases), cellulose metabolism (cellulase and cellulose synthases), cell division (leucine-rich repeat receptor-like serine threonine-kinase BAM1), sugar transport (sugar transporter ERD6), stomatal activity (SLAC), chlorophyll-related proteins and ABA signaling (PYL2 and PYL8). Decreased expression of chalcone synthases and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase was positively correlated with stomatal conductance.</p><p>Recovery-related early responses were measured 4 h following re-watering. Early responsive transcripts were grouped in Clusters 30 and 18, which include transcripts that are up- or down-regulated at Stage D4, respectively. Cluster 30 includes transcripts associated with oxidation-reduction processes (peroxidases), ABA catabolism (ABA 8-hydroxylase), auxin flux (auxin transporter 1), fatty-acid biosynthesis (lipoxygenases), membranes and the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton and cell wall-related transcripts (expansin). Cluster 18 includes down-regulated transcripts associated with RNA processing, cytokinin-activated signaling (histidine-containing phosphotransfer 1) and terpene synthesis (pinene synthase).</p><p>Late responsive transcripts were those transcripts for which significant up- or down-regulation was noted at Stage D5, at which point <italic>g</italic><sub>sc</sub> had partially recovered (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F1">1</xref>C). This category includes Cluster 12, which consists of transcripts that were up-regulated at Stage D5 and Clusters 3, 5 and 23, which together include transcripts that were down-regulated at Stage D5. The up-regulated transcripts include three different peroxidases and transcripts associated with sucrose metabolism (sucrose-phosphate synthase), photosynthetic acclimation (K<sup>+</sup> efflux antiporter chloroplastic protein), the ABA-activated signaling pathway (calcium-dependent kinase 17), stomatal movement (serine threonine-kinase HT1), cell division and DNA repair and sugar transport (SWEET1). The down-regulated transcripts include transcripts that are associated with water transport (aquaporin, aquaporin TIP4-3), cellulose synthesis (cellulose synthases) and polar auxin transport (auxin transport protein BIG).</p><p>Clusters 6, 20 and 27 include transcripts that were up-regulated at Stage D6, at which point we observed fully recovered <italic>g</italic><sub>sc</sub> (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F1">1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F5">5</xref>). Cluster 20 is dominated by transcripts that are up-regulated at Stages D4 and D6. This cluster includes 1405 transcripts, of which 646 transcripts are without annotation. This cluster also includes 489 transcripts that are associated with retrotransposons. These induced retrotransposons belong to families HAT, Ty1, Ty3 and Tf2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F6">6</xref>). However, the most dominant retrotransposon, with 243 related transcripts, was <italic>Tnt1</italic>-94 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F6">6</xref>B and C). Among the remaining 275 transcripts of this cluster, 8 are TFs, 44 are associated with photosynthesis, 22 peroxidase-64 transcripts, 18 ribonuclease (RNase) H transcripts and 10 endoribonuclease dicer transcripts. A similar pattern of 28 retrotransposable elements was seen in Clusters 6 and 27, which together include 130 transcripts.

Transcripts related to the hormones auxin, cytokinin, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid are down-regulated upon drought stress, while ABA and brassinosteroids related transcripts are up-regulated. Auxin seemed to be induced upon re-watering. For ethylene response, the picture seemed more complexed. The regulation overview map also suggests that Redox-related transcripts belong to the Prx/Trx and GPX/GST pathways are activated upon drought stress.

The association between the <italic>E</italic> and <italic>g</italic><sub>sc</sub> that was observed in this study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F1">1</xref>) is similar to those reported for peach (<italic>Prunus persica</italic>) and grapevine (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>), in which correlations between soil water content and stem water potential have been documented (<xref rid="tpx137C74" ref-type="bibr">Mata et al. 1999</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C132" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al. 2012</xref>).

This result was probably obtained due to high proportion of high quality <italic>P. sitchensis</italic> protein sequences in the NCBI nr protein database relative to pine species (<xref rid="tpx137C101" ref-type="bibr">Ralph et al. 2008</xref>).

As most pine species are poorly represented in the database, only <italic>Pinus</italic> spp. showed a meaningful match of 6.6% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F2">2</xref>).</p><sec id="tpx137s4a"><title>Drought-related genes</title><p>Currently, hundreds of genes have been identified in relation to drought response, while specific drought-related function has been identified for only a portion of them. The challenge is to identify genes that can be used in breeding programs and biotechnological approaches aimed at improving drought resistance, especially among forest tree species, which are completely dependent on environmental conditions. The genotype that was used in this study originated from a semi-arid area with suboptimal growth conditions and thus represents drought-resistance capacity. Although this single genotype does not represent the species genetic variation, it contributes comprehensive information regarding new candidate genes for drought resistance in <italic>P. halepensis</italic>.</p><p>The examination of the transcriptome at Stage D1 enabled us to identify molecular responses before any changes in stomatal conductance could be noted and to elucidate the hierarchy of responses to drought stress in pine. The limited number of DE transcripts at Stage D1 includes the strongly down-regulated photosystem II (PSII) protein D1 (psbA), which is a reaction-center-core protein responsible for electron transport that is an integral part of photosynthesis (<xref rid="tpx137C71" ref-type="bibr">Lu 2016</xref>). This down-regulation impairs PSII function, leading to reduced CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and increased ROS production, which in turn restricts D1 protein synthesis and further damages the routine repair of PSII (<xref rid="tpx137C117" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi and Murata 2008</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C91" ref-type="bibr">Nishiyama et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C93" ref-type="bibr">Noctor et al. 2014</xref>). Strong expression of the ROS-scavenging enzymes catalase (CAT) and ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase (FTRC) at this stage is probably induced to mitigate this damage (<xref rid="tpx137C91" ref-type="bibr">Nishiyama et al. 2011</xref>). Alternatively, this mechanism might also be activated to generate ROS signaling, which promotes the activation of downstream pathways (<xref rid="tpx137C93" ref-type="bibr">Noctor et al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C119" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al. 2016</xref>). Up-regulated transcripts at Stage D1 also included HSP70 and HSP90, which have been shown to modulate transcriptional and physiological responses to ABA and are required for stomatal closure in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="tpx137C24" ref-type="bibr">Cl&#x000e9;ment et al. 2011</xref>). In agreement with that report, in this work, these genes seem to be upstream of the ABA-induced stomatal closure. PLATZ TF, which was also observed at this stage, has been shown to suppress transcription via non-specific binding to A/T-rich sequences (<xref rid="tpx137C82" ref-type="bibr">Nagano et al. 2001</xref>). In the current experiment, PLATZ TF might have been partially responsible for the massive down-regulation of transcripts at Stages D2 and D3.</p><p>Another up-regulated gene is GABA transaminase, which has been suggested to be involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial GABA pools that are associated with energy production via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, to maintain normal cellular metabolism (<xref rid="tpx137C37" ref-type="bibr">Fait et al. 2008</xref>). GABA accumulation has been reported in <italic>Pinus radiata</italic> subjected to drought stress and may function as a long-term carbon and nitrogen reserve that facilitates recovery and confers a priming effect against future stress (<xref rid="tpx137C31" ref-type="bibr">De Diego et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>The major flavonoid biosynthesis-related transcript, chalcone synthase, is down-regulated at Stage D1, preceding massive down-regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis as drought continues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F4">4</xref>). In contrast, up-regulation of transcripts involved in phospholipid biosynthesis and lipid transport, as noted at Stage D1, suggests membrane enrichment toward stabilization and the prevention of membrane leakage. Phospholipids are central components of cell membranes and a decrease in phospholipid levels upon drought stress leads to membrane leakage (<xref rid="tpx137C61" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al. 2015</xref>). Drought might also lead to membrane shrinkage and turgor loss, which is known to induce the expression of HK1, which may act as an osmosensor (<xref rid="tpx137C120" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al. 2007</xref>). Two putative homologs of HK1 were identified in our study. However, neither of them was differentially expressed over the course of the experiment (data not shown).</p><p>The genes described above are probably some of the upstream regulators that sense the very initial stages of the drought stress and promote further responses to prevent tissue damage and the loss of water from cells. Therefore, each of these genes is a potential candidate for breeding programs and biotechnological approaches towards drought-resistant plants. Stages D2 and D3 of drought stress and Stages D4, D5 and D6 of recovery are associated with many more DE transcripts that reflect various processes that may or may not be connected to one another. Through our GO enrichment and cluster analyses of gene-expression patterns (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F5">5</xref>), we were able to illustrate the dynamic of these processes over the course of drought stress and recovery. In the current study, each physiological stage was shown to be characterized by differential expression of various TFs, which are key regulators of the activation or repression of DE transcripts (<xref rid="tpx137C113" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C108" ref-type="bibr">Saibo et al. 2009</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C62" ref-type="bibr">Lindemose et al. 2013</xref>). Expression of various TFs was similar to what was reported for other species, such the up-regulation of nuclear transcription factor Y subunit B in poplar (<xref rid="tpx137C25" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al. 2010</xref>). However, other annotated members belonging to the same gene families have been demonstrated to have opposite expression pattern (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref> available as Supplementary Data at <italic>Tree Physiology</italic> Online). This observation is due to the NGS technique, which is not biased towards a specific member of a gene family, but rather detects the whole gene range of expressed genes, thus better reflecting the complex regulation of the response to drought. Determining the specific DE transcripts that are affected by each of these TFs is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>The drought transcriptome that was generated in this study includes a high proportion (17%) of transcripts without annotation, which apparently restricts its potential to reflect the complete toolkit of drought-resistance mechanisms in <italic>P. halepensis</italic>.</p><p>Molecular response at partial stomatal closure includes ROS production, which is induced under drought stress due to the interruption of metabolic processes. Reactive oxygen species play an important role in signaling, but excess ROS are targeted by various mechanisms to prevent cell damage (<xref rid="tpx137C51" ref-type="bibr">Kapoor et al. 2015</xref>). The conversion of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02013;</sup> is catalyzed by superoxide dismutase to produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, while various pathways reduce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O. These pathways include CAT, the AsA-GSH pathway and two AsA-independent thiol-mediated pathways, the Prx/Trx and the GPX/GST (<xref rid="tpx137C93" ref-type="bibr">Noctor et al. 2014</xref>). CAT, which is mainly expressed in the peroxisome, is induced early in drought and is down-regulated during recovery (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref> available as Supplementary Data at <italic>Tree Physiology</italic> Online). The AsA-GSH pathway is induced in many species to scavenge ROS under drought stress (<xref rid="tpx137C115" ref-type="bibr">Sofo et al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C27" ref-type="bibr">Cruz de Carvalho 2008</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C20" ref-type="bibr">Caverzan et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C129" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2016</xref>), while other species activate the AsA-independent thiol-mediated pathways in response to drought (<xref rid="tpx137C27" ref-type="bibr">Cruz de Carvalho 2008</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C51" ref-type="bibr">Kapoor et al. 2015</xref>). This study shows that under drought conditions, <italic>P. halepensis</italic> activates genes related to the Prx/Trx and GPX/GST pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F7">7</xref>), while expression levels of genes from the AsA-GSH pathway are reduced (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref> available as Supplementary Data at <italic>Tree Physiology</italic> Online).</p><p>Stomatal closure upon drought stress is known to be induced by the phytohormone ABA (<xref rid="tpx137C118" ref-type="bibr">Tardieu and Davies 1992</xref>). The major ABA biosynthetic gene NCED (9-<italic>cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase</italic>), which has been shown to be expressed in response to drought in many species, was not found to be differentially expressed in the current experiment. This might be due to the sampling time, which may have been too late or too early during Stage D2. Alternatively, NCED might be up-regulated and cause ABA to be synthesized in a different organ (such as the root) and then transferred to leaves through the transpiration stream. Another possible explanation for the absence of NCED transcripts is that active ABA is accumulated through the hydrolysis of ABA-GE (glucose-ester), which might be predominant in needles. Few transcripts that were annotated as beta-glucosidases (which releases glucose from ABA-GE) were up-regulated at Stages D2 and D3. However, the actual role of these transcripts in ABA-GE hydrolysis should be examined.</p><p>Indications for ABA signaling in the current study come from ABA-responsive transcripts such as the TF ABI5, which is up-regulated at Stage D3, and from the up-regulation of two transcripts of SnRK2 at Stages D3 and D4. There were fewer DE PYL8 homologs at the point at which the minimum transpiration rate was reached (Stage D3), but only one PYL8 homolog was up-regulated at that stage. The PYL8 receptor has been shown to regulate root growth in response to drought in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="tpx137C35" ref-type="bibr">Dupeux et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C137" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C135" ref-type="bibr">Xing et al. 2016</xref>). A report of poplar response to drought stress demonstrated down-regulation of PYL expression (<xref rid="tpx137C25" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al. 2010</xref>); however, not much information is available regarding ABA receptors in trees in response to drought. The fact that PYL8 was the active ABA receptor at Stage D3 suggests that it may play a role in ABA signaling in needles.</p><p>In addition, PP2C genes that are known to inhibit ABA signaling by blocking SnRK2 activity were differentially expressed in the current study. While some were down-regulated, others were up-regulated. Although most of the PP2C genes have been shown to act as negative regulators of ABA signaling, some have been shown to be positive regulators (<xref rid="tpx137C104" ref-type="bibr">Reyes et al. 2006</xref>). Interestingly, E3 ubiquitin-ligase RGLG1, which is up-regulated at Stage D3, has been recently shown, together with RGLG5, to promote ABA signaling by mediating PP2C degradation (<xref rid="tpx137C133" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. 2016</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate the effects of RGLG1 on the various PP2C transcripts that were differentially expressed in this study. Abscisic acid degradation following re-watering is probably mediated by ABA 8-hydroxylase, whose transcript levels increased at Stage D4.</p><p>The cluster analysis implies that ABA accumulates in <italic>P. halepensis</italic> needles following drought stress. In <italic>P. radiata</italic>, foliar ABA was reported to accumulate gradually as drought stress progresses and to remain high as long as the stomata remain closed (<xref rid="tpx137C11" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb and McAdam 2013</xref>). Upon rehydration, stomatal conductance increased after 48&#x02013;72 h, that is, only after ABA levels fell to basal levels (<xref rid="tpx137C11" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb and McAdam 2013</xref>). This type of ABA dynamic is common in pine species that exhibit an R-type (rising) ABA response and an ABA-dependent stomatal closure response (<xref rid="tpx137C12" ref-type="bibr">Brodribb et al. 2014</xref>). The gradual up-regulation during drought and slow down-regulation during recovery of the <italic>CHY ZINC-FINGER AND RING FINGER PROTEIN1 (CHYR1)</italic> gene support the slow response of <italic>P. halepensis</italic> stomata, since this gene has been shown to be essential for ABA-mediated stomatal closure (<xref rid="tpx137C32" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al. 2015</xref>). In contrast, SLAC1, which is also involved in stomatal closure (<xref rid="tpx137C125" ref-type="bibr">Vahisalu et al. 2008</xref>), was down-regulated during the drought treatment, demonstrating the complexity of the ABA response over long periods of exposure to drought. Nonetheless, the similarity in stomatal behavior of this species with that observed in <italic>P. radiata</italic> and with the accompanying ABA-related transcription patterns suggest that the ABA response in <italic>P. halepensis</italic> is of the R-type.</p><p>In general, levels of transcripts related to the biosynthesis of flavonoids were gradually reduced significantly over the drought period and were gradually up-regulated after re-watering, reaching normal levels only at Stage D6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F4">4</xref>). It has been suggested that flavonoids protect plants against abiotic stress and their accumulation is also induced rapidly upon drought (<xref rid="tpx137C66" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C83" ref-type="bibr">Nakabayashi et al. 2014</xref>). However, decreased expression of CHI in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) and tea (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) under drought stress has been documented (<xref rid="tpx137C94" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C102" ref-type="bibr">Rani et al. 2012</xref>). A similar pattern of down-regulation was observed for transcripts associated with terpene biosynthesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F4">4</xref>). Terpenes benefit the plant under conditions of biotic stress. As opposed to the current study, drought stress has been shown to induce an increase in volatile terpenes in <italic>Q. ilex</italic> and <italic>P. halepensis</italic> (<xref rid="tpx137C9" ref-type="bibr">Blanch et al. 2009</xref>). However, a recent paper demonstrated a dramatic decrease in terpene emission in <italic>P. halepensis</italic> under severe drought conditions in the Yatir forest (<xref rid="tpx137C68" ref-type="bibr">Llusia et al. 2016</xref>). This discrepancy should be investigated; however, down-regulation of terpenes might explain the high sensitivity of drought-stressed trees to biotic stress. The pattern of down-regulation observed in our study may suggest that the plant limits the energy-intensive biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in favor of drought-related survival mechanisms.</p><p>Other genes, such as thaumatin, were differentially expressed in the current experiment in response to drought. Thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) have been shown to be involved in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses such as salinity, cold, osmotic stress and drought (<xref rid="tpx137C97" ref-type="bibr">Piggott et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C81" ref-type="bibr">Munis et al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C1" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C128" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2013</xref>). Ten TLPs have been identified in western white pine (<italic>Pinus monticola</italic>) and shown to play a role in responses to pathogens (<xref rid="tpx137C64" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2010</xref>). Here, we show that TLPs are differentially expressed in <italic>P. halepensis</italic> in response to drought stress. Thaumatin shares sequence homology with osmotin and is known to play a role in responses to osmotic and drought stress (<xref rid="tpx137C114" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al. 1987</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C79" ref-type="bibr">Misra et al. 2016</xref>). As it is an integral component of membranes, we suggest that aside from its role upon pathogen attack, thaumatin might also be involved in preventing membrane damage.</p></sec><sec id="tpx137s4b"><title>Recovery-related genes</title><p>Processes related to growth, photosynthesis, ion transport and biosynthesis of proteins and DNA were all induced following re-watering (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F4">4</xref>).

The most striking result was the strong transcription of retrotransposons that was observed during the recovery from drought (at Stages D4 and D6, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F6">6</xref>). Expressed retrotransposons included <italic>Ty1</italic>/<italic>Copia</italic>, <italic>Ty3</italic>/<italic>Gypsy</italic>, 297 and members of hAT families. The <italic>Copia</italic> element <italic>Tnt1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>94</italic> was by far the most dominant retrotransposon at Stages D4 and D6 and accounted for more than 10% of the total up-regulated genes at those stages (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tpx137F6">6</xref>A and B). It was recently reported that retrotransposons (mainly <italic>Ty1</italic>/<italic>Copia</italic> and <italic>Ty3</italic>/<italic>Gypsy</italic> elements) account for 62% of the 23-Gb <italic>P. taeda</italic> genome (<xref rid="tpx137C131" ref-type="bibr">Wegrzyn et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C86" ref-type="bibr">Neale et al. 2014</xref>). Retrotransposons from <italic>Ty1</italic>/<italic>Copia</italic>, <italic>Ty3</italic>/<italic>Gypsy</italic>, hAT, 297 and Tf2 families have been characterized previously in many plant species (<xref rid="tpx137C107" ref-type="bibr">Rubin et al. 2001</xref>). <italic>Tnt1</italic> retrotransposons were first identified in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) and are widely used to induce mutagenesis in plants (<xref rid="tpx137C42" ref-type="bibr">Grandbastien et al. 1989</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C28" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Erfurth et al. 2003</xref>). The involvement of transposable elements in stress responses was previously suggested in the Solanaceae (<xref rid="tpx137C43" ref-type="bibr">Grandbastien et al. 2005</xref>). A recent study demonstrated differential expression of retrotransposons in <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> in response to heat stress, pine woolly aphids and treatment with salicylic acid and ABA (<xref rid="tpx137C127" ref-type="bibr">Voronova et al. 2014</xref>). A specific response of <italic>Tnt1</italic> to biotic and abiotic factors was reported in tobacco (<xref rid="tpx137C78" ref-type="bibr">Mhiri et al. 1997</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C77" ref-type="bibr">Melayah et al. 2001</xref>, <xref rid="tpx137C48" ref-type="bibr">Hern&#x000e1;ndez-Pinz&#x000f3;n et al. 2009</xref>). Sequence variation in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of <italic>Tnt1</italic> has been shown to confer a specific response to various stress inducers in tobacco. While methyl jasmonate induces transcription of the <italic>Tnt1 A</italic> subfamily, salicylic acid and auxin activate the <italic>Tnt1 C</italic> subfamily (<xref rid="tpx137C7" ref-type="bibr">Beguiristain et al. 2001</xref>). <italic>Tnt1</italic> has been shown to be integrated into gene-rich regions and, therefore, it has been suggested to contribute to genetic variation (<xref rid="tpx137C48" ref-type="bibr">Hern&#x000e1;ndez-Pinz&#x000f3;n et al. 2009</xref>). It has been shown that epigenetic mechanisms suppress retrotransposon activity upon heat stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref rid="tpx137C50" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al. 2011</xref>). Epigenetic activity was noted for several genes in the current study, including those controlling the methylation of the transcriptional repressor H3K9me and the transcriptional activator H3K4me (<xref rid="tpx137C134" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al.2016</xref>). The lysine-specific demethylase JMJ706-like isoform x1 (see <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref> available as Supplementary Data at <italic>Tree Physiology</italic> Online), which decreases at D3, specifically reverses di- and trimethylation of H3K9 (<xref rid="tpx137C116" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Zhou 2008</xref>). In a complementary manner, the H3K9-specific methyltransferase SUVH1 increases at D3, suggesting an increase in H3K9me, which would lead to transcriptional suppression of the affected genes under drought. At the stage of post-irrigation, a dramatic decrease of the specific H3K9 methyltransferase SUVR5 (<xref rid="tpx137C19" ref-type="bibr">Caro et al. 2012</xref>) is observed, suggesting reduction in H3K9me and hence transcriptional activation. Transcriptional suppression during drought stress is also evident in the dramatic increase (~130-fold; see<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material"> Table S2</xref> available as Supplementary Data at <italic>Tree Physiology</italic> Online) in the expression of the lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 homolog 3, which specifically demethylates H3K4me, the positive regulator of gene expression. In the current study, we assume that genes regulated by H3K4me were strongly suppressed at Stages D2 and D3. However, those genes are probably reactivated during recovery, as the reduction in the expression of the lysine-specific-histone demethylase 1 homolog 3 at Stage D5 was dramatic (~130-fold; see<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material"> Table S2</xref> available as Supplementary Data at <italic>Tree Physiology</italic> Online). It was recently suggested that H3K4me may be related to acclimation or &#x02018;stress memory&#x02019; in plants (<xref rid="tpx137C53" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2012</xref>). In Arabidopsis, increased levels of H3K4me3 during recovery from drought indicated a form of transcriptional memory that persists for several days and results in higher expression levels upon repeated drought stress (<xref rid="tpx137C33" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al. 2012</xref>). The differential expression of these methylation-related transcripts implies that there is epigenetic regulation of gene expression during drought stress in <italic>P. halepensis</italic> that might be partially related to transposable elements activation. A growing body of evidence suggests that transposable elements may play a significant role in responses to environmental stimuli (<xref rid="tpx137C18" ref-type="bibr">Casacuberta and Gonz&#x000e1;lez 2013</xref>). It is not yet clear whether the retrotransposons found in this study are active. However, we speculate that the potential activity of retrotransposons during recovery from drought stress might increase tissue genetic variation, thereby improving the plant&#x02019;s ability to adapt to future stress that may be imposed by the changing environment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="tpx137s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Climate change, which is leading to increased mean temperatures and is expected to decrease annual precipitation levels in the Eastern Mediterranean region, is also characterized by large inter-annual variations in rainfall, which are becoming increasingly common (<xref rid="tpx137C39" ref-type="bibr">Giorgi and Lionello 2008</xref>). Adaptation of trees to drought and the ability to efficiently utilize sporadic rain events are crucial for forest tree survival. The available genomic tools allow the elucidation of molecular responses of drought-adaptive species for which we have no prior genomic information. The current study demonstrates this approach and exposes mechanisms that otherwise would not have been exposed. In addition, the large number of transcripts without annotation noted in this study underscores the untapped potential for the identification of novel functional genes in non-model species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="supplementaryfigure1.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup2"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="supplementarytable2.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup3"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="supplementarytable3.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup4"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="supplementarytable4.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup5"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="supplementaryfigure2.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup6"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="supplementaryfigure3.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup7"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="supplementarytable1.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="tpx137ack1"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Prof. Joseph Riov and Dr Einat Sadot for their valuable help with the rooting technique and Robert Sitbun, Guy Halperin and Gil Lerner for their technical help.
