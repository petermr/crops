Two genes from strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa), encoding an alcohol acyltransferase (SAAT) and a linalool/nerolidol synthase (FaNES), were cloned in L. lactis and actively expressed using the nisin-induced expression system. The specific activity of SAAT could be improved threefold (up to 564 pmol octyl acetate h-1 mg protein-1) by increasing the concentration of tRNA1Arg, which is a rare tRNA molecule in L. lactis. Fermentation tests with GM17 medium and milk with recombinant L. lactis strains expressing SAAT or FaNES resulted in the production of octyl acetate (1.9 microM) and linalool (85 nM) to levels above their odor thresholds in water. The results illustrate the potential of the application of L. lactis as a food grade expression platform for the recombinant production of proteins and bioactive compounds from plants.",NaN,[],[],[],[],[],NaN
1,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC1876254\eupmc_result.json,PMC1876254,"Results Identification of tomato terpene synthases 1 and 2 ( LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2) In order to identify tomato monoterpene synthases that are induced upon spider mite herbivory, we first queried tomato EST databases (www.tigr.org and www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) with known monoterpene synthase sequences from other plant species. Retrieved tomato EST sequences were used to design a primer specific for monoterpene synthases (Fig.  1). We then used cDNA derived from spider mite-infested plants, to amplify a single 850 bp fragment with this primer and an oligo dT(18) primer. This fragment was subsequently used as a probe to screen available tomato cDNA libraries. Two different full-length cDNAs were identified;  LeMTS1 (AY840091) was isolated from tomato leaves (sequence identical to the probe) and  LeMTS2 (AY840092) from tomato roots and stems. The  LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2 open reading frames encode proteins of 609 and 590 amino acids (Fig.  1), which have predicted masses of 70.8 and 68.6 kDa, respectively, and are 71% identical. LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 contain amino acid motifs conserved in angiosperm (mono)terpene synthases. These are, based on LeMTS1 amino acid positions: R(45)R(46)W(55), required for the initial diphosphate migration (Williams et al.  1998); D(362)D(363)D(366), required for binding of a Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ ion, which is used as cofactor (Cane et al.  1996; Starks et al.  1997); D(505)T(509)E(513), required for binding of a second Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ cofactor; and D(586) in the active site cleft (Schwab et al.  2001; Whittington et al.  2002). LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 contain both putative (predicted with TargetP; Emanuelsson et al.  2000) plastid targeting signal peptides, which should be processed in the region upstream of the conserved R(45)R(46) arginine pair.  Remarkably, LeMTS1 contains an extra sequence stretch of 22 amino acids starting at N170 (Fig.  1). This sequence is not found in any other terpene synthase, nor does it have homology to any protein in the NCBI database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Its presence can also not be explained by alternative splicing since the flanks do not contain canonical splice sites. This extra internal element is not an artefact of the isolated cDNA since it was present in four independent cDNAs isolated from different organs (data not shown). LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 belong to the TPSb subfamily of terpene synthases LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 are more similar to typical monoterpene synthases from, e.g., mint and citrus than to a typical tomato sesquiterpene synthase (Fig.  1). Based on protein sequence relatedness, LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 can be classified in the  TPSb subfamily (Fig.  2), a distinct group of angiosperm monoterpene synthases, according to the original classification proposed by Bohlmann et al. ( 1997). So, unlike the snapdragon ( Antirrhinum majus) monoterpene synthases from subfamily TPSg (Dudareva et al.  2003), including an Arabidopsis and a strawberry terpene synthase, the monoterpene synthases from the solanaceous family do not seem to form a new subfamily.  Terpene synthase activity of recombinant LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 Recombinant LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 proteins were produced in  Escherichia coli in order to characterize their enzymatic activities. The plastid targeting peptide was deleted up to one amino acid upstream of the RRX 8W motif (Fig.  1) to produce a His-tagged ‘pseudo-mature’ form of the proteins, since it has been reported that this can improve protein expression without affecting activity and product specificity of the enzymes (Bohlmann et al.  1999; Williams et al.  1998). The soluble protein fractions were assayed for terpene synthase activity and products were analyzed on a GC coupled to a Time Of Flight-MS. Using the monoterpene precursor geranyl diphosphate (GPP) as substrate, LeMTS1 generated only linalool whereas LeMTS2 generated several monoterpene products: β-phellandrene, β-myrcene, and sabinene (Fig.  3a). Mass spectra and relative retention indices (Adams  2001) or authentic standards confirmed the identification of terpene reaction products. Extracts of  E. coli cells expressing the empty vector control generated minor amounts of linalool (Fig.  3a) and occasionally geraniol. Thermally induced autoconversion or solvolysis of GPP to linalool has been observed before (Crowell et al.  2002; Jia et al.  1999), as well as conversion to geraniol by aspecific hydrolase or phosphatase activity in protein extracts (Crowell et al.  2002). However, LeMTS1 product levels are several hundred-fold higher than the background levels of the control (Fig.  3a).  Enantiomer separation on an enantiomer-selective column showed that LeMTS1 produced only ( R)-linalool (data not shown). LeMTS1 was also able to utilize the sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as substrate to produce ( E)-nerolidol (Fig.  3b), whereas LeMTS2 had no detectable sesquiterpene synthase activity. Both enzymes were unable to form terpene products from the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate. LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2 are differentially expressed in various plant organs We investigated the organ specificity of  LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2 expression in a mature (13 weeks old) tomato plant (Fig.  4a). Transcripts of  LeMTS1 were detected in young fruit, flower buds, petals, sepals, stems, petioles, and in young leaves. The expression pattern of  LeMTS2 was very different: no transcripts were detected in petals, sepals, and leaves. However,  LeMTS2 was expressed in roots.  For plants that contain glandular trichomes, monoterpene production is considered to be localized exclusively in these organs (Gershenzon et al.  1992; Iijima et al.  2004; Kutchan  2005; Turner et al.  1999; Turner and Croteau  2004). Tomato plants possess several types of trichomes including glandular trichomes that are present in high density on leaves, petioles, and stems and that contain terpenes (Maluf et al.  2001; Snyder and Carter  1985). Therefore, we investigated the location of  LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2 expression in trichomes of petioles and stems. This showed that  LeMTS1 is expressed in trichomes, whereas  LeMTS2 is expressed in the complementary tissue (Fig.  4b). LeMTS1 but not  LeMTS2 is induced by spider mite feeding, artificial wounding, and jasmonic acid To study whether  LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2 were induced upon spider mite feeding, changes in transcript levels of intact plants were analyzed by RT-PCR since  LeMTS gene-expression was too low to determine by RNA gel-blot analysis. Expression of  LeMTS1 was indeed induced in leaves by spider mite-feeding, but  LeMTS2, which expression was very low in leaves, was not (Fig.  5a). Spider mites damage plant tissue and induce JA- and SA-responsive genes such as a wound-induced proteinase inhibitor ( WIPI-II) and a pathogenesis related protein ( PRP6), respectively (Kant et al.  2004). Therefore, we investigated the effects of artificial wounding and exogenous application of JA and SA (Fig.  5a). Both artificial wounding and JA induced  LeMTS1. In contrast,  LeMTS2 was not induced by these treatments (Fig.  5a). SA-treatment induced the SA-marker  PRP6 but neither  LeMTS1 nor  LeMTS2 was increased. Induction of  LeMTS1 and  WIPI-II was validated by real-time Q-RT-PCR. This showed consistent and clear induction of both genes by JA, artificial wounding and spider mites, although there was large variation in the level of induction between independent experiments (Fig.  5b). We routinely used the tomato cultivar Moneymaker for our experiments. However, in our earlier work (Ament et al.  2004; Kant et al.  2004) the cultivar Castlemart (CM) was used because it has the same genetic background as the  defenseless1 ( def-1) mutant (Howe et al.  1996). Here, we show that spider mite- and JA-induced  LeMTS1 expression occurred both in CM and Moneymaker (Fig.  5b).  To investigate whether spider mite-induced expression of  LeMTS1 was dependent on JA or SA we made use of the  def-1 mutant, which is impaired in induced JA-accumulation (Howe et al.  1996) and the SA-deficient, transgenic  NahG tomato line (Brading et al.  2000). In plants with the  def-1 mutation,  LeMTS1 was not induced by spider mites, whereas the expression could be induced by exogenous JA (Fig.  6a). In contrast, the  NahG plants showed higher and clearly induced  LeMTS1 expression (Fig.  6b). This shows that induction of  LeMTS1 expression is dependent on JA but not on SA.  JA induces expression of  LeMTS1 in trichomes Since basal LeMTS1 expression in stems and petioles seemed to be restricted to trichomes (Fig.  4b), we addressed the question whether JA would induce expression of LeMTS1 solely in trichomes or also in other tissues. Indeed, JA-induced LeMTS1 expression was strongest in trichomes (Fig.  7). Interestingly, WIPI-II expression showed the opposite pattern. WIPI-II expression is very low in trichomes and basal as well as strongly induced WIPI-II expression occurred mainly in the complementary stem tissues.  Linalool accumulates in glandular trichomes and linalool emission is induced by wounding, jasmonic acid, and by ectopic  LeMTS1 overexpression Figure  4b showed that, in petioles and stems,  LeMTS1 was expressed specifically in the trichomes. Extraction of terpenes from the same tissues of that experiment demonstrated that linalool was produced predominantly in trichomes (Fig.  8). ( E)-nerolidol and β-phellandrene also accumulated in trichomes. Conversely, the volatile benzenoid methyl-salicylate was not produced in trichomes and was also clearly detected in roots, in contrast to most terpenes.  Because  LeMTS1 was induced by spider mite-infestation, wounding and JA, we investigated whether the emission of its in vitro products was induced concomitantly. Analysis of volatile production during 2 days of wounding or JA-treatment, conditions that induce  LeMTS1 expression (Fig.  5), revealed that plants emitted more linalool after both treatments (Fig.  9a), while nerolidol emission was not induced.  Next, we tried to overexpress the full length  LeMTS1 cDNA (including the putative targeting peptide) in tomato plants, under control of the CaMV 35S promoter. Four transformation experiments yielded only two transformants of which one overexpressed  LeMTS1. Compared to empty vector-transformed plants,  LeMTS1 overexpressing plants emitted several hundred-fold more linalool into the plants headspace (Fig.  9b), while emission of other terpenes, including nerolidol, did not differ significantly from control plants. This suggests that LeMTS1 functions in planta as a true linalool synthase.","Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plants emit a blend of volatile organic compounds, which mainly consists of terpenes. Upon herbivory or wounding, the emission of several terpenes increases. We have identified and characterized the first two tomato monoterpene synthases, LeMTS1 and LeMTS2. Although these proteins were highly homologous, recombinant LeMTS1 protein produced (R)-linalool from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and (E)-nerolidol from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), while recombinant LeMTS2 produced beta-phellandrene, beta-myrcene, and sabinene from GPP. In addition, these genes were expressed in different tissues: LeMTS1 was expressed in flowers, young leaves, stems, and petioles, while LeMTS2 was strongest expressed in stems and roots. LeMTS1 expression in leaves was induced by spider mite-infestation, wounding and jasmonic acid (JA)-treatment, while LeMTS2 did not respond to these stimuli. The expression of LeMTS1 in stems and petioles was predominantly detected in trichomes and could be induced by JA. Because JA treatment strongly induced emission of linalool and overexpression of LeMTS1 in tomato resulted in increased production of linalool, we propose that LeMTS1 is a genuine linalool synthase. Our results underline the importance of trichomes in JA-induced terpene emission in tomato.",NaN,"['Fig.', 'expression', 'induced', 'trichomes', 'monoterpene synthases', 'tomato EST', 'tomato', 'synthases', 'plants', 'synthase']","[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/, LeMTS2, D(362)D(363)D(366, Mg 2, Cane et al., D(505)T(509)E(513, Mg 2, D(586, LeMTS2, TargetP, LeMTS2, TPSb, LeMTS2, LeMTS2, LeMTS2, LeMTS2, Flight-MS, LeMTS2, Crowell et , hydrolase, Crowell et al., LeMTS2, mite-feeding, JA-, wound-induced proteinase inhibitor ( WIPI-II, PRP6, JA, SA (Fig.  , JA, JA-induced  LeMTS1, SA, JA, WIPI-II, WIPI-II, WIPI-II, E)-nerolidol, β-phellandrene, JA]","['TPSb', 'TPSb', 'TPSg']",[],[],terpene synthase
2,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC2459234\eupmc_result.json,PMC2459234,"Results Timing of egg parasitoid attraction to  P. sylvestris foliage Behavioral bioassays were conducted to study the parasitoid’s response to pine odor after different periods of time after sawfly egg deposition. The parasitic wasps showed a significantly positive response to odor from pine twigs laden with pine sawfly eggs for 72 h, thus confirming previous results (Hilker et al.  2002b,  2005; Mumm et al.  2003). However, at shorter (48 h) or longer (96 h) times after oviposition, the odor of pine twigs did not attract the parasitoids (Table  1). Cloning of sesquiterpene synthases from  P. sylvestris By the use of degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of known conifer sesquiterpene synthases and 5′-and 3′-RACE-PCR cloning strategies, three different cDNA clones containing open reading frames (ORFs) of terpene synthases were obtained from RNA isolated from oviposition-induced  P. sylvestris twigs (72 h after egg deposition). The clones were designated  PsTPS 1, 1,728 bp encoding an ORF of 576 amino acids;  PsTPS 2, 1,878 bp encoding an ORF of 626 amino acids, and  PsTPS 3, 1,743 bp encoding an ORF of 581 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequences of all three clones, when compared with other conifer terpene synthases, showed the two typical aspartate-rich DDxxD motifs which are involved in coordinating the bivalent metal ion for substrate binding (Bohlmann et al.  1999). In  PsTPS 1 and  PsTPS 2, an RR(x8)W motif was found near the N-terminus which might be important for catalysis (Pechous and Whitaker  2004). Furthermore, all three sequences show an RxR motif implicated in the complexation of the diphosphate function after ionization of the substrate, which prevents nucleophilic attack on any of the carbocationic intermediates formed subsequently (Starks et al.  1997). Analysis of the N-terminus of  PsTPS 2 suggested the presence of a 37-amino acid plastid transit peptide ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/) (Emanuelsson et al.  2000). Even though plastid targeting peptides are typical of plant monoterpene synthases (Bohlmann et al.  1998), the  PsTPS 2 sequence was most similar to those of sesquiterpene synthases (Fig.  1) when disregarding the putative signal peptide.  In summary, the three  P. sylvestris cDNAs showed greatest amino acid identity (60–80%) to three other conifer sesquiterpene synthases. In comparison with each other, the  P. sylvestris cDNAs had identities ranging from 60 to 65%, ignoring the signal peptide of  PsTPS 2 (Table  2).  Functional expression of  P. sylvestris sesquiterpene synthases The three  P. sylvestris sesquiterpene synthases were heterologously expressed in  E. coli, and the crude bacterial extracts containing recombinant protein were incubated with prenyl diphosphates. Product formation was observed for farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), but no terpenoid products were detected after incubation with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). Control bacterial extracts containing the empty vector control did not show any enzyme activity. PsTPS 1 formed only two main products: ( E)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, 76.3 and 23.7%, respectively, of total sesquiterpene peak area (Fig.  2a). No other terpenoid products were detectable.  For  PsTPS 2, assays were performed with the full ORF and with a construct in which the presumptive 37-amino acid plastid targeting sequence was removed. Both forms gave one major product from FPP, 1(10),5-germacradiene-4-ol (41.5% of total sesquiterpene peak area), and two minor products, β-elemene (19.2%) and bicyclogermacrene (13.2%). The detected β-elemene likely results from the heat-induced rearrangement of germacrene A during gas chromatography (de Kraker et al.  1998). In addition,  PsTPS 2 catalyzes the production of some products below 10% abundance, one of which was tentatively identified by its mass spectrum as α-amorphene (Fig.  2b). PsTPS 3 incubated with FPP produced longifolene as a main product with about 64.2% of total sesquiterpene peak area, α-longipinene in smaller amounts (11.2%), and three minor peaks tentatively identified as α-ylangene, longicyclene and longiborneol (Fig.  2c). None of the three expressed terpene synthases produced ( E)-β-farnesene, the terpene induced by  D. pini oviposition for which a specific role in egg parasitoid attraction had been documented in previous studies (Mumm et al.  2003; Mumm and Hilker  2005). The presence of sesquiterpene synthase products in pine needles Both pine needles 72 h after egg deposition and the artificially wounded tissue contained the major products of the cloned sesquiterpene synthases: ( E)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene (the main products of recombinant  PsTPS 1), β-elemene, bicyclogermacrene, and 1(10),5-germacradiene-4-ol (the major products of recombinant  PsTPS 2), and longifolene (the dominant product of recombinant  PsTPS 3). In oviposition-induced pine needles, the main products of  PsTPS 1 and  PsTPS 2 were slightly more accumulated (1.035 and 1.12 times more) when comparing with artificially wounded control samples (Fig.  3). The content of sesquiterpenes in artificially wounded needles used for calibration were 32 μg/g FW ± 3.2 β-elemene, 54 μg/g FW ± 4.8 ( E)-β-caryophyllene, 9.2 μg/g FW ± 1.1 α-humulene, 41 μg/g FW ± 5.3 bicyclogermacrene, and 205 μg/g FW ± 16 1(10),5-germacradiene-4-ol. Longifolene was detected only in traces.  The effect of oviposition on sesquiterpene synthase transcript levels Sawfly oviposition on pine significantly affected transcript levels of  PsTPS 1 and  PsTPS 2 when compared to artificially wounded pine. In contrast, no such significant treatment (oviposition) effect was detectable for  PsTPS 3 . Transcript levels of  PsTPS 1 and  PsTPS 2 also changed significantly over time with a striking increase 72 h after oviposition. In contrast, no such time effect was found for  PsTPS 3 (Fig.  4, Supplemental data Table S2). The results in Table  1 show that odor from  P. sylvestris twigs was significantly attractive to the egg parasitoid  C. ruforum only 72 h after  D. pini oviposition. At this time, steady state transcript levels of  PsTPS 1 and  PsTPS 2 were on average 1.9 fold and 2.6 fold higher, respectively, than those from non-attractive control twigs 72 h after artificial wounding (Fig.  4a, b). ","Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris; Pinaceae, Pinales) is known to defend against egg deposition by herbivorous sawflies by changing its terpenoid volatile blend. The oviposition-induced pine odor attracts egg parasitoids that kill the sawfly eggs. Here, we investigated whether sawfly egg deposition activates genes encoding pine terpene synthases by extracting mRNA from oviposition-induced P. sylvestris. Three new sesquiterpene synthases, PsTPS 1, PsTPS 2, and PsTPS 3, were isolated that were shown on heterologous expression in Escherichia coli to produce (E)-beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene (PsTPS 1), 1(10),5-germacradiene-4-ol (PsTPS 2), and longifolene and alpha-longipinene (PsTPS 3) as their principal products. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that transcript levels of PsTPS 1 and PsTPS 2 were significantly higher in oviposition-induced twigs that were attractive to the parasitoids than in non-attractive, artificially damaged twigs. Thus, our results demonstrate a specific transcription response to egg deposition, distinct from that caused by artificial wounding. Transcripts of PsTPS 3 did not change in response to egg deposition. The transcript levels of PsTPS 1, PsTPS 2, and PsTPS 3 were also determined in relation to time after egg deposition, since pine odor is attractive to the parasitoid only 72 h after egg deposition. Transcription rates of PsTPS 1 and PsTPS 2 were significantly enhanced only 72 h after egg deposition, thus matching the timing of odor attractiveness, while for PsTPS 3, enhanced transcription was not detected at any time period studied after egg deposition. The ecological significance of the oviposition-induced increase of sesquiterpene synthase transcripts is discussed.",NaN,"['PsTPS', 'sesquiterpene synthases', 'foliage Behavioral', 'Behavioral bioassays', 'sesquiterpene', 'Fig.', 'synthases', 'products', 'Results Timing', 'recombinant PsTPS']","[5′-and 3′-RACE-PCR, RR(x8)W, 60–80, farnesyl diphosphate, geranyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPP, 37-amino acid, α-longipinene, Mumm, Mumm, μg/g FW ±, μg/g FW ±, μg/g FW ±, μg/g FW ±, μg/g FW ±]","['PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS']",['C.'],[],terpene synthase
3,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC2515324\eupmc_result.json,PMC2515324,"Results Overview Actinidia cDNA libraries were constructed mainly from four  Actinidia species:  A. deliciosa, A. chinensis, A. eriantha and  A. arguta (Table  1, Additional file  2). The libraries were constructed from petals, fruits, buds and leaves, with a small number from roots and cell culture and sequenced from the 5' end. The average edited sequence length of the 132,577 ESTs was 503 bases. Clustering these sequences using a 95% threshold resulted in 18,070 tentative consensus (TC) sequences (average length 577 bases), with 23,788 ESTs remaining as singletons. The combination of TCs and singletons are referred to as non redundant (NR) clusters. These numbers are similar to those observed with apple [ 10]. Over 95% of TCs had fewer than 18 EST members, and the largest single TC had 758 members. It should be noted that  A. chinensis and  A. deliciosa are more closely related to each other than the other species mentioned in this paper, and that only a restricted number of genotypes within each species was used in making EST libraries compared to the total numbers available. Sequence analysis Codon usage Knowledge of the GC content of a genome and codon usage is useful when devising PCR-based strategies for mapping and gene isolation, as well as for hybridization studies by microarray. Based on the coding regions of 302  A. deliciosa, 319  A. chinensis and 84  A. eriantha full-length cDNAs, the GC content in the third base position was estimated to be 55%, 49% and 58%, respectively. These values are higher than the overall GC ratio from the sequences of the complete EST datasets of  A. deliciosa (46%),  A. chinensis (46%) and  A. eriantha (48%), indicating that there is some pressure, particularly in  A. deliciosa and  A. eriantha, towards an increased GC ratio in coding regions compared with non-translated regions. Overall the codon usage of the three  Actinidia species is similar, although not identical (Additional file  3).  A. deliciosa and  A. eriantha differ in only their preference for aspartate (GAT/GAC) and serine (TCT/TCC). In contrast, comparative codon preferences between  A. deliciosa and  A. chinensis show differences for alanine (GCC/GCT), glycine (GGC/GGA), isoleucine (ATC/ATT), leucine (CTC/TTG), asparagine (AAC/AAT), glutamine (CAG/CAA), threonine (ACC/ACT) and valine (GTG/GTT). In most of these codons,  A. chinensis shows a greater preference for an A or T in the third base position, accounting for its lower GC third base percentage when compared with the other two species. Polymorphisms and genetic markers Both SNPs and microsatellites or SSRs are valuable tools for genetic mapping within breeding populations of many crops. A total of 32,764 biallelic SNPs were detected from the overlapping regions of 3,901 (21.6%) of the 18,070 TCs, at a rate of one SNP every 417 bp. This frequency is higher than that reported in apple using a dataset of comparable size (one SNP per 706 bp from ~150,000 ESTs [ 10]). As several  Actinidia species were used to construct the cDNA libraries, while the apple cDNA libraries were from different varieties of the same species, this increased frequency of SNPs could reflect the greater genetic diversity in the surveyed  Actinidia EST libraries. For example the frequency in apple increased significantly to 1 in 149 bp when a greater diversity of genotypes was added (Chagne  et al unpublished results). The polyploidy nature of several of the  Actinidia species used may also have affected SNP frequencies. As a result of this, some of the SNPs identified may not be allelic in nature but due to homoeologous or paralogous sequences clustering in the same TC. EST-derived SSRs have already been shown to be valuable mapping tools in  Actinidia chinensis [ 14] where 150 SSRs with more than 10 dinucleotide repeat units were tested as markers in an  A. chinensis mapping population. More than 90% of the SSR markers were polymorphic and segregated within the population. Subsequently, 20 of these SSRs were shown to be transportable across multiple species of  Actinidia, showing the value of this resource [ 15]. Compared with apple [ 10], where less than 20% of the NRs contained a microsatellite, over 30% of  Actinidia NRs were found to have at least one. The other major difference between apple and  Actinidia was that, while di- and tri-nucleotide repeats were equally frequent in apple at 7 to 8% frequency, di-nucleotide repeats (18%) were twice as frequent as tri-nucleotide repeats (9%) in  Actinidia. Tetra-nucleotide repeats were found at similar frequencies in NRs for the two genera. The lengths of the SSRs were similar in both apple and  Actinidia, with 50% of the repeats having between 12 and 14 bases. As in apple, AG repeats were the most frequent (16% of NRs, significantly more frequent than in apple) and were followed by AT (1.2%) and AC (0.8%) while GC repeats were very infrequent. The position of SSRs in relation to the putative initiation ATG was very similar when comparing  Actinidia with other plants such as  Arabidopsis and apple [ 10, 20], with di-nucleotide repeats being predominantly (93%) in the 5' UTR, and tri-nucleotide repeats being more evenly distributed along the gene (37%). Comparative genomic DNA hybridizations by microarray A 17,472 feature  Actinidia oligonucleotide microarray was constructed based on sequence data from the  Actinidia EST database. The 44–55 mer oligonucleotides were derived from gene sequences of different  Actinidia species (Additional file  4). To test the cross hybridization between the different genomes of the  Actinidia species, genomic DNA from two  Actinidia species ( A. deliciosa and  A. eriantha) was hybridized to two different microarray slides. A plot of average signal intensity for the two species against each other is shown in Fig.  2. Of the 13,443 informative features, the majority (98.4%) showed a similar level of hybridization between the two species (less than an average of 2-fold change), with 172 showing a higher signal intensity in  A. deliciosa (plus symbols, Fig.  2), and 44 showing a higher intensity in  A. eriantha (triangles, Fig.  2). There was no correlation between the species from which the oligonucleotide was derived and the increased or decreased level of hybridization (Table  2). Consequently, the increases are probably due to separate gene duplications in each species. Functional analysis Highly populated tentative consensus sequences The TC with the greatest number of ESTs was a cysteine proteinase (actinidin family, 758 members) followed by a metallothionein (547 members) (Additional file  5). However, when similar proteins were taken into account (i.e. different TCs that all matched a common  Arabidopsis protein as their closest homolog with E < 1.0e -100), there were 1,266 ESTs matching cysteine proteinases followed by 769 metallothionein protein-encoding ESTs. It was not surprising to identify the cysteine protease actinidin as the most highly abundant TC cluster in  Actinidia. Actinidin can constitute up to 50% of soluble protein in mature  A. deliciosa fruit at harvest [ 21]. Recent research has shown that this cysteine protease exists in basic and acidic forms and the amount of each form varies between species, with fruit of the important  A. chinensis cultivar 'Hort16A' being almost devoid of acidic actinidin [ 22]. ESTs for actinidin occur throughout the fruit libraries that make up the database, and these cluster into 10 distinct genes/alleles [ 22]. As two of the key fruit libraries were subtracted for actinidin, the number of ESTs in the TC is likely to be an under-representation of the actual number. The function of this protease may be related to insect defense [ 23]. The metallothionein TC cluster contains a gene (pKIWI504) previously identified in kiwifruit [ 24] as being highly expressed in young fruit with reduced expression in the later stages of fruit development. However, the  in vivo function of the metallothionein TC cluster is currently unknown. Interestingly, pineapple also had a high proportion of metallothionein ESTs [ 11]. Fourteen TCs in  Actinidia with their proteins annotated by BiolView as ""not assigned-unknown"" proteins (i.e. matches to sequences with unknown function from  Arabidopsis or other species) were highly expressed with over 100 EST members. Four of the unassigned TCs contained more than 300 EST members. These four TCs included kiwellin [ 25], which is a homolog to a grape ripening-related protein [ 26] with no  Arabidopsis homologs (527 EST members); a homolog of At5g11420, a protein of unknown function (339 EST members); a senescence-related protein (no  Arabidopsis matches, 311 EST members); and an ABA stress-related protein (no  Arabidopsis matches, 302 EST members). Functional analysis using Mapman and InterPro Functional analysis of ESTs and NRs using Mapman [ 27] is shown in Table  3. The analysis was conducted by identifying each NR's nearest homolog to  Arabidopsis, using BLASTx and identifying domains/families that are indicative for a given function using InterProScan. Then that NR and its member ESTs were assigned to the corresponding bin of the  Arabidopsis match. Of the 41,858 NRs, 28,345 had sufficient homology to an  Arabidopsis sequence to assign it a functional classification in Mapman. Thus, 32% of NRs from  Actinidia had no  Arabidopsis homolog, but a proportion would have homologs in other crops (e.g. genes related to fruit ripening). A comparison of the percentage of NRs assigned to the top level Mapman classification bins and the percentage of  Arabidopsis genes classified in the same bin showed a strong relationship with an r 2 value of 0.96 and a slope of 0.87, near to the expected 1:1 slope. The same relationship when calculated for second level bins gave an r 2 of 0.98 and a slope of 1.14 (second level bin data not shown). Taking only those top level bins that contained more than 100 NRs to remove chance as a major factor, only two bins appeared to be over-represented (i.e. > 2.0 times higher than the mean) in  Actinidia, namely bin 4 (glycolysis) and bin 8 (TCA cycle). This may reflect a high level of primary metabolism in fruit. Interestingly, when all NRs are included, bin 5 (fermentation) and bin 6 (gluconeogenesis) were added to the list of over-represented NRs. The same relationships for potato showed no anomalies (Table  3). This analysis demonstrates that the clustering of ESTs generated a fair representation of the distribution of genes. Overall, the average number of ESTs per NR in the database was 4.0. There were only two bins with a high number of ESTs per NR, bin 15 (metal handling) with over 17 ESTs per NR and bin 22 (polyamine metabolism) with over 9. However, bin 22 had a low number of NR and EST members, suggesting this result may have occurred by chance. In contrast, bin 15 included the metallothioneins and the very highly expressed EST discussed earlier (Additional file  5). TCs with high numbers of ESTs (> 100) came from 18 of the 35 Mapman bins [ 27] with approximately three quarters falling into the bin names ""not assigned, no ontology"", ""protein degradation"", ""metal handling binding chelation and storage"", ""stress biotic"", ""cell wall degradation"" and ""secondary metabolism isoprenoids"". The most common InterPro families [ 28] were also analyzed (Additional file  6). There were 3,111 InterPro families (flagged as true by InterPro) represented in the  Actinidia NRs, with the most NRs found in the protein kinases grouping. Following that were thioredoxins, while cysteine proteinases, which had the highest number of ESTs in the database, were represented as the 7 th most frequently occurring NR. Genes related to flavor and fragrance Understanding the relationship between fruit flavor and the genetic diversity present in the EST database requires a detailed analysis of the flavor and fragrance compounds present in the  Actinidia genus. Fruit and flower samples from the major  Actinidia varieties that were used to produce the EST database were characterized using both headspace sampling and solvent extraction followed by GC-FID/MS analysis. The results of this compound analysis are presented in Additional file  7 for esters (over 55 identified compounds), acids, alcohols and terpenoids. Compound analysis The most abundant volatile compounds in the flowers of these  Actinidia species were alcohols and terpenes.  A. chinensis flowers contained 71% sesquiterpenes, largely dominated by farnesols (Additional file  7).  A. deliciosa flowers had the highest volatile ester content at around 12%, and aromatic (6–9%) and straight-chain alcohols (9%). These flowers were notable for their α-farnesene (12–26%) and germacrene D (0.3–12%) content.  A. arguta flowers contained branched-chain (13%) and aromatic alcohols (14–50%), and monoterpenes (12–24%), which were mostly linalool oxidation products reported previously [ 29].  A. eriantha flowers contained few volatile compounds, the notable ones being 2-phenylethanol (8.5%), 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (also 8.5%), and β-myrcene (5%). The flowers from two further  Actinidia species showed distinct volatile profiles.  A. polygama flowers contained linalool oxides (36.5%) and dehydroiridodial (37%), a monoterpene related to the  Nepeta cataria (catnip) compounds [ 30, 31]. The flowers of  A. indochinensis flowers were dominated by 2-phenylethanol (25.8%) and a couple of terpenes, the major one being linalool (23.6%). The aromas from these flowers have also had descriptors attached (McNeilage et al. unpublished observations). For example  A. eriantha has been described as coconut and berry, and  A. arguta with descriptors including sweet, lime, rose and vanilla [ 29].  A chinensis and  A. deliciosa are described as having tea-rose aromas, sweet, fresh, lilac and violet, while  A. polygama has gardenia and lime descriptors. These descriptors reflect the diversity of volatile compounds found in the  Actinidia flowers. In fruit, esters accounted for up to 85% of the total volatiles. The main  A. chinensis esters were the fresh, fruity ethyl butanoate which, depending upon analytical method and genotype, ranged from 3 to 54%, and butyl butanoate, both of which are common fruit esters [ 32].  A. chinensis 'Hort16A' fruit contained significant amounts of eucalyptol (0.2 to 21%) which has been described as having a fresh, pungent cooling taste [ 32]. Acetaldehyde, hexanal, E-2-hexenal and ethyl butanoate are known to be important contributors to Hort16A aromas [ 33]. Ethyl butanoate along with methyl butanoate and ethyl acetate were the major (~60%) compounds in the green  A. deliciosa fruit and are known to be major volatile contributors to its flavor [ 34]. The other major compound was ethanol (16%), with only trace levels of other alcohols and terpenes. Whilst at more modest levels in  A. arguta fruit (2–8%), ethyl butanoate was still substantial.  A. arguta fruit were notable for their content of methyl- and ethyl benzoate, which are responsible for the distinctive aroma of feijoa ( Feijoa sellowiana O. Berg) fruit [ 35], and also camphor (7%). The dominant ester in  A. eriantha fruit was butyl acetate (12%), a flavor compound found in many fruit, which has a strong, fruity odor and a taste reminiscent of pineapple [ 32, 36]. However, the total volatile level in  A. eriantha is lower than other species and the number of esters is also lower (Additional file  7). Ester biosynthesis Esters are synthesized from their acid and alcohol precursors by acyltransferases (ATs). We identified 30 ATs in the  Actinidia EST database, of which 25 are full length. These sequences were analyzed for their phylogenetic relationship with other plant ATs of known function (Fig.  3). Two clades were identified that contained enzymes involved in the synthesis of flavor-related esters (Clades 1 and 2 in Fig.  3). The first contained alcohol acyltransferases (AATs) from apple, melon and banana and nine AATs from  Actinidia (AdAT1, AdAT2, AeAT9, AcAT15, AcAT16, AdAT17, AaAT18, AcAT20, AcAT23), while the second clade contained AATs from strawberry and three AATs from  Actinidia (AdAT6, AdAT22, AcAT24). An  Actinidia AT predicted to be involved in esterifying anthocyanins (AcAT25) and two ATs predicted to be anthranilate acyltransferases (AdAT8, AcAT21) were also identified. Three  Actinidia ATs were closely related to the carboxylesterase-related protein 2 CER2 and therefore predicted to be elongases (AcAT30, AcAT27 and AcAT26) possibly involved in wax production. Multiple sequences of the same genes were recovered for some genes reflecting orthologs, alleles or sequences from different genomes within polyploid genomes. For example, the three ATs, AcAT16, AdAT17 and AdAT1, and the two ATs, AaAT18 and AdAT2, are probable variants of just two different AATs.  A. deliciosa is a hexaploid (6n) possibly explaining this multiplicity of genes. We may have uncovered at least one instance where, for a single AAT, all three genomic versions have been isolated (AcAT16, AdAT17 and AdAT1). Carboxylesterases conduct the opposite reaction to ATs, i.e. the hydrolysis of esters into acids and alcohols [ 37]. As well as ester hydrolysis, plant carboxylesterases have been implicated in isoflavonoid biosynthesis [ 38], plant defense [ 39], and hormone regulation [ 40]. Analysis of  Actinidia flowers and fruits showed a wide range of acids and alcohols (Additional file  7). Previously published plant carboxylesterase (CXE) genes from GenBank were used to identify CXE genes in the  Actinidia EST database using BLAST searches. The sequence alignment of CXEs revealed amino acid motifs and secondary structural features characteristic for members of the α/β hydrolase fold superfamily and more particularly of CXEs such as an active site serine surrounded by a GXSXG motif. In  Actinidia 19 CXEs were identified, 18 of which are full length (Fig.  4). These include CXE members likely to encode gibberellin receptors (AdCXE9, AdCXE17, AdCXE15), an isoflavanone dehydratase (AeCXE11) and an ortholog of a plant defense-associated CXE (AcCXE12). Other CXEs from  Actinidia align well with  Arabidopsis CXEs and can be associated with the classes identified elsewhere [ 41]. The structure of an  Actinidia CXE is now available (AeCXE1), the first plant CXE to have its structure solved [ 42]. AeCXE1 can hydrolyze a range of substrates from C2 to C16 esters, with a preference for C4 moieties. There are two CXEs from  Actinidia (AdCXE16, AaCXE2) that may be orthologs to AeCXE1 from  A. eriantha. Terpene biosynthesis Actinidia terpenoid compounds such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) diterpenes (C20), triterpenes (C30), carotenoids, sterols, phytols and quinones are derived from two common precursor molecules, isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate. These precursors are produced via the cytoplasmic mevalonate pathway or the chloroplastic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (mevalonate-independent) pathway [ 43]. Genes for enzymes in both these pathways are present in the  Actinidia EST database, with the results for analysis of ESTs in the early steps of the mevalonate pathway shown in Fig.  5. The conversion of these precursors into other intermediates of the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway, including geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate, is carried out by polyisoprene synthase genes (EC 2.5.1.x). Over 200 ESTs with sequence homology to known polyisoprene synthase genes were found in the  Actinidia EST database including 116 ESTs with similarity to dimethyallyltranstransferase (EC 2.5.1.1), 66 ESTs with homology to known monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases and 38 ESTs homologous to squalene synthase (EC 2.2.1.21). No ESTs for phytoene synthase (EC 2.5.1.32) were identified. The EST database collection has been used to identify a multifunctional terpene synthase gene from  A. deliciosa flowers that produces the sesquiterpene germacrene D and a range of other sesquiterpene products at lower abundance [ 44]. This gene is represented by 10 sequences in the EST database. Genes related to color Chlorophyll catabolism Green fleshed commercial kiwifruit such as  A. deliciosa 'Hayward' are characterized by the retention of chlorophylls in the flesh of ripe fruit [ 45]. In contrast, the newer yellow-fleshed fruit cultivars (e.g.  A. chinensis 'Hort16A' and 'Jintao') degrade the chlorophyll during ripening and the consequent loss of the green color uncovers the underlying yellow carotenoid pigmentation. The degradation of chlorophylls (leading to the production of colorless breakdown products) is controlled by catabolic enzymes in the chlorophyll degradation pathway [ 46].  Actinidia ESTs discovered in the pathway of chlorophyll breakdown are shown in Fig.  6. Chlorophyllase is the first enzyme of the catabolic pathway and it removes the phytol chain from chlorophyll  a. Homologs of this enzyme have been mainly identified in libraries of vegetative tissues (breaking buds, leaves and petals) of  A. deliciosa and  A. chinensis. Homologs of pheophorbide  a oxygenase have also been identified, with eight ESTs representing two genes from fruit libraries of  A. chinensis. This enzyme is responsible for opening the tetrapyrrolic ring of the chlorophyll molecules, the critical step for the loss of green color. Surprisingly, we did not identify any ESTs of red chlorophyll catabolite reductase, an enzyme associated with pheophorbide  a oxygenase and required to complete the porphyrin ring opening and the degradation of chlorophyll. Carotenoid biosynthesis The fruit of many  Actinidia species contain a range of carotenoid pigments, including β-carotene and lutein [ 45]. The yellow-fleshed kiwifruit  A. chinensis 'Hort16A' develops as a green-fleshed fruit, but on ripening the chlorophyll is degraded exposing the carotenoids in the yellow flesh. ESTs for most steps in the biosynthesis of carotenoids [ 47- 49] are present in the  Actinidia EST database (Fig.  7), except the first step, phytoene synthase. Ninety eight ESTs for phytoene desaturase were identified, with 94 coming from  A. deliciosa libraries, and the remainder from  A. chinensis libraries. Of these 98 ESTs, 90 came from a single  A. deliciosa fruit library with eight from bud and meristem libraries. Of the 56 ESTs found for lycopene β-cyclase, 23 were from petal tissues and 32 from fruit libraries. These ESTs were largely found in libraries from  A. deliciosa (31) and  A. chinensis (24), with only one EST from  A. eriantha. In contrast, only a single EST was found for lycopene ε-cyclase, which is the enzyme required with lycopene β-cyclase to convert lycopene to α-carotene [ 50]. There were five ESTs of β-carotene hydroxylase found in petal (3), leaf (1) and dormant bud (1) libraries, but only a single EST was present for ε-carotene hydroxylase. Both of these enzymes are required for lutein synthesis [ 51]. Flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis Flavonoids are polyphenolic secondary metabolites synthesized through the phenylpropanoid pathway [ 52]. Anthocyanins are a subgroup of the flavonoids, which appear red to blue, depending on the pH, due to additions to their phenolic rings. In red fruit of  A. chinensis and  A. deliciosa, the predominant anthocyanins are cyanidin-based and the preferred glycosylation is in the 3' position [ 53]. While many of the kiwifruit libraries came from tissue with low levels of anthocyanins, several libraries were derived from tissue containing anthocyanins, including red fruits, brown skins and pink petals, leaves and buds (Additional file  2a). The anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway was analyzed by BLAST searching for ESTs representing different enzymes in the pathway (Fig.  8). Chalcone synthase (CHS) was a highly represented gene family in the EST database with ~300 ESTs. There appeared to be three distinct CHS NRs, possibly representing three genes, that are found in mostly young  A. eriantha fruit libraries, as well as in bud and petal libraries. There was only one apparent chalcone isomerase (CHI) NR and over half the ESTs for this gene were found in shoot and bud libraries. Two distinct flavanol 3-hydroxylase (F3H) NRs were found, with ESTs predominantly found in bud and cell culture libraries. Only one flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H) NR was found, from  A. eriantha fruit, while ESTs for two distinct flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) NRs were predominantly found in shoot and bud libraries. Of the four potential dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) NRs, the most highly represented was found in bud and young fruit. Three NRs, perhaps representing three gene families, of leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX) were found in the EST database, with most ESTs in bud libraries. The ESTs with highest sequence similarity to UDP-glucose flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) are also predominantly found in developing buds of  A. deliciosa. Many of the ESTs for anthocyanin biosynthesis were sequenced from young fruit libraries (particularly  A. eriantha) and in  A. deliciosa buds. Developing buds from  A.  deliciosa appear to be a darker red color and therefore presumably accumulate more anthocyanins than buds from  A. chinensis and  A. eriantha, so it is not surprising to find ESTs for these later biosynthetic steps in bud tissue from  A. deliciosa. However, ESTs for genes encoding enzymes from the early steps in the flavonoid pathway (e.g. CHS and F3H) are found in unpigmented  A. eriantha fruit suggesting these tissues may accumulate a different class of flavonoids. Most of the enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis are well represented in the EST database except for F3'5'H. This is not surprising given the only anthocyanins identified in  A. deliciosa and  A. chinensis are glycosylated in the 3' position. There are, however, species within the genus  Actinidia, such as  A. melanandra, that accumulate high levels of delphinidin, a different aglycone that would require F3'5'H activity. No ESTs from these species were sequenced. Genes related to healthful components Ascorbic acid-related genes Kiwifruit are well known to be high in ascorbic acid (vitamin C), with values in commercial varieties ranging from 80 to 120 mg per 100 g fresh weight of fruit [ 54], and with  A. eriantha having up to 10 times as much again. Ascorbic acid is synthesized in plants from glucose, through three potential pathways: the L-galactose pathway, the galacturonate pathway and through  myo-inositol [ 55].  Myo-inositol is a major sugar alcohol found in kiwifruit (Additional file  7; [ 56, 57]). The only pathway that is well established is the L-galactose pathway for which all the enzymes have now been identified in plants [ 55, 58]. Many of the genes are known for the other two potential pathways, but several steps are still unknown. The  Actinidia EST database was searched for ESTs similar to genes known to encode steps in these pathways. The numbers of ESTs homologous to various identified genes in the three pathways of ascorbic acid biosynthesis are shown in Fig.  9. Surprisingly for these high vitamin C plants, while the number of ESTs found in early steps in all the pathways is relatively large, the number of ESTs found in the two last steps is much lower, with no examples of ESTs encoding the last step of two of the pathways, that catalyzed by L-galactono lactone dehydrogenase. Quinic acid metabolism Fruit from  Actinidia species have a relatively high total acid content (1–3% w/w) of which 40–60% can be quinic acid, 40–60% citric acid and 10% malic acid (Additional file  7). Quinic acid comprises an even higher proportion of the total acids during early fruit development [ 59], and over 25-fold variation in quinic acid content can be found in fruit of a single  A. chinensis cross [ 60]. Kiwifruit are unusual in having such a high content of quinic acid as a fresh fruit, although levels of quinic acid in cranberry juice can be around 1% [ 61] and peaches can have up to 0.2% quinic acid [ 62]. Quinic acid is a key intermediate in lignin biosynthesis, folic acid metabolism, aromatic acid synthesis, anthranilate biosynthesis, and purine metabolism. The molecular and enzymatic control of quinic acid storage and metabolism may affect all these pathways. However, little is known about quinic acid metabolism in  Actinidia species. ESTs for all the enzymes in the quinic acid biosynthetic pathway to shikimate (Fig.  10), except for a quinate dehydrogenase, have been identified in the  Actinidia EST database. Of the 13 ESTs identified for dehydroquinate synthase, eight were found in fruit or petal libraries, the rest were sequenced from bud or leaf libraries. Of the 16 ESTs identified for the bifunctional dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase, 11 were from fruit or petal libraries and five from bud or leaf libraries. These ESTs were found mainly in libraries made from  A. deliciosa and  A. chinensis tissues and to a lesser extent in  A. arguta and  A. eriantha libraries, reflecting the distribution of ESTs among the species. An enzyme has been reported with predominantly quinate dehydrogenase activity [ 63], but the gene for this enzyme has not been cloned. Allergens Food allergies are estimated to affect ~6% of young children and ~3% of adults [ 64]. Kiwifruit have been recognized as a potentially allergenic fruit for over 20 years and reported allergies to kiwifruit are increasing [ 65]. Most allergy symptoms to kiwifruit are quite mild, but severe reactions have been reported, particularly in young children [ 66]. Allergies have been recorded in all three commercial species of  Actinidia [ 67]. The  Actinidia EST database contains sequences with homology to many known plant allergen proteins [ 68]. Potential allergens include the 2S albumin proteins, lipid transfer proteins, thaumatin-like protein (TLP), α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors, latex allergens, plant chitinases, profilins, cystatins, Bet v 1 homologous proteins and plant seed globulin allergens. However, only a small number of potential kiwifruit allergens have been directly confirmed by immunological testing, including the cysteine protease actinidin (Act d 1; [ 69]), an unidentified 43 kDa protein (Act d 2; [ 70], a TLP [ 70] and kiwellin [ 25]. ESTs for actinidin occurred throughout the 37 libraries from seven species that make up the database, and these clustered into acidic and basic forms of 10 distinct genes/alleles [ 22]. No matches were found by BLAST searching the EST database for the 43 kDa protein Act d 2. Kiwellin ESTs were found in libraries from most  Actinidia species but were particularly abundant in  A. eriantha ripe fruit skin, accounting for ~40% of ESTs in that library. The EST database contained 24 NRs with homology to TLPs from other plants (e.g. Pru a 2 from cherry and thaumatin 1 from  Thaumatococcus daniellii), and all but one EST contained the 16 conserved cysteine residues characteristic of this protein class [ 71]. The various NRs could be aligned and clustered into 4 or 5 groups (data not shown), with two NRs accounting for the bulk of the ESTs (46 and 29%). Globulin proteins (11S and 7S) have been reported from a wide range of seeds, including cereals [ 72, 73] and legumes [ 74]. Globulin-like proteins are also found in  A. thaliana [ 75] and a gene family of 10 globulin-like genes are present in  Arabidopsis gene databases (The  Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR),  ). 11S globulins are composed of sets of polymorphic subunits derived from a multigene family. They exist as hexamers with molecular mass between 300 and 400 kDa, or as trimers. 11S globulin subunits consist of two polypeptide chains linked by at least one S-S bridge between cysteine residues at highly conserved positions in the acidic alpha-chain and basic beta-chain. Both chains are post-translationally generated from a common precursor protein, which represents the product of one member of the multigene family [ 76]. 11S globulins have been shown to be related to the 7S globulins through sequence comparisons [ 77]. A BLAST search of the  Actinidia EST sequence database with a range of previously identified globulin protein sequences identified two ESTs with a predicted protein sequence matching 11S globulin, both from a library made from  A. chinensis whole fruit, which included seeds. Other related sequences from  Actinidia fruit libraries belonged to the 7S vicilins-like family (38 ESTs), which were found in only fruit-based libraries from  A. deliciosa,  A. chinensis and  A. arguta. These libraries would have all included seeds. A third grouping of sequences was identified that we have named other globulins (OG) (201 ESTs). The OG group appears to be more closely related to the 7S globulins than to the 11S (Fig  11). All three groupings are supported by the clustering of the  Arabidopsis globulin genes as well as globulin genes from other species. While most OG ESTs were found in fruit libraries (81%), which included seeds, some members of the OG family were found in fruit skin, buds and petal libraries, suggesting a role other than as seed storage proteins. These OG ESTs were found in libraries derived from  A. deliciosa (100),  A. chinensis (42),  A. arguta (39), and  A. eriantha (16). Genes related to fruit softening Some kiwifruit cultivars exhibit outstanding storage characteristics e.g.  A. deliciosa 'Hayward' fruit can be stored for 4–6 months at 0°C. Other  Actinidia species exhibit a range of ripening and softening behaviors [ 78].  A. eriantha develops a peelable skin as the fruit ripen,  A. arguta ripens in less than 10 days at 20°C versus 20–25 days for  A. deliciosa and  A. chinensis [ 79], whilst some small-fruited  Actinidia genotypes tend to remain firm even towards the end of the ripening process [ 78]. The main chemical changes occurring in the cell wall during kiwifruit softening are pectin solubilization and degradation, reduction in the molecular weight of xyloglucan, and galactose loss from pectin side chains. Microscopically, the cell wall shows extensive swelling, until at the end of the softening process dissolution of middle lamellae can be observed [ 80]. These processes eventually lead to disintegration of the cell wall. Although similar chemical changes occur in other fruit [ 81], these changes occur concurrently with ethylene production and the respiratory climacteric. In kiwifruit, however, most of the softening process is well separated temporally from the climacteric and ethylene production (shown schematically in Fig.  12). The genes for many enzymes involved in the key chemical changes in the cell wall during ripening are represented in the  Actinidia EST database. Three enzymes involved in pectin degradation (pectin lyase, pectin methylesterase and polygalacturonase) are particularly abundant with 244, 611 and 414 ESTs, respectively. Genes encoding expansin, a protein implicated in pectin solubilization early in the kiwifruit softening process [ 80], are also highly abundant (468 ESTs). Galactose loss from fruit cell walls during the softening process has been attributed to the action of β-galactosidases [ 82]. A β-galactosidase from ripe kiwifruit has been purified. However, the activity of the enzyme  in vitro against synthetic or purified native substrates from kiwifruit was far too low to account for the amount of galactose loss observed during softening [ 83]. Ninety β-galactosidase ESTs were observed in fruit libraries in the EST database and are good candidates for genetic manipulation and to study the role of this enzyme. During softening, xyloglucan is also hydrolyzed. As xyloglucan and cellulose create the major load-bearing network of the cell wall, any xyloglucan degradation is thought to weaken the cell wall, resulting in softening of the fruit. In kiwifruit, hydrolysis of xyloglucan occurs mainly during the rapid softening phase. Endoglucanases and xyloglucan transglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) enzymes are implicated in this process. XTHs catalyze both hydrolytic and transglucosylation reactions, and an XTH enzyme capable of carrying out both reactions has been isolated from kiwifruit [ 84]. This particular XTH, however, is expressed late in kiwifruit ripening, when xyloglucan degradation has already come to an end. The 96 XTH ESTs found in fruit libraries will allow the identification of genes involved in hydrolysis of xyloglucan during the rapid softening phase. ESTs for enzymes that act on minor kiwifruit cell wall components such as galactoglucomannans or glucuronoarabinoxylans [ 80] were less abundant in the EST database (e.g. mannan transglycosylase/hydrolase (MTH), 10 ESTs found in fruit)."," Background Kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) are a relatively new, but economically important crop grown in many different parts of the world. Commercial success is driven by the development of new cultivars with novel consumer traits including flavor, appearance, healthful components and convenience. To increase our understanding of the genetic diversity and gene-based control of these key traits in Actinidia, we have produced a collection of 132,577 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Results The ESTs were derived mainly from four Actinidia species (A. chinensis, A. deliciosa, A. arguta and A. eriantha) and fell into 41,858 non redundant clusters (18,070 tentative consensus sequences and 23,788 EST singletons). Analysis of flavor and fragrance-related gene families (acyltransferases and carboxylesterases) and pathways (terpenoid biosynthesis) is presented in comparison with a chemical analysis of the compounds present in Actinidia including esters, acids, alcohols and terpenes. ESTs are identified for most genes in color pathways controlling chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid biosynthesis. In the health area, data are presented on the ESTs involved in ascorbic acid and quinic acid biosynthesis showing not only that genes for many of the steps in these pathways are represented in the database, but that genes encoding some critical steps are absent. In the convenience area, genes related to different stages of fruit softening are identified. Conclusion This large EST resource will allow researchers to undertake the tremendous challenge of understanding the molecular basis of genetic diversity in the Actinidia genus as well as provide an EST resource for comparative fruit genomics.

As ascertained by ESEM analyses the leaf surfaces were spotted with platelet like structures which seem to be partly mixed with the lipophilic epicuticular layers. The structures are supposed to contain the condensed monoterpenes, which could be identified by GC. Long term exposure (more than 48 h) to 100 mg/50 mg killed the plants by desiccation, a 24 h exposure caused necrotic spots that became visible one to two days after the treatment. Examinations of the stomatal apertures indicated that monoterpenes induced stomatal opening followed by extreme swelling and a final break down of the protoplasts. Exposure of Arabidopsis thaliana to volatiles of Mentha piperita, Lavandula latifolia and Artemisia camphorata resulted in a dramatic increase of the stomata aperture but swelling of the protoplasts was less exhibited.In contrast to de-waxing, expression of the fatty acid condensing enzyme encoding CER6 gene and de novo synthesis of CER6 protein was not induced after 24 h of exposure to the monoterpenes.The aim of the study was to demonstrate that the lipophilic layers of the leaf surface and the stomata are primary targets of monoterpene allelopathic attack. Enhanced transpiration results from a combination of affected lipophilic wax layers and a disturbed stomata function.","['Arabidopsis thaliana', 'Stomata', 'Allelopathy', 'terpenes', 'Mentha Piperita', 'Cuticular Waxes', 'Artemisia Camphorata', 'Cer6', 'Lavandula Latifolia']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN
5,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC2639028\eupmc_result.json,PMC2639028,"Results and discussion Ethylene metabolism Berry development is characterized by a weak spike in ethylene production around véraison with a concomitant increase in the activity of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the last step of ethylene biosynthesis ( Chervin   et al., 2004 ). Exogenous ethylene application affects the production of phenols and anthocyanins, and influences the aromatic quality of Aleatico berries, so ethylene is likely to be involved in the post-harvest withering process ( Bellincontro   et al., 2006 ). AFLP-TP analysis revealed the up-regulation of  S-adenosyl methionine synthase (TC67664) ( Table 2), which supports such a role. Grimplet   et al. (2007)  also provides evidence of the induction of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling in grape berry development and ripening under water-deficit stress conditions. Transcription factors Several transcription factor genes matched to the withering-specific AFLP-TP tags ( Tables 2, 3, 4, 5). These included an up-regulated transcript related to a tobacco bZIP transcription factor (TC54438) ( Table 2) that binds  in vitro to G-box elements in the promoters of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes ( Heinekamp   et al., 2002 ). The putative grapevine homologue could potentially bind similar elements upstream of grapevine genes, such as those identified in the  Vst1 and  DFR promoters ( Schubert   et al., 1997 ;  Gollop   et al., 2002 ). Another induced transcript was homologous to the apple MYBR2 factor (TC61058) ( Table 2). In plants, MYB proteins regulate different cellular and developmental processes including secondary metabolism, cellular morphogenesis, and the response to growth regulators ( Martin and Paz-Ares, 1997). In grapevine, the role of MYB proteins in the regulation of phenylpropanoid synthesis has been considered ( Deluc   et al., 2006 , 2008;  Bogs   et al., 2007 ;  Walker   et al., 2007 ). The up-regulation of a transcript displaying homology to the  Nicotiana attenuata WRKY6 factor (TC59548) was also observed ( Table 3). This could be linked to the activation stress response genes, as observed in numerous plant species in the case of wounding, pathogen infection or abiotic stress ( Ulker and Somssich, 2004). Among the withering-specific genes, the transcript for grapevine MADS1 (TC51812) was repressed ( Table 5). This MADS-box transcription factor may play a role in flower development before fertilization and in berry development after fertilization ( Boss   et al., 2001 ). On-plant and off-plant withering processes Transcriptional modulation during grape berry post-harvest ripening was also studied in bunches that were left attached to the plant in the vineyard. AFLP-TP analysis was carried out on overripe berries and the results were compared with those obtained from the off-plant withering in order to highlight major differences caused by attachment to the shoot. Off-plant withered berries were characterized by significant water loss and increased sugar concentration, whereas there was negligible water loss and little sugar accumulation in the on-plant berries ( Table 1). A comparative analysis of AFLP-TP expression profiles from the three shared sampling time points identified 167 transcripts that were modulated only during off-plant withering, while another 86 transcripts were modulated only during the on-plant process. Thus, only 253 tags with different transcription profile were detected on the whole. This comparative analysis suggests that common transcriptional changes characterize the two kinds of withering processes. This seems surprising for a non-climacteric fruit such as grape berry, in which the occurrence of different processes on-plant and off-plant could be hypothesized. Differences in gene expression seem to be due mainly to dehydration stress, occurring in the off-plant withering process. A list of tags homologous to sequences with a known function is provided in  Table 6. One notable difference between the two processes was the higher level of  VvDHN1a in off-plant withered berries, which almost certainly reflects off-plant water loss and the role of  VvDH1a in dehydration stress. A similar profile was observed for a transcript with homology to a tomato enzyme involved in sorbitol biosynthesis ( Ohta   et al., 2005 ). There were no major differences in genes involved in cell wall metabolism. However, tags encoding a pectinesterase-like protein (Q9LZZ0) and a laccase (TC68636) were down-regulated specifically in off-plant withered berries ( Table 6). Pectinesterase is involved in the process of fruit softening during ripening ( Prasanna   et al., 2007 ), and this would appear less important in off-plant withered berries as would the polymerization of monolignols by laccase ( Sterjiades   et al., 1992 ). Possible down-regulation of cell wall lignification during the off-plant process is also supported by the repression of a tag homologous to a poplar Class III HD-Zip protein 1 (TC57687) ( Table 6) which plays a role in wood formation ( Ko   et al., 2006 ). A putative glycine-rich protein was up-regulated in the on-plant withered berries, and such proteins also play a role in cell wall structure ( Mousavi and Hotta, 2005). In off-plant withered berries, a tag with homology to the  A. thaliana NAP1 (TC52510) protein was repressed ( Table 6). NAP1 helps to regulate the activity of the ARP3/3 complex, which controls actin polymerization, suggesting that on-plant withering may require the preservation of actin polymers ( Brembu   et al., 2004 ). With respect to energy metabolism, transcripts involved in photosynthesis were down-regulated in off-plant withered berries, for example, the photosystem I reaction centre subunit N chloroplast precursor (TC53444). However, a tag matching solanesyl diphosphate synthase (TC55340) was up-regulated ( Table 6). In  A. thaliana, this enzyme is involved in the synthesis of the isoprenoid component of plastoquinone and ubiquinone ( Jun   et al., 2004 ), which take part in photosynthetic electron transfer in the chloroplast and respiratory electron transfer in the mitochondrion ( Jun   et al., 2004 ). Chlorophyll  a/ b binding proteins (TC56895; TC65556) were up-regulated in on-plant withered berries ( Table 6). There were some differences between the two processes in terms of protein synthesis, with both induction and repression noted for tags corresponding to various ribosomal proteins and translation factors ( Table 6). However, on-plant withering appeared to repress genes involved in protein recycling, such as polyubiquitin (TC70093) and ubiquitin (TC57081) ( Table 6). In terms of secondary metabolism, only genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis showed any major differences between the post-harvest drying processes with the repression of a tag encoding a 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (TC69609), an enzyme belonging to the mevalonate-independent pathway, in off-plant withered grapes ( Table 6). AFLP-TP analysis AFLP-TP, a gel-based transcript profile method, is a genome-wide transcriptional analysis with some advantageous features over microarrays. No prior sequence information is required for AFLP-TP analysis, the low start-up cost and its high specifity allow analysing the expression profile of genes with high homology ( Vuylsteke   et al., 2007 ). The procedure of purification, amplification, and sequecing of tags required by AFLP-TP analysis is time-consuming, labour-intensive and cannot be automated. However, the gene discovery possibility of AFLP-TP is still an important advantage which can complement the recently obtained genomic informations (French-Italian Public Consortium for Grapevine Genome Characterization, 2007;  Velasco   et al., 2007 ). For these reasons, an AFLP-TP analysis was used to obtain a large-scale description of the transcriptional changes of grapevine berries during withering, a process uncharacterized up to now. Other aspects of grape berry development have been investigated by microarray analysis, such berry ripening under normal and water stress conditions ( Terrier   et al., 2005 ;  Waters   et al., 2005 ;  Deluc   et al., 2007 ;  Grimplet   et al., 2007 ;  Pilati   et al., 2007 ;  Lund   et al., 2008 ). Eight sampling times were chosen during the 2003  Vitis vinifera cv. Corvina growing season, four covering the entire period of berry development ( Table 1) and up to four covering the subsequent 99 d post-ripening period ( Table 1). In the latter case, two different withering processes, one on-plant and one off-plant, were considered. For the on-plant withering process, only the first three sampling points were used, due to the poor quality of the berries at the final stage ( Table 1). The kinetics of the withering processes was monitored by evaluating weight loss and the sugar content of berry juice ( Table 1). For on-plant withering, a negligible weight loss was recorded ( Table 1) because grape clusters connected to the shoot are not subjected to intense dehydration. The observed increase in sugar concentration is mainly due to the over-ripening process ( Table 1). During the 2003 growing season, temperature values higher than the seasonal average values and lower rainfall were recorded in the sampling area. These climatic conditions influenced berry development and resulted in the anticipated ripening. Similar conditions, recorded for the autumn season, could have affected withering and, in particular, dehydration, which characterizes the off-plant withering process. AFLP-TP analysis was performed mixing an equal amount of total RNA extracted from skin and flesh tissues for each sampling time-point, to overcome problems related to RNA extraction efficiency. RNA yields from skin and flesh tissues could be negatively affected by polyphenol and sugar contents which, moreover, change during the berry development and withering processes. Because RNA extracted from whole berries derives from unknown quantities of skin and flesh RNAs and because these can be differently affected by the extraction procedure during the analysis, it was decided to mix equal amounts of skin and flesh RNAs and to maintain the same total RNA quantity over the whole experiment. Although this procedure can introduce some bias, it is believed that these are preferable to the analysis of an unknown and varying RNA content of samples. The expression of approximately 9600 transcripts, representing almost one-third of the protein-coding genes predicted in the grapevine genome (French-Italian Public Consortium for Grapevine Genome Characterization, 2007), was analysed using 128 different BstYI+1/MseI+2 primer combinations for selective amplification. Among these transcripts, 2093 were found to be differentially expressed during berry development and/or withering. The differentially expressed tags were excised from the gels, and 1829 were successfully re-amplified by PCR using the appropriate selective AFLP-TP primers (data not shown). The PCR products yielded 1267 good-quality sequences which were used for BLASTN and BLASTX searches against the DFCI Grape Gene Index database ( http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=grape) and the UNIPROT database ( http://www.expasy.uniprot.org), respectively (see  Supplementary Table S2 at  JXB online). Gene Ontology terms were assigned to the sequences and were used to organize them into major functional categories (see  Supplementary Fig. S1 at  JXB online). No matches were found for 225 sequences. Cluster analysis The expression profiles of the 2093 differentially-expressed transcripts were visually scored relative to the first sampling time point which was arbitrarily attributed a zero value. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using a Pearson correlation (uncentred) distance and complete linkage clustering based on the scores from the four developmental and four post-harvest (off-plant withering) sampling points. Twelve main clusters were identified and their mean expression profiles are shown in  Fig. 1. Clusters 1 (10.51%) and 2 (6.36%) represent genes induced in early and late development, respectively, whereas clusters 3 (13.71%) and 4 (10.99%) represent genes specifically induced during early and late withering, respectively. Cluster 5 (5.64%) represents genes that are expressed transiently during withering. Clusters 6 (27.66%) and 9 (10.46%) represent genes that are repressed during early and late development, whereas clusters 8 (6.36%) and 10 (2.34%) represent genes that are specifically repressed during early and late withering, respectively. Cluster 7 (1.00%) represents genes that are transiently repressed during ripening and the first stage of withering. Cluster 11 (0.67%) represents genes that are repressed during late berry development but induced at the onset of withering. Finally, cluster 12 (4.3%) is the reciprocal of cluster 11, i.e. genes up-regulated in late development but repressed during withering. Real-time RT-PCR experiments The expression profiles of six randomly-selected differentially-expressed genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR experiments using the same RNA samples. The analysis was carried out for the four developmental time points (PFS, PRV, V, R) and for the three time points common to both withering processes (WI, WII, WIII) ( Fig. 2). The six tags represented an avr9/cf-9 rapidly-elicited protein, a cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase, a DNA-binding protein, a glutathione  S-transferase, a MLO-like protein, and an SOS2-like protein kinase. The real-time RT-PCR expression profiles were similar to the profiles obtained by AFLP-TP ( Fig. 2). Changes in gene expression during off-plant withering AFLP-TP analysis of grape samples allowed us to identify a number of transcripts specifically modulated during the post-harvest withering process, i.e. those in clusters 3 and 4 (induced during early and late withering, respectively) and clusters 8 and 10 (repressed during early and late withering, respectively). These genes accounted for 33.4% of all differentially expressed transcripts, with an approximate 3:1 ratio of up-regulated to down-regulated genes. For each cluster, a list of tags with homology to sequences with known functions was prepared ( Tables 2,  3,  4,  5). Analysis of the AFLP-TP transcripts specifically modulated during berry dehydration allowed a model for the molecular processes that take place after berry picking to be formulated. Phenolic compounds Among the AFLP tags induced by withering, there were three transcripts with homology to two different phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL) genes (TC69585; TC66528), and two tags encoding 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL)-like proteins (TC57438) ( Tables 2,  3). Therefore, berry dehydration appears to induce general phenylpropanoid metabolism, which generates precursors for many different categories of phenolic compounds. Eight tags corresponding to  STS genes (TC52790, TC52907, TC53668, TC59572, TC60946, NP1227286) were induced by withering ( Tables 2,  3) suggesting a strong stilbene production. Stilbenes are synthesized constitutively in seeds and are also produced in berry skin during development, and in response to biotic or abiotic stresses ( Soleas   et al., 1997 ). Significant resveratrol accumulation occurs during the post-harvest drying of berries of many grape cultivars, and this has already been linked to the high-level expression of stilbene synthase (STS) ( Celotti   et al., 1998 ;  Tornielli, 1998;  Versari   et al., 2001 ). Given that  STS is also induced during on-plant withering (see  Supplementary Table S2 at  JXB online), these results indicate that the induction of the expression of many  STS genes is a characteristic of the berry post-ripening phase. Among the up-regulated withering-specific transcripts, one chalcone isomerase ( CHI) gene (TC55034) and two tags homologous to polyphenol oxidase (TC52784) ( Table 2) were identified ( Table 2). The transcriptional profile of the first gene suggests an activation of the flavonoid pathway during the withering process, while the transcriptional profile of the second one indicates a probable oxidation/polymerization of phenolic compounds. Few previous studies have considered the production of phenolics in grape skin during the post-harvest drying process, and there is some conflict about the abundance of such compounds, with some reports citing a general reduction ( Di Stefano   et al., 1997 ;  Borsa and Di Stefano, 2000) and others a general increase ( Bellincontro   et al., 2004 ;  Tornielli   et al., 2005 ). Taken together, these results suggest that, in addition to the stilbene synthesis, some classes of flavonoids may also be produced during the withering process. Small- and large-scale gene expression studies have already been performed on grapes under preharvest water-deficit stress ( Castellarin   et al., 2007  a,  b;  Grimplet   et al., 2007 ). Preharvest water-deficit stress does not necessary cause a cell osmotic stress in berry tissues which is likely to occur during the post-harvest dehydration process analysed in this work. Although physiological events associated with pre- and post-harvest developmental stages are different, a similar positive modulation of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway in lignin and stilbene biosynthesis was observed in skin tissues of ripening berries in response to water-deficit stress ( Grimplet   et al., 2007 ), and during berry post-harvest withering. On the other hand, preharvest water stress accelerated ripening and induced the expression of flavonoid structural genes during berry development ( Castellarin   et al., 2007  a,  b), while the water stress caused by dehydration characterizing the off-plant withering had a minor influence on the flavonoid pathway. Terpenoid compounds Terpenoids contribute to the aroma of grapes and their products including wine ( Lund and Bohlmann, 2006). AFLP-TP showed that two transcripts with homology to a limonoid UDP-glucosyltransferase (TC65435) were induced during the post-harvest drying ( Tables 2,  3). In citrus fruits, limonoid UDP-glucosyl transferase catalyses the conversion of bitter tasting limonin to limonoid glucoside ( Kita   et al., 2000 ). There is no evidence for the presence of limonin in grape berries, but it is possible that this gene is involved in the modification of other terpenes or in the production of secondary metabolites and hormones ( Kita   et al., 2000 ). A tag representing hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (TC68763) was shown to be repressed during withering ( Table 4). This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), which can be converted into isoprenoids via the mevalonate pathway ( Sirinupong   et al., 2005 ). These data suggest that the late terpene biosynthetic pathway is up-regulated whereas the production of terpene precursors is inhibited. A repression at ripening of a transcript encoding a key enzyme of the non-mevalonate IPP biosynthetic pathway, the 1-deoxy- D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase was reported in grape berries under water-deficit stress ( Grimplet   et al., 2007 ). Cell wall metabolism Previous reports have described the expression patterns of cell wall-modifying enzymes during berry development and ripening, as well as concomitant changes in cell wall composition ( Nunan   et al., 1998 , 2001;  Vidal   et al., 2001 ;  Doco   et al., 2003 ;  Grimplet   et al., 2007 ). There is no direct evidence for modification of the berry cell wall structure and composition during off-plant drying, but the increase in polyphenolic compounds reported in some studies ( Tornielli   et al., 2005 ;  Pinelo   et al., 2006 ) might depend on cell wall degradation. AFLP-TP analysis revealed the down-regulation of only two withering-specific tags putatively involved in cell wall metabolism, encoding a cellulose synthase (TC55634) and a β-mannan endohydrolase (TC67062) ( Tables 4,  5). Response to stress It has recently been shown that berry ripening results in the accumulation of transcripts related to biotic and abiotic stress responses ( Deluc   et al., 2007 ;  Pilati   et al., 2007 ). Among the withering-specific AFLP-TP tags, there were transcripts encoding a gag-pol polyprotein (TC69867), a non-LTR reverse transcriptase (CD007484), and a reverse transcriptase (TC51865) ( Table 2). These data suggest that an increase in transposable element activity is one component of the stress response to berry withering. Many transposable elements have been identified in the grapevine genome ( Verriès   et al., 2000 ;  Pelsy   et al., 2002 ;  Pereira   et al., 2005 ; French-Italian Public Consortium for Grapevine Genome Characterization, 2007;  Velasco   et al., 2007 ) and  cis-acting sequences in the LTR of elements  Tnt1,  Tto1, and  Vine-1 could be involved in the activation of defence genes in response to stress conditions ( Grandbastien, 1998;  Verriès   et al., 2000 ). Dehydration is likely to be the major stress factor affecting grape berries after harvest, since they lose over 30% of their weight through evaporation during off-plant ripening ( Table 1). The up-regulation of  DHN1a, encoding dehydrin 1a (TC61998), and of a trehalose-phosphate phosphatase mRNA (TC67690) ( Table 3), supports this theory, since plant dehydrins counteract the water stress that occurs in cold, frost, drought, and saline conditions ( Sanchez-Ballesta   et al., 2004 ;  Rorat, 2006). In  Vitis riparia and in  V. vinifera, DHN1a is induced in response to cold, drought, and ABA treatment ( Xiao and Nassuth, 2006). This gene could protect the berry during the late withering stages, together with the increased production of trehalose by trehalose-phosphate phosphatase ( Table 3) since increased trehalose levels protect  Escherichia coli from stress including drought ( Garg   et al., 2002 ). The up-regulation of a sorbitol related enzyme (TC58983) ( Table 2) could positively affect the synthesis of this sugar with a protective role against water stress in plant ( Tao   et al., 1995 ). One transcript encoding a lipoxygenase (Q8GSM3), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of C6 volatile compounds and signalling molecules that respond to stress ( Croft   et al., 1993 ), was isolated among the tags specifically induced in late withering ( Table 3). During Malvasia grape berry drying, an increase in lipoxygenase activity and the concomitant production of C6 compounds such as hexen-1-ol, hexanal, and ( E)-hex-2-enal was reported ( Costantini   et al., 2006 ). It has been suggested that grape ripening, unlike tomato and strawberry, is not accompanied by the induction of oxidative stress response genes ( Terrier   et al., 2005 ). However, an oxidative burst characterized by H 2O 2 accumulation duration  véraison and by the modulation enzymes that scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) was recently described during berry development ( Pilati   et al., 2007 ). The AFLP-TP analysis identified two tags, encoding a cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (TC51718) and a glutathione  S-transferase (TC53088), which were up-regulated during post-harvest drying ( Table 2). This suggests that the post-ripening phase is characterized by oxidative stress and the corresponding response. Such response may not require the involvement of two thioredoxin-like proteins given that the corresponding transcripts (TC56954; TC63581) were down-regulated during withering ( Tables 4,  5). Despite the absence of pests and diseases, several genes involved in biotic stress responses were also induced during withering, including the  STS genes discussed above. Other early-induced genes identified by AFLP-TP analysis included transcripts homologous to  Arabidopsis thaliana MLO-like protein 6 (Q94KB7) and potato systemic acquired resistance-related protein SRE1a (TC61558) ( Table 2). The involvement of MLO proteins in resistance to powdery mildew was reported in barley ( Peterhänsel and Lahaye, 2005). Delayed induction was observed for other defence gene tags including those related to  A. thaliana Avr9/Cf-9 rapidly elicited protein (CA813698) ( Durrant   et al., 2000 ), soybean syringolide-induced protein (Q8S901) which is induced in soybean cells treated with  Pseudomonas syringae elicitors ( Hagihara   et al., 2004 ) and an  A. thaliana disease resistance response protein (Q9LID5) ( Table 3). A TMV response-related gene product (TC57457) was shown to be repressed during withering ( Table 4). Genes related to the general stress response, such as a sorbitol related enzyme, an Avr9/Cf-9 rapidly elicited protein, and a disease resistance gene were also induced in ripening berries of grape plants in water-deficit conditions ( Grimplet   et al., 2007 ). Carbohydrate transport and metabolism Our AFLP-TP experiment showed that  VvHT5 (Q3L7K6), which encodes a hexose transporter (HT) located in the plasma membrane ( Hayes   et al., 2007 ), is up-regulated late in the withering process ( Table 3). This indicates that hexose transport, reported to be strongly active during ripening ( Hayes   et al., 2007 ), is probably also active during withering. Such activity may be responsible for the transport of sugars in different subcellular compartments. The solute concentration in ripening berries increases in part due to water loss ( Costantini   et al., 2006 ;  Di Stefano   et al., 1997 ), but reactions related to hexose aerobic/anaerobic respiration, hexose conversion to malate, gluconeogenesis, and malate respiration might also increase during post-harvest drying ( Zironi and Ferrarini, 1987;  Bellincontro   et al., 2006 ;  Chkaiban   et al., 2007 ). The analysis showed that transcripts encoding glycolytic enzymes like aldolase (TC54602; TC59070) and phosphoglycerate kinase (TC52072) were up-regulated ( Table 3), whereas a pyruvate kinase (TC60979) was repressed ( Table 5) along with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (TC60028), which is involved in gluconeogenesis ( Table 4). Taken together these results suggest that hexoses could be metabolized via the pyruvate pathway or conversion into malate, even if no transcripts directly involved in the latter pathway were identified, while  de novo synthesis of such compounds seems to be inhibited.","Post-harvest withering of grape berries is used in the production of dessert and fortified wines to alter must quality characteristics and increase the concentration of simple sugars. The molecular processes that occur during withering are poorly understood, so a detailed transcriptomic analysis of post-harvest grape berries was carried out by AFLP-transcriptional profiling analysis. This will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of berry withering and will provide an opportunity to select markers that can be used to follow the drying process and evaluate different drying techniques. AFLP-TP identified 699 withering-specific genes, 167 and 86 of which were unique to off-plant and on-plant withering, respectively. Although similar molecular events were revealed in both withering processes, it was apparent that off-plant withering induced a stronger dehydration stress response resulting in the high level expression of genes involved in stress protection mechanisms, such as dehydrin and osmolite accumulation. Genes involved in hexose metabolism and transport, cell wall composition, and secondary metabolism (particularly the phenolic and terpene compound pathways) were similarly regulated in both processes. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the molecular events underpinning post-harvest withering and could help to define markers for different withering processes.",NaN,"['Table', 'withering', 'genes', 'off-plant withering', 'Berry', 'Berry development', 'AFLP-TP analysis', 'stress', 'withering process', 'Tables']","[véraison, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase, Bellincontro   , Grimplet   , G-box, MYB, MYB, Deluc   , TC59548, Somssich, MADS-box transcription factor, Q9LZZ0, Pectinesterase, laccase, Sterjiades   , poplar Class III HD-Zip protein 1, Ko   , glycine-rich, Hotta, TC52510, NAP1, ARP3/3, actin, actin polymers, photosystem I, TC55340, Jun   , Jun   , b binding proteins, ribosomal, polyubiquitin, TC70093, ubiquitin (, TC69609, BstYI+1/MseI+2, WI, avr9/cf-9 rapidly-elicited, SOS2-like protein kinase, AFLP, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, TC69585, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL)-like proteins, TC52790, TC52907, TC53668, TC59572, TC60946, chalcone isomerase, TC55034, polyphenol oxidase, Bellincontro   , Castellarin   , lignin, Grimplet   , Castellarin   , UDP-glucosyltransferase, limonoid UDP-glucosyl transferase, limonin, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, TC68763, Sirinupong   , Grimplet   , Tornielli   , Pinelo   , cellulose synthase, TC55634, CD007484, Verriès   , Pelsy   , Tnt1, dehydrin 1a, trehalose-phosphate phosphatase, Sanchez-Ballesta   , DHN1a, ABA, Nassuth, trehalose-phosphate phosphatase ( Table 3, Tao   , Q8GSM3, lipoxygenase, hexen-1-ol, TC51718, glutathione  S-transferase, TC53088, TC56954, Peterhänsel, Grimplet   , Q3L7K6, glycolytic enzymes like aldolase, TC59070, phosphoglycerate kinase, TC52072, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, TC60028]",[],[],[],NaN
6,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC2642826\eupmc_result.json,PMC2642826,"Results and Discussion Library construction Fifty-six libraries were constructed from two main genotypes representing three contrasting genetic origins: ICS1, a hybrid between Criollo and Forastero from Lower Amazonia of Brazil, and Scavina 6, a Forastero from Upper Amazonia of Peru. A few other genotypes characterized by specific resistance or quality traits and belonging to various genetic origins were also used. The plant materials were provided from a various panel of different  T. cacao L. organs (Table  1). Among them, 25 libraries corresponded to  T. cacao tissues introduced to different biotic stresses: pods inoculated by  Phytophthora palmivora, Phytophthora megakarya, Moniliophthora perniciosa and  Moniliophthora roreri, leaves inoculated by  Phytophthora palmivora and  Phytophthora megakarya, stems inoculated by  Moniliophthora perniciosa and  Ceratocystis fimbriata, and stems attacked by  Sahlbergella singularis (mirids). Among these libraries, 17 are suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries. Finally, two libraries corresponded to  T. cacao tissues introduced to drought stresses and 11 corresponded to seed development and fermentation stages. EST sequencing and assembly From the 56 libraries, 8565 clones were first sequenced on both strands using forward and reverse primers, to have an overview of the quality of the libraries, and then 163,868 clones were single-pass sequenced from 5' or from 3' end (Table  1). This represented a total number of 180,998 chromatograms that were used in this analysis. After low quality, vector and adapters trimming, 149,650 sequences longer than 100 bp remained as good quality sequences. The average sequence length was 472 bp and 62% were longer than 400 bp. These individual ESTs (available through EMBL-Bank [ 25]) were assembled using the TIGR Gene Indices clustering tools (TGICL) [ 26]. The assembly process produced 12,692 contigs and 35,902 singletons that represented a total of 25.6 Mb of transcripted sequences. The combined set of contigs and singletons resulted in 48,594 unigenes which might correspond to different putative transcripts or different parts of the same transcript found in the  Theobroma cacao transcriptome. The average length of this  T. cacao non redundant sequences dataset was 527 bp. An assembly of ESTs has already been published for  Theobroma cacao but has been limited to 1380 unigenes (4433 ESTs) from two leaf and bean cacao libraries [ 21], to the isolation of 1256 unigenes (2114 ESTs) from cacao leaves treated with inducers of defense response [ 23] and to 2926 non redundant sequences from libraries of cacao meristems inoculated by  Moniliophthora perniciosa [ 24]. The results of this study are more comparable to a cotton EST project [ 19], involving 30 cDNA libraries. This analysis detected 51,107 unigenes in approximately 185,000  Gossypium ESTs. Analysis of EST abundance in a contig can provide insights to gene expression levels, although this information must be taken with caution due to cloning and replication bias resulting form library construction and propagation steps. The number of ESTs in the  T. cacao contigs ranged from 2 to 5102 (Figure  1) and 65.3% were composed of 4 or less ESTs. 98% of the contigs contained less than 50 ESTs. We evaluated the redundancy of transcripts in each library and among all libraries by studying the distribution of ESTs in contigs across multiple libraries. 11,226 had members from more than one library (Figure  2) and 1466 contigs were specific from one library. No contigs had members from all 56 libraries. Two contigs were found in 52 libraries: the contig CL1Contig269 was similar to the mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA gene and the contig CL1Contig513 to the 18S ribosomal RNA gene. The contig CL18Contig2, CL2Contig3 and CL15Contig2, similar to an ATP Synthase beta subunit, a metallothionein-like protein and a photosystem II D1 protein respectively, were found in 47 libraries. Unigene set annotation BLASTN against cacao ESTs The unigene dataset was used to detect how many cacao sequences had not been already described in public databases. To answer this question, we collected all 2539  T. cacao unique sequences already published by the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) gene index [ 27] and we did a BLASTN search against our unigenes. An e-value cutoff of 1e -50 was used to ensure that only highly similar sequences were detected. A total of 3901 unigenes produced a significant hit with 1788 unique sequences from the DFCI gene index, therefore these sequences may correspond to  T. cacao sequences already published or may match different parts of the gene index sequences. They may be also produced by closely related genes (multigenic families). Finally, 44,693 unique sequences did not produce a significant hit, therefore these sequences may be new. BLASTX and BLASTN annotation The unigenes were first translated into amino-acid sequences and then searched for similar protein with the BLASTX program using an e-value cutoff of 1e-5 against the non-redundant protein sequence database (NR) with entries from GenPept, Swissprot, PIR, PDF, PDB and NCBI RefSeq. The 10 best hits were retained for the annotation, providing an annotation for 27,245 cacao sequences (56.1%). The 43.9% of the unigenes that did not have any match were searched for similar nucleotide sequences from the Genbank nucleotide collection NT with the BLASTN program. An e-value cutoff of 1e-5 was also used and the 10 best hits were used for the annotation. 2604 unigenes exhibited a significant similarity with nucleotide sequences providing a BLASTX or BLASTN annotation for 29,849 unigenes. The 10 BLASTX hits were used to classify the unigenes according to the species associated with the annotation (Figure  3A). A total of 140,270 hits (56%) involved proteins from  Vitis vinifera,  Arabidopsis thaliana or  Oryza sativa, while 1955 hits involved proteins from  Gossypium hirsutum, a closely related species from the Malvaceae family [ 28]. Although fewer protein sequences from  Vitis vinifera than from  Arabidopsis thaliana (54,395 and 58,061 respectively) were present in the non redundant database we used for BLASTX, and although the evolutionary distance between  Vitis vinifera and  Theobroma cacao is higher than the distance between  Arabidopsis thaliana and  Theobroma cacao [ 28], we found more similarities with  Vitis vinifera (50,315 hits) than with  Arabidopsis thaliana (41,766 hits). To further investigate this unexpected result we compared with the BLASTX program the cacao unigenes dataset against the two proteomes of  Arabidopsis thaliana and  Vitis vinifera (Figures  3B, C). For each Blast result, we selected the species found in the first hit having an expected value lower than 1 e-15 to detect similar sequence. A total of 25,049  Theobroma cacao sequences (56%) presented at least a significant hit with an  Arabidopsis thaliana or  Vitis vinifera protein. The results showed that 18,643  Theobroma cacao sequences presented a higher similarity to the  Vitis vinifera proteome whereas only 6406  Theobroma cacao sequences presented a first Blast hit similar to the  Arabidopsis thaliana proteome (Figure  3B). Moreover, it was determined that these first significant hits involved 9943  Vitis vinifera proteins (33% of the proteome) and 4246  Arabidopsis thaliana proteins (12% of the proteome) (Figure  3C). These surprising results suggest that the genes expressed in  Theobroma cacao are more similar to  Vitis vinifera proteins than to those of  Arabidopsis thaliana. These findings could be explained by the fact that  Theobroma cacao and  Vitis vinifera are both fruit trees. This idea could be supported by the large amount of Blast hits found with other tree crops such as  Populus trichocarpa (8605 Blast hits), despite a small number of non redundant proteins in the databases for this species. Gene Ontology annotation We used BLAST2GO [ 29], a program that retrieves GO terms based on BLAST definition, to assign gene ontology (GO) annotation [ 30] to the unigene dataset. To best exploit GO results, we built a local AmiGO browser [ 31]. A total number of 49,364 annotations were found and 16,364 unigenes were characterized by at least one annotation. These annotations were distributed among the main GO categories into 16,448 Biological Process (P), 14,696 Cellular Component (C) and 18,219 Molecular Function (F) (Figure  4A). The most abundant high-level direct GO counts within these categories were C: mitochondrion (1924), C: membrane (1218), C: plastid (1173), F: ATP binding (1017) and C: chloroplast (1001) (Figure  4B). Genes involved in defense and resistance mechanisms Some of the libraries provide an important resource to study plant/pathogens interactions. Using the annotations provided by Blast and Gene Ontology, we specifically focussed on genes known to play a crucial role in plant pathogen resistance and defense mechanisms [ 32]. Using the AmiGO browser, we identified 1001 gene product associations to ""response to stress"" (GO:0006950). Both searches with Blast result and Gene Ontology annotation resulted in the identification of unigenes similar to known proteins involved in resistance or defense mechanisms such as LRR-NBS [ 33] (8 contigs and 32 singletons), chitinase [ 34] (19 contigs and 37 singletons), 1–3 beta glucanase [ 35] (5 contigs and 7 singletons) or pathogenesis-Related protein (24 contigs and 24 singletons). Other genes related to resistance/defense mechanisms were also found more specifically in libraries produced from pathogen infected tissues, such as those involved in regulation of pathogen-induced genes like transcription factors (6 contigs and 7 singletons), in signal transduction (like MAPKinase with 5 contigs and 3 singletons) or in the cell death program. The identification of a unigene set gathering sequences from all genes known to be involved in plant resistance and defense mechanisms, and the construction of a corresponding microarray could constitute a valuable tool to progress in the understanding of plant/pathogens interactions. Genes involved in particular metabolic pathways or biological activities To check the representativeness of our EST collection, we looked for ESTs encoding proteins known to be involved in the flavonoid and the terpene pathways, already studied in other plant species, and at the basis of important traits of interest in  T. cacao. Generally, polyphenols play a major role in chocolate quality, acting as colour precursors or taste agents [ 36]. Moreover, they are strongly implicated in health benefits associated with chocolate consumption [ 37- 40]. The flavonoid pathway The flavonoid pathway has been already studied in several plants [ 41]. In  T. cacao, this pathway is the source of numerous essential components for human health benefits of chocolate [ 37- 40] and resistance against pathogens [ 42]. Gene Ontology analysis highlighted 99 EST sequences implicated in ""phenylpropanoid biosynthetic process"" (GO:0009699), most of them implicated in flavonoid biosynthesis. For example, the GO analysis, together with keyword ESTtik database searching (see material and methods) into Blast Results allowed us to find sequences encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase (5 contigs and 12 singletons), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (4 contigs and 11 singletons), the 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (14 contigs and 12 singletons), chalcone synthase (6 contigs and 25 singletons) and chalcone isomerase (8 contigs and 13 singletons), all major enzymes of the general flavonoid pathway (Figure  5). Most specific enzymes, implicated in anthocyanin biosynthesis (flavanone-3-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol reductase, anthocyanidin synthase, flavonoid-3-glucosyltransferase) were also represented in this  T. cacao EST resource. The terpene pathway Terpenoid compounds, synthesized in the isoprenoid pathway (Figure  6), are compounds of importance for specific scent and aromatic qualities of chocolates classified as ""fine and flavor"". For example, linalool, a monoterpenol, is found in high quantity in Arriba Nacional varieties from Ecuador and in some Criollo clones from Venezuela [ 11, 43, 44]. Linalool, together with other volatiles, could be responsible for the typical floral aroma [ 45] of these chocolates. One of our goals was to identify enzymes involved in the terpenoid pathway that could be responsible for linalool content variations among Nacional clones. As a first step we identified sequences encoding isoprenoid pathway enzymes (42 contigs and 55 singletons). The final step enzyme for linalool synthesis, linalool synthase, was represented by 2 contigs and 4 singletons. Nearly all enzymes reported to be involved in this biochemical pathway were present in our ESTtik database, allowing the analysis of the  T. cacao terpene pathway based on oligonucleotide microarrays derived from these ESTs. The fact that nearly all of the genes involved in these two pathways as described in other plant species were identified in ESTs from our collection demonstrates the high level of representation of this resource and suggests that the majority of cacao genes have been sampled. Thus, this EST collection offers a comprehensive resource to search for candidate genes involved in quality traits and other important agronomical traits variation. Production of SSR and SNP markers Molecular markers derived from ESTs are part of, or adjacent to genes, and therefore they provide an efficient means of gene mapping. Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were identified in the unigene dataset with the MISA pipeline [ 46]. In this study, SSRs were defined as dimers with at least 6 repetitions and trimers, tetramers, pentamers and hexamers with at least 5 repeats. Microsatellites were considered compound when two SSRs were not separated by more than 100 bp. A total of 2252 SSRs were identified as 2164 unigenes, and 204 unigenes had more than 1 SSR. Dimers and trimers were the most common types (Table  2) and represented 94.2% of SSRs found in unigenes. The distribution of all possible dimer and trimer motifs found in the unigenes is listed in Table  3. The poly(AG)n and poly(AAG)n groups were the most abundant motifs in  T. cacao unigenes. For each SSR identified, if possible, 3 couples of primers were defined using Primer3 [ 47]. A total of 5265 flanking sequences were designed and it was possible to define at least one couple of primers for 1755 SSRs. The exploration of redundant ESTs in contigs was shown to be a valuable resource of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) [ 48]. SNPs were detected using QualitySNP [ 49] pipeline from unigene contigs. We assumed that contigs with at least 100 members contained paralogous sequences [ 50, 51] therefore we selected 4818 contigs that contained at least 4 sequences but no more than 100 sequences. A preliminary study assembled 5246 SNPs into 2012 contigs. Transitions (A/T-G/C) represented 54.2% of the SNPs found, transversions 32.1% and InDels 13.7%."," Background Theobroma cacao L., is a tree originated from the tropical rainforest of South America. It is one of the major cash crops for many tropical countries. T. cacao is mainly produced on smallholdings, providing resources for 14 million farmers. Disease resistance and T. cacao quality improvement are two important challenges for all actors of cocoa and chocolate production. T. cacao is seriously affected by pests and fungal diseases, responsible for more than 40% yield losses and quality improvement, nutritional and organoleptic, is also important for consumers. An international collaboration was formed to develop an EST genomic resource database for cacao. Results Fifty-six cDNA libraries were constructed from different organs, different genotypes and different environmental conditions. A total of 149,650 valid EST sequences were generated corresponding to 48,594 unigenes, 12,692 contigs and 35,902 singletons. A total of 29,849 unigenes shared significant homology with public sequences from other species.Gene Ontology (GO) annotation was applied to distribute the ESTs among the main GO categories.A specific information system (ESTtik) was constructed to process, store and manage this EST collection allowing the user to query a database.To check the representativeness of our EST collection, we looked for the genes known to be involved in two different metabolic pathways extensively studied in other plant species and important for T. cacao qualities: the flavonoid and the terpene pathways. Most of the enzymes described in other crops for these two metabolic pathways were found in our EST collection.A large collection of new genetic markers was provided by this ESTs collection. Conclusion This EST collection displays a good representation of the T. cacao transcriptome, suitable for analysis of biochemical pathways based on oligonucleotide microarrays derived from these ESTs. It will provide numerous genetic markers that will allow the construction of a high density gene map of T. cacao. This EST collection represents a unique and important molecular resource for T. cacao study and improvement, facilitating the discovery of candidate genes for important T. cacao trait variation.",NaN,"['Upper Amazonia', 'Theobroma cacao', 'sequences', 'cacao', 'contigs', 'Vitis vinifera', 'cacao sequences', 'Arabidopsis thaliana', 'ESTs', 'unigenes']","[ICS1, single-pass, TIGR, ESTs, perniciosa [ 24], ESTs, CL2Contig3, CL15Contig2, beta subunit, metallothionein-like, photosystem II D1, PIR, 58,061, C, AmiGO, C, C, plastid (1173), C, plant/pathogens, AmiGO, LRR-NBS [ 33], chitinase [ 34] (19, 1–3 beta glucanase [ 35], pathogenesis-Related protein (24, MAPKinase, plant/pathogens, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (4, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, chalcone synthase (6, chalcone isomerase, flavanone-3-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol reductase, anthocyanidin synthase, flavonoid-3-glucosyltransferase, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, poly(AG)n, poly(AAG)n, SSRs, ESTs]",[],[],[],NaN

Mechanistically, these reactions could occur via a single, multifunctional cytochrome P450 or some combination of cytochrome P450s and a dehydrogenase. We report here the characterization of a single cytochrome P450 enzyme, Hyoscyamus muticus premnaspirodiene oxygenase (HPO), that catalyzes these successive reactions at carbon 2 (C-2) of the spirane substrate. HPO also catalyzes the equivalent regio-specific (C-2) hydroxylation of several eremophilane-type (decalin ring system) sesquiterpenes, such as with 5-epi-aristolochene. Moreover, HPO displays interesting comparisons to other sesquiterpene hydroxylases. 5-Epi-aristolochene di-hydroxylase (EAH) differs catalytically from HPO by introducing hydroxyl groups first at C-1, then C-3 of 5-epi-aristolochene. HPO and EAH also differ from one another by 91-amino acid differences, with four of these differences mapping to putative substrate recognition regions 5 and 6. These four positions were mutagenized alone and in various combinations in both HPO and EAH and the mutant enzymes were characterized for changes in substrate selectivity, reaction product specificity, and kinetic properties. These mutations did not alter the regio- or stereo-specificity of either HPO or EAH, but specific combinations of the mutations did improve the catalytic efficiencies 10-15-fold. Molecular models and comparisons between HPO and EAH provide insights into the catalytic properties of these enzymes of specialized metabolism in plants.",NaN,[],[],[],[],[],NaN

Degenerated primers for the conserved sequences of sesquiterpene synthases [ 43] were used in reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to retrieve partial sesquiterpene synthase sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two PCR fragments displayed high sequence similarity to other sesquiterpene synthase genes in the public database. The 3'- and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) led to the identification of two distinct full-length cDNAs. The mRNA for  HaTPS1 [GenBank:  DQ016667] showed a length of 1,913 bp, containing an ORF of 1,680 bp coding for 559 amino acids. The mRNA sequences for  HaTPS2 [GenBank:  DQ016668] showed a length of 1,944 bp with an ORF of 1,668 bp coding for 555 amino acids. Both genes encoded proteins with high similarity to germacrene A synthases from other plant species. The molecular weight of the enzymes was calculated to 64.4-kDa for  HaTPS1 and 64.2-kDa for  HaTPS2, falling into the typical mass range of plant sesquiterpene synthases [ 43- 45]. For further systematic classification of the identified sesquiterpene synthases, the genomic DNA (gDNA) sequences were obtained. PCR amplification of gDNA with specific primers for  HaTPS2 resulted in a single amplicon. The complete nucleotide sequence showed a length of 2,791 bp [GenBank:  EU443250]. In contrast to  HaTPS2, PCR amplification with primers for  HaTPS1 showed two gDNA fragments which differed in length. Sequencing of both products resulted in the identification of a third sesquiterpene synthase that showed 95% deduced amino acid identity to the  HaTPS1. Thus, the ORF of the  HaTPS1 and its close homolog was designated as  HaTPS1a and  HaTPS1b [GenBank:  EU327785], respectively. The gDNA sequences for  HaTPS1a/b consisted of highly similar exon structures but differed considerably in their intron length and sequence in particular for the intron 2 and 4 (Figure  1). The gDNA for  HaTPS1a showed a length of 2,826 bp [GenBank:  EU439590] while the gDNA for  HaTPS1b contained 3,312 bp [GenBank:  EU443249]. All three sunflower sesquiterpene synthase genes displayed an assembly of 7 exons and 6 introns, typical for class III terpene synthases [ 46]. They belong to the  TPSa-gene family [ 45], a group of genes mainly consisting of angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases [ 47]. The ORF size in  HaTPS1b was identical to  HaTPS1a (559 amino acids) with 95% sequence identity. The  HaTPS1a/b shared 63% amino acid identity with  HaTPS2 and shared 94% similarity to germacrene A synthases from Asteraceae like  Lactuca sativa ( LsLTC1 and  LsLTC2; [ 32]) or  Cichorium intybus ( CiGASlo [ 31]). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of  HaTPS2 with entries in public database showed 62% similarity to Asteraceae germacrene A synthases from lettuce or chicory but showed only about 40% identity to δ-cadinene synthases from  Gossypium arboretum and  G. hirsutum [ 48- 50]. The amino acid sequences of all three sesquiterpene synthases contained the common sequence motifs for the sesquiterpene synthase family [ 45], such as the highly conserved DDxxD and RxR motifs, responsible for the divalent metal ion-substrate binding (Figure  2). Functional characterization of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases  HaTPS2 (HaCS) For functional characterization, all three synthase genes were heterologously expressed in  E. coli as thioredoxin-fusion proteins. The  HaTPS2 fusion protein was purified through Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Figure  3a). The gas chromatograph mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis of the  in vitro enzyme assay products with substrate FDP showed the presence of the parental mass of sesquiterpene (m/z 204) but with a very low product yield (Figure  3b) which prevented the identification of conversion products. To solve this problem,  HaTPS2 was expressed heterologously  in vivo in  S. cerevisiae using high-copy plasmid pESC-Leu2d in the EPY300 strain which was previously engineered to synthesize copious amount of FDP from simple carbon source [ 51, 52]. The transgenes were induced by the addition of galactose to the medium, and non-volatile dodecane was overlaid on the culture to trap volatile sesquiterpene products. The GC-MS analysis of recombinant enzyme product showed a much higher product yield compared to the  in vitro assay (Figure  3), but the fragmentation pattern of the obtained products still did not allow unambiguous product identification. In this analysis, significant accumulation of farnesol was detected in the negative control (Figure  4, peak I) and in the products obtained by expression of  HaTPS2 in EPY300, indicating an incomplete conversion of FDP to sesquiterpenes. To improve the activity of the enzyme,  HaTPS2 was expressed as a thioredoxin-fusion protein (thioredoxin-HaTPS2, Figure  4) in EPY300, similar to the expression in  E. coli. This modification resulted in a notable increase of synthesized products without altering the overall product profile. Farnesol was completely absent in this  in vivo assay, indicating a complete conversion of FDP to sesquiterpenes probably due to the significantly enhanced  HaTPS2 activity. Products of  HaTPS2 were identified by comparison with the reference spectra in the NIST02 library and also with the authentic standards. One of the two main products was identified as δ-cadinene with α-muurolene, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene and α-copaene as minor products. This result characterized  HaTPS2 as an Asteraceae sesquiterpene synthase involved in the biosynthesis of mainly δ-cadinene and other minor sesquiterpenes (Figure  4), and hence it was named as  HaCS ( Helianthus annuus Cadinene Synthase). The second main product remained unidentified, but its fragmentation pattern (Figure  4, peak 7) showed high similarities to that of an authentic γ-cadinene standard, but differed slightly in the retention time indices (RIs). The RI of authentic γ-cadinene was 1519, whereas the RI of peak 7 was 1521. Spiking the yeast terpene products with the standard showed a fused, broader peak than the original peak 7 or γ-cadinene standard, indicating that peak 7 is not γ-cadinene (data not shown). Comparison of this fragmentation pattern with that of δ-cadinene and γ-cadinene indicates that this so far unidentified compound is also a product with a cadinene skeleton, but its chemical identity remains unknown. The fragmentation patterns of peaks 4 and 5 were very similar to each other (Figure  4) and both showed high similarities to the fragmentation pattern of γ-gurjunene from the NIST02 library. Multiproduct terpene synthases are known from different plant families. For example, γ-humulene synthase and δ-selinene synthase from  Abies grandies produce 52 and 34 products, respectively, from the FDP [ 53]. Within Asteraceae, only the epi-cedrol synthase from  Artemisia annua [ 42] has been described to produce more than one product in significant amount. The only other two sesquiterpene synthases producing sesquiterpenes with the cadinene skeleton were found in  Gossypium hirsutum and  G. arboretum [ 48, 49, 54, 55]. GC-MS analysis of pentane extracts from isolated glandular trichomes showed small amounts of sesquiterpenes. Peaks representing α-copaene, β-caryophyllene, δ-cadinene and the unidentified compounds 7 and 9 (Figure  4) were detected. SPME headspace-analysis of sunflower volatiles showed a whole bouquet of different mono- and sesquiterpenes. Again sesquiterpenes produced by  HaCS were detected, this time in larger amounts (data not shown). These results are in accordance with the report from Schuh et al. [ 56] where β-caryophyllene and α-humulene were detected as volatile emissions from  H. annuus. Besides the compounds produced from  HaCS, several other sesquiterpenes were detected in the headspace experiments, indicating the activity of yet unidentified terpene synthases in sunflower. Generally, terpene synthases form a large gene family [ 47, 57], and hence it is evident that more terpene synthases are expressed in different sunflower tissues or still remained unidentified in glandular trichomes. Functional identification of  HaTPS1a and  HaTPS1b as germacrene A synthases ( HaGAS) HaTPS1a and  HaTPS1b were expressed as thioredoxin fusion proteins in  E. coli to produce soluble protein.  In vitro enzyme assays with purified enzyme showed a single product with the expected mass of m/z 204 in the GC-MS measurements (Figure  5a). A peak with the same retention time and fragmentation pattern was observed by the analysis of a germacrene A standard, produced by the expression of the previously characterized germacrene A synthase  LsLTC2 from  Lactuca sativa [ 32]. The identity of the peak from the  in vitro assays was determined as β-elemene by an authentic standard. β-elemene is the known cope-rearrangement product of germacrene A due to the hot injection port temperature for GC measurements [ 29, 32]. Thus, the  HaTPS1a and  HaTPS1b were named as  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2, respectively. The performance of both sunflower germacrene A synthases was tested  in vivo by expression in yeast and for comparison of the product spectra between  in vitro and  in vivo expression.  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2 were cloned into the pESC-Leu2d plasmid and used to transform  S. cerevisiae EPY300. To produce the germacrene A reference standard, a previously characterized germacrene A synthase from  Lactuca sativa ( LsLTC2 [ 32]) was also cloned and expressed under the same conditions. GC-MS analyses of these products showed two identical peaks for all three germacrene A synthases (Figure  5b). The earlier eluting peak was identified as β-elemene, whereas the later peak represented germacrene A, as it showed identical fragmentation pattern to the literature data and terpene products from reference gene (i.e.  LsLTC2) [ 29, 31, 32]. In contrast to the GC-MS measurements of the  in vitro assays, germacrene A produced from  in vivo assays was not completely converted to β-elemene. The complete rearrangement of germacrene A to β-elemene depicted in Figure  5a is likely due to the high injection port temperature used (280°C for Figure  5a versus 250°C for Figure  5b). These results showed that  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2 are germacrene A synthases, which catalyze the first committed reaction for sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis in sunflower. In contrast to  HaCS, both germacrene A synthases are single product enzymes. Biochemical characterization of sunflower germacrene A synthases To obtain native HaGAS1 and HaGAS2 enzymes, the  E. coli-expressed fusion proteins were digested with enterokinase and further purified to remove the thioredoxin and the enterokinase before biochemical characterization. SDS-PAGE showed nearly homogeneous proteins. For determination of the influence of the thioredoxin fusion part on the biochemical properties of HaGAS1, thioredoxin-HaGAS1 fusion protein was also characterized. HaCS did not show reproducible results  in vitro and its biochemical properties were not determined. Measured pH-optima were 7.4 for thioredoxin-HaGAS1, 7.7 for native HaGAS1 and 7.5 for native HaGAS2. Apparent  Km values for FPP were calculated as 0.82 μM for HaGAS1, 1.06 μM for thioredoxin-HaGAS1 and 0.74 μM for HaGAS2, indicating a similar range like previously reported for sesquiterpene synthases [ 58, 59]. These results indicate that the fused thioredoxin protein part has only minor effects on the properties and catalytic activity of HaGAS1. In contrast to thioredoxin-HaGAS1 and native HaGAS1, HaGAS2 showed substrate inhibition characteristics; because the activity decreased with substrate concentrations above 2.5 μM. Substrate inhibition has also been reported for monoterpene synthases from  Citrus limon [ 60]. Tissue-specific expression of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases In order to assess the relative transcript level of sesquiterpene synthase, semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiments were carried out using cDNA templates from roots, stem, cotyledons, young and old leaves, ray flowers, and trichomes (Figure  6a). The transcript level for farnesyl diphosphate synthase ( FDPS) was also analyzed as this enzyme provides the substrate farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) for the sesquiterpene synthases. It could be shown that  FDPS was expressed in all tissues observed, but was upregulated in those tissues where expression of sesquiterpene synthase genes was detected at highest level (Figures  6,  7,  8). Due to very high sequence similarity, the transcripts for  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2 could not be distinguished in the RT-PCR analyses. Therefore, PCR products for  HaGAS represent the transcripts from both germacrene A synthase genes. The  FDPS was detectable with different expression intensity in all organs except for cotyledons.  HaGAS and the  HaCS showed a much more differentiated expression. Transcripts of all three genes were traceable in roots and young leaves, but in contrast to  HaGAS,  HaCS was not expressed in old leaves. The strongest expression of all three genes was detected in capitate glandular trichomes. These results showed the predominant expression of sunflower sesquiterpene synthase genes in the highly specialized trichome stalk cells. As the transcript for  FDPS was also detectable in RNA samples from these secretory cells, it is predicted that the whole biosynthetic pathway from the precursor molecules to the secreted STL is located in the sunflower trichomes. Transcripts detected in the leaf samples are likely to show the expression of the sesquiterpene synthase genes in trichomes located on the leaf epidermis. The expression of the sesquiterpene synthase genes in young roots, even though low in comparison to the expression in trichomes, showed that both  HaGAS1/2 and  HaCS were not exclusively expressed in the aerial parts of the sunflower. These results were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR experiments (Figure  8). Expression of terpene synthases in roots has been described for many plant species and seems to be a common biosynthetic process in plants [ 57, 58, 61- 63]. As the  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2 were not distinguishable by PCR, a restriction digestion was performed to confirm the expression of both genes. The full-length cDNA of both synthases was amplified from root and trichome cDNA with the same primer pair, and their amplicons were subjected to the differential restriction enzyme digestion. The restriction enzyme  DraI was identified to cut only  HaGAS1 but not  HaGAS2,  PauI cut HaGAS2 but not  HaGAS. Gel separation of the digested products clearly demonstrated the expression of both germacrene A synthases in roots and trichomes (Figure  6b). Two lettuce germacrene A synthases were induced in cotyledons by infection with the downy mildew pathogen  Bremia lactucae [ 32]. In contrast, inoculation of sunflower seedlings with  Plasmopara halstedii [ 64], the sunflower downy mildew pathogen, did not induce the expression of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases in cotyledons or stem and did not have influence on the expression intensity in roots (data not shown). This indicates that expression of these genes is tightly regulated by the developmental program of the trichome secretory cells and is not induced by the infection with these pathogens. Developmentally regulated expression of sesquiterpene synthase genes in sunflower capitate glandular trichomes The low density of glandular trichomes and the early termination of the secretory active phase in young leaf stages complicate the isolation of biosynthetically active trichomes from sunflower leaves. However, trichomes from the anther appendages provided an excellent alternative to study developmental gene expression along the trichome development [ 38]. Using glands from disk florets of different ages, trichome RNA could be isolated from the pre-secretory to post-secretory stage as previously described [ 36]. In order to assess transcriptionally active stages of sunflower trichome cells, semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiments were performed to amplify  HaGAS,  HaCS, and  FDPS (Figure  7). While  FDPS was expressed with the same level in all but the last trichome stage,  HaGAS and  HaCS were highly regulated and expressed only during the active secretory phase of the capitate glandular trichomes. Real-Time RT-PCR data indicated that the combined expression level of  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2 seems to be significant higher than that of  HaCS (Figure  8). A stage-specific expression of terpene synthase genes during trichome development has not been reported before. These semi-quantitative RT-PCR results are in line with the biosynthetically active phases of sunflower trichomes determined by microscopic observations of fluorescent flavones in trichomes and HPLC-measurements of STL content [ 36, 38]."," Background Sesquiterpene lactones are characteristic metabolites of Asteraceae (or Compositae) which often display potent bioactivities and are sequestered in specialized organs such as laticifers, resin ducts, and trichomes. For characterization of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases we employed a simple method to isolate pure trichomes from anther appendages which facilitated the identification of these genes and investigation of their enzymatic functions and expression patterns during trichome development. Results Glandular trichomes of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) were isolated, and their RNA was extracted to investigate the initial steps of sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments led to the identification of three sesquiterpene synthases. By combination of in vitro and in vivo characterization of sesquiterpene synthase gene products in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively, two enzymes were identified as germacrene A synthases, the key enzymes of sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis. Due to the very low in vitro activity, the third enzyme was expressed in vivo in yeast as a thioredoxin-fusion protein for functional characterization. In in vivo assays, it was identified as a multiproduct enzyme with the volatile sesquiterpene hydrocarbon delta-cadinene as one of the two main products with alpha-muuorlene, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene and alpha-copaene as minor products. The second main compound remained unidentified. For expression studies, glandular trichomes from the anther appendages of sunflower florets were isolated in particular developmental stages from the pre- to the post-secretory phase. All three sesquiterpene synthases were solely upregulated during the biosynthetically active stages of the trichomes. Expression in different aerial plant parts coincided with occurrence and maturity of trichomes. Young roots with root hairs showed expression of the sesquiterpene synthase genes as well. Conclusion This study functionally identified sesquiterpene synthase genes predominantly expressed in sunflower trichomes. Evidence for the transcriptional regulation of sesquiterpene synthase genes in trichome cells suggest a potential use for these specialized cells for the identification of further genes involved in the biosynthesis, transport, and regulation of sesquiterpene lactones.",NaN,"['sesquiterpene synthases', 'synthases', 'Figure', 'synthase genes', 'synthase', 'sesquiterpene', 'showed', 'expression', 'sunflower sesquiterpene', 'sunflower']","[64.4-kDa, 64.2-kDa, homolog, sunflower sesquiterpene synthase, class III terpene, LsLTC1, metal ion-substrate binding (, HaCS, thioredoxin-fusion, Ni-NTA, FDP, high-copy, FDP, EPY300, FDP, thioredoxin-HaTPS2, FDP, NIST02, α-copaene, RI, RI, δ-cadinene, NIST02, FDP [, epi-cedrol synthase, 9, thioredoxin fusion proteins, sativa [ 32], β-elemene, cope-rearrangement, β-elemene, sunflower germacrene A, HaGAS1, HaGAS2 enzymes, enterokinase, thioredoxin, thioredoxin, HaGAS1, thioredoxin-HaGAS1, thioredoxin-HaGAS1, HaGAS2, HaGAS1, μM, thioredoxin-HaGAS1, μM, HaGAS2, thioredoxin protein part, HaGAS1, HaGAS1, HaGAS2, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, FDP, germacrene A synthase, sunflower sesquiterpene synthase, HaGAS2, sunflower downy mildew, post-secretory, HPLC-measurements]","['HaTPS1', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS1', 'HaTPS2,', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2,', 'HaTPS1', 'HaTPS1.', 'HaTPS1', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1b', 'HaTPS1a/b', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1b', 'TPSa-gene', 'HaTPS1b', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1a/b', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', '(thioredoxin-HaTPS2,', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1b', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1b', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1b']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase

These compounds consist of chirally rich hydrocarbon backbones derived from terpene synthases, which are subsequently decorated with hydroxyl substituents catalyzed by terpene hydroxylases. Availability of these compounds is, however, limited by intractable synthetic means and because they are produced in low amounts and as complex mixtures by natural sources. We engineered yeast for sesquiterpene accumulation by introducing genetic modifications that enable the yeast to accumulate high levels of the key intermediate farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Co-expression of terpene synthase genes diverted the enlarged FPP pool to greater than 80 mg/L of sesquiterpene. Efficient coupling of terpene production with hydroxylation was also demonstrated by coordinate expression of terpene hydroxylase activity, yielding 50 mg/L each of hydrocarbon and hydroxylated products. These yeast now provide a convenient format for investigating catalytic coupling between terpene synthases and hydroxylases, as well as a platform for the industrial production of high value, single-entity and stereochemically unique terpenes.",NaN,[],[],[],[],[],NaN

The unique, carbocationic reaction mechanism of these enzymes can form multiple products from a single prenyl diphosphate substrate. Two maize genes were isolated that encode very similar sesquiterpene synthases, TPS6 and TPS11, which both produce beta-bisabolene, a common monocyclic sesquiterpene, and beta-macrocarpene, an uncommon bicyclic olefin. Investigation of the reaction mechanism showed that the formation of beta-macrocarpene proceeds via a neutral beta-bisabolene intermediate and requires reprotonation by a proton that may ultimately be abstracted from water. This reprotonation is dependent on the pH and the presence of a Mg(2+) cofactor. Mutational analysis of the enzyme demonstrated that a highly conserved tyrosine residue in the active center of the enzymes is important for the protonation process.

11,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC3295389\eupmc_result.json,PMC3295389,"Results Volatile emission and accumulation in  A. chinensis flowers The emission of floral terpenes by  A. chinensis was investigated using a combination of dynamic headspace sampling and solvent extraction followed by GC-MS analysis. Volatile sampling, which was carried out over the course of a 24 h day/night cycle, revealed a mixture of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and various terpene derivatives to be present in the headspace of the flowers ( Table 1). ( E)-nerolidol emission, calculated on a ng (g fresh weight) −1 h −1 (gFW −1 h −1) basis over a day/night cycle, constituted ∼30% of the total emitted terpenes and was produced at an average rate of 7.5 ng gFW −1 h −1. The ( E, E)-α-farnesene oxidation product, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one ( Anet, 1972), was the second most prevalent terpene compound, with an emission rate of ∼4.18 ng gFW −1 h −1, while ( E, E)-α-farnesene emission was the next highest, at ∼1.15 ng gFW −1 h −1. Lower amounts of the terpene metabolites ( E)- and ( Z)-geranyl acetone and 4,8-dimethyl −1,3,7-nonatriene, which were assumed to be oxidative degradation products of ( E)-nerolidol ( Donath and Boland, 1995;  Boland   et al., 1998 ), were also present. The emission profiles for the main floral sesquiterpenes ( Fig. 1) showed that peak ( E)-nerolidol emission occurred at midnight (0:00 h) then declined over the next 8 h where it remained low until evening. Although there was a suggestion of smaller day-time ( E)-nerolidol emission peak at 16:00 h, the emission rates between noon and 20:00 h were not significantly different. The emission profile for ( E, E)-α-farnesene and its oxidation product 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one remained relatively constant, although levels did appear to gradually decline from midnight onwards. Generally, the concentrations of the different monoterpenes ( Supplementary Fig. S1) were low (< 3 ng gFW −1 h −1) and showed little variation over the course of the day/night cycle, although cumulative amounts of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (predominantly ( E)-nerolidol) were similar ( Table 1). Solvent extractions of flowers taken at the equivalent time points to the above headspace analysis were analysed for the presence of accumulated volatiles. In contrast to the emitted volatiles, the profile of accumulated volatiles was significantly less complex and primarily consisted of sesquiterpenes ( Table 2). On a whole-flower fresh-weight basis, the dephosphorylated FDP derivative ( E, E)-farnesol was by far the most prevalent compound occurring at ∼18,700 ng gFW −1, or ∼72%, of the total extracted terpene volatiles. The accumulated terpenes, presumed to be produced by TPS enzymes, were dominated by linalool and ( E)-nerolidol, with ∼1500 and ∼890 ng gFW −1 respectively. Time point analysis of these terpenes ( Fig. 2) showed that ( E, E)-farnesol and ( E)-nerolidol were largely accumulated during the day, with peak concentrations occurring at noon. Notably, the highest concentrations of accumulated ( E)-nerolidol corresponded to the lowest rate of emitted ( E)-nerolidol and  vice versa, while linalool accumulation remained relatively constant over the course of the day/night cycle. Volatile glycosylation in  A. chinensis flowers Differences in the accumulation and emission patterns for ( E)-nerolidol and ( E, E)-farnesol in  A. chinensis flowers suggested that these compounds might be sequestered in non-volatile glycosylated form for later release. Floral glycosides were extracted from  A. chinensis and analysed by GC-MS after enzymatic hydrolysis ( Fig. 3). This analysis showed that glycosylated forms of ( E)-nerolidol, ( E, E)-farnesol, and linalool were present in the flowers, as well as high levels of glycosylated 8-hydroxylinalool. Glycosylated ( E)-nerolidol was detected at midnight, at ∼290 ng gFW −1 (or ∼44% of the total ( E)-nerolidol pool), and increased to 340 ng gFW −1 at noon (although this level now only equated to ∼12% of the total ( E)-nerolidol pool). There was no glycosylated ( E)-nerolidol detected following the period of peak ( E)-nerolidol accumulation at noon ( Fig. 2), suggesting that between noon and 16:00 h the sequestered ( E)-nerolidol had been remobilized and released from the flower. The pattern of ( E, E)-farnesol glycosylation ( Fig. 3B) was similar to that of ( E)-nerolidol, although it only comprised a minor component (∼0.1–6%) of the total ( E, E)-farnesol pool. Glycosylated linalool accounted for between ∼2.5% and 6.5% of the total linalool pool with peak accumulation occurring between midnight and noon. Unexpectedly, 8-hydroxylinalool ( Fig. 3C), was by far the most predominant  A. chinensis glycosylated floral terpene, with levels declining from ∼87% (∼11,300 ng gFW −1) of the total linalool pool at midnight to 62 % (∼2600 ng gFW −1) at 20:00 h. Identification of terpene synthase-like sequences from  A. chinensis flowers A homology-based gene mining approach was taken to identify putative TPS enzymes that could account for the production of the terpene compounds identified in  A. chinensis flowers. A search of an  Actinidia expressed sequence tag database ( Crowhurst   et al., 2008 ) identified a single contig from floral tissue with sequence homology to known floral TPS sequences ( Supplementary Fig. S2). This transcript represented a full-length cDNA (termed AcNES1) of 1978 nucleotides encoding a predicted protein of 573 amino acids and ∼65.4 kDa. AcNES1 was not predicted to contain a plastid-targeting peptide according to the ChloroP and TargetP prediction programmes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AcNES1 clustered in a well-supported manner with the TPS enzymes in the TPS-g subgroup ( Bohlmann   et al., 1998 ;  Dudareva   et al., 2003 ) ( Fig. 4). The TPS-g enzymes are characterized by the absence of an N-terminal RRX 8W motif, which is reported to be essential for cyclic monoterpene production in the angiosperm TPS-b and gymnosperm TPS-d enzyme subgroups ( Savage   et al., 1994 ). AcNES1 was most similar to the  Actinidia polygama and  A. arguta linalool synthases ( Chen   et al., 2010 ), with ∼78% amino acid identity. Enzymatic properties of AcNES1 Purified recombinant AcNES1 protein was analysed for activity with GDP and FDP precursors in separate solvent extraction assays ( Fig. 5). GC-MS analysis of the pentane/Et 2O extracted volatiles showed that AcNES1 could catalyse the conversion of both FDP and GDP precursors to the respective terpene alcohols ( E)-nerolidol and linalool. The smaller amount of ( Z)-nerolidol produced by AcNES1 was assumed to derive from ( Z,E)-FDP contamination of the ( E, E)-FDP used. Kinetic evaluation of recombinant AcNES1 enzyme ( Table 3) showed that it had a higher binding affinity for FDP compared with GDP ( Km values of 0.80 and 1.89 μM respectively) and an approximate four-fold increase in catalytic efficiency ( kcat/ Km) in the presence of FDP (300 s −1 mM −1) compared with GDP (69 s −1 mM −1) . AcNES1 also showed an approximate 8-fold increase in its affinity for Mn 2+ ( Km ≈ 14.2 μM compared with Mg 2+ ( Km ≈ 117 μM) as the divalent metal cofactor. However, in the presence of Mn 2+ AcNES1, activity was only ∼22% of that observed with FDP and Mg 2+ together and ∼54% of that observed with GDP and Mg 2+ together. The kinetics for substrate and divalent metal ion preference are similar to those observed for other TPS-g enzymes ( Nagegowda   et al., 2008 ;  Chen   et al., 2010 ). Enantiomeric analysis of terpene compounds from AcNES1 and  A. chinensis flowers Enantioselective GC-MS analysis of ( E)-nerolidol and linalool produced by AcNES1 determined that ( S)-( E)-nerolidol and ( S)-linalool ( Fig. 6) were the predominant enantiomers. AcNES1 was also observed to produce ( S)-linalool ( Fig. 6F) from racemic LDP, while the small amount of ( R)-linalool observed was assumed to have derived from LDP breakdown. This assumption was based on the fact that other racemic monoterpene products were seen in this analysis (data not shown). Equivalent analysis of an  A. chinensis whole-flower extract ( Fig. 6D) also showed that ( S)-( E)-nerolidol was the predominant enantiomer and hence supports the assumption that AcNES1 is likely to be responsible for floral ( S)-( E)-nerolidol biosynthesis in  A. chinensis. In contrast to the ( S)-linalool produced by AcNES1, the predominant linalool enantiomer in  A. chinensis flowers, as previously shown by  Matich   et al. (2010)  was ( R)-linalool. Alternative substrate usage by AcNES1 The sequence homology of AcNES1 to TPS-g nerolidol/linalool and linalool/nerolidol/geranyllinalool synthases from grape ( Martin   et al., 2010 ) provided a rational basis for testing additional prenyldiphosphate substrates ranging from C5 to C20. This analysis (summarized in  Table 4) showed that AcNES1 was able to catalyse the conversion of GGDP (C20) to the corresponding terpene alcohol geranyllinalool at ∼10% of the optimized rate for ( E)-nerolidol from FDP but was unable to convert the C5 hemiterpene (isoprene) precursor DMADP to its corresponding alcohol. This  in vitro plasticity for GDP, FDP and GGDP prenyldiphosphate usage in AcNES1 is mirrored in the activity of the three grape TPS-g sesqui-TPS enzymes ( Martin   et al., 2010 ) and again demonstrates an inherent capacity for TPS enzymes to evolve different product and substrate specificities. Gene expression analysis Relative gene expression analysis was carried out to investigate the spatial and temporal regulation patterns of  AcNES1 expression in  A. chinensis ( Fig. 7). The highest  AcNES1 expression was observed in the petals of fully open flowers, with lower expression in the stamens and pistils ( Fig. 7A).  AcNES1 expression was not observed in unopened flowers. Over the course of a day/night cycle,  AcNES1 expression followed a weak diurnal rhythm with peak expression levels occurring between 20:00–0:00 h and 8:00–12:00 h ( Fig. 7B). Gene expression analysis was also carried out to determine how genes in the MVA pathway might modulate FDP flux and consequently sesquiterpene emission and/or accumulation in  A. chinensis flowers ( Fig. 8). The profiles of three family members encoding the key regulatory enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) ( Maurey   et al., 1986 ;  Gondet   et al., 1992 ;  Hemmerlin   et al., 2003 ;  Hey   et al., 2006 ;  Muñoz-Bertomeu   et al., 2007 ) and the mevalonate-5-diphosphate decarboxylase gene ( MDC) peaked in expression at 08:00 h. This peak in expression preceded maximal ( E, E)-farnesol and ( E)-nerolidol accumulation at noon ( Fig. 2), and suggests a link between FDP substrate flux and sesquiterpene accumulation in  A. chinensis flowers. Interestingly, the reduction of floral  HMGR gene expression between 08:00 h and noon also coincided with increasing ( E, E)-farnesol concentrations ( Figs. 8 and  2, respectively). Expression analysis for the other MVA genes ( Fig. 8) showed that peak expression for the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase ( HMGS), phosphomevalonate kinase ( PMK), and isopentenyldiphosphate isomerase ( IDPI) genes all occurred at 20:00 h. Subcellular localization and in planta activity of AcNES1 The subcellular localization of AcNES1 was investigated using an AcNES1-GFP fusion protein in  Arabidopsis protoplasts . Confocal laser scanning microscopy ( Fig. 9) revealed a diffuse GFP fluorescence pattern for AcNES1-GFP protein distribution exclusively present in the cytosol. Similar fluorescence patterns were observed for a control GFP expression product, while no fluorescence was observed in untransfected protoplasts. These results are in agreement with the lack of a predicted AcNES1 plastid-targeting signal (ChloroP) and confirm that this enzyme is located in the cytosol. A. tumefaciens-mediated transient expression ( Hellens   et al., 2005 ) in  Nicotiana benthamiana leaves was used to confirm that AcNES1 acted as a ( E)-nerolidol synthase  in planta.  N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with a CaMV 35S-driven binary  AcNES1 vector construct produced significant amounts of nerolidol ( Fig. 10). ( E)-nerolidol was not produced in control  N. benthamiana leaves that had been infiltrated with buffer or a GUS-containing binary vector. Small amounts of linalool were also identified in both the control and  AcNES1 infiltrated leaves and were therefore assumed to be derived from an endogenous linalool synthase.","Flowers of the kiwifruit species Actinidia chinensis produce a mixture of sesquiterpenes derived from farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and monoterpenes derived from geranyl diphosphate (GDP). The tertiary sesquiterpene alcohol (E)-nerolidol was the major emitted volatile detected by headspace analysis. Contrastingly, in solvent extracts of the flowers, unusually high amounts of (E,E)-farnesol were observed, as well as lesser amounts of (E)-nerolidol, various farnesol and farnesal isomers, and linalool. Using a genomics-based approach, a single gene (AcNES1) was identified in an A. chinensis expressed sequence tag library that had significant homology to known floral terpene synthase enzymes. In vitro characterization of recombinant AcNES1 revealed it was an enzyme that could catalyse the conversion of FDP and GDP to the respective (E)-nerolidol and linalool terpene alcohols. Enantiomeric analysis of both AcNES1 products in vitro and floral terpenes in planta showed that (S)-(E)-nerolidol was the predominant enantiomer. Real-time PCR analysis indicated peak expression of AcNES1 correlated with peak (E)-nerolidol, but not linalool accumulation in flowers. This result, together with subcellular protein localization to the cytoplasm, indicated that AcNES1 was acting as a (S)-(E)-nerolidol synthase in A. chinensis flowers. The synthesis of high (E,E)-farnesol levels appears to compete for the available pool of FDP utilized by AcNES1 for sesquiterpene biosynthesis and hence strongly influences the accumulation and emission of (E)-nerolidol in A. chinensis flowers.",NaN,"['Fig.', 'nerolidol', 'chinensis flowers', 'linalool', 'FDP', 'chinensis', 'expression', 'analysis', 'emission', 'flowers']","[E)-nerolidol, −1, −1, −1, E)-α-farnesene, −1, −1, E)-, Z)-geranyl acetone, 4,8-dimethyl −1,3,7-nonatriene, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E, E)-α-farnesene, −1, E)-nerolidol, FDP, E, E)-farnesol, ∼72, TPS enzymes, E)-nerolidol, ∼1500, ∼890, E, E)-farnesol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E, E)-farnesol, E)-nerolidol, E, E)-farnesol, E)-nerolidol, ∼290, ∼44, E)-nerolidol, −1, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E, E)-farnesol, E)-nerolidol, ∼0.1–6, E)-farnesol, ∼2.5, glycosylated floral terpene, ∼87, ∼11,300, ∼2600, ∼65.4 kDa, TargetP, TPS-g enzymes, ∼78, FDP, pentane/Et 2O, FDP, E)-nerolidol, Z)-nerolidol, E)-FDP, E, E)-FDP, FDP, FDP (, −1, −1, −1, −1, Mn 2, ≈, μM, Mg 2+, ≈ 117 μM, Mn 2+ AcNES1, ∼22, FDP, Mg 2, ∼54, Mg 2, TPS-g enzymes ( Nagegowda   , E)-nerolidol, S)-, E)-nerolidol, S)-linalool ( Fig. 6, S)-linalool (, S)-, E)-nerolidol, S)-, E)-nerolidol, S)-linalool, TPS-g nerolidol/linalool, linalool/nerolidol/geranyllinalool, C20, GGDP, ∼10, E)-nerolidol, FDP, FDP, TPS-g sesqui-TPS enzymes, 20:00–0:00, 8:00–12:00, FDP, HMG-CoA reductase, Maurey   , mevalonate-5-diphosphate decarboxylase, E)-farnesol, E)-nerolidol, FDP, E, E)-farnesol, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, HMGS, phosphomevalonate kinase, isopentenyldiphosphate isomerase, AcNES1-GFP, GFP, AcNES1-GFP, GFP, A., E)-nerolidol synthase  , E)-nerolidol]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-d', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-g', 'sesqui-TPS', 'TPS']",[],[],terpene synthase

Orange fruits accumulate the monoterpene limonene at high levels in the oil glands of their fruit peels. When limonene production was downregulated in orange fruits by the transgenic expression of a limonene synthase (CitMTSE1) in the antisense configuration, these fruits were resistant to the fungus Penicillium digitatum (Pers.) Sacc. and the bacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri and were less attractive to the medfly pest Ceratitis capitata. These responses were reversed when the antisense transgenic orange fruits were treated with limonene. To gain more insight into the role of the limonene concentration in fruit responses to pests and pathogens, we attempted to overexpress CitMTSE1 in the sense configuration in transgenic orange fruits. Only slight increases in the amount of limonene were found in sense transgenic fruits, maybe due to the detrimental effect that excessive limonene accumulation would have on plant development. Collectively, these results suggest that when limonene reaches peak levels as the fruit develops, it becomes a signal for pest and pathogen attraction, which facilitate access to the fruit for pulp consumers and seed dispersers.",NaN,[],[],[],[],[],NaN
13,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC3353483\eupmc_result.json,PMC3353483,"3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Yields of Essential Oils The essential oils yields of four citrus peels during fruit maturation are shown in  Table 1. Species and harvest time had significant effect on essential oil yield. Independently to ripening stage, mandarin exhibited the highest yield (2.70%) followed by lemon (1.30%) and orange (0.74%) while bitter orange showed the smallest value of 0.46%. On the other hand, essential oil yields varied during ripening to reach maximum values during the middle stage of maturity (stage 2) for mandarin and orange while the highest lemon yield was found at the beginning of fruit maturation and decreased after that. Bitter orange showed different pattern behaviour evolution from other species since the yield doubled during ripening from 0.23 at stage 1 to 0.46% at stage 3. Vekiari et al. [ 14] reported a seasonal variation of the yield of lemon peel essential oil extracted from Zambetakis variety cultivated in the island of Crete with the highest value reached at the middle of the season. Our results concerning the mature stage are in accordance with those of Hosni et al. [ 15] who demonstrated that Tunisian mandarin peel was the richest on essential oil compared to orange and bitter orange. However, these authors reported higher values (varying from 1.24 to 4.62%). Such differences could be due to the effect of extraction procedure and environmental conditions. In fact, these authors used dried and ground material from citrus cultivated in Mograne region which is known to belong to the semiarid region, while in our experiment we used a fresh material collected from Menzel Bouzelfa which belongs to the humid region. Extractions parameters are known to greatly influence the essential oil yield [ 18,  19]; moreover, water supply during ripening was reported to influence considerably the essential oil content with an enhancement of the yield under moderate water shortage conditions [ 20,  21]. On the other hand, the yields obtained in our study were higher than those reported in the literature; Ahmad et al. [ 22] reported yields varying from 0.30 to 1.21% for the four citrus varieties from Pakistan. Moreover, lower yields were reported for the mandarins from France (yield ranging from 0.05% to 0.60%) by Lota et al. [ 8] and the mandarin from Colombia (yield of 0.79%) by Blanco Tirado et al. [ 23]. 3.2. Essential Oil Composition Analysis of citrus peel essential oils composition showed 39 identified compounds presenting fluctuations during ripening ( Table 2).  3.2.1. Bitter Orange Analysis of the essential oil indicated that it is made essentially from monoterpenes hydrocarbons which constitute the main class during ripening varying from 71.21 to 94.61% and reaching a maximum at full maturity ( Table 2). Oxygenated monoterpenes were the second class. This later was present with appreciable levels at the first and the middle stages of maturity (7.75 and 22.51%); however, it was markedly reduced at maturity (2.11%). Sesquiterpenes were weakly represented during the ripening. Analysis of the volatile composition showed the predominance of limonene which level varied from 67.90 to 90.95% during ripening, with the highest value reached at the maturity stage ( Table 3). The relevance of limonene in mature bitter orange peel is in accordance with previous reports [ 15]. The essential oil was also characterized by appreciable levels of camphor (0.17–6.37%), cis-linalool oxide (tr-3.40%),  α-terpinene (0.91–1.66%), and octanol (0.02–1.59%). Moreover, the results showed that particularly 1,8-cineole reached an important level of (14.7%) at the semimature stage. Despite the dominance of limonene, the low-abundant compounds are known to contribute actively to citrus aroma. Thus, camphor, which has green dry leave note [ 24], could mainly influence the aroma in the first stage of ripening while 1,8-cineole, characterised by a fresh and cool aroma [ 25], could participate actively to the citrus aroma at the middle stage. However, several minor compounds including  α-terpinene (lemon aroma) [ 26],  α-terpineol (green and floral-like aroma) [ 27], and carvacrol may influence the aroma at the mature stage. Interestingly, when limonene showed the lowest level at the middle stage (67.90%), several minor compounds including 1,8-cineole, terpinolene, sabinene hydrate, and linalool oxide reached their highest content. These later compounds are synthesised from a common precursor:  α-terpinyl cation [ 28]. Thus, at middle stage the biosynthesis of limonene is lowered in favour to other cyclic monoterpenes mainly 1,8 cineole. Biosynthesis of 1,8-cineole is thought to proceed from the a-terpinyl cation via an  α-terpineol intermediate which undergoes internal additional cyclization of the alcoholic oxygen [ 29]. 3.2.2. Lemon As for bitter orange, essential oil composition of lemon was dominated by monoterpenes hydrocarbons followed by oxygenated monoterpenes ( Table 2). These classes represented 98.83, 87.15, and 90.43% for monoterpenes hydrocarbons and 3.92, 8.72, and 5.61% for oxygenated monoterpenes during first, middle, and mature stages, respectively. Immature fruit presented a limonene chemotype since it constituted the predominant compound with a percentage of 68.08% ( Table 3). However, at semimature stage, limonene level decreased (37.63%) while  β-pinene level (31.49%) increased. Thus, the essential oil chemotype becomes “limonene/ β-pinene”. At mature stage, limonene was found to be the most abundant (69.71%). Lota et al. [ 30] analyzed the volatile composition of peel oil of 43 taxa of lemon cultivated in France and reported different chemotypes including limonene and limonene/ β-pinene/ γ–terpinene. Besides, Flamini et al. [ 31] analysed the volatiles emitted by the pericarp of unripe and ripe Italian lemon fruit and found that limonene level enhanced from 65.30 at immature stage to 68.30% at mature stage. These authors concluded also that the emitted volatiles are originated from glandular structures which give an essential oil similar to fruit emissions. On the other hand, other representative compounds in lemon oil were  γ-terpinene and  p-cymene ( Table 3) which showed opposite behavior during ripening; in fact,  p-cymene level decreased from 9.84% at immature stage to 0.23% at maturity while  γ-terpinene level augmented to reach 9.96% at maturity. This is in accordance with their biosynthetic pathway, in which  γ-terpinene is a precursor of  p-cymene [ 32]. Further, the Germacrene D and valencene were the most abandon sesquiterpenes ( Table 3). Minor compounds including valencene have stand out in citrus as important flavour and aroma compounds [ 33]. 3.2.3. Orange Maltaise Differently to bitter orange and lemon, the peel essential oil of orange fruit extracted at three stages of maturity was mainly dominated by limonene which presented a level of 86.43, 81.52, and 85.35% at immature, semimature, and mature stages, respectively ( Table 3). The rest of compounds were weakly represented with levels lower than 1% except for the monoterpenes  β-pinene, camphor and bornyl acetate. These compounds reached their maximum at semimature stage with levels of 1.80, 4.81, and 4.21%, respectively. The increase of camphor and  β-pinene levels suggests an activation of the related terpene synthases which catalyze their formation from the critical intermediates pinyl and bornyl cations, respectively [ 29]. Concerning sesquiterpenes,  α-humulene (0.16–0.34%) followed by germacrene-D (tr-0.12%) were found to be the most represented compounds. Our results are in accordance with that of Droby et al. [ 9] who analysed the composition of peel essential oil of sweet orange fruit at different stages of maturity and found that limonene was the predominant compound with percentage varying from 72.41 to 94.77%. However, these authors reported a decrease of limonene level during the course of fruit maturity especially at the end of the ripening. Such difference could be attributed to both interactions between genetic (biotic) and environmental (abiotic) factors since in their study, these authors considered “Valencia” and not maltaise cultivar. On the other hand, concerning the mature stage, Hosni et al. [ 15] reported a higher limonene level (96.00%) in the peel essential oil extracted from Tunisian maltaise orange than that obtained in our study. These authors found that  β-pinene was also a marked compound (1.82%). However, camphor was not detected in their samples. 3.2.4. Mandarin Analysis of peel oil composition of mandarin during ripening indicated that immature stage was characterized by the predominance of monoterpenes hydrocarbons where limonene (65.37%) followed by  γ-terpinene (12.44%) were the main compounds. Moreover, borneol (1.22%) and caryophyllene oxide (1.18%) were the most represented oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, receptively (Tables  2 and  3). Limonene and  γ-terpinene levels decreased at semimature stage to 51.81 and 2.53%, respectively. This decrease was accompanied with a concomitant increase of 1,8-cineole (26.43%) and E- β-ocimene (7.93%) levels. The enhancement of the biosynthesis of these compounds suggests an activation of the related synthases at semimature stage. The cyclic monoterpenes including limonene,  γ-terpinene, and  α-terpineol are produced from a common intermediate: terpeiyl cation.  α-terpineol undergoes after that cyclisation to lead 1,8-cineole. On the other hand, the enhancement of the acyclic terpene E- β-ocimene level suggest the activation of E- β-ocimene synthase which derives its conversion from linalyl cation [ 29]. Shimada et al. [ 34] reported that the expression of 1,8-cineole and E- β-ocimene genes and their related products in Satsuma mandarin was high in flower and then decreased toward mandarin fruit development. At maturity, 1,8-cineole and E- β-ocimene levels decreased. The essential oil was found to be dominated by limonene (69.00%) followed by  γ-terpinene (14.06%). If considering only the mature stage, similar composition has been described by Lota et al. [ 7] who reported limonene (52.20–96.20%) and  γ-terpinene (tr-36.70%) as the main compounds of French mandarins peel oils. 3.3. Antibacterial Activity The antibacterial activity of citrus essential oils was tested against human pathogenic bacteria. The results presented in  Table 4 showed great differences in the activity between citrus species and during ripening stages. The oils were effective against Gram (+) and Gram (−) bacteria, with a major activity against  S. aureus and  E. coli. Bitter orange, lemon, and orange were effective against  P. aeruginosa only at maturity while mandarin oil remained inactive against this strain. In accordance with our finding, Espina et al. [ 12] reported no activity of the peel oil extracted from mature mandarin fruit against  P. aeruginosa. On the other hand, lemon and mandarin essential oils extracted from immature fruit exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against  E. coli which was comparable of positive control activity. In the case of  S. aureus, the oils were mostly active at mature stage with mandarin oil showing the highest antibacterial activity. The antimicrobial activity of essential oils is believed to be associated with phytochemical components especially monoterpenes [ 35] which diffuse into and damage cell membrane structures. However, the differences on the oils activity found in our experiment between ripening stages may be related to the modifications of the oils composition during fruit maturation. For the four citrus species, the variations of the activity were not correlated to that of the major compound level: limonene. This is in agreement with literature data where limonene is a weak antibacterial compound [ 36]. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of an essential oil is known to result from a complex interaction between its different constituents, which may produce additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects, even for those present at low concentrations. Thus, at immature stage, antibacterial compounds including camphor [ 37] and  α-thujone [ 38] in bitter orange,  α-terpineol [ 39] and nerol in lemon [ 40], and borneol [ 37] and caryophyllene oxide [ 41] in mandarin may be involved in the found activities of the corresponding oils. At semimature stage, the higher antibacterial capacity of orange oil compared to the citrus oils could be linked to the presence of camphor at appreciable level (4.81%). Moreover, borneol could be involved in the found activity since this monoterpene alcohol was reported to exhibit moderate antibacterial activity against  S. aureus and  E. coli but to remain inactive against  P. aeruginosa [ 42]. Our results demonstrated also an important increase of 1,8 cineole in bitter orange and mandarin oils. Literature data dealing with the activity of 1,8 cineole are contrasting; Randrianarivelo et al. [ 43] reported that this ether is effective against Gram(+) and Gram(−) bacteria including  E. coli and  S. Aureus; however, Hussain et al. [ 44] found that 1,8 cineole remained inactive against  P. aeruginosa and  E. coli. The low activity of the bitter orange and mandarin oils at the semimature stage in spite of a high level of 1,8 cineole suggests that this compound is inactive. The activity of the four oils extracted from mature fruits could mainly be due to the presence of the phenolic compound carvacrol. This later is a well-known antibacterial compound acting at low concentration [ 38]. Moreover, mandarin was distinguished from other citrus species by the presence of farnesol which was reported to be highly effective against  S. aureus [ 45] while the activity of orange oil could be ascribed to the enhancement of humulene percentage, which was reported to be moderately active [ 46].","The present work investigates the effect of ripening stage on the chemical composition of essential oil extracted from peel of four citrus: bitter orange (Citrus aurantium), lemon (Citrus limon), orange maltaise (Citrus sinensis), and mandarin (Citrus reticulate) and on their antibacterial activity. Essential oils yields varied during ripening from 0.46 to 2.70%, where mandarin was found to be the richest. Forty volatile compounds were identified. Limonene (67.90-90.95%) and 1,8-cineole (tr-14.72%) were the most represented compounds in bitter orange oil while limonene (37.63-69.71%), β-pinene (0.63-31.49%), γ-terpinene (0.04-9.96%), and p-cymene (0.23-9.84%) were the highest ones in lemon. In the case of mandarin, the predominant compounds were limonene (51.81-69.00%), 1,8-cineole (0.01-26.43%), and γ-terpinene (2.53-14.06%). However, results showed that orange peel oil was dominated mainly by limonene (81.52-86.43%) during ripening. The results showed that ripening stage influenced significantly the antibacterial activity of the oils against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This knowledge could help establish the optimum harvest date ensuring the maximum essential oil, limonene, as well as antibacterial compounds yields of citrus.",NaN,"['essential oil', 'oil', 'stage', 'Essential', 'Oils', 'limonene', 'orange', 'bitter orange', 'mature stage', 'Activity']","[Zambetakis, Mograne, tr-3.40, “limonene/, ”, limonene/ β-pinene/ γ–terpinene, 0.16–0.34, tr-0.12, “, ”, E- β-ocimene, terpeiyl cation, E- β-ocimene, E- β-ocimene, E- β-ocimene, 52.20–96.20, tr-36.70, Gram (, Gram(+]",[],[],[],terpene synthase
14,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC3364978\eupmc_result.json,PMC3364978,"Results Transcriptome profiling using RNA-Seq Between 24 and 41 million 85-nt paired-end reads were obtained from each of four cDNA libraries derived from mature fruit peel at different disease stages: fruit peel from uninfected trees in an orchard with no HLB present; fruit peel from apparently healthy trees (PCR-positive at the time of sample collection, healthy without any symptoms) in an orchard with HLB; symptomatic and asymptomatic fruit peel from the same trees infected with CaLas (PCR-positive with HLB symptoms). These reads were aligned to the NCBI citrus unigene set, with 42 to 46% of reads per sample mapping to a unigene. Six pairwise comparisons were made between symptomatic, asymptomatic, apparently healthy, and healthy control fruit peel to calculate changes in expression (log fold ratio) of individual genes ( Tables S1,  S2,  S3,  S4,  S5,  S6). The comparison between asymptomatic and symptomatic stages of the disease identifies genes related to the appearance of symptoms. Interestingly, the overall expression profiles of apparently healthy and asymptomatic fruit peel were very similar, indicated by fewer differentially expressed transcripts in this comparison. The four fruit types were also tested for the presence of Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) using CTV CP reference sequence T36 (M76485) to show cross-responses to multiple pathogens. CTV was detected in all four sample types. No significant differences were observed among the three fruit categories from the infected orchard ( Figure S1). Functional analysis of RNA-Seq data was performed to determine how the four fruit types can be separated based on their overall transcriptome profile ( Figure S2). Linear combination of transcriptomic data generated vectors or groups to best explain overall variance in the data set without prior assumptions about whether and how clusters might form. It was clearly evident that apparently healthy and asymptomatic fruits showed close similarities and were separated from the other two fruit types. Healthy fruits and symptomatic fruits were clearly distinguished from each other. The 21 target genes most specific to each category are listed in  Table S7. Three complementary methods were used for functional analysis of the transcriptomic data: Fisher's Exact Test and Gene Ontology (GO) descriptions, PageMan gene set enrichment analysis, and pathway enrichment analysis using Pathexpress. The Fischer Exact Test as provided in Blast2GO  [24] is useful to determine the specific GO terms affected by the disease. Some GO terms were significantly over-represented among differentially expressed genes obtained from pairwise comparisons ( Table S8). Among these, several GO terms associated with cell wall biogenesis, modification, and organization and related metabolic processes were over-represented among more abundant transcripts in healthy control fruit than in apparently healthy, asymptomatic, or symptomatic fruit. Interestingly, GO terms related to photosynthetic reactions (Photosystem I and II, rubisco activity, thylakoid localization) were over-represented in fruits showing the typical symptoms of HLB infection. Over-represented GO terms in four pairwise comparisons (symptomatic vs. apparently healthy, symptomatic vs. asymptomatic, symptomatic vs. apparently healthy and asymptomatic, and asymptomatic vs. symptomatic) were analyzed to determine which GO terms correlated significantly with HLB disease ( Figure 1). It is interesting to note that when symptoms are clearly evident, GO terms of small carbohydrate metabolism (monosaccharide, sucrose, and galactose catabolic and metabolic processes) and other important pathways of primary metabolism such as the pentose-phosphate cycle are over-represented. As expected from visual analysis of fruit symptoms, many gene functions related to photosynthesis were over-represented at the symptomatic stage (e.g., electron carrier activity, chloroplast, photosystems, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase complex and activity, thylakoid, photosynthetic dark reaction) compared with all other conditions. GO terms for ion transport were also over-represented at the symptomatic stage. The high number of GO terms for oxidoreductase activity is consistent with the hypothesis that the disease induces oxidative stress. Several categories of GO terms involved in vesicle transport and cell wall biogenesis, metabolism, and organization were over-represented among genes expressed at the symptomatic stage. Interesting defense-related and lipid transport GO terms were over-represented at the asymptomatic stage. PageMan software  [25] was used to visualize functional classes that were significantly affected by HLB disease ( Figure S3). This method pinpoints which subcategory of genes were upregulated and downregulated in each main gene category based not only on metabolic pathways but also on cell functions. Increased expression in diseased samples is seen in photosynthesis, N-metabolism, amino acid synthesis, isoprenoids, jasmonate and salicylic acid, and several transcription factors. Functional classes with decreased expression include sucrose and starch biosynthesis, glycolysis, gibberellins, DNA and protein synthesis, and flavonoids metabolism. Additional changes in expression can be seen in the comparison between samples from the disease-free location and apparently healthy fruits (asymptomatic but from the infected orchard). These changes, eventually affected by environmental variability, probably were induced in early stages of HLB disease. Differential expression of transcripts comparing different stages of HLB infection and their functions were visualized using MapMan software  [26]. This provided more specific information on pathways and functions identified by Fisher's Exact Test and PageMan. For MapMan data analyses, a mapping file composed of NCBI  Citrus sinensis unigenes was used. The third enrichment method was conducted using the Pathexpress web-tool  [27] to determine which metabolic pathways were significantly affected by the disease by comparing symptomatic and asymptomatic fruits ( Table 1). The MapMan graphical metabolic overview identifies transcripts that are differentially expressed in symptomatic and apparently healthy fruit, with each colored square representing a single annotated gene in a particular pathway ( Figure 2). Several genes involved in light reactions of photosynthesis, mitochondrial electron transport, sucrose metabolism, glycolysis, and fermentation were up-regulated. In contrast, gene transcripts for cell wall modification and degradation, pectin esterase activity, and cellulose synthesis were mostly down-regulated. We also identified several differentially expressed genes involved in secondary metabolic pathways, including terpenes, flavonoids, and phenylpropanoids. Photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism The expression of several genes involved in photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism increased significantly in symptomatic fruits, when compared to asymptomatic fruit from the same tree or different trees. Transcripts for oxygen-evolving enhancer 3 (PsbQ), photosystem II subunit Q-2, photosystem II reaction center protein J, and other genes encoding different subunits of photosystem II were highly abundant in symptomatic fruit. In addition, genes encoding subunits of cytochrome b6/f (complex subunit 8, subunit IV) and genes encoding ATP synthase subunits (ATPase subunit III, alpha, beta, F, and complex CF0) were induced ( Figure 3A). Several transcripts encoding subunits of photosystem I increased, including chlorophyll A apoprotein subunit G, photosystem I reaction center subunit (PSI-N), and D1 subunit. Several genes for enzymes involved in the first steps of glycolysis were differentially expressed. Up-regulation was observed for genes encoding protein serine/threonine kinase and fructose-2,6-biphosphatase ( Figure 3B). There were significant changes in transcripts related to carbohydrate metabolism in symptomatic and asymptomatic fruit. The citrus orthologs of two  Arabidopsis genes encoding different isoforms of invertase (AB276108 and EY662586) were induced in symptomatic fruit. In starch metabolism, transcription of glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase was diminished, while several genes involved in starch degradation were significantly differentially expressed ( Figure 3C). Expression of genes involved in raffinose synthesis were differentially regulated, while transcripts involved in galactinol metabolism were abundant in symptomatic fruits ( Figure 3D). Hormone-related pathways Significant transcriptional changes in response to CaLas infection were observed for a group of genes involved in hormone biosynthesis, mobilization, and signal transduction. Log fold ratios for differentially expressed genes in symptomatic fruits compared to apparently healthy and asymptomatic fruits are shown ( Figure 4). Transcripts related to GH3-like proteins involved in auxin synthesis (IAA-amino acid conjugate hydrolase and GH3.1 and GH3.4) were more abundant in symptomatic fruit. Transcripts for GRAM-domain containing protein, involved in the abscisic acid pathway, were more abundant. Several genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction were upregulated in HLB-affected fruit including ACO4, ethylene receptor 1 (ETR1), ethylene response element binding factors (ERF1 and ERF2), ethylene forming enzyme (EFE), while ACO1 and an ethylene-responsive protein were downregulated. Interestingly, genes for ATHK1 and Snakin-1, involved in the cytokinin and gibberellin pathways, were repressed in infected fruit ( Figure 4A). Transcription factors Several transcription factors were differentially expressed in HLB-infected fruit, including those belonging to the AP2-EREBP, helix-loop-helix, bZIP, C2H2 zinc finger, C2C2-CO-like, MYB-related, WRKY, and AS2 gene families ( Figure 4B). Among genes for bZIP, haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase, GBox binding factor 3 and 6 and GBF1 were upregulated at asymptomatic and symptomatic stage, while elongated hyocotyl 5 was downregulated. Some, but not all, bHLH proteins were upregulated in HLB disease. Two AS2 transcription factors (lateral organ boundaries gene family), LBD4 and LBD40, were upregulated while LBD41, LBD21, and LOB were downregulated. Interstingly most of the C2H2 transcription factors were upregulated in response to HLB as were C2C2-CO-like proteins (B-Box types). Several WRKY genes, known to be involved in biotic stress responses, showed increased expression as the disease progressed, including WRKY54, WRKY65, WRKY70, WRKY53, WRKY54, WRKY18, and WRKY50. Fewer WRKY transcripts were less in abundant: WRKY32, WRKY45, and WRKY47. Volatiles and defense response Up-regulation of genes involved in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis such as allene oxide synthase, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, and jasmonic acid-carboxylmethyltransferase was observed in infected fruit, showing that defense responses were induced ( Figure 5A). It is interesting to note that while Lipoxygenase2 (EY727780) expression was down, expression increased for Lipoxygenase1/3 (EY663264). Transcriptional changes were also observed in the non-mevalonate or 1-deoxy-D-xylulose/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis located in the plastids. Transcript abundance of 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase (ISPH) and the geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthase 1 genes involved in carotenoid synthesis was elevated in CaLas-infected fruit. Additionally, genes encoding several types of terpene synthases involved in mono- and diterpene biosynthesis, which affect aroma composition and nutritional properties of citrus fruit, were differentially expressed in HLB-infected fruit ( Figure 5B). The salicylic acid-mediated response was also activated as shown by the higher abundance of transcripts for genes encoding salicylic acid methyltransferases ( Figure 5C). Protein degradation Differentially expressed genes involved in protein degradation were identified at the symptomatic stage ( Figure 6A). Upregulated genes included the ubiquitin-ring family of proteins: zinc finger C3HC4-type ring finger, zinc ion binding ring-H2 protein, F-box family protein, UBQ10, and UBQ3, while transcripts for other C3HC4 ring finger proteins were downregulated. At the same time, transcripts for heat shock protein 82 were downregulated at both asymptomatic and symptomatic stages ( Figure 6B). This gene is a major hub in the protein-protein interaction network deduced from the  Arabidopsis protein-protein knowledgebase ( Figure 6C;  Table S1). Real time PCR validation Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analyses were conducted using all four fruit types to validate the expression patterns of a subset of differentially expressed genes identified by next generation sequencing ( Figure 7;  Table 2). Among hormone-related transcripts, indole-3-acetic acid amido synthetase (GH3.4) was expressed more at all disease stages. Ethylene responsive factor 1 (ERF-1) expression was higher at the symptomatic stage. Transcripts for ent-kaurenoic acid hydroxylase 2 (KAO2) and gibberellin-responsive protein GASA1 were less abundant in infected fruits. The jasmonic acid and salicylic acid pathways were affected by HLB disease. Transcript abundance of lipoxigenase2 (Lox2), which is involved in jasmonate biosynthesis, was lower in fruit from infected trees at asymptomatic and symptomatic stages than in healthy trees from the disease-free location. Salicylic acid methyltransferase (SAM) was strongly up-regulated in infected fruits. Transcription factors are key players in transducing signals generated in response to pathogen infection. Among them, the WRKY family was highly involved in HLB response. WRKY70 was highly up-regulated in symptomatic fruits and its transcript abundance was also significantly higher in asymptomatic, apparently healthy fruit. Transcripts of RD26, NAC-1, and Myb-related transcription factors (MYB TF) were more abundant at asymptomatic stages. Heat shock protein 82 (HSP82), the hub with the highest degree in the protein-protein interaction network, was down-regulated in all infected fruits, with likely consequences for overall fruit metabolism. Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase (APL4) was highly down-regulated in symptomatic fruits while invertase (β-fructofuranosidase) was clearly up-regulated in the peel of apparently healthy and symptomatic fruits from the infected orchard. Sucrose symporter (SucSymport) was up-regulated in infected, symptomatic fruits. The terpenoid pathway was affected by HLB disease, as shown by the down-regulation of terpene synthase cyclase (TerpeneSC). Induction of lipid transfer protein (NNLTP) was observed in the absence of symptoms. The expression of other genes such as acidic cellulase and methyltransferase2 (MTransf2) was diminished in infected fruits.","Huanglongbing (HLB) or ""citrus greening"" is the most destructive citrus disease worldwide. In this work, we studied host responses of citrus to infection with Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas) using next-generation sequencing technologies. A deep mRNA profile was obtained from peel of healthy and HLB-affected fruit. It was followed by pathway and protein-protein network analysis and quantitative real time PCR analysis of highly regulated genes. We identified differentially regulated pathways and constructed networks that provide a deep insight into the metabolism of affected fruit. Data mining revealed that HLB enhanced transcription of genes involved in the light reactions of photosynthesis and in ATP synthesis. Activation of protein degradation and misfolding processes were observed at the transcriptomic level. Transcripts for heat shock proteins were down-regulated at all disease stages, resulting in further protein misfolding. HLB strongly affected pathways involved in source-sink communication, including sucrose and starch metabolism and hormone synthesis and signaling. Transcription of several genes involved in the synthesis and signal transduction of cytokinins and gibberellins was repressed while that of genes involved in ethylene pathways was induced. CaLas infection triggered a response via both the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways and increased the transcript abundance of several members of the WRKY family of transcription factors. Findings focused on the fruit provide valuable insight to understanding the mechanisms of the HLB-induced fruit disorder and eventually developing methods based on small molecule applications to mitigate its devastating effects on fruit production.",NaN,"['Figure', 'symptomatic', 'fruit', 'genes', 'symptomatic fruits', 'genes involved', 'apparently healthy', 'HLB', 'fruits', 'HLB disease']","[HLB, Pathexpress, Photosystem I, rubisco, HLB, HLB disease, photosystems, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, oxidoreductase, HLB disease (, N-metabolism, HLB, Fisher, pectin esterase, oxygen-evolving enhancer 3, PsbQ, photosystem II, photosystem II, photosystem II, cytochrome b6/f, subunit IV, ATPase subunit III, alpha,, beta, photosystem, chlorophyll A, apoprotein subunit G, photosystem I, D1 subunit, fructose-2,6-biphosphatase, invertase (, AB276108, EY662586, glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, GH3-like, auxin, hydrolase, GH3.1, GH3.4, GRAM-domain, abscisic acid, ACO4, ethylene receptor 1, ETR1, ERF1, ERF2, EFE, ACO1, ATHK1, Snakin-1, cytokinin, gibberellin, AP2-EREBP, bZIP, C2C2-CO-like, WRKY, AS2, bZIP, haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase, GBox binding factor 3, GBF1, elongated hyocotyl 5, LBD40, LBD41, LBD21, LOB, Interstingly, HLB, C2C2-CO-like proteins, WRKY, WRKY54, WRKY65, WRKY70, WRKY54, WRKY18, WRKY50, WRKY, WRKY32, WRKY45, WRKY47, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, Lipoxygenase2, Lipoxygenase1/3 (, EY663264, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase, ISPH, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthase 1, F-box, UBQ10, UBQ3, heat shock protein, GH3.4, factor 1, ERF-1, KAO2, GASA1, lipoxigenase2, Lox2, WRKY, WRKY70, RD26, NAC-1, MYB TF, Heat shock protein 82, HSP82, Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, APL4, invertase (, β-fructofuranosidase, Sucrose symporter, SucSymport, terpene synthase cyclase, NNLTP, cellulase, methyltransferase2 (MTransf2]",[],[],"['Citrus', 'Citrus']",terpene synthase
15,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC3614522\eupmc_result.json,PMC3614522,"Results and Discussion Phenotypic and metabolic characterization of grape berries Grape berries were sampled at four developmental stages according to EL system  [4] during 2008 growing season. The staging took into account the berry weight and the content of the main anthocyanins, organic acids and sugars ( Fig.s 1,  2). The developmental stages investigated in this study were identified as EL 32 characterized by small hard green berries accumulating organic acids, EL 35 corresponding to  véraison, EL 36 involving sugar and anthocyanin accumulation, and active growth due to cell enlargement and EL 38 corresponding to harvest time. The date of  véraison was set at approximately 9 weeks post-flowering for each of the three varieties. Metabolic profiling of grapes was carried out using a GC-EI-TOF/MS platform that enabled the relative quantification of several classes of compounds such as fatty acids, phenylpropanoids and sugars among the polar compounds ( Table 1,  File S1). Additional metabolic profiling was achieved using a headspace GC-EI-MS platform for the relative quantification of volatiles. In what concerns amino acids, few could be quantified since the conditions used favored the identification of secondary metabolites. Homoserine and pyroglutamic acid which includes glutamine and glutamic acid were the amino acids identified ( Table 1). Specific chromatogram ion peaks were selected for relative quantification (based on peak height) of certain metabolites during ripening as shown in  Fig. 2. Regarding berry weight corresponding to ripe and harvest stages, Aragonês tends to present bigger berries, followed by Trincadeira and then Touriga Nacional. This implies that berries of Touriga Nacional contain a higher amount of skin per berry which may be related to the increased content in anthocyanins observed for this variety ( Fig.1). The higher weight observed in Aragonês berries may also be partially responsible for higher content in fructose and glucose ( Fig. 2) since these compounds accumulate preferentially in the pulp. To confirm if these and other metabolites were present in significantly different amounts during ripening Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank sum tests were performed using ion peak responses ( File S2). For the multiple comparisons the Benjamini & Hochberg correction was the most adequate. These tests showed that the majority of the metabolites (77, 69%) exhibited a different content either comparing among developmental stages or among varieties. These ion peak responses were also used for Multivariate Data Analysis using the unsupervised method of Independent Principal Component analysis (ICA). A good discrimination was obtained between pre-  véraison/ véraison and post- véraison stages for all the varieties and both analysis of volatiles and polar metabolites ( Fig. 3). However, the developmental stages of EL 32 and EL 35 ( véraison) were only separated according to the polar metabolite fractions while samples corresponding to EL 36 and EL 38 clustered together in both types of analysis (though some degree of discrimination could be observed for polar metabolites). Regarding volatiles stages EL 35 and EL 32 were separated from EL 36 and EL 38 by two independent components accounting for 41.99% of variance. In what concerns polar metabolites the same discrimination accounted for 58.94% of variance. Trincadeira tends to cluster more independently of the other varieties as it has been previously observed using a NMR platform for metabolic profiling  [13]. The heat map showed that the metabolites have a differential accumulation during berry development and ripening ( Fig. 4). Some alcohols and aldehydes such as ethanol, (E)-2-hexenal and heptanal reached the highest levels in ripe and harvest stage of fruits, and contributed to the formation of aroma. The same holds true for sugars and many fatty acids. Organic acids tend to decrease during ripening in all varieties, though exhibiting a high degree of variance among them. Phosphoric acid was an exception since it increased at harvest stage in all varieties. Phenylpropanoids and flavonoids may also decrease or increase during ripening. Microarray, functional categorization of Unigenes and RT-qPCR The mRNA expression profiles of two time points (EL35 and EL36) during 2008 season were compared using the Affymetrix GrapeGen® genome array containing 23096 probesets corresponding to 18711 unique sequences. Testing was performed using biological triplicates for each time point. After performing a Bayes t-statistics from the linear models for microarray data (limma) for differential expression analysis, P-values were corrected for multiple-testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg's method  [14]. The total number of probesets that were differentially expressed at least in one variety (fold change ≥1.5 and FDR <0.05 or fold change ≤−.1.5 and FDR<0.05.) was 8696 corresponding to 37.65% of the total probesets represented in the chip ( File S3). From these, a common gene set of 2255 probesets were differentially expressed in all the three studied varieties, whereas 1282 and 954 probesets were down- and up- regulated, respectively ( Table 2,  File S3). The remaining 19 were either up- or down-regulated in the three varieties. The common set of modulated transcripts corresponds to 1915 unigenes. Gene expression data of the three varieties were used for Multivariate Data Analysis using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ( Fig. 5).A good discrimination was obtained regarding EL 35 and EL 36 stages for all the varieties through PC1 that accounts for 41,89% of the variance. On the other hand, PC2 that accounts for 26,27% of the variance enabled the discrimination of the varieties with Trincadeira clustering independently of the other varieties as obtained previously for metabolomics data. Functional annotations could be assigned to the majority of probesets though 727 of the probesets had matches to genes with still unknown functions ( Fig. 6). Eleven categories beside the genes with unknown function were differentially represented at significant levels during berry development in the common gene set. These were ""primary metabolism"", “secondary metabolism”, cellular metabolism”, ""development”, “cellular process”, “diverse functions”, “regulation overview”, ""response to stimulus, stress”, “signaling”, “transport overview”, and “xenoprotein, transposable element”. In order to validate microarray data and obtain further insights into expression of ten selected genes RT-qPCR analysis was performed ( Fig. 7). Analysis of gene expression and metabolite content during grape berry ripening Carbohydrate metabolism During ripening there is a major decrease in malate content as it was confirmed here by using GC-MS. The study of catabolism of this acid is very important for wine improvement due to its involvement in TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis, ethanol fermentation and for production of secondary metabolites (reviewed by  [23]). In the cytoplasm, malate can be produced from phosphoenolpyruvate produced in glycolysis through the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH). One gene coding for a PEPC was down-regulated (VVTU12208_at, VIT_01s0011g02740) at EL 36 vs EL 35 together with two genes coding for malate dehydrogenase (VVTU1903_at, VIT_13s0019g05250, VVTU4095_at, VIT_03s0088g01190) in agreement with a decrease in malate. Two of these genes (VVTU12208_at, VIT_01s0011g02740, VVTU4095_at, VIT_03s0088g01190) were more down-regulated in Touriga Nacional ( Table 2) which may be related to an enhanced decrease in malic acid content of this variety at EL 38 ( Fig. 2). It is not surprising that a gene coding for a TONOPLAST DICARBOXYLATE TRANSPORTER with homology to a sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter (VVTU17663_s_at, VIT_00s2188g00010), which is putatively involved in the transport of malate in the vacuole, was down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 ( File S3). Organic acids such as malic and tartaric acids are well known for their contribution to wine taste. At  véraison large amounts of malate released from the vacuole may be directly transported to the mitochondria and fed into an increased TCA cycle flux. The mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex provides acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle and NADH for oxidative phosphorylation. The alpha (VVTU3838_at, VIT_09s0018g01940) subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was induced after  véraison, though this enzyme is known to be highly regulated post-translationally. We observed an increase in the expression of a gene coding for ATP-citrate synthase (VVTU37457_s_at, VIT_01s0127g00260) at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties though the highest level of expression was observed in Touriga Nacional. At EL 32 and EL35 this variety tends to present more citric acid than Aragonês and Trincadeira. Aragonês showed elevated concentration of succinate whereas Trincadeira of fumarate ( File S2). While malic and tartaric acids showed the highest content in green berries in all varieties, citrate, succinate and fumarate showed the highest content in different developmental stages (green or  veraison) depending on the variety. During ripening a transcript encoding a Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH1; VVTU35625_s_at, VIT_19s0085g00880) putatively involved in succinate synthesis is down-regulated in all varieties as obtained by both microarray and RT qPCR analysis ( Fig. 6). It was also noticed that several genes coding for enzymes of the TCA cycle such as aconitate hydratase and malate dehydrogenase showed different expression among the three varieties, being some genes up or down-regulated in one variety but not in other ( File S3). The increase in the rate of glycolysis due to an excess of sugars leads to an increase in pyruvate that may trigger aerobic fermentative metabolism  [24]. In fact, the production of ethanol by pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase may occur in ripening fruit  [23]. Here it was observed an increase in ethanol during ripening in all varieties though pyruvate levels showed no significant change. It was observed up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase  [7] which may be indicative of a shift to an aerobic fermentative metabolism during ripening  [25]. We observed that a gene coding for an Alcohol dehydrogenase (VVTU4210_at, VIT_14s0068g01760) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35. This data may indicate that aerobic fermentation is occurring during ripening of all varieties. Other genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenases were up- or down-regulated in only one or two varieties ( File S3). Interestingly, acetic acid, a product of ethanol metabolism which is known for giving a sour, pungent fatty and sweaty aroma to wines was previously detected in higher amounts at harvest stage (EL 38) in Trincadeira comparing to the other varieties Aragonês and Touriga Nacional  [13]. Berries start to accumulate after  véraison the carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis and imported from the leaves. There is a general tendency for an increase in dehydroascorbic acid dimer (an oxidized form of ascorbic acid) at EL 36 and EL 38. This is not surprising since ripening is characterized by increased oxidative stress  [7],  [11]. Moreover, ascorbic acid present in abundant amounts in fruits undergoes rapid oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid  [26] yielding reduced glutathione. Previously, the content in glutathione was shown to increase during grape ripening with 90% being reduced  [27] in agreement with these results. Moreover, ascorbate was shown to decrease during ripening  [11] together as indicated here with genes coding for GDP-mannose 3,5-epimerase 1 (VVTU9987_s_at, VIT_05s0020g04510), VTC2 (VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE), L-Galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (VVTU8069_at, VIT_08s0007g05710), enzymes putatively involved in ascorbate biosynthesis. At the same time there is a decrease in threonic acid ( File S2) which is a polyhydroxy acid derived from L-ascorbic acid  [28]. The pentose phosphate pathway is a process that generates NADPH and pentoses used in reductive biosynthesis reactions within cells (e.g. fatty acid synthesis). An increase in expression of a gene coding for 6-phosphogluconolactonase (VVTU13533_s_at, VIT_16s0098g01200) at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties from the pentose phosphate pathway may be related to increase in fatty acids content as it will be discussed in paragraph on lipid metabolism. Interestingly, there is a big increase in β-sedoheptulose at EL 38 in agreement with major fatty acid accumulation. In conclusion, the analysis of expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and contents in metabolites in all varieties indicates that  véraison is a stage of active carbohydrate metabolism and transport. Ripening is characterized by a complex mechanism of starch breakdown with little sucrose accumulation but major accumulation of fructose and glucose. Raffinose and stachyose may play an important role in ripening of grapes. On the other hand, the pentose phosphate pathway seems to be involved in grape ripening together with aerobic fermentative metabolism. The TCA cycle may operate differently among the varieties since they were accumulating different contents in organic acids in particular in pre- véraison and  véraison stages. Sucrose concentrations remained relatively constant with a slight increase towards harvest stage. This is in agreement with transcript abundance of a gene encoding an enzyme involved in sucrose biosynthesis that was higher at EL 36 when compared with EL35, namely sucrose phosphatase (VVTU21174_s_at, VIT_08s0032g00840) ( Table 2). A gene coding for a myb domain protein R1 transcription factor (VVTU2631_at, VIT_18s0001g09850) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties ( File S3). This gene presents homology to one coding for a  Vitis vinifera sucrose responsive element binding protein which represses sucrose transporters expression in grape berry  [15]. This putative inhibition of sucrose transporters is in accordance with the fact that after  véraison sucrose is no longer transported to the grape cells but instead hydrolyzed at the apoplast  [16], which initiates a futile cycle of sucrose hydrolysis and resynthesis  [17]. Furthermore, the transcript abundance of two vacuolar invertases, GIN1 and GIN2 (VVTU3710_at, VIT_02s0154g00090, VVTU13187_at, VIT_16s0022g00670), which catalyze the catabolism of sucrose to fructose and glucose, decreased during ripening ( Table 2,  File S3) as observed for Pinot Noir  [7] and Syrah  [18]. Proteomics data also showed decreased levels of these proteins in accordance with the relocation of sucrose hydrolysis from the vacuole to the apoplast after  veraison[8]. As expected, at EL 35 an increase in fructose and glucose was already observed in all the varieties ( File S2) confirming that the onset of  veraison corresponds indeed to a stage of initiation of sugar accumulation. On the other hand, starch content has been shown to decrease in Trincadeira berries at EL 35 and EL 36  [11]. However, genes putatively involved in synthesis of starch such as coding for Starch synthase 1, chloroplast precursor (VVTU3541_at, VIT_16s0098g01780) and starch synthase (VVTU13257_s_at, VIT_02s0025g02790) were up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties. On the other hand, a gene coding for an isoamylase-type starch-debranching enzyme 1 (VVTU13947_s_at, VIT_11s0078g00310) is down-regulated. This enzyme is assumed to play a role in biosynthesis of starch  [19]. The control of activity of starch synthesis and starch degradation enzymes is complex in storage organs such as fruits. Different starch degradation pathways may be specific to early development and not active in late development  [20]. We have observed a high up-regulation of a gene coding for galactinol synthase (VVTU3450_at, VIT_05s0020g00330) at EL 36 vs EL 35 ( Table 2). The biosynthesis of raffinose and stachyose occurs via sequential transfers of galactosyl units to sucrose. The galactosyl donor is galactinol synthesized from UDP-galactose and myo-inositol, in a reaction catalyzed by galactinol synthase. The biosynthesis of raffinose and stachyose was reported during ripening of olive, also a non-climacteric fruit  [21]. On the other hand, we observed up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of a gene coding for 1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (VVTU9324_at, VIT_18s0001g03290), an enzyme that participates in inositol phosphate metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signalling. It should be noted the considerable higher fold change displayed by the gene coding for galactinol synthase (VVTU3450_at, VIT_05s0020g00330) in Touriga Nacional (∼105× comparing to 40.81× in Aragonês and 6.64× in Trincadeira). This may eventually imply a different composition in raffinose and stachyose for the three varieties. Raffinose is a minor carbohydrate in grape tissues but it has been reported that accumulation of raffinose in leaves of  Vitis vinifera might be an early step of cold acclimation  [22]. Interestingly, the sugar alcohol erythritol is more present in Aragonês cultivar at harvest stage, and may contribute to the final wine taste ( File S2). Plastid glycolysis seems to be inhibited at the onset and following  veraison as we suggested previously  [11]. On the other hand, cytoplasmic glycolysis seems to be activated. In fact, genes coding for pyruvate kinase, cytosolic isozyme (VVTU18887_s_at, VIT_08s0007g04170) are up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 and a gene coding for a cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is down-regulated (VVTU12977_s_at, VIT_18s0072g00770). Although different berry tissues may have different trends of glycolysis  [8], cellular compartmentation should be taken into account  [11]. This subject deserves further confirmation as a marker of ripening. Nevertheless, the whole rate of glycolysis seems to decrease in ripe berries as suggested by the decrease in glyceric acid ( File S2), a precursor of important biochemical intermediates in that process. Lipid metabolism The increase was mostly noticed for α-tocopherol which presents the highest anti-oxidant activity. Previously, we reported an increase in glutathione during ripening of Trincadeira grapes and suggested to be related to increased oxidative stress at the onset of ripening and during ripening as suggested by  [7]. Interestingly, we observed up-regulation in Touriga Nacional and Trincadeira at EL 36 vs EL 35 of a gene coding for tocopherol cyclase (VVTU22626_s_at, VIT_04s0008g03600,  File S3) which catalyzes the penultimate step of tocopherol synthesis. The precursor of tocopherol, phytol also increases at EL 36 and EL 38 in Touriga Nacional berries. Derivatives of fatty acids may be structural components of cell membranes, and/or used in triacylglycerol production  [39]. Two genes coding for triacylglycerol lipases (VVTU15811_at VIT_09s0002g00990, VVTU8356_at, VIT_07s0005g01240) were up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35, and may be involved in the release of fatty acids. The resultant product of glycerol-3-phosphate which decreases during ripening ( File S2) may be metabolized for synthesis of esters of fatty acids for surface waxes  [40],  [41]. It was noticed an up-regulation of a gene coding for chloroplastidial palmitoyl-monogalactosyldiacylglycerol delta-7 desaturase in all the varieties up to EL 38 as revealed by RT qPCR data (VVTU3709_at, VIT_09s0002g06970,  Fig. 7) putatively involved in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis for that purpose. Interestingly, glycerol which is also important for wineś taste presented the highest concentration at EL 38 in Aragonês ( File S2). On the other hand, it was noticed the up-regulation of a gene coding for a diacylglycerol kinase 2 (VVTU5906_at, VIT_07s0031g02840) which functions in the recycling of diacylglycerol, yielding phosphatidic acid, a compound that has emerged as an important lipid second messenger in plants, being involved in a wide range of biotic (e.g. pathogens) and abiotic (e.g. osmotic, temperature) stress responses  [42]. These stresses are known to increase during grape ripening  [11]. It was observed the up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties of a gene coding for a 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (VVTU25722_at, VIT_18s0001g11910) which intervenes in the phospholipid biosynthetic process. This suggests that this class of lipids may increase during ripening as it occurs with  Capsicum annuum, another non-climacteric fruit  [43]. Indeed, the most abundant fraction of grape lipids has been reported to be the phospholipids  [44]. The metabolism of lipids is very active during grape ripening due to the breakdown of plastid thylakoids, and differentiation of chloroplasts into non-photosynthetic chromoplasts. In these plastids fatty acid biosynthesis is enhanced for wax biosynthesis, as well as for aroma production which is due also to a specific fatty acid and correspondent esters combination. Steroid composition also varies among varieties but tends to decrease during ripening. On the contrary, tocopherol increases probably to cope with increased stress occurring during grape ripening. The glyoxalate cycle plays a role in metabolism of fatty acids during seed germination; but was relevant to our analyses even though seeds have been removed from our samples. At EL 36 vs EL 35 there is down-regulation of a gene coding for glyoxalate reductase (VVTU9635_s_at, VIT_03s0038g02510) in all varieties in agreement with a decrease in glycolic acid ( Tables 1,  2). The net result of the glyoxalate cycle is the production of glucose from fatty acids. However, fatty acid oxidation does not seem to be favored during ripening in pulp and skin but instead fatty acid biosynthesis appeared to be enhanced. Indeed, we have observed at EL 36 and EL 38 an increase in content in several saturated fatty acids ( Table 1,  File S2) as previously reported for another  Vitis vinifera variety  [29]. Moreover, genes coding for key enzymes of glyoxalate cycle such as malate synthase and isocitrate lyase were down-regulated though not in all varieties ( File S3). It was observed up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of two genes coding for Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain member 2 and 6 (VVTU13825_at, VIT_02s0025g01410, VVTU40835_s_at, VIT_05s0020g03080) in Touriga Nacional and Aragonês. The skin of berries from these varieties is thicker than from Trincadeira (Agudelo-Romero et al., unpublished). Fatty acids can be found in cells in activated form performed by enzymes acyl-CoA synthetases. The resultant acyl-CoAs are used in the biosynthesis of many cellular products such wax and cutin which are components of berry skins. After  veraison grape berries continue to enlarge due to cell expansion driven by the increase of sugar content in the cell vacuole and a continuous flow of water; therefore a thick cuticule is necessary to avoid evapotranspiration. The surface wax of the grape berry is chemically a mixture of long-chain alcohols, esters of such alcohols and fatty acids, free fatty acids, long-chain aldehydes, and hydrocarbons  [30]. The GC-MS platform enabled the identification of several saturated fatty acids which in general increase at EL 36 and/or EL 38, namely octacosanoic, hexacosanoic and triacontanoic acids ( Table 1,  File S2). This increase was much more noticed in Touriga Nacional berries whereas docosanoic and eicosanoic acids showed increased levels at EL 38 in Aragonês cultivar. This increase is not surprising since saturated long-chain fatty acids are major constituents of grape waxes that accumulate in ripe berries. The hexacosanoic acid or cerotic acid is a component of carnauba wax, an extremely good wax presenting several commercial applications. It is interesting to note that this fatty acid increased significantly in Touriga Nacional samples ( File S2). The composition of their skin e.g wax density may influence the resistance of this variety to fungal attack  [31] comparing to other varieties such as Trincadeira. Lipid components in fruits though occurring in low amounts are important due to their nutritional value and due to their contribution to aroma and flavor. Fatty acids as n-hexadecanoic acid and 9,12-(Z, Z)-octadecadienoic acid (linoleic acid) have an important influence on the flavour of strawberry fruit  [32]. A gene coding for a chloroplastidial omega 6-fatty acid desaturase (VVTU24552_at, VIT_11s0016g00130) was down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all the varieties. This enzyme also known as FAD6 is the primary route of polyunsaturated fatty acids production in plants and converts oleic acid (18∶1, a monounsaturated fatty acid) to linoleic acid  [33] which provides a potential herbaceous aroma in ripe grapes  [29]. In fact, we did not detect a significant decrease in linoleic acid. Also a gene coding for a chloroplastidial omega-3 fatty acid desaturase (VVTU5073_at, VIT_08s0105g00430) putatively involved in α-linolenic acid biosynthesis is down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties. A gene coding for a stearyl acyl carrier protein desaturase was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties (VVTU35129_s_at, VIT_18s0001g15460). Stearoyl ACP-desaturase, commonly known as fatty acid biosynthesis 2 (FAB2), is a key enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of stearic (18∶0) into oleic acid (18∶1)  [34]. Nevertheless we did not observe a significant decrease in stearic acid also known as octadecanoic acid. Other fatty acids such as octadecenoic and hexadecanoic also showed no significant differences throughout ripening ( File S2). However, in 'Pedro Ximnez'  Vitis vinifera grapes hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid) increased during ripening  [29] highlighting metabolic specificities among varieties. Regarding steroid biosynthesis we have observed down-regulation of genes coding for squalene synthase (VVTU35040_s_at, VIT_03s0038g00450), and 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (VVTU3496_at, VIT_01s0146g00070) suggesting decreased steroid synthesis at EL 36. In fact, a transcript encoding 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase has been recently considered a biomarker of pre- veraison and  veraison stages  [9]. Campesterol decreased during ripening in all the varieties while stigmastan-3-ol showed no significant variation in content. In tomato, among all sterol lipids, the ratio of stigmasterol to β-sitosterol the two major sterols in tomato, increased 2.3-fold during ripening  [35]. It has been reported an increase in the total sterol content of pericarp tissue during ripening of tomato fruit from mature green to red ripe stages  [36]. In berries of  Vitis vinifera at least for the sterols evaluated this does not seem to be the case. In addition, a gene involved in brassinosteroidś biosynthesis from campesterol and coding for a steroid 5 alpha reductase DET2 (VVTU6606_at, VIT_08s0007g01760) was down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all the varieties ( File S3). This class of hormones plays an important role in the onset of grape ripening  [37]. We observed an increase in α-tocopherol and β-tocopherol in all varieties during ripening but in particular in Touriga Nacional. The increase in tocopherol has been reported also for tomato and recently shown to be regulated by  APETALA2a ( AP2a) transcription factor  [38]. It is interesting to note that a gene coding for  AP2a (VVTU2494_at, VIT_07s0031g00220) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all the varieties ( File S3). It remains to be established whether this transcription factor is a major regulator of grape ripening as occurs in tomato  [38]. Amino acid metabolism Homoserine and pyroglutamic acid which when monitored by the chosen GC-MS profiling approach also includes glutamine and glutamic acid were the amino acids identified ( Table 1). In this context, the use of an NMR- based platform enabled the quantification of many amino acids, namely arginine, valine and threonine  [13]. This highlights the fact that both platforms used in metabolomics studies are complementary. Glutamate was shown previously to decrease at EL 38 in all varieties  [13] as it happens here with pyroglutamic acid. It is interesting to note that genes related to glutamate metabolism were down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all the varieties and may eventually be considered as negative markers of ripening such as glutamate N-acetyltransferase (VVTU22296_s_at, VIT_08s0040g03320) and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (VVTU13950_s_at, VIT_08s0007g07400). L-Homoserine is a precursor of methionine biosynthesis. Interestingly, it has been shown that homoserine accumulation in the chloroplast triggers a novel form of downy mildew resistance that is independent of known defense signaling pathways  [45]. Though the levels of this amino acid have remained the same throughout ripening in all varieties we have detected increased methionine levels towards harvest especially in Trincadeira  [13]. S-adenosyl-L-methionine is a precursor of both ethylene and polyamine biosynthesis. Recently, we showed that during ripening there is an increase in polyamine catabolism in the three varieties  [46]. Regarding the synthesis of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine which is a precursor of the phenolic compounds that accumulate during ripening, it was observed the up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of genes coding for a 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (VVTU1391_at, VIT_00s0391g00070) and a cytosolic chorismate mutase (VVTU6948_at, VIT_04s0008g06570) putatively involved in shikimate metabolism and phenylalanine biosynthesis. Therefore, it is not surprising that shikimate content is decreased in berries at ripe and harvest stages ( File S2) though it was substantially higher at EL 32 and EL 35 in Aragonês and Touriga Nacional cultivars than in Trincadeira. Those varieties are known to accumulate more phenolic compounds  [13]. Also different genes coding for phenylalanine ammonia lyase were up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 though not in all varieties ( File S3). From the above it can be suggested that the metabolisms of glutamate, methionine and phenylalanine play a major role in grape ripening. Flavonoid and stilbene metabolism Phenylpropanoid metabolism plays a major role in grape ripening changing the content in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonols, tannins, anthocyanins, and stilbenes from green to harvest stage of grapes and presenting cultivar specific variation with a tendency of Touriga Nacional to present more phenolics. Genes coding for enzymes acting on flavonols, stilbenes, and anthocyanins synthesis were noticed to be induced during grape ripening  [7],  [11]. Our results confirm these for all the varieties and establish these genes as candidate markers of grape ripening. In addition, many genes coding for transcriptions factors of the MYB family were up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all the varieties and may be involved in the regulation of the flavonoid pathway as other previously characterized MYB transcription factors  [12]. These are the case of genes coding for myb domains proteins 73, 14, R1 and 94 ( File S3). A gene coding for a flavonol synthase (VVTU16103_at, VIT_18s0001g03470) was up-regulated at EL36 vs EL 35. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of dihydroflavonols to flavonols which are important co-pigments that stabilize anthocyanins in wine. In the skin of Shiraz berries,  VvFLS1 expression is highest between flowering and fruit set, then declines to  veraison, and increases again during ripening coincident with accumulation of flavonols per berry  [47]. The same seems to be the case of this gene coding for flavonol synthase at least in Touriga Nacional ( Fig. 7). However, in this work it was detected a decrease in quercetin following EL 32 in all varieties including Touriga Nacional ( Fig. 8) in agreement with a previous identified decrease in quercetin glycoside using NMR  [13]. Ampelopsin or dihydromyricetin is a flavanonol presenting anti-cancer properties and derivates from the flavonol myricetin  [48]. Interestingly, it was detected at higher concentrations in ripe berries (EL 36) ( Fig. 8) and mainly in Aragonês. This fact highlights the use of GC-MS as a platform to investigate the medicinal potential of samples. A reduction in tannin concentration from pre- veraison to harvest has been well documented  [49]. The tannin catechin decreases during ripening in all varieties as shown in  Fig. 8 for Touriga Nacional. However, it should be noted that Trincadeira presents much lower levels of catechin at EL 32 and EL 35 than the other varieties. Interestingly, epigallocatechin was higher in Aragonês at harvest stage and may contribute to higher astringency of the wine. This compounds is a precursor of epigallocatechin-3-gallate which is known for the anti-oxidant properties  [50]. The observed decrease in gallic acid during ripening is expected since this compound makes part of tannins such as epigallocatechin. It is clear the overall flavonoid profile of grapes changes significantly over time  [51] and includes a significant reduction in catechin and gallic acid. One gene coding for an UDP-glucose: anthocyanidin 5,3-O-glucosyltransferase (VVTU14620_at, VIT_18s0041g00740) was up-regulated at EL36 vs EL 35. Another gene coding for this enzyme was down-regulated (VVTU13618_x_at, VIT_16s0050g01580) at EL 36 when compared to EL 35 but was up-regulated at EL 35 when compared to EL 32 at least for Trincadeira cultivar  [11]. This suggests that the pattern of anthocyanins may change during berry ripening as recently observed for Corvina berries  [51]. These authors showed a rapid accumulation of nonacylated anthocyanins and flavones during  veraison, concomitant with a sharp decline in the levels of aromatic organic acids and procyanidins. This could be due to the use of the organic acid pool to provide precursors for the synthesis of other molecules. For example, both coumaric acid and caffeic acid could in principle be used (as coumaroyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA, respectively) as substrates for the production of chalcones by chalcone synthase. The resulting chalcones could then be used for the synthesis of flavones and anthocyanins  [51]. Interestingly, we have detected a decrease in caffeic acid in ripe berries of all the varieties being no longer detected at harvest stage. Touriga Nacional was the variety accumulating more caffeic acid at EL 32 and shown to present more anthocyanins at EL 36 and EL 38 ( Fig. 1). The same holds true for trans- 4-hydroxycinnamic acid or  p-coumaric acid ( Fig. 8), which is a precursor of flavonoids, stilbenes and coumarins  [52]. Two genes coding for trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase (VVTU15353_at, VIT_11s0065g00350, VVTU12032_s_at, VIT_06s0004g08150) were more expressed at EL 36 vs EL 35 in Touriga Nacional ( Fig. 8). Previously, and through an NMR platform it was established that the green and  veraison stages (EL 32, EL 35) of Touriga Nacional presented more hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives such as caftaric acid than Aragonês and Trincadeira  [13] and that was recently related to increased anti-tumoral properties of that cultivar  [53]. One gene coding for flavonoid 3,5 –hydroxylase (VVTU35884_at, VIT_06s0009g03010) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 but only in Trincadeira ( Table 2,  File S3). This enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of the B-ring of flavonoids and can act on flavonols, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins. Bogs and co-workers  [54] showed that in berry skin, expression of these genes was low at the onset of ripening but increased after  veraison concomitant with the accumulation of 3′- and 3′,5′-hydroxylated anthocyanins. The hydroxylation pattern of the B-ring is an important determinant of flavonoids ´coloration, stability, and antioxidant capacity  [55]. Regarding stilbenes, their accumulation during ripening of grape berries is well known  [2]. It is interesting to note, however, that resveratrol or  trans-3, 4′,5,-trihydroxystilbene is present at higher concentrations in Touriga Nacional berries at ripe ( Fig. 8) and harvest stages in agreement with a higher fold change detected at EL 36 vs EL 35 in this variety for several genes coding for stilbenes synthases (VVTU34913_at, VIT_16s0100g00810, VVTU15628_s_at, VIT_16s0100g00950, VVTU34553_s_at, VIT_16s0100g01030). Aroma development One gene coding for a lactoylglutathione lyase (VVTU11834_at, VIT_09s0002g06420) was up-regulated whereas another one (VVTU9837_s_at, VIT_04s0008g03560) was down-regulated EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties. The same holds true for four genes coding for aldo-keto reductase (VVTU4697_at, VIT_08s0007g01040, VVTU9888_at, VIT_05s0049g01130, VVTU11927_at, VIT_05s0062g00980, VVTU3533_s_at, VIT_05s0077g01300). Lactoylglutathione lyase or glyoxalase I is involved in the detoxification of methylglyoxal together with aldo-keto reductase. Dicarbonyl compounds, like methylglyoxal, are often associated with amino acids in the formation of odorous products present in wine so the previously mentioned enzymes may play a role in wine aroma. For instance, leucine and methylglyoxal give rise to 3-methylbutanal responsible for a moderate amylic aroma  [65]. This compound reached the highest values in Touriga Nacional at harvest stage. Among other important volatiles is the alcohol 3-methylbutanol considered as a key-odorant in Grenache, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot wines  [66]. This compound was presented in higher concentration in Touriga Nacional and Aragonês berries at EL 32 but decreased during ripening in both varieties showing no significant differences from Trincadeira at EL 38. Benzaldehyde also decreased at EL 36 and EL 38. Therefore these compounds cannot be used to discriminate the potential aroma of wines made from these varieties. Benzoic acid which may constitute a precursor of volatile benzenoids  [67] also showed a tendency to decrease in all varieties during ripening. The majority of cyanogenic glucosides are derivatives of benzaldehyde cyanohydrin (mandelonitrile, i.e. nitrile of mandelic acid). Cyanogenic glycosides may be defined chemically as glycosides of a-hydroxinitriles and function in nitrogen storage for germination and plantlet development, and pathogen and herbivory defense  [68]. The involvement of cyanogenic glycosides in fruit ripening has been previously mentioned for strawberry  [69]. In grapevine, cyanogenesis (release of cyanide) has been detected in leaves but not in berries though the possibility that cyanogenic compounds, are present in berries remains to be excluded  [70]. Interestingly, a gene coding for beta-cyanoalanine synthase (VVTU13018_s_at, VIT_15s0046g02300) putatively involved in cyanide detoxification was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 but only in Aragonês. Among other free volatiles reported in grapes are C6 alcohols and aldehydes derived from linoleate cascade through activity of lipoxygenases  [71]. We have observed up-regulation of an enzyme coding for a lipoxygenase (VVTU13955_at, VIT_14s0128g00780) that was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 but only in Touriga Nacional and Trincadeira. Since these varieties present more (E)-2-Hexenal and hexanal especially at EL 36 we can speculate whether the gene coding for this enzyme is involved in the synthesis of these C6 aldehydes. Previously and in Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, both (E)-2-hexenal and hexanal showed a significant increase after  veraison followed by a decrease in the harvest sample  [72]. It is also interesting to note that a gene coding for fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase (HPL1; VVTU37595_s_at, VIT_12s0059g01060) was down-regulated at EL36 vs EL 35 but only in Aragonês. Hexenal can be converted to hexanol by alcohol dehydrogenases. One gene coding for alcohol dehydrogenase was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 (VVTU4210_at, VIT_14s0068g01760) in all varieties. Production of volatiles as a result of alcohol dehydrogenase activity was suggested to contribute to the development of taste and aroma in fruits  [73]. Besides hexenal and (E)-2-hexenal other aliphatic aldehydes such as octanal and (E)-2-heptenal provide an herbaceous odor. Octanal seems to be in higher amounts in Trincadeira at EL 38 whereas (E)-2-heptenal is present at EL 35. (E)-2-heptenal or  trans-2-heptenal, and (E)-2-hexenal or  Trans-2-hexenal are known to provide fruity, green, leafy notes  [74]. Decanal is associated with citrus peel and “sawdust” or “plant” odor  [75] and accumulate in Trincadeira at EL 36 and EL 38. Nonanal with a fatty-green aroma  [76] also accumulates at these stages in particular in this variety. Genes coding for carboxylesterases were up or down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in only some varieties ( File S3). These enzymes are involved in hydrolysis of esters into acids and alcohols and may contribute to flavor development. Interestingly, anthraniloyal-CoA: methanol anthraniloyal transferase putatively involved in the biosynthesis of fruit esters responsible for aroma was up-regulated from EL 35 to EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties (VVTU5363_at, VIT_09s0018g01490). It is difficult to establish the activity of the enzyme coded by this gene since it shows strong homology with other acyltransferases responsible for synthesis of flavor compounds but it may be involved in the synthesis of the volatile methyl anthranilate  [77]. Monoterpenes, C 13-norisoprenoids, and some benzenoid compounds are the most important grape aroma substances present in the pulp and skin of berries in both free and glycoside forms. Their specific profiles depend mainly on the variety though environmental cues may have impact (Flamini and Traldi, 2010). S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases catalyze methylation of several molecules, and are key enzymes in phenylpropanoid, flavonoid and many other metabolic pathways. Enzymatic methylation of hydroxyl and carboxyl moieties is catalyzed by O-methyltransferases which include SAM: salicylic acid carboxy methyltransferases, SAM: jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferases and SAM: benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferases, among others  [78]. A gene coding for a S-adenosyl-L-methionine:salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (VVTU5372_s_at, VIT_04s0023g02280) was down-regulated at EL36 vs EL 35, and may play an important role in specific aroma production at earlier stages of berry development  [78]. Other two genes, however, were expressed either in Touriga Nacional (VVTU14878_s_at, VIT_04s0023g02200) or in Aragonês and.Trincadeira (VVTU8882_at, VIT_01s0011g05920). A gene coding for a caffeic acid methyltransferase (VVTU36927_x_at, VIT_12s0059g01790) putatively involved in aroma production was also down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 as it was already referred for a decrease in the compound caffeic acid. RT qPCR data showed that this gene presented a major decrease from EL 32 to EL 35 in particular in Aragonês cultivar ( Fig. 7). Other methyltransferases such as  O-methyltransferases may be involved in the synthesis of vanillin  [79] which precursor is vanillic acid. The presence of this compound was only identified in grapes at EL 36 and EL 38 stages of ripening and shown to be present at higher amounts in Touriga Nacional, highlighting the known aromatic potential of these grapes. In fact, ethyl vanillate was shown to be present in clonal red wines from Touriga Nacional (Falco da Costa, personnal communication). It should be pointed out that methyltransferases constitute a protein family in which little correlation is observed between the level of sequence similarity among enzymes and the structural similarity of their substrates so their activities should be discussed with caution  [56]. Cytochrome P450 are also involved in the formation of plant volatiles and in a vast array of biosynthetic pathways in secondary and primary metabolism  [56]. A gene coding a CYP89H3 (VVTU21329_at, VIT_16s0039g00880) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs El 35 in all varieties in particular in Trincadeira while the expression values at EL 38 were similar among the varieties ( Fig. 7). Other genes coding for CYPs were up-regulated in one or two varieties and may eventually be involved in aroma development ( File S3). It was noticed the up-regulation of a gene coding for alliin lyase precursor (VVTU16622_at, VIT_00s0225g00230) in all varieties, especially in Trincadeira. Alliin lyase (alliinase) gives rise to volatile sulphur compounds from S-alk(en)yl cysteine sulphoxide flavor precursors derived from cysteine and glutathione  [80]. This latter compound was shown to increase during ripening of Trincadeira grapes  [11]. Moreover, glutathione and  trans-2-hexenal intervene in the biosynthesis of S-(3-hexan-1-ol)-glutathione which is a flavor precursor in wines  [81]. In fact, most of the volatile sulphur compounds that contribute to varietal character are released during must fermentation from specific aroma/flavor precursors present in the grapes  [82]. The varietal aroma is built on different classes of compounds that may be more present in one variety independently of the  terroir. Nevertheless at  veraison aromas and flavors begin to develop in all varieties and increase their complexity during ripening. For all the varieties studied pre- veraison and  veraison stages seem to be enriched in carotenoids, benzaldehyde and caffeic acid and post- veraison stages in volatile terpenes and sulfur compounds, C6 alcohols and aldehydes, and vannilic acid. The largest class of plant volatiles is derived from isoprenoid pathways  [56]. The mevalonate pathway is a source of isoprene units for the biosynthesis of cytokinins and brassinosteroids. In plants, both the cytosolic mevalonate and the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate pathways generate the five-carbon compound isopentenyl pyrophosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These two precursors give rise to volatile and non-volatile terpenoid compounds such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) diterpenes (C20), triterpenes (C30), carotenoids, sterols and phytols. In this respect, it should be noted that Touriga Nacional presented a higher quantity of phytol at EL 36 and EL 38 than Aragonês and Trincadeira. Variety,  terroir, sunlight exposure, soil water retention capacity as well as ripening stage affect carotenoid concentration in the grapes which is known to decrease following  veraison[57]. So it is not surprising that genes coding for a chloroplast precursor of phytoene synthase (VVTU39097_at, VIT_04s0079g00680), for a zeaxanthin epoxidase (VVTU6355_at, VIT_07s0031g00620) and for a Beta-carotene hydroxylase (VVTU13738_at, VIT_16s0050g01090) are down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties. However, it is interesting to note that in Touriga Nacional we found up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of genes coding for a Zeta-carotene desaturase ZDS1 (VVTU4228_at, VIT_14s0030g01740) and a Beta-carotene hydroxylase (VVTU13791_at, VIT_02s0025g00240) involved in carotenoid biosynthesis as well as a gene coding for phytoene synthase (VVTU9210_a, VIT_13s0019g01270) that was up-regulated in Trincadeira. Volatile terpenes may derive from the cleavage of carotenoids by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases  [56]. A gene coding for a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 2 (isoenzyme carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1; VVTU8254_at, VIT_02s0087g00930) was up-regulated at EL36 vs EL 35 in Touriga Nacional whereas another (VVTU17555_s_at, VIT_10s0003g03750) was down-regulated in Trincadeira. Some flavor volatiles peak at pre- veraison or  veraison stages and others at ripe or harvest stage and this may be also dependent on the variety. The volatiles (E)-2-Pentenal, 2-Ethylfuran, 2-Pentylfuran, (E, E)-2,4-Hexadien-1-al, 3-Methylbutanol, 3-Methylbutanal, benzaldehyde, 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and (Z)-3-Octen-1-ol were higher at EL32 while (E)-2-Heptenal was more present at both pre- veraison or  veraison stages. The volatiles ethanol, hexanal, decanal and nonanal increased their content at ripe and harvest stages while (E)-2-Hexenal peaked at EL 36. The content in the putatively identified undecane peaked at EL 35 or EL 36 depending on the variety while heptanal at EL 36 and limonene at EL 38. Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases have been reported to generate 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one from lycopene  [58]. This compound is an important flavor volatile in tomato  [59] and tends to be higher in Trincadeira at EL 38 comparing to the other varieties. Different aroma profiles may also be related to the fact that a gene coding for myrcene synthase (VVTU36515_at, VIT_00s0271g00030) was down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in Trincadeira and Aragonês but not in Touriga Nacional. Terpenes which are precursors for important aroma compounds start to accumulate at  véraison[60]. A gene coding for a (-)-isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (VVTU2626_at, VIT_17s0000g05580) putatively involved in monoterpenoid biosynthesis was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 but only in Touriga Nacional. On the other hand, a gene coding for (+)-neomenthol dehydrogenase (VVTU7133_s_at, VIT_15s0046g03570) putatively involved in menthol biosynthesis, a volatile monoterpenoid, was down-regulated in all the varieties but another one (VVTU21725_at, VIT_15s0046g03600) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 only Touriga Nacional and Aragonês. From the above it is not surprising that wines made from Touriga Nacional berries are recognized as being highly aromatic. Furthermore, the putatively identified cyclic terpene limonene that provides a lemon-like fresh aroma reached the highest concentrations at harvest stage (EL 38) in Trincadeira and in particular in Touriga Nacional. In fact, Touriga Nacional wines are known to have an aroma of orange tree flower. Higher-quality Touriga Nacional wines are characterized by a fruity-citric aroma described as sweet and fresh citrus evoking the bergamot fruit ( Citrus bergamia)  [61]. In accordance, we have noticed in Touriga Nacional and by real time qPCR a very significant increase at EL 38 ( Fig.7) in the expression of a gene coding for a terpene synthase which previous functional characterization showed that produces mainly (E)-a-bergamotene (VvTPS10;  [62]). On the other hand, a terpene synthase that produces mainly (E)-b-ocimene (VvTPS34, [62]) was up-regulated at EL 38 in all the varieties but mainly in Aragonês highlighting aroma cultivar specificities. We have observed down-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of a gene coding for a limonoid UDP-glucosyltransferase in all varieties (VVTU17111_s_at, VIT_03s0180g00200  Table 2) putatively involved in limonoid glucoside synthesis from limonin  [63]. In particular in Aragonês a considerable decrease in expression was noticed from EL 32 to EL 35 as shown by RT qPCR ( Fig. 7). Limonoids are highly oxygenated triterpenes and one of the components responsible for the bitterness in citrus fruit  [63]. The lower synthesis of their glucosides may be related to increased citric aroma. This gene was also shown to be induced during early withering in grape  [64]."," Background Grapes (Vitis species) are economically the most important fruit crop worldwide. However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to ripening of berries as well as how aroma is developed are not fully understood. Methodology/principal findings In an attempt to identify the common mechanisms associated with the onset of ripening independently of the cultivar, grapes of Portuguese elite cultivars, Trincadeira, Aragonês, and Touriga Nacional, were studied. The mRNA expression profiles corresponding to veraison (EL35) and mature berries (EL36) were compared. Across the three varieties, 9,8% (2255) probesets corresponding to 1915 unigenes were robustly differentially expressed at EL 36 compared to EL 35. Eleven functional categories were represented in this differential gene set. Information on gene expression related to primary and secondary metabolism was verified by RT-qPCR analysis of selected candidate genes at four developmental stages (EL32, EL35, EL36 and EL 38). Gene expression data were integrated with metabolic profiling data from GC-EI-TOF/MS and headspace GC-EI-MS platforms. Conclusions/significance Putative molecular and metabolic markers of grape pre-ripening and ripening related to primary and secondary metabolism were established and revealed a substantial developmental reprogramming of cellular metabolism. Altogether the results provide valuable new information on the main metabolic events leading to grape ripening. Furthermore, we provide first hints about how the development of a cultivar specific aroma is controlled at transcriptional level.",NaN,"['Touriga Nacional', 'gene coding', 'VIT', 'acid', 'coding',

16,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC3650682\eupmc_result.json,PMC3650682,,"Early plants began colonizing the terrestrial earth approximately 450 million years ago. Their success on land has been partially attributed to the evolution of specialized metabolic systems from core metabolic pathways, the former yielding structurally and functionally diverse chemicals to cope with a myriad of biotic and abiotic ecological pressures. Over the past two decades, functional genomics, primarily focused on flowering plants, has begun cataloging the biosynthetic players underpinning assorted classes of plant specialized metabolites. However, the molecular mechanisms enriching specialized metabolic pathways during land plant evolution remain largely unexplored. Selaginella is an extant lycopodiophyte genus representative of an ancient lineage of tracheophytes. Notably, the lycopodiophytes diverged from euphyllophytes over 400 million years ago. The recent completion of the whole-genome sequence of an extant lycopodiophyte, S. moellendorffii, provides new genomic and biochemical resources for studying metabolic evolution in vascular plants. 400 million years of independent evolution of lycopodiophytes and euphyllophytes resulted in numerous metabolic traits confined to each lineage. Surprisingly, a cadre of specialized metabolites, generally accepted to be restricted to seed plants, have been identified in Selaginella. Initial work suggested that Selaginella lacks obvious catalytic homologs known to be involved in the biosynthesis of well-studied specialized metabolites in seed plants. Therefore, these initial functional analyses suggest that the same chemical phenotypes arose independently more commonly than anticipated from our conventional understanding of the evolution of metabolism. Notably, the emergence of analogous and homologous catalytic machineries through convergent and parallel evolution, respectively, seems to have occurred repeatedly in different plant lineages.","['Selaginella', 'Parallel Evolution', 'Convergent Evolution', 'Specialized Metabolism', 'Chemodiversity']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN
17,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC3838315\eupmc_result.json,PMC3838315,,"The participation of the mevalonic acid (MVA) and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate/2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (DOXP/MEP) pathways in sesquiterpene biosynthesis of grape berries was investigated. There is an increasing interest in this class of terpenoids, since the oxygenated sesquiterpene rotundone was identified as the peppery aroma impact compound in Australian Shiraz wines. To investigate precursor supply pathway utilization, in vivo feeding experiments were performed with the deuterium labeled, pathway specific, precursors [5,5-(2)H2]-1-deoxy-d-xylulose and [5,5-(2)H2]-mevalonic acid lactone. Head Space-Solid Phase Micro Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) analysis of the generated volatile metabolites demonstrated that de novo sesquiterpene biosynthesis is mainly located in the grape berry exocarp (skin), with no detectable activity in the mesocarp (flesh) of the Lemberger variety. Interestingly, precursors from both the (primarily) cytosolic MVA and plastidial DOXP/MEP pathways were incorporated into grape sesquiterpenes in the varieties Lemberger, Gewürztraminer and Syrah. Our labeling data provide evidence for a homogenous, cytosolic pool of precursors for sesquiterpene biosynthesis, indicating that a transport of precursors occurs mostly from plastids to the cytosol. The labeling patterns of the sesquiterpene germacrene D were in agreement with a cyclization mechanism analogous to that of a previously cloned enantioselective (R)-germacrene D synthase from Solidago canadensis. This observation was subsequently confirmed by enantioselective GC-MS analysis demonstrating the exclusive presence of (R)-germacrene D, and not the (S)-enantiomer, in grape berries.","['Grapevine', 'Diterpenes', 'Mevalonic acid', 'Monoterpenes', 'Deuterium Labeling', 'Gas Chromatography–mass Spectrometry', '1-Deoxy-d-xylulose', 'Head Space', 'Solid Phase-microextration']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN
18,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC3838408\eupmc_result.json,PMC3838408,"Results and Discussion Analysis of promoter nucleotide sequences The ABA-responsive element (ABRE) is a major  cis-acting element (PyACGTGGC) in ABA-responsive gene expression. One and three such ABA-responsive elements (T ACGTG) were found in the CPS and ECS promoters, respectively ( Table 3). A single copy of the ABRE is not sufficient to mediate ABA regulation unless a coupling  cis-element such as coupling element 1 (CE1) (TG CCACCGG)  [54], coupling element 3 (CE3) ( A  CGCGTGTCCTC )  [55] or dehydration responsive element (DRE) (T ACCGACAT)  [56] is present. We have not found any of these coupling elements in the CPS promoter indicating that the single ABRE element of this promoter does not mediate ABA regulation. However, a response to ABA can be seen when the promoter carries multiple copies of the ABRE element  [57] and therefore we may expect a response to ABA of the ECS promoter, which carries two ABRE elements ( Table 3). It is well established that bHLH TFs are involved in the response of plants to ABA  [58]. As discussed above these proteins bind to the E-box sequence and all four sesquiterpene synthase promoters carry such sequences ( Table 3). The ABRE and E-box  cis-acting elements may both be involved in the response of the promoters studied to ABA. Treatment of  A. annua plants with ABA (10 µM) resulted in the induction of a number of genes encoding enzymes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis  [59]. The expression levels of HMGR, FDS, CYP71AV1 and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) were significantly induced while ADS only showed a slight increase. The TCA-element ( GAGAAGAATA) is involved in responsiveness of genes to SA  [60]. This element was first characterized as a  cis-acting element involved in salicylic acid responsiveness and systemic acquired resistance in wild cabbage ( Brassica oleracea)  [61]. Only the ADS promoter carries one such element with the sequence  GAGAAGAAAA. Treatment of  A. annua plants with 1 mM SA resulted in a temporary peak in the expression of the  ADS gene  [62]. A number of auxin-responsive elements have been found in the ADS, CPS and FS promoters. The TGA-element (AACGAC) is found in the ADS (one copy) and CPS (one copy) promoters. The ACTTTA motif is essential for tissue-specific and auxin-regulated expression of the  rolB oncogene in plants  [63]. Such motifs were found in the ADS (three copies), CPS (one copy) and FS (one copy) promoters. Finally, one AU-RR core sequence (GGTCCAT), which is involved in auxin responsiveness, was found in the ADS promoter. Furthermore, the putative gibberellin (GA)-responsive element (the GARE-motif AAACAGA) is present in the ADS and FS promoters (one copy each). In addition, the FS promoter carries one copy of the (GA)-responsive pyrimidine box (P-box; CCTTTTG); a conserved element in the upstream sequence of GA inducible genes in cereal seeds  [64]. Treatment of  A. annua with gibberellic acid 3 (GA 3) results in an increased formation of artemisinin, indicating an increased expression of the key regulatory enzyme ADS  [24],  [65]– [67]. In one study, it was shown by qPCR that the level of ADS transcripts was increased around three times after treatment with 20 mg/L GA 3 by soil drenching  [67]. Only the ADS promoter contains the putative ethylene responsiveness ERE-element (ATTTCAAA) (one copy). The TC-rich repeat ( ATTTTCTCCA) was previously described in tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum) as a  cis-acting element involved in defense and stress responsiveness  [68]. TC-rich repeats are found in the promoters of ADS (one copy), ECS (one copy) and FS (three copies). The WRKY TFs constitute a large family of TFs in plants  [69]. They function via interaction with other proteins such as MAP kinases, 14-3-3 proteins or calmodulin and they bind to box-W1 elements ([C/T]TGAC[C/T]). WRKY TFs may be involved in the simultaneous regulation of different processes. In cotton, the GaWRKY1 is regulating the activity of cadinene synthase 1 (CAD1) involved in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpene phytoalexins  [70]. The CAD1 promoter carries two box-W1 motifs to which the GaWRKY1 may bind. For  A. annua, there are 29 WRKYs listed in the plant transcription factor database. One of these (AaWRKY1) has been cloned  [71]. The fungal elicitor responsive box-W1 element, which interacts in  Arabidopsis with members of the WRKY transcription factor family to mediate responses to wounding or pathogen responses  [72], is only found in the ADS promoter in two copies ( Table 3). Transient expression of the  A. annua transcription factor AaWRKY in agroinfiltrated leaves of  A. annua resulted in increased levels of ADS (7x) and other biosynthetic enzymes, such as HMGR (5x), CYP71AV1 (3x) and DBR2 (4x) indicating that several of the genes encoding enzymes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis are co-induced by binding of AaWRKY to W-boxes  [72]. In fact, the CYP71AV1  [44] and DBR2 [K. Yang  et al., unpublished] promoters also carry two box-W1 motifs each. A recent study showed that foliar application of an elicitor (chitosan) resulted in increase of dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinin by 72% and 53%, respectively, in  A. annua[73]. Furthermore, semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed increased levels of ADS, CYP71AV1 and DBR2 transcripts after application of chitosan. An elicitor preparation from the phytopathogenic fungus  Verticillium dahliae induces CPS in leaves of  A. annua[1]. The recombinant CPS promoter does not carry any of the elicitor responsive box-W1 or TC-rich repeat elements. However, an EL1-box3 sequence (AAACCAATT), which is another elicitor responsive element of plant promoters  [74], is found in the CPS promoter. In addition, the CPS promoter carries a  cis-acting regulatory AG-motif (AGATCCAA) that confers responsiveness to wounding and elicitors  [75]. The wound-inducible  MYB gene  NtMYB2 is up-regulated by an AG-motif binding protein (AGP1), which is a GATA-type zinc finger. The other three promoters do not carry any EL1-box3 sequence or AG-motif. The WUN motif (consensus AATTTCC) is present in the four promoters in a relative large number,  i.e. 9, 5, 9 and 6 copies ( Table 3) in the ADS, CPS, ECS and FS promoters, respectively, indicating that all four sesquiterpene synthase genes may be induced by wounding. A slight induction of ADS and other enzymes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis was observed after wounding of  A. annua leaves  [76]. This induction resulted in a slight increase in artemisinin yield. It was shown that the  CPS gene is induced by wounding  [1]. To our knowledge, no reports on the induction of the  ECS or  FS gene by wounding have been published. The nucleotide sequences of the promoter regions upstream to the start codon were cloned by the genome walking method. The transcription start site (TSS) (labeled +1) of the cloned promoters was predicted using the TSSP software ( http://linux1.soft-berry.com/berry.phtml) as summarized in  Table 2. Using the PLACE ( http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/) and PlantCARE ( http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/) databases, we localized putative TATA- and CAAT-boxes of the recombinant promoters as summarized in  Table 2. In addition, the E-boxes discussed above are also involved in responses to abiotic elicitors. They are MYC recognition site conferring dehydration, cold and freezing induction. The MYB binding site (MBS; TAACTG) is involved in drought-inducibility. In  Arabidopsis, MBS sequences are the binding site for the proteins AtMYB1 and AtMYB2 involved in regulation of genes that are responsive to water stress  [77] and in  Petunia hybrida for MYB.Ph3 involved in regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis  [78]. MBS sequences were found in the ADS (two copies), CPS (two copies) and FS (one copy) promoters. The ADS, ECS and FS promoters carry two, one and three copies, respectively, of the HSE  cis-acting element ( AAAAAATTTC) involved in heat stress responsiveness. Lulu  et al.  [79] showed that chilling affects the transcript levels of ADS and CYP71AV1 in  A annua cultures. Using qPCR, they observed after 24 h 11- and 7-fold increases in ADS and CYP, respectively, in cultures chilled to 4°C for 30 min compared to non-chilled cultures. Higher temperatures (42°C) did not seem to affect the transcript levels of either ADS or CYP71AV1. Yang  et al.  [80] also showed marked increases in ADS in response to chilling. It was also shown that a significant increase in ADS occurred in response to a 1-h dose of UV light. Furthermore, when plant roots were allowed to dry for 6 h, an increased of ADS in shoots was observed  [80]. In contrast, water logging decreased ADS. Putative  cis-acting regulatory elements of the three cloned promoters were predicted using the PlantCARE and PLACE software as summarized in  Table 3 and shown in the  Figures S1- S5. Here the ADS promoter, previously cloned and characterized  [27], has been included. The promoters of the four  A. annua sesquiterpene synthases carry some putative  cis-acting regulatory elements in common but also some for each promoter unique elements. It is obvious that the four sesquiterpene synthase promoters are differently regulated and that they all carry a large number of putative  cis-acting regulatory elements. In plants, sesquiterpene synthase genes are involved in the biosynthesis of communication and defense related terpenoids. Defense terpenoids may be induced by insects, pathogens, wounding or MeJA. We will restrict our discussion of putative  cis-acting elements of the cloned sesquiterpene synthase promoters to those known to be involved in responsiveness towards external factors, such as wounding, hormones, abiotic and biotic elicitors. The four recombinant sesquiterpene synthase promoters carry a number of putative  cis-acting regulatory elements involved in responsiveness to various external factors ( Figure 2 and  Table 3). There are 514 putative transcription factors (TFs) classified in 48 families listed in the Plant Transcription Factor Database ( http://planttfdb.cbi.edu.cn/index.php?sp= Aan) for  A. annua. Some of these TFs are involved in the regulation of the promoters studied. In  Arabidopsis thaliana, there are six signal-responsive genes ( AtSR1 to  6), which are related to the tobacco ethylene-responsive gene  NtER1 encoding a calmodulin-binding protein  [47]. The  AtSR genes are rapidly and differentially induced by environmental signals such as extreme temperatures, UV-B, salt, and wounding, hormones such as ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA), and signal molecules such as MeJA, H 2O 2, and salicylic acid (SA)  [47]. AtSR1 targets the nucleus and specifically recognizes a 6-bp CGCG-box (A/C/G)CGCG(G/T/C). One or more CGCG  cis-acting elements are found in promoters of genes involved in ethylene, ABA and SA signaling, and light signal perception. One putative CGCG-box was found in the ADS and ECS promoters ( Table 3). Two MeJA-responsive  APETALA2/ ethylene response factor TFs (AP2/ERF),  i.e. AaERF1 and AaERF2, have recently been cloned from  A. annua[48]. The AP2/ERF TFs bind to CBF2 ([G/a][T/c]CGAC) and RAA (CAACA) motifs. One CBF2 motif was found in the ADS, CPS and FS promoters, while the ADS, CPS, ECS and FS promoters carried three, two, one and four RAA motifs, respectively ( Table 3). The effects of the AaERF1 and AaERF2 have been studied on the ADS promoter  [48]. Transient co-expression of  AaERF2 and a  pADS:: GUS construct in tobacco resulted in a three-fold increased activity of the ADS promoter. Over-expression of AaERF1 or AaERF2 in transgenic  A. annua plants resulted in elevated transcript levels of ADS (2- to 8-fold) and in an increased accumulation of artemisinin  [49] These results demonstrate that AaERF1 and AaERF2 are two positive regulators of the ADS promoter and possibly also of other promoters. Basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs may be involved in the JA responsiveness of plants  [49]. There are 35 such proteins listed in the  A. annua TF database. Most bHLH TFs bind to the E-box sequence (CANNTG), which also is recognized by MYB and bZIP TFs. The number of E-boxes found in the studied promoters varied; ten, seven, three and one for the ADS, CPS, ECS and FS promoters, respectively ( Table 3). These E-boxes may be involved in the response of  A. annua to JA. In addition to the JA-responsive motifs discussed above, we have also found some other JA-responsive  cis-acting regulatory elements in the sesquiterpene synthase promoters. The CGTCA motif, involved in the MeJA-responsive gene expression in barley ( Hordeum vulgare)  [50], was found in the CPS (one copy) and ECS (one copy) promoters and one T/G-box (AACGTG) each in the ADS, CPS and FS promoters ( Table 3). The T/G box binds the MYC TF in tomato and  Arabidopsis involved in JA signaling  [51]. Thus, the four sesquiterpene synthase promoters carry a number of JA responsive  cis-acting elements, which may be involved in the response of  A annua plants to MeJA. In fact, treatment of plants of  A. annua with MeJA results in the induction of ADS and other enzymes of artemisinin biosynthesis such as FDS, CYP71AV1, DBR2 and ALDH1 leading to increased production of artemisinin  [28],  [52],  [53]. Southern blot In order to determine the transgene copy number, the various transgenic plants were analyzed by Southern blotting. Genomic DNA from wild-type and transgenic plants was digested completely by  EcoRI or  HindIII, and the fragments obtained were analyzed by Southern blotting using a 686 bp hybridization probe binding to the  NPTII gene ( Figure 3). All lines showed positive hybridization bands. The transgenes were integrated into the genome with a single copy (the  pCPS::GUS and  pFS::GUS constructs) or two copies (the  pECS::GUS and  pADS::GUS constructs) ( Figure 3). Activity of the CPS Promoter In order to study the temporal and spatial expression of the  CPS gene, transgenic  A. annua plants carrying the  pCPS::GUS construct were produced using  A. tumefaciens. Twenty-three positive T 0 transgenic lines were selected by PCR (primers listed in  Table 1). Fifteen plants transformed with pCAMBIA1381Z ::GUS (lacking a promoter) were obtained and five randomly selected lines were used as controls. Tissues of primary transgenic lines were tested for CPS promoter activity by histochemical GUS activity staining. The same expression pattern was observed for all transgenic lines but the intensity of the staining varied. For further studies, we selected the five lines showing the strongest staining. GUS expression controlled by the CPS promoter was exclusively located to T-shaped trichomes (TSTs) of leaf primordia and expanded leaves ( Figures 4A to 4I). No GUS staining was observed in GSTs ( Figures 4F, 4G), which is in contrast to the ADS promoter, which exhibits specific expression in GSTs where artemisinin is biosynthesized. Leaf veins of some old leaves showed GUS staining ( Figures 4B, 4H). On lower/older leaves of transgenic plants at early vegetative stage, a larger fraction of the TSTs showed GUS expression ( Figures 4A to 4C). There is no obvious difference in GUS expression between upper and lower leaves of older plants ( Figures 4D, 4E, 4H). However, mature leaves of older seedlings showed lower GUS expression. It appeared that GUS expression of TSTs gradually became stronger to a high level during TST development and that the expression of GUS varied during TST development. TSTs on the midrib or the adaxial surface showed stronger GUS staining than those on the abaxial surface. The GUS expression in TSTs on midrib near leaf petiole is stronger than that on/near leaf veins close to the leaf tips ( Figures 4A to 4H). This indicates that TSTs at different locations on the same leaf surface are at different developmental stages, which may implicate that CPS expression is different at different locations on the same leaf. GUS expression in stem is located to TSTs and the site where it was sampled by cutting ( Figures 4K, 4L), which indicates that CPS is wound inducible (This is discusses further below). Basal bracts of flower buds showed GUS staining ( Figure 4M). Corolla, pollen of hermaphroditic florets near to the marginal pastille florets of flowers at early stage of development also exhibited GUS expression ( Figures 4N to 4O). Corolla, style and stigma of flowers at late stage of development showed GUS expression in two kinds of florets ( Figures 4P to 4R). These results indicate that CPS expression is different at different stages of flower development and that the highest level of expression is seen at the full blooming stage. This is in agreement with the finding that the level of β-caryophyllene was highest at the full blooming stage  [4],  [6]. Only a few TSTs of flowers showed GUS staining ( Figure 4S). Finally, GUS staining was observed in vascular tissues of root ( Figure 4T). Except for the expression in roots, the results obtained are in good agreement with those of Cai  et al.[1] showing that the  CPS gene is expressed in all tissues of  A. annua except in roots. In this study, the CPS promoter is specifically active in TSTs of leaves, stem, basal bract of flower buds and some florets cells but not in GSTs. Activity of the ECS Promoter Transgenic  A. annua plants carrying the  pECS::GUS construct were produced using  A. tumefaciens as described above for the CPS promoter. Twenty-six positive T 0 transgenic lines were selected by GUS staining and PCR (primers listed in  Table 1). Fifteen plants transformed with the pCAMBIA1381Z ::GUS (lacking a promoter) construct were obtained and five randomly selected lines were used as controls. All the lines showed similar GUS expression pattern but the intensity of the staining varied. We selected the five lines exhibiting the strongest staining for further experiments. Tissues of transgenic  A. annua plants at vegetative stage (two stages) and at the reproductive stage were sampled for histochemical GUS staining. At an early vegetative stage, GUS expression was exclusively located to TSTs of leaf primordia and expanded leaves ( Figures 5A, 5B). A larger fraction of the TSTs on leaves at lower locations on the plant showed GUS staining comparable to that observed in leaf primordia at apex at an early stage of development ( Figures 5A, 5B). Some leaf veins of old leaves at the lowest node showed GUS staining ( Figures 5C, 5I). At late vegetative stage, GUS expression is specifically located to TSTs of leaf primordia and young leaves at upper nodes of the plants ( Figures 5D, 5H). No GUS-staining was observed in GSTs ( Figures 5E to 5G). Midrib, veins and margin of older leaves also showed GUS expression ( Figures 5F, 5H). There is no GUS expression in very old leaves at the lowest node of the plant ( Figure 5I). We may conclude that ECS expression occurs mainly in TSTs of leaves ( Figure 5). Furthermore, TSTs on midrib or adaxial leaf surface and on midrib near leaf petiole showed strong GUS expression ( Figures 5B, 5D, 5F, 5H). In conclusion, ECS expression is highly dependent on trichome development. GUS expression in stem was observed in TSTs and at the locus where it was cut during sampling ( Figures 5K, 5L) indicating that ECS may be involved in wound-response and plant defense in  A. annua as discussed below. GUS expression in flower buds is specifically located to TSTs of basal bracts ( Figure 5M and 5N). Also in flower buds no staining of GSTs was observed ( Figure 5N). Style and stigma of hermaphroditic florets at an early stage of flower development exhibited GUS expression ( Figures 5O to 5Q). Stigma and both types of florets were GUS stained at late stages of flower development ( Figures 5R to 5T). TSTs on basal bracts also showed GUS staining. GUS staining was observed in vascular tissues of root ( Figure 5U). The results showed that ECS is mainly located to TSTs of leaves, stems and flower buds but also in floret cells, but not in GSTs. Activity of the FS Promoter Transgenic  A. annua plants carrying the  pFS::GUS construct were produced using  A. tumefaciens as described above for the CPS promoter. Five positive T 0 transgenic lines were selected by GUS staining and PCR (primers listed in  Table 1). Five plants transformed with the pCAMBIA1381Z ::GUS (lacking a promoter) construct were used as controls. All transgenic lines showed similar expression patterns, but different expression levels in individual plants. GUS expression was observed in leaf cells of shoots including GSTs and TSTs ( Figures 6A, 6B). FS is the only of the three sesquiterpene synthases studied that shows staining of GSTs ( Figure 6B) and therefore most likely is co-expressed with ADS in these cells. At a somewhat later stage of leaf development only a few trichomes were stained ( Figure 6C). No GUS staining was observed in old leaves ( Figure 6D). Vascular tissues of root showed strong GUS staining ( Figure 6E). The GUS expression observed showed a temporal expression in young leaves of shoots. Promoter activity in different tissues The activity of the wild-type sesquiterpene synthase promoters in different tissues of  A. annua was determined by measuring the transcript levels of the gene by qPCR. β-Actin was used as reference gene. The relative activity of the wild-type promoters in different tissues was compared with the activity of the β-actin promoter, which was set to 1.0. Relative activities were calculated using the 2 -ΔΔC  t method  [81]. Software REST 2009 ( http://www.REST.de.com) was used to analyze the data. The wide-type CPS promoter ( pCPS) was active in all plant tissues except in roots ( Figure 7A), The  pCPS was highly active in flower buds and leaf primordia but exhibited a relatively low activity in old leaves ( Figure 7A). This is consistent with the analysis of CPS transcript levels in  A. annua plants  [5]. Furthermore, the promoter showed highest activity in flowers and the relative activity was ∼200-fold of that in stem ( Figure 7A). This result supports the finding that the amount of β-caryophyllene increased sharply at late flower developmental stages  [42]. The wild-type ECS promoter ( pECS) was highly active in flower buds and old leaves while it was moderately activity in flowers and leaf primordia ( Figure 7B). The relative activity of  pECS in old leaves was ∼ 30 times higher than that in leaf primordia ( Figure 7B). Very low promoter activity was observed in roots. We have previously reported that the wild-type ECS promoter is very active in old leaves  [5], which is confirmed in these studies. Finally, the wide-type FS promoter ( pFS) was highly active in flowers ( Figure 7C). The  pFS was moderately active in flower buds but exhibited low activity in old leaf and roots ( Figure 7C). No or low activity of the three sesquiterpene synthase promoters were observed in roots when under the control of the wild-type promoters ( Figures 7A, 7B, 7C). However, under the control of the recombinant promoters, GUS-staining was observed in vascular tissues of roots of transgenic plants for CPS ( Figures 4T), ECS ( Figure 5U) and FS ( Figure 6E). No staining was observed for the recombinant ADS promoter  [27]. Obviously, there is a difference in the regulation of expression of CPS, ECS and FS in wild-type and transgenic plants. A possible explanation for this difference is that the plant uses a silencing mechanism based on miRNA for the downregulation of sesquiterpene synthase expression in trichome-free roots. This mechanism of down-regulation would not be effective for the GUS transcript leading to the high level of GUS transcripts observed in vascular tissues of roots of transgenic plants. Wound-response of recombinant sesquiterpene synthase promoters The four promoters studied carry a number of putative  cis-acting regulatory elements that may be involved in responses of the plant to mechanical wounding (WUN motifs) ( Table 3 and  Figure 2). In order to investigate the effects of wounding, leaves of transgenic lines at vegetative reproductive stage carrying the sesquiterpene synthases promoter-GUS constructs were wounded by cutting with a razor blade along the midrib (3–5 mm). Subsequently, the wounded leaves were analyzed by GUS staining during a time courses of 48 h after wounding ( Figures 8 and  9). Leaves of transgenic lines carrying the  pCPS::GUS fusion showed rapid GUS expression at the site of wounding. Strong GUS staining was observed immediately after wounding,  i.e. around 10 minutes ( Figure 8B). A high GUS expression is maintained for at least 12 h ( Figures 8C to 8G). At 24 or 48 h, very little or no staining is observed ( Figures 8H and 8I). Wounded leaves of transgenic lines expressing the  pECS::GUS fusion showed strong GUS staining immediately after wounding ( Figure 9B), which was maintained for 4 h. At 8 h after wounding, no staining was observed ( Figure 9F). Subsequently, the expression of GUS increased to a visual level at 12 and 24 h ( Figures 9G and 9H) and finally to no expression at 48 h ( Figure 9I). Wounded leaves carrying the  pFS::GUS and  pADS::GUS constructs did not show any visual GUS expression after wounding (data not shown). However, recently it was shown that ADS is induced by wounding and that the amount of artemisinin is increased around 50% 4 h after wounding  [76]. The activity of the wild-type sesquiterpene synthases promoters in wounded and unwounded leaves of  A. annua was determined by qPCR. β-Actin was used as reference gene. The relative activity was compared with that of the β-actin promoter, which was set to 1.0 ( Figure 10). The four wild-type sesquiterpene synthase promoters were transiently induced by wounding ( Figure 10). A peak in the transcript levels was observed 4 h after wounding for the ADS, CPS and FS promoters, while the ECS promoter showed highest expression at 12h after wounding ( Figure 10C). However, from GUS-staining ( Figure 9) it is obvious that the ECS promoter is rapidly activated by wounding. The reason for the relatively slow increase in the ECS transcript level observed after wounding may be the comparably high constitutive expression of ECS in leaves  [5], which may mask the local wounding response. For the ADS and CPS promoters, the promoter activity decreased at 12 h after wounding. Relatively low but still detectable transcript levels were observed 24 and 48 h after wounding. The ECS promoter activity decreased at 24 and 48 h after wounding but the levels were still higher than that of unwounded leaves. The FS promoter activity decreased at 12h after wounding and exhibited similar level with that of unwounded leaves at 24 and 48 h after wounding. The fact that an induction of ADS and FS is observed in the qPCR experiments but not in GUS-staining experiments may be explained by the absolute levels of induction. The maximum transcript level of ADS and FS is 0.13- and 0.07-fold, respectively, compared to the level of β-actin transcripts. The sensitivity of the GUS-staining method is not sensitive enough to detect these low levels of induction. On the other hand, the maximum transcript level of CPS and ECS is 2.3- and 3.9-fold higher than that of the β-actin transcript, respectively. Obviously, these high promoter activities are detectable with the GUS-staining technique ( Figures 8 and  9). Our results on the ADS and CPS promoters are consistent with those obtained by semi-quantitative PCR analysis of the transcript levels of ADS  [76] and CPS  [1] in leaves after mechanical wounding. For ECS and FS, there are no reports on the effects of wounding on the expression of these sesquiterpene synthases. We may conclude that the four sesquiterpene synthase genes are induced by mechanical damage and that the sesquiterpenoids produced by the enzyme may play important roles in the response of  A. annua to herbivory. Response to methyl jasmonate As discussed above, the four promoters carry a number of putative  cis-acting regulatory elements involved in the response to MeJA ( e.g. CBF2, CGTCA-motifs, E-boxes, RAA-motifs and T/G-boxes) ( Figure 2;  Table 3). To investigate the effects of MeJA on the expression of the four sesquiterpene synthases wild-type and transgenic plants were sprayed with 300 µM MeJA + 0.01% Tween 20. Control plants were sprayed with 0.01% Tween 20. For each experiment three plants were used. GUS-staining of treated transgenic plants showed that no difference in the expression patterns of GUS could be observed in any of the plants,  i.e. after MeJA treatment GUS expression was observed in the same tissues as for non-treated plants. Since it is impossible to quantitatively determine the relative levels of GUS expression in transgenic plants by staining, the activity of the wild-type sesquiterpene synthase promoters were determined by qPCR after MeJA-treatment, using β-actin as reference gene. The relative activity was compared with that of β-actin promoter, which was set to 1.0 ( Figure 11). The four wild-type sesquiterpene synthase promoters exhibited similar expression pattern after the MeJA-treatment. The increase in transcript levels of CPS, ECS and FS reached a maximum 16 h after the treatment and at this point the transcript level was ∼0.2-, ∼1.6- and ∼0.03-fold the β-actin transcript level, respectively. The ADS promoter activity showed the highest induction 24 h after MeJA-treatment. The activity was ∼2-fold of the β-actin activity. After 48 h all the four sesquiterpene synthases transcript levels decreased to low level but still much higher than that of untreated leaves. In control plants, the transcript levels remained unchanged during the whole time course. In the case of the  ADS gene, some studies on the effect of MeJA have been carried out, which are in agreement with the results presented here  [28],  [52],  [53]. The level of ADS transcripts increased during 24 h after treatment with 100 µM MeJA  [52]. At this time point, the amounts of dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinin was increased 1.9- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Furthermore, an indirect evidence of the induction of the  CPS gene was given as the amount of caryophyllene increased 3-fold after the MeJA treatment  [52]. Similarly a 3-fold increase in the amount of germacrene D was reported. Obviously a germacrene D synthase (not yet cloned from  A. annua) is induced by the MeJA treatment. In another study,  A. annua plants of both chemotypes were treated with 100 µM MeJA every second day. After two weeks a 6- and 3-fold increase of ADS transcripts was observed in the HAP and LAP variety, respectively  [26]. Other enzymes of artemisinin biosynthesis were also induced by the MeJA treatment. Depending on the chemotype, MeJA treatment resulted in increased amounts of artemisinic acid and arteannuin B in the LAP variety and increased amounts of dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinin in the HAP variety. Relative amounts of sesquiterpene synthase transcripts in A. annua tissues In these experiments, we have also included the germacrene A synthase (GAS) using primers as reported previously  [5]. The relative amounts of GAS, FS, ECS, CPS and ADS transcripts were compared with that of the β-actin transcript in flower buds and leaf primordia of  A. annua by qPCR. The relative amount of the β-actin transcript was set to 1.0 ( Figure 12). Flower buds and leaf primordial were selected since these tissues carry a relative large number of GSTs, which are the sites of artemisinin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the concentration of artemisinin precusors is high in young tissues  [82],  [83]. In flower buds, the relative amounts of GAS, FS, ECS, CPS and ADS transcript were 0.14-, 0.74-, 0.01-, 0.20- and 0.46-fold the β-actin transcript level, respectively ( Figure 12A). The relative amounts of GAS, ECS and CPS transcript were much lower than that of ADS transcript while the relative amount of FS was slightly higher. In leaf primordia, the relative levels of GAS, FS, ECS, CPS and ADS transcripts were 0.20-, 0.13-, 0.03-, 0.23- and 1.5-fold, the β-actin transcript level, respectively ( Figure 12B). All competitive sesquiterpene synthases showed lower transcript levels than ADS. In the Anamed cultivar, relative amounts of GAS, ECS and CPS transcripts were also much lower that of ADS  [5].","In order to better understand the influence of sesquiterpene synthases on artemisinin yield in Artemisia annua, the expression of some sesquiterpene synthases has been studied using transgenic plants expressing promoter-GUS fusions. The cloned promoter sequences were 923, 1182 and 1510 bp for β-caryophyllene (CPS), epi-cedrol (ECS) and β-farnesene (FS) synthase, respectively. Prediction of cis-acting regulatory elements showed that the promoters are involved in complex regulation of expression. Transgenic A. annua plants carrying promoter-GUS fusions were studied to elucidate the expression pattern of the three sesquiterpene synthases and compared to the previously studied promoter of amorpha-4,11-diene synthase (ADS), a key enzyme of artemisinin biosynthesis. The CPS and ECS promoters were active in T-shaped trichomes of leaves and stems, basal bracts of flower buds and also in some florets cells but not in glandular secretory trichome while FS promoter activity was only observed in leaf cells and trichomes of transgenic shoots. ADS, CPS, ECS and FS transcripts were induced by wounding in a time depended manner. The four sesquiterpene synthases may be involved in responsiveness of A. annua to herbivory. Methyl jasmonate treatment triggered activation of the promoters of all four sesquiterpene synthases in a time depended manner. Southern blot result showed that the GUS gene was inserted into genomic DNA of transgenic lines as a single copy or two copies. The relative amounts of CPS and ECS as well as germacrene A synthase (GAS) transcripts are much lower than that of ADS transcript. Consequently, down-regulation of the expression of the CPS, ECS or GAS gene may not improve artemsinin yield. However, blocking the expression of FS may have effects on artemisinin production.",NaN,"['GUS expression', 'GUS', 'ADS', 'ADS promoter', 'CPS promoter', 'GUS staining', 'CPS', 'Figure', 'Figures', 'promoter']","[ABRE, T ACGTG, CPS, ABRE, ABA, CPS, ABRE, ABA, ABA, ABA, ABRE, bHLH TFs, E-box, ABRE, E-box  , ABA, ABA, µM, HMGR, CYP71AV1, cytochrome P450 reductase, SA, CPS, TGA-element, AACGAC, CPS, ACTTTA, CPS, AU-RR, GGTCCAT, auxin, gibberellin (GA)-responsive element (, GARE-motif AAACAGA, CCTTTTG, GA inducible, gibberellic acid 3, GA 3, ERE-element, ATTTCAAA, ATTTTCTCCA, FS (, WRKY TFs, MAP kinases, calmodulin, box-W1 elements, [C/T]TGAC[C/T, GaWRKY1, CAD1, CAD1, box-W1, GaWRKY1, AaWRKY1, box-W1, factor AaWRKY, HMGR (, CYP71AV1 (3x), DBR2 (, AaWRKY, CYP71AV1  [44, box-W1, CYP71AV1, CPS, CPS, box-W1, EL1-box3, AAACCAATT, CPS, CPS, AGATCCAA, wound-inducible  MYB, AGP1, EL1-box3, AATTTCC, CPS, http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/, PlantCARE, http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/, TATA-, CAAT-boxes, MYC, MYB, TAACTG, MBS, AtMYB1, AtMYB2, MYB.Ph3, CPS, AAAAAATTTC, CYP71AV1, CYP, °C, CYP71AV1, PlantCARE, http://planttfdb.cbi.edu.cn/index.php?sp= Aan, signal-responsive, AtSR1, abscisic acid, ABA, AtSR1, (A/C/G)CGCG(G/T/C, ABA, SA, CGCG-box, AP2/ERF, AaERF1, AaERF2, AP2/ERF TFs, CBF2, [G/a][T/c]CGAC, CBF2, CPS, CPS, AaERF1, AaERF2, GUS, AaERF1, AaERF2, artemisinin  , AaERF1, AaERF2, E-box, MYB, bZIP TFs, E-boxes, CPS, E-boxes, CGTCA, CPS, T/G-box, AACGTG, CPS, FS promoters, T/G, MYC TF, JA, CYP71AV1, DBR2, ALDH1, artemisinin  , CPS, pCAMBIA1381Z, GUS, CPS, GUS, CPS, GUS, GSTs, 4F, 4G, GSTs, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, CPS, GUS, CPS, wound inducible (, GUS, GUS, GUS, CPS, β-caryophyllene, GUS, GUS, CPS, GSTs, CPS, GUS, pCAMBIA1381Z, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS-staining, GSTs, GUS, 5F, GUS, GUS, 5F, GUS, wound-response, GUS, 5N, GSTs, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GSTs, CPS, GUS, pCAMBIA1381Z, GUS, GUS, GSTs, TSTs ( Figures 6A, GSTs, GUS, GUS, GUS, β-Actin, β-actin, CPS promoter, pCPS, CPS, ∼200-fold, ∼, 7B, 7C, GUS-staining, CPS ( Figures 4T, FS ( Figure 6E, CPS, GUS, GUS, promoter-GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, GUS, β-Actin, β-actin, CPS, CPS, ECS, β-actin, CPS, β-actin, CPS, CPS  , CBF2, T/G-boxes, GUS, GUS, GUS, β-actin, β-actin, CPS, ∼0.2-, ∼1.6-, β-actin, ∼2-fold, β-actin, µM, µM, LAP, LAP, CPS, β-actin, β-actin, GSTs, CPS, β-actin, CPS, CPS, β-actin, CPS]",[],[],[],terpene synthase

These hypotheses have often been tested by transforming plants with sesquiterpene synthases expressed behind the constitutively active 35S promoter, which may have physiological costs measured as inhibited growth and reduced reproduction or may require augmentation of substrate pools to achieve enhanced emission, complicating the interpretation of data from affected transgenic lines. Here, we expressed maize (Zea mays) terpene synthase10 (ZmTPS10), which produces (E)-α-bergamotene and (E)-β-farnesene, or a point mutant ZmTPS10M, which produces primarily (E)-β-farnesene, under control of the 35S promoter in the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata. Transgenic N. attenuata plants had specifically enhanced emission of target sesquiterpene(s) with no changes detected in their emission of any other volatiles. Treatment with herbivore or jasmonate elicitors induces emission of (E)-α-bergamotene in wild-type plants and also tended to increase emission of (E)-α-bergamotene and (E)-β-farnesene in transgenics. However, transgenics did not differ from the wild type in defense signaling or chemistry and did not alter defense chemistry in neighboring wild-type plants. These data are inconsistent with within-plant and between-plant signaling functions of (E)-β-farnesene and (E)-α-bergamotene in N. attenuata. Ectopic sesquiterpene emission was apparently not costly for transgenics, which were similar to wild-type plants in their growth and reproduction, even when forced to compete for common resources. These transgenics would be well suited for field experiments to investigate indirect ecological effects of sesquiterpenes for a wild plant in its native habitat.",NaN,[],[],[],[],[],NaN
20,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4232691\eupmc_result.json,PMC4232691,"Results and discussion Spearmint PGT and their development Spearmint leaves produce three different types of trichomes on their surfaces: non-glandular multicellular hair like, capitate glandular trichomes with a single secretory head cell and PGTs whose secretory head is composed of eight-cells with a single stalk and basal cell (Figure  1A). These PGT glands possess a large subcuticular storage space that is formed by the separation of the cuticle from the apical cells and the essential oil is secreted into this cavity [ 12] (Figure  1B). It is known that new glands keep initiating on the leaf till expansion ceases and the monoterpene content and compositions change with the age of the leaf [ 13- 16]. Different studies have indicated that monoterpene biosynthesis is most active in young 12–20 day old leaves of peppermint after which the rate of synthesis slowly declines [ 17- 19]. We performed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on young spearmint leaves (about 1–2 cm in length) and found abundance of both limonene and carvone monoterpenes (Figure  2). Limonene is the first committed step towards carvone pathway. In addition to these monoterpenes, the presence of sesquiterpenes was also observed. This indicated the dynamic terpene biosynthetic activity of leaves at this stage of development. PGT were purified from leaves of this stage and RNA isolated. The leaves of the same stage were brushed to remove all trichomes and RNA extracted from them as controls (Additional file  1). Sequencing,  de novo assembly and annotation of transcriptome Three RNA libraries were prepared and sequenced by Illumina technology. More than 100 million high quality reads of 101 base pairs (bp) were generated from PGT, leaf-PGT and leaf (Additional file  2). Using the Trinity method [ 20] the sequence reads were finally assembled into 40,587 non-redundant unigenes, spanning a total of 101 Mb of sequence with a GC content of 43.14%. All unigenes were longer than 200 bp. The N50 of the final assembled transcripts was 1,774 bp. The unigenes were annotated by performing BLASTX search against various protein databases. Among the 40,587 non-redundant unigenes, 27,025 (67%) had at least one hit in BLASTX search with E-value < = 1e-3. Functional classifications of Gene Ontology (GO) term of all unigenes were performed using Trinotate [ 20]. In order to calculate the expression level for assembled transcripts, we first mapped reads onto them using bowtie [ 21]. RSEM (RNA-seq by Expectation-Maximization) was used to estimate the abundance of assembled transcripts and to measure the expression level [ 22]. Overview of expression profile of spearmint PGT From the RNA seq data about 25,000 unigenes were observed to be expressed in spearmint PGT. The heat map in Figure  3 exhibits some specific expression patterns to PGT. Among this specific pattern for PGT we found transcripts for terpene biosynthesis, lipid transfer proteins and interesting transcription factors like MYBs and WRKYs. Comparison of PGT and leaf-PGT showed that 3,919 unigenes were differentially expressed in PGT (Additional file  3). These unigenes showed a minimum of 4 times increase in expression level in PGT as compared to leaf-PGT. About 30% of these unigenes encoded either hypothetical proteins or remained unannotated. Many of these unannotated unigenes showed none or minimal expression in leaf-PGT. They might represent novel genes that are unique to PGTs development and divergent from other plants, whose genomes have been sequenced. Data from proteomic analysis of spearmint PGT also showed that the largest functional category of the identified proteins was “unclear classification” and included proteins with unknown functions [ 11]. The absence or low levels of some PGT-specific transcripts from leaf RNA seq data indicated the dilution of PGT-specific RNAs among the total leaf RNAs and reaffirms the importance of isolating these organs for analysis. Among the top 1000 differentially expressed unigenes, we identified 16 TPSs, 18 cytochrome P450s, 5 lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), 20 transcription factors, 2 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and several transcripts associated with cell wall. Cytochrome P450s are involved in the hydroxylation of terpenes [ 23] and LTPs have been suggested to be involved in intracellular transport and secretion of lipids and terpenes [ 9, 24]. LTPs were among the most abundant unigenes in PGT and were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). The abundance of these LTPs suggests their importance in PGTs metabolic function and development. ABC transporters are also proposed to be involved in the active transport of secondary metabolites [ 11, 25]. The spearmint PGT is presumed to undergo cell wall modification to form subcuticular storage space [ 12]. Among the differentially expressed unigenes there were few that were related to cell wall synthesis or modifications and a subset of these were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Additional files  4 and  5). Whether they play a role in modification of cell wall layers to form the storage space remains to be investigated. To characterize biological processes specific for PGT, GO term was determined for all differentially expressed unigenes. Additionally, we identified unigenes whose expression was reduced in PGT by comparing leaf-PGT and PGT. These unigenes showed a minimum of 4 times reduction in expression level in PGT when compared to leaf-PGT. GO term was determined for them as well. Figure  4 shows the top 30 GO terms for the more abundant and less abundant unigenes. GO terms associated with ribosome biogenesis, ribosome structural genes and translation are highly represented in PGT, which could reflect the high protein biosynthetic activity of PGTs. Other terms included terpene metabolism and most of the primary energy producing terms like glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Furthermore, pentose phosphate related term (oxidative) was also enriched in PGT. This term provides NADPH for biosynthetic processes such as fatty acid synthesis, cytochrome P450 mediated hydroxylation and the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen [ 26]. These results indicate that the GO functions that provide energy equivalents and redox cofactors are very active in PGT. Secretory trichomes are biosynthetically very active, and hence, there is a high energy requirement in these cells. Unigenes from the GO terms of photosynthesis, chlorophyll biosynthesis and starch biosynthesis were among the less abundant ones. This shows that our PGT sample preparation was pure and not contaminated with leaf tissues as mint PGTs are non-photosynthetic. Mint PGTs being non- photosynthetic and metabolically very active would presumably rely on exogenous supply of sucrose from underlying leaf tissues to use as carbon source for energy production. We found several transcripts encoding enzymes for sucrose catabolism expressed more in PGT like sucrose synthase and neutral/alkaline invertases that are important for channelling carbon from sucrose in non-photosynthetic tissues [ 27]. These enzymes convert sucrose to hexose phosphates. Plastids in the PGTs are the main sites of secondary metabolism. In contrast to chloroplasts, plastids of heterotrophic tissues have to rely on the import of ATP and carbon to drive their metabolic processes. We checked our set of differentially expressed unigenes to see if any known transporters are present. In most plants glucose 6-phosphate seems to be the preferred hexose phosphate taken up by nongreen plastids. The transporter proteins responsible for this import of carbon into plastids are known as Glc6P–phosphate translocator (GPT) and transcript similar to GPT was seen enriched in PGT (about 30 times more in PGT). This carbon can be used for starch biosynthesis or for the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in plastids [ 28]. GO terms for oxidative pentose phosphate pathways were seen enriched in PGT. Additionally transcript similar to plastidic Phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator was found to be expressed more in PGT. They are involved in the transport of phosphoenolpyruvate, an energy rich glycolytic intermediate from the cytoplasm into the plastids [ 29]. Further, ATP generated either by glycolysis or by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria can be imported into non- green plastids by plastidic nucleotide transporter (NTT). Transcript similar to NTT was also observed to be more abundant in PGT [ 29]. Analysis of spearmint PGT transcription factors Although the cloning and functional characterization of enzymes involved in terpene biosynthesis has been quite successful in various plants, knowledge about regulation of these secretory trichome specific pathways is very rudimentary. Studies in peppermint show a close association between enzyme activity and transcript abundance for all gene/enzyme pairs, suggesting that, essential oil biosynthesis is primarily influenced at the transcriptional level [ 12, 17, 18, 30]. Hence, identification of transcription factors that globally control metabolic pathway will provide an attractive strategy for engineering terpene production. Similarly, knowledge about the development of secretory glandular trichomes, the so-called factories of important terpenoid production, is very limited. Most of the transcription factors involved with trichome development have been isolated from Arabidopsis, which lacks secretory trichomes. Studies in tobacco and tomato are beginning to show that multicellular secretory trichomes and unicellular trichomes of Arabidopsis are not homologous structures, and they likely develop under different regulatory conditions [ 31]. Our analysis of transcriptome data of young leaves or PGT did not uncover any transcripts that matched those of the major known trichome initiating gene transcripts from Arabidopsis, like  TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1, GLABRA1, GLABRA3 [ 32]. Either these genes are not expressed or are expressed at a different developmental stage of leaves or PGT than the stage used in this study. Table  1 shows the top 20 transcription factors that were significantly more abundant in PGT when compared to leaf-PGT. The MEP (2-Cmethyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate) pathway is more abundant in spearmint PGT than the MVA (mevalonate) pathway The building blocks for all different classes of terpenes produced by plants are C5 units of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). They are generated either by plastidial MEP or cytoplasmic MVA pathway. The MEP pathway requires seven enzymes to synthesize IPP and DMAPP from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates which feed the monoterpene pathway [ 33]. From peppermint EST studies it has been proposed that the active pathway for the formation of IPP/DMAPP in the PGT is the MEP pathway. This is consistent with our analysis too where MEP pathway transcripts were more abundant in PGT than MVA. High expression of MEP pathway transcripts correlates well with the production of monoterpenes in PGT. It has been reported that 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), the first enzyme of this pathway is important for the overall regulation of the pathway [ 34]. Multiple  DXS genes have been found in plants like  Zea mays,  Medicago truncatula, Oryza sativa, Ginkgo biloba and  Pinus densiflora and  Picea abies [ 35- 40]. In all these plants, two or three candidate  DXS genes have been reported. From our data we were able to identify 2 different 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) unigenes showing different levels of abundance in PGT. The number of genes coding for each MEP pathway enzyme varies from plant to plant [ 33, 41]. Presence of multiple genes with differential tissue-specific expression levels might contribute towards the regulation of the MEP pathway, in different organs of the plant. Figure  5 shows the number of unigenes identified for each enzyme of the MEP pathway and their RNA seq expression levels. In cases of enzymes with more than one unigene, the unigene with the highest abundance in PGT was taken into consideration. Their expression was further validated by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). From our RNA seq data and qRT-PCR analysis, DXR and MCT transcript levels were low when compared to levels of other enzymes in MEP pathway. This might suggest that possibly these two enzymes are the rate limiting steps of this pathway. A possible option to explore in future will be to enhance the expression level of various rate limiting steps to enhance the production of terpenes. In contrast to the MEP pathway, the transcript levels of MVA enzymes were very low. For RNA seq expression levels of unigenes involved in this pathway refer Additional file  6. Their expression was validated by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). MVA pathway derived IPP is generally believed to be used for the production of cytosolic sesquiterpenes, triterpenes and mitochondrial terpenes. In addition to monoterpenes, mint produces a few sesquiterpenes although at much lower quantities than monoterpenes [ 9, 42]. Lower level of MVA pathway can be one of the reasons. Interestingly, the transcripts of genes involved in the MEP pathway are also enriched in  Artemisia annua trichomes, glandular trichomes of Hops and in Snapdragon flowers where sesquiterpene metabolism dominates [ 43- 45] suggesting that the MEP pathway can also feed sesquiterpene production. Studies with labelled substrate predict exchange of metabolites between the MVA and MEP pathways [ 46, 47]. How the IPP/DMAPP formed by MEP pathway is utilized to synthesize sesquiterpenes in mint remains to be investigated. Monoterpene production is enriched in spearmint PGT Subsequent condensation reactions between IPP and DMAPP are catalysed by GPP synthases (GPPS) that leads to the formation of geranyl diphosphate (GPP; C10) the precursor for monoterpenes. The conversion of IPP to DMAPP and its equilibrium is maintained by IPP isomerase (IPPI). In most plant species this enzyme is encoded by a single gene whereas Arabidopsis has two IPPI genes [ 33]. We found 2 IPPI unigenes in spearmint both enriched in PGT. Peppermint GPPS (Mp GPPS) is a two-component heteromeric enzyme consisting of a large and a small subunit, and both the subunits are catalytically inactive by themselves [ 48, 49]. In spearmint too, we found unigenes for both the small and large subunits of GPP synthase that showed high expression in PGT. The major constituent of spearmint essential oil is (−) carvone which is synthesised from GPP in a three step reaction. Transcripts for all the three enzymes involved in above reaction, Limonene synthase (LS), Limonene-6-hydroxylase (L6OH) and carveol dehydrogenase (CD) were highly expressed in PGT and verified by q-RT-PCR (Figure  6 and Additional file  4). Interestingly, the precursor for menthol in peppermint and (−) carvone in spearmint is the same limonene. In peppermint it is oxygenated by (2)-4S-limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH) to form (2)-trans-isopiperitenol and it enters the menthol pathway whereas in spearmint limonene is oxygenated by (2)-4S-limonene- 6-hydroxylase (L6OH) to form (2)-trans-carveol. Both these enzymes show a 70% identity at the amino acid level with major differences localized to the presumptive active sites [ 50]. The spearmint L6OH transcript is highly expressed in PGT as expected but the full set of downstream redox enzymes isopiperitenone reductase, (+)-pulegone reductase, and menthone reductase involved in menthol pathway were also found but poorly expressed in PGT. A previous study has shown that (−) carvone is not an efficient substrate for the initial double-bond reductase, therefore (−) carvone accumulates in spearmint even though the downstream redox enzymes are present [ 11, 51]. Hence, the abundance of a single enzyme L6OH instead of L3OH changes the final monoterpene produced. This shows how simple changes in the production of a single intermediate can result in drastic changes in the metabolic profiles. When compared to heterodimeric GPP synthase, transcripts for farnesyl diphosphate synthase which is responsible for the formation of farnesyl diphosphate precursor for sesquiterpenes, is expressed around 4 times less in PGT. Apart from low MVA pathway, low levels of FPP synthase transcripts might also contribute to the reduced sesquiterpene production in mint PGT. Functional characterization of Terpene Synthases (TPS) from spearmint In plants, specific TPSs are responsible for the synthesis of various terpene molecules from the common precursors. Our transcriptome data provides a rich resource for identifying and functionally characterizing new TPSs from spearmint. From our enriched unigenes, we found 16 that were identified as terpene synthases; all of them were more than 1 kb and 10 of them were encoding full-length open reading frames (ORFs). We found TPSs annotated as limonene synthase, (E)-β-farnesene synthase, bicyclogermacrene synthase and cis muuroladiene synthase being preferentially expressed in PGT. However, the exact functional annotation of a new TPS requires activity characterization of the recombinant protein. In mint species, to our knowledge limonene synthase from spearmint [ 52], ( E)-β-farnesene synthase from peppermint [ 42] and cis-muuroladiene synthase from black peppermint [ 53] have been previously characterised with respect to their functions. From our RNA seq data we chose to characterize two unannotated full-length TPS. Phylogenetic comparison (Additional file  7) showed that both MsTPS1 and MsTPS2 belonged to the TPS-a subfamily of angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases. The main sesquiterpenes identified by GC-MS analysis in our spearmint variety were (E)-β-farnesene, β-caryophyllene, α-caryophyllene (Humulene), cis murola-3-5 diene, β-copaene, bicyclogermacrene and bicyclosesquiphellandrene. To determine MsTPS1 and MsTPS2 enzymatic activities, the full-length open reading frame encoding these enzymes were overexpressed in  E.coli, purified and used for in vitro assays with GPP or FPP as substrate. In the presence of FPP MsTPS1 catalysed the formation of β-caryophyllene in vitro (Figure  7A) whereas MsTPS2 produced a peak from FPP that was identified as one of β-cubebene/Germacrene D/β-copaene by GCMS (Figure  7B). β-copaene was observed in our mint leaf GC-MS data suggesting that MsTPS2 is most likely to be β-copaene synthase. Both the TPSs failed to produce a peak with GPP as substrate (Figure  7A and B). Thus, our in vitro studies identified them to be sesquiterpene synthases. Furthermore, transient  Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated plant expression [ 54] was used to investigate the terpenes produced by  MsTPS1 and  MsTPS2 in planta. Both  MsTPS1 and  MSTPS2 under the control of a 35S promoter were transiently expressed in  N. benthamiana leaves by  Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration. The compounds were analysed 3 dpi (days post-infiltration) by GC-MS. Both TPSs failed to form any new peak when observed by GC-MS. Studies have shown that overexpressing enzyme 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase (HMGR), a rate limiting step of the mevalonate pathway increases heterologous plant sesquiterpene production [ 55]. Accordingly, both the TPSs were coexpressed with HMGR  in planta to observe the production of sesquiterpenes. MsTPS1 with HMGR produced β-caryophyllene as the major peak and α-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide as minor peaks Additional file  8. MsTPS2 even with HMGR failed to produce any new peaks  in planta suggesting that the compound formed by MsTPS2 might be further metabolised endogenously by the plant (data not shown). Sesquiterpene synthesis is thought to take place in the cytoplasm while monoterpene synthesis is believed to occur in plastids. Since our biochemical characterization shows that  MsTPS1 and  MsTPS2 are sesquiterpene synthases, we examined subcellular localization of these proteins in transient studies in tobacco leaves. YFP-tagged MsTPSs were transiently expressed in  N. benthamiana leaf cells by  Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration and visualized 3 dpi using the YFP channel of a confocal microscope. Both the MsTPSs showed cytoplasmic localization (Additional file  9) and their sequence analysis also showed lack of plastid targeting sequences which further affirms that these TPSs are sesquiterpene synthases. Therefore, either by sequence similarity or by functional characterization we were able to identify all the major terpene synthases that are responsible for the formation of major spearmint essential oil components. Spearmint PGTs as plants chemical defense organs Many of the secondary metabolites produced by glandular trichomes play a role in plant defence. Majority of them fall into the category of terpenes, phenylpropenes, flavonoids, methyl ketones, acyl sugars and defensive proteins. Apart from having a rich terpene pathway, spearmint PGT also shows presence of transcripts that are involved in the production of different secondary metabolites that may have a role in plant defense. Transcripts encoding enzymes for phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumarate CoA-ligase were seen expressed in PGT. These enzymes are involved in phenylpropanoid production. Presence of a variety of small molecular weight phenylpropanoids like caffeic, rosmarinic and ferulic acids has been detected in leaves of different mint germplasm [ 56]. Transcripts similar to Caffeate O-methyltransferase, an enzyme required for the conversion of caffeic acid into ferulic acid was preferentially expressed in PGT. Chalcone flavanone isomerase an enzyme in the flavonoid pathway in plants was also preferentially expressed in PGT. Unigenes encoding transcripts similar to plant invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitors were highly expressed in PGT which are important to defend against plant pathogens [ 57, 58]. All the above transcripts were verified by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). Oxylipins are large family of biologically active oxidized fatty acid-derivatives that are important for plant defense responses. They are produced mainly by the combined action of lipases, lipoxygenases (LOXs) and members of cytochrome P450 (CYP74) family specialized in metabolizing fatty acids hydroperoxides (HPs). HPs form the initial substrates for different branches of the oxylipin pathway [ 59- 62]. We found enzymes involved in oxidation of fatty acids expressed more in PGTs. Transcripts similar to phospholipase A, lipoxygenase and allene oxide synthase and allene oxide cyclase were enriched in PGT. Allene oxide synthase and allene oxide cyclase are members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP74) family and are involved in the LOX pathways [ 63, 64]. All the above mentioned transcripts showed a minimum of 8 times enrichment in PGT and were confirmed by qRT-PCR. However to understand the role of these enzymes in plant defence and exact nature of oxylipins formed by them, further characterization is essential, especially in terms of their positional specificity and substrate specificity. Plants possess both basal and inducible mechanisms to defend themselves against pathogens. The transcriptome data reflects the basal or constitutive state of defense mechanism existing in spearmint PGT. The changes in transcript abundance in all the above mentioned genes on stress induction will provide a better understanding of how PGT act as chemical defence organs."," Background Plant glandular trichomes are chemical factories with specialized metabolic capabilities to produce diverse compounds. Aromatic mint plants produce valuable essential oil in specialised glandular trichomes known as peltate glandular trichomes (PGT). Here, we performed next generation transcriptome sequencing of different tissues of Mentha spicata (spearmint) to identify differentially expressed transcripts specific to PGT. Our results provide a comprehensive overview of PGT's dynamic metabolic activities which will help towards pathway engineering. Results Spearmint RNAs from 3 different tissues: PGT, leaf and leaf stripped of PGTs (leaf-PGT) were sequenced by Illumina paired end sequencing. The sequences were assembled de novo into 40,587 non-redundant unigenes; spanning a total of 101 Mb. Functions could be assigned to 27,025 (67%) unigenes and among these 3,919 unigenes were differentially expressed in PGT relative to leaf - PGT. Lack of photosynthetic transcripts in PGT transcriptome indicated the high levels of purity of isolated PGT, as mint PGT are non-photosynthetic. A significant number of these unigenes remained unannotated or encoded hypothetical proteins. We found 16 terpene synthases (TPS), 18 cytochrome P450s, 5 lipid transfer proteins and several transcription factors that were preferentially expressed in PGT. Among the 16 TPSs, two were characterized biochemically and found to be sesquiterpene synthases. Conclusions The extensive transcriptome data set renders a complete description of genes differentially expressed in spearmint PGT. This will facilitate the metabolic engineering of mint terpene pathway to increase yield and also enable the development of strategies for sustainable production of novel or altered valuable compounds in mint.",NaN,"['PGT', 'Spearmint PGT', 'MEP pathway', 'pathway', 'Additional file', 'PGTs', 'unigenes', 'Spearmint', 'MEP', 'transcripts']","[PGTs, PGT, PGT, PGT, leaf-PGT, Trinotate [, RNA-seq, PGT, PGT, WRKYs, PGT, leaf-PGT, PGT (, PGT, leaf-PGT, leaf-PGT, PGTs, “, ”, PGT-specific, PGT-specific, cytochrome P450s, Cytochrome P450s, LTPs, PGT, PGTs, PGT, PGT, leaf-PGT, PGT, PGT, leaf-PGT, PGT, PGTs, PGT, cytochrome P450, PGT, PGT, Mint PGTs, PGT like sucrose synthase, neutral/alkaline invertases, PGTs, glucose 6-phosphate, Glc6P–, GPT, GPT, PGT, PGT, PGT, PGT, green plastids, PGT [ 29, PGT, TESTA GLABRA1, GLABRA1, PGT, PGT, leaf-PGT, 2-Cmethyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3, PGT, PGT, PGT, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, PGT, PGT, MCT, GPPS, geranyl diphosphate, DMAPP, IPP isomerase, PGT, Mp GPPS, PGT, Limonene-6-hydroxylase, L6OH, carveol dehydrogenase, PGT, (2)-4S-limonene-3-hydroxylase, L3OH, (2)-trans-isopiperitenol, (2)-4S-limonene- 6-hydroxylase, L6OH, (2)-trans-carveol, PGT, PGT, L6OH, L3OH, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, PGT, PGT, MsTPS1, MsTPS2, MsTPS1, MsTPS2, FPP MsTPS1, β-caryophyllene, MsTPS2, MsTPS2, Coenzyme A Reductase, HMGR  , MsTPS1, HMGR, MsTPS2, MsTPS2, MsTPSs, YFP, MsTPSs, phenylalanine ammonia, 4-coumarate CoA-ligase, PGT, O-methyltransferase, PGT, Chalcone flavanone isomerase, PGT, invertase/pectin methylesterase, PGT, LOXs, cytochrome P450, CYP74, PGTs, phospholipase A, lipoxygenase, PGT, cytochrome P450, CYP74, LOX, PGT, PGT]","['TPSs,', '(TPS)', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS.', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'TPS-a', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPS2', 'TPSs', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPS1', 'MSTPS2', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPSs', 'MsTPSs', 'TPSs']",[],[],terpene synthase
21,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4273207\eupmc_result.json,PMC4273207,"Results Database content As described in methods, each EssOilDB record corresponds to the amount of emission of a particular compound in a specific oil profile. Further, in case a single journal article lists three different sets of volatile profiles, say for three different plant parts, or under three independent stresses, we treat the datasets as three independent records. Currently, the database contains a total of 123 041 such records spanning a century of published reports of essential oil profiles, starting from early 1900s to date. These records have been sourced from over 1520 citations and the data includes 1618 plant species, subspecies or varieties representing 92 distinct taxonomic families encompassing the entire range from ancient and lower plants like chlorophytes and mosses, to the gymnosperms and angiosperms.  Figure 2 provides an estimate of the geographical and taxonomical distribution of the records and it can be seen that families over represented in the data belong to high volatile content taxa such as the Myrtaceae, Apiaceae and Lamiaceae. The extensive amount of data for these taxa, along with lists of essential oils from mosses and volatile hydrocarbons from algae to pines may assist in deducing patterns between phylogeny of plants and their emission profiles. Essential oils were extracted from distinct aerial or underground plant structures such as leaf, root, rhizome, seed, bark, flower, fruit or any combination of these or even the whole plant ( 17). The material used for extraction may further be fresh, dry, juice extract or lab-dried, or it may have been harvested at a certain developmental stage such as ripe, semiripe or unripe fruits, woody or non-woody branches etc. EssOilDB integrates these aspects wherever possible in order to collate available information about the material used for obtaining essential oils and users can browse through more than 160 different types of plant part/sub-part categories. For each compound, EssOilDB includes known information about any associated biological activity, and the current version of the database lists these properties for 44 787 records. These records comprise various combinations of over 200 distinct activities that have pharmacological, commercial or agroindustrial relevance. In view of the fact that a majority of essential oils comprised terpenoid compounds and their derivatives, the database contains information about the type or general chemical classification, wherever possible, such as a the specific class of terpenes. For example, alpha-pinene is a monoterpene, while gamma-murolene belongs to the sesquiterpene category. The database contains relatively fewer diterpenes records; namely abietol, cembrene, isopimara-7,15-diene, phytane, phytol and sclareol, which in turn, reflect the fact that diterpenes are generally not volatile in nature. Currently more than 40 categories are recorded in this section, providing information on whether a compound under consideration is an alcohol, fatty acid, ketone, ether, mono-, di- or sesqui-terpene etc. As mentioned earlier, evidence for invasive nature of a given plant under study has been incorporated wherever available, and EssOilDB presently has 2806 essential oil records obtained from invasive plants located across the major continents of the world. The data is specially relevant in the Indian context as it contains volatile profiles of highly invasive species in various parts of India, of which  Lantana camara has the highest number of records followed by  Ageratum conyzoides. The analysis of these essential oil profiles of invasive plants may provide the opportunity to identify the specific patterns present between plant volatiles and their invasive nature if any. Further, this knowledge may also be used to find the significance of specific volatiles in the development of invasive nature and these concepts may be introduced practically to gain benefit in agricultural perspectives.  Benchmarking analysis We have benchmarked EssOilDB by carrying out a comparative assessment of its features with existing public databases contributing significant information on essential oils. Some of these are EOUdb (Essential Oil University database), AromaWeb ( http://www.aromaweb.com/), Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases ( http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/) and the Cropwatch files ( http://www.cropwatch.org/). EOUdb is an online chemical reference database ( http://essentialoils.org/eoudb/) with a login requirement, and it provides information on essential oils and their chemical composition, although details about source plant, taxonomy or ecological factors is entirely lacking. Aromaweb is dedicated to holistic aromatherapy and accordingly limited to just over one hundred essential oil profiles that are most important for the perfumery industry. The Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases are not limited to essential oils and contain vast information on all kinds of phytochemicals including sugars and proteins as well. There is also no direct way to browse the data, users have to necessarily type the name of the chemical, plant or activity of interest. Since this resource is motivated by diagnosis and medication, the records do not mention any citation details or extraction methods, providing only a list of chemicals along with activities, benefits and source plant organs and references to personal notes or text books. The Cropwatch files essentially represent a resource for surveys and critical opinions about aromatic products from commercial sources, rather than an essential oil database, per se. Many commercial essential oil databases such as Essential Oil Bioactivity Research Database, Essential oil component database ( http://www.quintessential.uk.com/index.php), LabAroma ( http://www.labaroma.com) are also available, but they emphasize on literature and information based on the bioactivity aspect of essential oils, catering mainly to the cosmetic and perfumery industry. In addition to this, ESO 2000 ( http://www.leffingwell.com/baciseso.htm) for quantitative analysis of essential oil is also commercially available but it has no contextual data on stress or invasive nature of the plants under study. A detailed comparative chart listing the features available in various databases is provided in See online  supplementary material for  Supplementary Table S1. It clearly reveals EssOilDB as the only public database that is dedicated to the biology of essential oils and may reliably be used for scientific research on patterns and profiles of essential oils and their variations across a variety of contextual situations. Association of essential oil data with genetic, phenological and ecological factors Several studies have been carried out to compare essential oil profiles under different experimental conditions. EssOilDB offers a major advancement to such studies as it provides information about specific environmental factors associated with essential oil records, thereby facilitating a comparative analysis under normal and user-specific plant conditions, which may be studied individually or in combination with other factors. Apart from available volatile profiles under normal conditions, EssOilDB has 30 883 records in which essential oil profiles have been measured and published based on a given factor as depicted in the form of a chart in  Figure 3. These records represent variations in developmental stages, spatial distribution, seasonal variation, mutant analysis, isolation techniques, population- or cultivar-based variation, as well as different kinds of abiotic and biotic stress conditions ( Figure 3). Geographical distribution studies are the topmost among all factors in the database with 8685 records. The major reports of this section include the analysis of essential oil composition of a plant species across different altitudes, habitats and populations, providing insights about spatial location based intraspecific variations. The second highest factor incorporated in the database is climatic changes (4657) in which the effect of different temperature, rainfall and day length is mapped to the volatile composition profile of a given plant. The transition from one developmental stage to another such as vegetative to reproductive is inter-connected with variety of factors such as photoperiod, temperature, nutrients and hormones. The database has 3393 records in which changes in chemical profiles are studied under various stages of growth and development during the life history of plants. Interestingly, there have been several reports on the combinatorial effect of seasonal change and developmental stage variation on plant essential oil composition, and EssOilDB contains many such records that can be browsed by users.  Figure 4 clarifies this aspect with a clustered view of the essential oils emitted under some of the specific conditions described above, each condition being depicted in distinct colors. EssOilDB thereby enables analysis of compounds emitted under user-specific combinations of conditions, such as the oils that may be specific to a given cultivar at a given geographical location. As can be seen from  Figure 4, emissions can be distinguished based on whether they are completely unique to a particular feature or may be commonly released between multiple conditions. For example, a large number of compounds synthesized under stress are unique, whereas compounds that are released based on developmental stage variations or seasonal variations are common to a majority of the conditions analysed. Such common compounds may vary by the exact amounts emitted by the respective plants, which may in turn, depend upon the condition or feature being studied. One such example has been provided in the next section, where a plant produces the same compounds before and after stress, but there is a drastic change in the amounts released upon infection. As discussed earlier, there are many isolation techniques used for the extraction of essential oils and the comparative analysis of these techniques are also reported on the basis of quality and quantity of essential oils obtained by applying them. EssOilDB includes 2872 records providing comparative lists of volatiles extracted through different methods. The chemistry of volatiles has been shown to be differential under the effect of genetic variants such as mutants, cultivars, and populations. The database incorporates genetic factor based compositional profiles that may be used for associating genotype variations with the manifestation of distinct chemical phenotypes. Plants exhibit significant variation in essential oil profiles based on variation in ecological factors, such as the nature of habitat, their abundance and abiotic and biotic factors ( 26). One of the major strengths of EssOilDB is that it can facilitate visualization of emission related variations in diverse plant conditions, providing insights into the cause of such variations. Apart from conditional variations associated with either the plant or the extraction procedure as described above, it can be very valuable to understand compositional variations in the emission itself, and such studies are facilitated in EssOilDB through incorporation of detailed information on the identified chemical compounds within essential oil bouquets, including their registry number, percentage emission, general chemical classification, chemical formula and biological activity, as described in methods.  Terpene variability in the plant kingdom As an illustrative example, we have used EssOilDB to carry out an assessment of the relationship between terpene biosynthetic pathways and actual emission records. The biosynthesis of monoterpenes and diterpenes is conventionally believed to be compartmentalized in plastidial territory of the plant where the 2C-Methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway is known to be located. In contrast, sesquiterpenes and triterpenes are supposed to be synthesized in cytosol through classical mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway ( 27). This assumption is further supported by recent studies on promoter analysis in  Arabidopsis thaliana that suggest an abundance of light and circadian clock related motifs in MEP pathway gene promoters reflecting higher expression of this pathway in green tissues as compared to MVA pathway ( 28). Spatiotemporal expression analysis of genes encoding farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), geranyl pyrophospate synthase (GPPS) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS) in  A. thaliana have also supported the fact that photosynthetic tissues have higher expression of  AtGPPS and  AtGGPPS genes ; generally assumed to synthesize monoterpenes and diterpenes respectively. In contrast, the  AtFPPS gene , which is responsible for the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes, showed higher activity in roots and seeds as compared to above ground, green parts ( 28). We used EssOilDB to test this hypothesis and found that green parts of plants (that are likely to have a more active plastidial MEP pathway) do indeed show relatively greater amounts of released hemi, mono and diterpenes, as compared to sesquiterpenes. In contrast, the non-green plant parts, such as the underground regions and woody parts (signifying an absence of plastidial units and therefore a less active MEP pathway) release higher amounts of sesquiterpenes as compared to monoterpenes. This has been depicted in  Figure 5A, with emission data records from green (plastidial) parts, leaves, fruits and flowers releasing a higher percentage of monoterpenes as compared to sesquiterpenes, whereas roots and bark or woody parts release more sesquiterpenes, thus significantly adding value to the hypothesis.  Terpene diversity in the plant kingdom OilDB data was used in conjunction with genomic data in order to understand how a plant creates the so-called final terpenome, specific to itself, and whether or not plants tap the complete potential for terpene biosynthesis at their disposal according to their genomes. For selected plant species with publicly available genome sequence data, we correlated the ‘actual/observed’ terpene emissions (as recorded in EssOilDB) with ‘expected’ terpene content, (as predicted by a computational identification of TPS genes) for that genome.  Table 1 shows this data for 11 distinct plant species, where the terpene potential of the genome (terpenome) has been compared with the observed or actual terpene emission from EssOilDb records. As can be seen from this table, the available emission profiles appear to only partially capture the full terpene potential. For example, in case of  Eucalyptus, the emission of only 21 monoterpenes have been recorded in literature, whereas the genome of this plant contains genes that code for more than double this number of monoterpene synthases. This is the case with many other plants analysed in this effort, and it may be explained by limitations of record compilations or the unavailability of data under stress for the plant, since these are secondary metabolites induced for specific functions and a large number of biosynthetic genes may lie dormant under natural conditions. Interestingly, a few plants like the legume crop chickpea ( Cicer arietinum) show a contrasting trend, wherein more terpene emissions have been recorded in literature than the predicted genomic potential (Marked in bold font in  Table 1). This means that the number of TPS gene models in the plant genome is less than the total number of terpenes released by that plant, reflecting in turn, the unique ability of TPS enzymes to synthesize multiple products from a single substrate. A single predicted TPS gene product can thus generate many terpene compounds rather than only one, and this ability to create complex odor profiles from a minimal gene set can lead to an expansion of the terpene potential of the respective genome. Further characterization and detailed analysis of such genes may provide insights into the unique molecular mechanism of TPSs that remains poorly understood. This study illustrates the use of EssOilDB for addressing complex and interesting questions in terpene biology and in identification of new avenues for scientific research.  Alteration in terpene emission profiles under stress Extensive research has been carried out to elucidate the stress responses of plants, including the investigation of essential oil compositions under adversity. Accordingly, EssOilDB contains records displaying the observed variability of volatile compositions in different abiotic and biotic stress conditions; and this data would be indispensable in mapping volatile release to the extent of stress. Emission profiles of plants often show significant changes in oil composition under various biotic and abiotic stress conditions. For example, EssOilDb records show that viral stress induces the release of two monoterpenes  Echinacea purpurea ( 29) . As depicted in  Figure 5B,  E.purpurea releases over 50 compounds during cucumber mosaic virus infection, and although these compounds are also released under normal conditions, the percentage emissions vary. Thus, it can be clearly seen that myrcene and alpha-pinene (both monoterpenes) are synthesized and released in higher amounts under stress. Similarly, sesquiterpenes emission has been recorded to increase under blue light in  Ocimum selloi, and as shown in  Figure 5C, drought stress records from EssOilDB reveal the induction of monoterpene carvacrol in  Nigella sativa whereas other monoterpenes show decreased emission under stress ( 30,  31). The database also contains records exposing the induced emission of beta-caryophyllene (a sesquiterpene) in severe salt stress from stems alone, suggesting that emission profiles can significantly vary with plant parts. Interestingly, emission patterns recorded in EssOilDB show significant difference in cases of natural and artificial infection, or based on the noxious state of a plant, or whether it is an introduced plant. This complex emission pattern indicates that the specific isoprenoid compound, type and degree of stress conditions, plant species and plant parts are dynamically co-ordinated by a multi-layered and finely tuned regulatory network that excellently controls isoprenoid biosynthesis and its emission.","Plant essential oils are complex mixtures of volatile organic compounds, which play indispensable roles in the environment, for the plant itself, as well as for humans. The potential biological information stored in essential oil composition data can provide an insight into the silent language of plants, and the roles of these chemical emissions in defense, communication and pollinator attraction. In order to decipher volatile profile patterns from a global perspective, we have developed the ESSential OIL DataBase (EssOilDB), a continually updated, freely available electronic database designed to provide knowledge resource for plant essential oils, that enables one to address a multitude of queries on volatile profiles of native, invasive, normal or stressed plants, across taxonomic clades, geographical locations and several other biotic and abiotic influences. To our knowledge, EssOilDB is the only database in the public domain providing an opportunity for context based scientific research on volatile patterns in plants. EssOilDB presently contains 123 041 essential oil records spanning a century of published reports on volatile profiles, with data from 92 plant taxonomic families, spread across diverse geographical locations all over the globe. We hope that this huge repository of VOCs will facilitate unraveling of the true significance of volatiles in plants, along with creating potential avenues for industrial applications of essential oils. We also illustrate the use of this database in terpene biology and show how EssOilDB can be used to complement data from computational genomics to gain insights into the diversity and variability of terpenoids in the plant kingdom. EssOilDB would serve as a valuable information resource, for students and researchers in plant biology, in the design and discovery of new odor profiles, as well as for entrepreneurs--the potential for generating consumer specific scents being one of the most attractive and interesting topics in the cosmetic industry.

22,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4332321\eupmc_result.json,PMC4332321,"RESULTS AND DISCUSSION MANGO RNA-seq AND  DE NOVO ASSEMBLY A total of 234,310,610 Illumina reads from both, mature-green and ripe conditions were obtained with a total of 16,870,363,920 bases (16 Gb). The FastQC program was used to evaluate the quality of the reads and low-quality or adapter sequences were removed. After trimming and discarding low-quality reads, 67,682,269 clean reads (4,873,123,368 pb) were used. The GenBank accession number for those reads is SRP045880. After Trinity assembly 80,969 transcripts were obtained with a mean length of 836 bp and N 50 of 1,456 bp. The largest transcript was 8,713 nucleotides long. Transcripts were assembled into 52,948 putative unigenes of which 33,142 had an open reading frame (ORF). Detailed information about the assembly statistics are presented in  Table   1. A leaf transcriptome of mango “Langra” was reported ( Azim et al., 2014) where 85,651 transcripts were obtained with a mean size of 536 bp resulting in 30,509 unigenes. In this study, we obtained 22,439 more unigenes and a significantly higher mean transcript length. The pooled transcriptomes from mango “Zill” pericarp and pulp had 124,002 transcripts with a mean size of 838 bp resulting in 54,207 unigenes ( Wu et al., 2014a) essentially similar to our results. ANNOTATION AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION The annotation of assembled sequences was performed using the Swiss-Prot and NCBI non-redundant databases and the results are shown in  Figure   1. According to the Swiss-Prot database, 25,154 genes were fully annotated, 3,905 were partially annotated (Psignal, Pfam, COG, among others) and for 5,264 there was no annotation. In contrast, the results of the annotation performed with the NR database suggest that 32,560 deduced proteins (98.2%) showed significant BLASTp matches with amino acid sequences deposited in the nr database (cut-off E-value of 10 -3).  Citrus protein sequences were the most commonly matched with 36.9% (12,249 sequences) of the 33,142 proteins matched with  C. sinensis followed by 35.3% with  Citrus clementina (11,708 amino acid sequences;  Figure   2). A phylogenetic study of mango chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) reported that  C. sinensis was closely related to  M. indica ( Azim et al., 2014).  M. indica L., meanwhile only presented hits for 62 amino acid sequences, as little publicly available sequence information previously existed for this species. The predicted mango genes were classified into the three Gene Ontology (GO) categories: Cellular Component, Biological Process, and Molecular Function. Based on sequence homology, 29,844 mango unigenes ( Figure   1) were categorized into 81,315 functional groups. The Cellular Component category-contained 10,999 unigenes with the most highly represented terms being “cell part” (9,002), “membrane-bounded organelle” (5,332) and “protein complex” (2,448; Figure  S1). The Biological Process category contained 16,055 unigenes with the more highly represented GO terms including “organic substance metabolic process” (10,261), “primary metabolic process” (9,805) and “cellular metabolic process” (9,557; Figure  S2). The Molecular Function category contained 21,331 unigenes with the most frequent GO terms being “organic cyclic compound binding” (7,686), “heterocyclic compound binding” (7,677), and “ion binding” (6,890; Figure  S3). In the mango leaf transcriptome ( Azim et al., 2014), similar GO terms at similar frequencies to the results of this work were observed, where the terms “cell part” for cellular component, “cellular process” for biological process and “binding” for molecular function, were their most representative GO terms. According to the COG database 11,004 proteins showed a functional annotation. The most representatives COG annotations were Serine/threonine protein kinase (COG0515) with 1,318 proteins. These kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues on target proteins by using ATP as phosphate donor, which is a way to regulate the function of the target protein ( UniProt Consortium, 2014). Followed by FOG: WD40 repeat (COG2319) with 301 proteins, which are implicated in a variety of functions that include signal transduction, regulation of transcription and cell cycle control, among others ( Stirnimann et al., 2010). And by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein (COG4886) with 190 proteins, which are proteins whose main function appears to be to provide a versatile structural framework for the formation of protein–protein interactions ( Kobe and Kajava, 2001). Transcripts were also analyzed in the KEGG database and a total of 7,458 unigenes ( Figure   1) were assigned to 327 KEGG pathways. Tables  S2 and  S3 show 30 metabolic pathways of genes for both the total mango transcriptome and the differentially expressed subset. The most significant pathways with regard to the number of hits from the whole transcriptome data were “biosynthesis of amino acids,” “ribosome” and “RNA transport,” different to the results of the mango “Zill” transcriptome, who reported that “metabolic pathways,” “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” and “plant-pathogen interactions” were the maps with the highest transcripts representation ( Wu et al., 2014a). In the other hand, 3,966 unigenes were annotated in all the databases, including NR, Swiss-Prot, GO, COG and KEGG ( Figure   1). Fruit ripening is a complex process that involves physiological and biochemical modifications associated with metabolic pathways, like the conversion of starch to sugars, changes in the biosynthesis and accumulation of pigments, biosynthesis of flavor and aromatic volatiles and remodeling of the structure of cell wall ( Goulao and Oliveira, 2008).  Table   2 shows five major pathways associated with fruit ripening, the number of gene products involved in each and the percentage of gene products of these pathways identified from the transcriptome or the differentially expressed subset with respect to the  C. sinensis database. The metabolic pathways are: plant hormone signal transduction (Figure S4), starch and sucrose metabolism (Figure S5), galactose metabolism (Figure S6), terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (Figure S7) and carotenoid biosynthesis (Figure S8). DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION DURING MANGO RIPENING Using the edgeR pipeline included with the Trinity software, a total of 2,306 genes were identified as differentially expressed between the mature-green and ripe mango stages, representing 6.9% of total unigenes with a predicted ORF ( FDR < 0.05). From these, 1,178 were up-regulated and 1,128 were down-regulated (Figure S9). As was expected in a climacteric fruit, there was a wide range of genes up-regulated during mango ripening, such as carbohydrate catabolism, sucrose and ethylene biosynthesis among others. Genes encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) oxidase, PME, PG, PL, endoglucanase, expansin, β -galactosidase, α -galactosidase, rhamnogalacturonate lyase (RGL), and β -amylase among others were expressed at higher levels at ripe mango and are listed in  Table   3. These genes are generally encoded in multiple copies in plants. Family members of PGs, PLs, β -galactosidases and other unigenes identified in this transcriptome will be very helpful in future studies where their expression profiles at different developmental stages will be assayed at the transcriptional and translational level. We determined if particular GO terms were enriched in the DE genes as compared to the complete transcriptome.  Figure   3 shows the significantly enriched terms ranked according to the  p-value and number of genes. Some enrichment of GO terms of up-regulated genes ( Figure   3A) are associated to fruit ripening like “cell wall” and “integral component of endoplasmic reticulum membrane,” “starch metabolic process” and “sucrose metabolism.” Similar up-regulation of genes associated with “cell wall” and the “starch metabolic process” during fruit ripening has been previously observed ( Feng et al., 2012;  Wu et al., 2014b). In addition, genes involved in other important biological processes such as “regulation of gene expression,” “carbohydrate catabolic process” and “DNA binding” were also identified. Some enrichment of GO terms for down-regulated genes ( Figure   3B) was associated to, “protein phosphorylation,” “regulation of transcription” and “protein serine/threonine kinase activity.” Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathway genes Four genes encoding the ethylene biosynthesis enzyme (ACC) oxidase and two encoding ACC synthase were obtained in this study. Three ACC oxidase genes were up-regulated in ripe mango (comp35681, comp36021, comp59876) with 2, 4, and 7-fold changes, respectively. The expression of the two ACC synthase genes did not change. Both ACC oxidase and ACC synthase are encoded by a multigene family of five and nine members, respectively, in tomato ( Nath et al., 2006). Ethylene signaling is a plant hormone signal transduction pathway. Several ethylene response genes have been identified in  Arabidopsis ( Bleecker, 1998;  Schaller and Kieber, 2002) and tomato ( Lashbrook et al., 1998;  Tieman and Klee, 1999). In this work we have identified four ethylene receptor transcripts:  ETR1 (comp46286) and  ETR2 (comp47044), that remain constant during fruit ripening, and  ERS1 (comp32379) and  EIN4 (comp34039) that showed a decrease in their expression levels. Other components of the ethylene signaling pathway, such as the constitutive triple response CTR1 (comp43157), which was down-regulated (-2-fold) and eleven ethylene-responsive transcription factor (ERF) were found in this transcriptome, where one (comp27110) was up-regulated (7-fold), seven were down-regulated (comp18706, comp26333, comp34532, comp39082, comp40325, comp42703, and comp45406) in mango ripe and three did not changed (comp24020, comp41521, comp45323). In a previous report ( Wu et al., 2014b), one  ERF showed a decrease in its expression levels during orange ripening. Regulator proteins EIN2 (comp43660), EIN3 (comp47416), and EIL3 (comp41806) were also identified and their levels remained constant. EIN3 proteins are controlled by two F-box proteins (EBF1/2), which are SKP–Cullin–F-box (SCF) E3 ligases targeting EIN3 and EIL for 26S proteosome degradation ( Guo and Ecker, 2003). Two EBF (ethylene binding F-Box proteins) sequences were found in this study, EBF1 (comp45329) was up-regulated (2-fold) and EBF2 (comp44836) was down-regulated (-2-fold) in ripe mango. Genes associated with firmness Mango fruit ripening involves changes in cell wall structure and degradation of lamella media, which are mainly composed by pectin, as well as loss of starch, which result in loss of firmness ( Yashoda et al., 2006;  Cárdenas-Coronel et al., 2012). Gene families encoding for PGs, PMEs, PLs, RGL, α-GAL, β-GAL and β-glucosidases (β-Glu) that degrade cell wall components, as well as α and β-amylases that degrade starch were DE in this work ( FDR < 0.05). In this study, nine  PG unigenes were obtained and six of them (comp28658, comp34301, comp35446, comp39571, comp39826, comp39773) were up-regulated in ripe mango, with 12, 10, 10, 9, 2, and 2-fold changes, respectively. One  PG was down-regulated (comp26280) with a -4 fold. These results suggest that PG expression is developmentally regulated and that most of the PGs act in late phase of ripening but they could act also at the beginning. In papaya ( Carica papaya),  Fabi et al. (2014), reported that  cpPG1 plays a central role during pulp softening. This  cpPG1 presented higher expression levels compared with other three papaya  PG. Comparing the amino acid sequences of cpPG1 against mango PG, those encoded in comp35446 and comp28658, were 68 and 67% identical, respectively. The up-regulation of these two PG (comp35446 and comp28658) in ripe mango could imply their role in pulp softening. In banana ( Musa acuminata), four genes encoding PG associated with fruit ripening were also reported ( Mehar and Pravendra, 2005). Comparison of amino acid sequences of these PGs and mango PGs showed a high percentage of identity (up to 62%) and their expression patterns were also similar. In mango cultivars “Alphonso” and “Dashehari,” three PG isoforms that showed an increase in their activity during fruit ripening were reported ( Prasanna et al., 2006;  Singh and Dwivedi, 2008). Pectin, formed by galacturonic acid with α-1,4 linkages, generally is highly methyl-esterified and must be de-esterified by PME to be later processed by PG ( Brummell and Harpster, 2001). Seven  PME cDNAs were found in this transcriptome, six of them (comp45079, comp198908, comp27472, comp173846, comp37143, comp37279) were up-regulated with 8, 7, 6, 5, 3, and 2-fold changes, respectively and one (comp43676) was down-regulated (-2-fold) in ripe mango. These results suggest that PME expression is differentially regulated during mango ripening. The abundance of four  PL (comp63384, comp28245, comp49359, comp21883) transcripts increased during mango ripening with 11, 6, 5, and 2-fold changes, respectively. In a previous study with mango “Dashehari,” a PL gene associated to fruit ripening was reported and its expression levels increased in ripe mango ( Chourasia et al., 2006). This PL gene is similar to the PL gene (comp21883) reported in this transcriptome (both are 99% identical in their amino acid sequences). In banana, two different  PL (Pel I and Pel II) cDNAs associated with fruit ripening have been reported. Both  PL presented higher levels of expression in ripe bananas ( Marin-Rodriguez et al., 2003). In this study, only one  RGL (comp25112) was obtained and it was DE in ripe mango (5-fold). It is known that RGL degrades pectin type rhamnogalacturonan I, but little is known about how it acts in fruit cell walls. In potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) plants transformed with fungal  RGL, the resulting tubers had cells with an altered morphology and their cell wall contents were easier to extract than those from wild-type plants, suggesting the importance of this enzyme ( Oomen et al., 2002). Recently, in strawberry ( Fragaria x ananassa) an RGL gene was reported to be up-regulated in receptacle in ripe fruit and it was related to the degree of firmness of fruit according to genetic linkage association analysis ( Molina-Hidalgo et al., 2013). This strawberry RGL enzyme is 57% identical in amino acid sequence to the mango RGL (comp25112) from this transcriptome. This enzyme could be important in softening and it will be interesting to uncover its function. Two of the main pectin deglycosylating enzymes that participate in this process are α-GAL and β-GAL ( Goulao and Oliveira, 2008). In this study, four α- GAL transcripts were identified and three of them (comp38455, comp42509, comp45738) did not changed expression levels during ripening; while one of them (comp46653) was up-regulated (2-fold change). Nine β-GAL genes were identified and three (comp41701, comp41168, comp46653) were up-regulated with fold-changes of 12, 10, and 2, respectively, in ripe mango; while five β -GAL transcripts (comp42509, comp250695, comp44177, comp45738, comp44177) expression levels did not changed in ripe mango. Among the glycosidases from mango, β-GAL appeared to be the most predominant ( Ali et al., 1995;  Prasanna et al., 2005). This fact is consistent with the number of unigenes for β-GAL obtained in this study. Two β -Glu transcripts (comp43956, comp47526), which are involved in cellulose degradation, were up-regulated in ripe mango with 6 and 5-fold change, respectively. Expression analysis of β -Glu during ripening in fruits is very limited; most of the reports are about enzymatic analysis. In mango “Ataulfo,” the activity of this enzyme increased significantly during fruit ripening, which coincides with a dramatic decrease in firmness ( Muy-Rangel et al., 2009). In sweet cherry ( Prunus avium L.), the purification of one β-Glu has been reported and its activity increased during ripening ( Gerardi et al., 2001). In this work, an increase in the expression levels of five  EXP transcripts (comp32472, comp51667, comp31446, comp32692, comp48981) was observed with 17, 5, 4, 2, and 2-fold changes, respectively. Only one mango  EXP (comp42385) showed decreased expression (-2-fold change) in ripe fruit. In mango “Dashehari” and “Zill,” expansin genes had increased expression during fruit ripening ( Sane et al., 2005;  Zheng et al., 2012).  EXPA1 of mango “Dashehari” is 71% identical to  EXP (comp51667) obtained in this study that also had increased expression levels in ripe fruit. In mango, there is evidence that enzymatic hydrolysis of starch by α or β- amylases results in major loosening of the cell wall structure, which results in a decrease of the fruit firmness and increase of sweetness. Also, in mango “Kent” there is evidence that 90% of starch is catabolized in the early stages of fruit ripening, which is associated with fruit softening ( Yashoda et al., 2006;  Cárdenas-Coronel et al., 2012). In this work, four β-amylases encoding genes were found, two of them (comp44532, comp39992) were up-regulated (3, 2-fold changes), whereas the others did not changed in ripe mango. Meanwhile, three α-amylases were found (comp46096, comp40871, comp40434) highly expressed and did not change during ripening. In mango fruit, it has been shown that these genes have a very important role in fruit quality.  Lima et al. (2001) reported that in fruit that showed lower activities of amylase, a spongy tissue was observed, which is a physiological disorder that affects the fruit quality and therefore, the potential for marketing. Genes related to flavor quality Fruit flavor is often dependent on aroma generated by volatile compounds and taste is associated with the sugar/acid ratio. Sucrose, glucose and fructose are the most abundant fruit sugars ( Chaimanee and Suntornwat, 1994). In fruit ripening, accumulation of sucrose is due to the activity of the enzyme sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and sucrose phosphate phosphatase (SPP). In this study, six SPS genes were identified and they remained constantly expressed from mature-green to ripe mango. Two SPP genes were obtained and one of them (comp47111) was highly expressed in both stages. While seven sucrose synthase (SuSy) genes were identified, one of them (comp45134) was up-regulated and the rest did not changed in ripe mango. Recently,  Islam et al. (2014) reported the presence of at least six SuSy genes in  Citrus, four of them were expressed in fruit juice sacs and mature leaves and two expressed in young leaves. They demonstrated that the  Citrus SuSy genes have different spatio-temporal expression patterns. Mango fruit has more than 300 volatile compounds identified and terpene hydrocarbons (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) are the dominant volatile components ( Pino et al., 2005). This transcriptome data set contained a total of 29 terpenoid backbone biosynthesis genes, and seven were DE ( Table   2). Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) catalyzes the synthesis of farnesyl pyrophosphate, a key intermediate in sterol and sesquiterpene biosynthesis. Recently, a  FPPS gene was identified in mango “Alphonso” and it was expressed during fruit ripening ( Kulkarni et al., 2013). An  FPPS (comp48152) transcript was identified and showed a 2-fold increase in expression in ripe mango. Another important gene for aroma is the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPS), in this study two GGPS genes were identified, one of them (comp40639) was highly expressed in both stages and the other (comp48107) was DE (8-fold change) during ripening. In orange, mono and sesquiterpenes are the major components for flavor, while in climacteric varieties of melon, volatile esters are the predominant components together with sesquiterpenes, norisoprenoids, alcohols, and aldehydes ( Sharon-Asa et al., 2003;  El Hadi et al., 2013). During ripening the membranes and the cell wall become permeable allowing the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway to be active by sequential enzyme steps involving lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL). Substrates for lipoxygenase, such as linoleic and linolenic acids, are common constituents of plant membranes ( Riley et al., 1996). For mangos “Kensington Pride,” caprylic, capric, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids were found in the pulp of ripe fruit ( Lalel et al., 2003). Six LOX genes were found DE in this transcriptome in ripe mango; four genes (comp20603, comp47763, comp40188, comp44212) were up-regulated with 6, 5, 3, and 3-fold change, respectively. In tomato, at least five LOX genes have been reported, but there is only one ( TomloxC) associated with volatile synthesis and it is expressed during tomato ripening ( Heitz et al., 1997;  Chen et al., 2004). This  TomloxC is 47% identical with a LOX gene (comp44212) of mango. Genes associated to color Mesocarp in mango fruit changes from green to yellow-orange color due to the accumulation of carotenoids ( Tanaka et al., 2008). It has been reported that all- trans-β-carotene, all- trans-violaxanthin and 9- cis-violaxanthin (as dibutyrates) are the principal “Ataulfo” mango carotenoids. During fruit ripening, carotenoids accumulate in an exponential manner, especially all- trans-β-carotene ( Ornelas-Paz et al., 2008). In tomato, the genes encoding enzymes of the carotenoid pathway are regulated both transcriptionally ( Klee and Giovannoni, 2011) and post-transcriptionally ( Cazzonelli and Pogson, 2010). In this study, 10 genes that encode enzymes of carotenoid metabolism in mango mesocarp were DE; a PSY (comp42694) that carry out the first committed step, was highly expressed in mango and did not changed during ripening. While two identified phytoene desaturases (PDSs; comp46184 and comp44482) and one zeta-carotene desaturase (ZDS; comp39926) did not changed during ripening. However, a lycopene isomerase ( MiCRTISO; comp42184) gene presented 4-fold change in ripe mango; similarly, a tomato  SlCRTISO was also up-regulated at the red-ripe stage of fruit development ( Smita et al., 2013). In this study, a lycopene-beta-cyclase ( LCYB; comp42574) transcript presented a -2 fold change in ripe mango.  LCYB is 83% identical to persimmon fruit  DkLCYB and relative expression levels of  DkLCYB followed a similar expression pattern of mango  LCYB. The levels of  DkLCYB decreased during ripening and correlated with the increased contents of β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene in this fruit ( Zhao et al., 2011). Two carotenoid β-hydroxylase (CHYB1 and CHYB2) genes were identified in mango.  CHYB1 (comp45152) presented a 4-fold increase in ripe mango; while  CHYB2 did not changed during ripening. Zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP; comp41313) expression level was down-regulated in ripe mango with -2 fold change. Two additional genes from the isoprenoid pathway that may be associated with color development were identified in this transcriptome, unigene farnesyl diphosphate synthase (comp 48152) and GGPS (comp48107) were differentially expressed with 2 and 8-fold change, respectively. qRT-PCR VALIDATION In order to validate the DE data obtained by RNA-seq, the following single unigenes were selected to experimentally determine their expression levels by qRT-PCR: 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO) comp59876, ethylene receptor 1 (ETR1) comp46286, ethylene response sensor 1 (ERS1) comp32379, ethylene insensitive 4 (EIN4) comp34039, PME comp45079, PL comp63384, expansin (EXP) comp51667, alpha-galactosidase (AGAL) comp46653, lycopene beta-cyclase (LCYB) comp42574 and carotenoid beta-hydroxylase 2 (CHYB2) comp39312. The results for gene expression ratios between ripe and mature-green mango are shown in  Figure   4A. A linear regression analysis showed an overall correlation coefficient of  R = 0.97, which indicates a high correlation between transcript abundance assayed by qRT-PCR and the transcription profile revealed by RNA-seq data ( Figure   4B). The results showed that although the exact fold changes of selected genes at the two data points (mature-green and ripe mango) varied between RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analyses, trends of gene expression by the two different approaches were consistent. The RNA-seq data reflects what is happening in the cell at the transcriptional level during mango ripening.","Fruit ripening is a physiological and biochemical process genetically programmed to regulate fruit quality parameters like firmness, flavor, odor and color, as well as production of ethylene in climacteric fruit. In this study, a transcriptomic analysis of mango (Mangifera indica L.) mesocarp cv. ""Kent"" was done to identify key genes associated with fruit ripening. Using the Illumina sequencing platform, 67,682,269 clean reads were obtained and a transcriptome of 4.8 Gb. A total of 33,142 coding sequences were predicted and after functional annotation, 25,154 protein sequences were assigned with a product according to Swiss-Prot database and 32,560 according to non-redundant database. Differential expression analysis identified 2,306 genes with significant differences in expression between mature-green and ripe mango [1,178 up-regulated and 1,128 down-regulated (FDR ≤ 0.05)]. The expression of 10 genes evaluated by both qRT-PCR and RNA-seq data was highly correlated (R = 0.97), validating the differential expression data from RNA-seq alone. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, showed significantly represented terms associated to fruit ripening like ""cell wall,"" ""carbohydrate catabolic process"" and ""starch and sucrose metabolic process"" among others. Mango genes were assigned to 327 metabolic pathways according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, among them those involved in fruit ripening such as plant hormone signal transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, terpenoid backbone, and carotenoid biosynthesis. This study provides a mango transcriptome that will be very helpful to identify genes for expression studies in early and late flowering mangos during fruit ripening.","['Ethylene', 'Fruit quality', 'Fruit ripening', 'Transcriptome', 'Mesocarp', 'Mangifera Indica L.', 'Cell Wall Hydrolytic Enzymes']","['ripe mango', 'MANGO', 'Fruit ripening', 'genes', 'Fruit', 'Figure', 'ripening', 'ripe', 'EXPRESSION', 'MANGO RIPENING']","[16,870,363,920, 67,682,269, 4,873,123,368, SRP045880, 80,969, 52,948, 30,509, 22,439, ”, 2014a, Swiss-Prot, Swiss-Prot, 29,844 mango, 81,315, ”, “membrane-bounded, “protein complex, “, ”, “, ”, ”, 21,331, ”, “, ”, “, ”, ”, ”, “binding”, Serine/threonine protein kinase, FOG, WD40, leucine-rich repeat, protein–, “, ” “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, 2014a, Swiss-Prot, PL, endoglucanase, β -galactosidase, α -galactosidase, rhamnogalacturonate lyase, β -amylase, PGs, PLs, β -galactosidases, “, ”, “sucrose, ”, “cell wall”, “starch, ”, 2014b, “, ” “carbohydrate, ”, “DNA, ”, “, ” “, ”, “protein serine/threonine, oxidase, comp35681, comp36021, comp59876, ACC synthase, ACC oxidase, ACC synthase, comp46286, comp47044, comp32379, comp34039, CTR1, comp43157, comp18706, comp26333, comp39082, comp40325, comp42703, comp45406, comp24020, comp41521, comp45323, 2014b, comp43660, EIN3, comp47416, EIL3, comp41806, EIN3, F-box proteins, EBF1/2, SKP–Cullin–F-box, EIN3, EIL, 26S proteosome, ethylene binding, F-Box, EBF1, comp45329, EBF2, comp44836, pectin, PGs, PMEs, α-GAL, β-GAL, β-glucosidases (β-Glu, α, β-amylases, comp34301, comp35446, comp39571, comp39826, comp39773, comp26280, PGs, cpPG1, comp35446, comp28658, comp35446, Mehar, Pravendra, PGs, “Dashehari, ”, Pectin, α-1,4, comp45079, comp198908, comp27472, comp173846, comp37143, comp37279, comp43676, comp63384, comp28245, comp49359, comp21883, ”, PL, PL, PL, Pel I, Pel II, comp25112, pectin type rhamnogalacturonan I, comp25112, pectin deglycosylating enzymes, α-GAL, β-GAL, α- GAL, comp38455, comp42509, comp45738, comp46653, β-GAL, comp41701, comp41168, comp46653, β, comp42509, comp250695, comp44177, comp45738, comp44177, β-GAL, β-GAL, β, comp43956, β, ”, β-Glu, comp32472, comp51667, comp31446, comp32692, comp48981, comp42385, “Zill, ”, comp51667, α, β- amylases, ”, β-amylases, comp44532, comp39992, α-amylases, comp46096, comp40871, comp40434, amylase, Chaimanee, SPS, SPP, SPS, SPP, comp45134, SuSy, Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, FPPS, sterol, comp48152, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, GGPS, GGPS, comp40639, comp48107, Sharon-Asa, LOX, lipoxygenase, hydroperoxide lyase, “, Lalel, LOX, comp47763, comp40188, comp44212, LOX, LOX, trans-violaxanthin, 9- cis-violaxanthin, Ornelas-Paz, PSY (comp42694, comp46184, comp44482, zeta-carotene desaturase, ZDS, comp39926, MiCRTISO, comp42184, lycopene-beta-cyclase, comp42574, β-cryptoxanthin, β-carotene, CHYB1, CHYB2, comp45152, comp41313, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, GGPS (, comp48107, RNA-seq, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, comp59876, ethylene receptor 1, ETR1, comp46286, ERS1, comp34039, PME comp45079, PL comp63384, alpha-galactosidase (, comp42574, carotenoid beta-hydroxylase 2, CHYB2, RNA-seq, RNA-seq, RNA-seq]",[],"['C.', 'C.', 'C.']","['Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus,', 'Citrus']",NaN
23,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4356138\eupmc_result.json,PMC4356138,"Results Differences in sugar, organic acid and carotenoid content between Murcott and Temple Fruits of Temple and Murcott were different in flesh color (Figure  1). There were differences for sugars, organic acids and carotenoids between Temple and Murcott at the three maturity stages. Among sugars, only sucrose and total sugars were higher in Murcott than Temple at stage 3, and total soluble solids content (SSC) at stage 1 and 3. However, no differences were found in fructose and glucose. Among acids, Temple was higher than Murcott for citric acid at stage1, malic acid and titratable acidity (TA) at stage 1 and 2, and ascorbic acid at all three stages, respectively. The pH values for Temple were significantly lower at stage 2. Overall, ascorbic acid was 21 times higher in Temple than Murcott. SSC/titratable acidity (TA) was lower in Temple at stage 1 and 2. SSC/TA is an indicator of maturity in citrus, and no differences were found between the two cultivars in stage 3. All carotenoids, except α-carotene for stage 2 and 3 and lutein for stage 1, were significantly higher in Murcott than in Temple (Figure  2). Differences in aroma volatiles between Murcott and Temple A total of 121 volatile compounds were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), with 108 compounds in Temple and 60 compounds in Murcott, respectively (Additional file  1: Table S1). Only 48 volatiles were found in both Temple and Murcott. There were 46 volatiles unique to Temple, in addition to 14 unknown compounds, whereas 12 volatiles were found only in Murcott (Table  1). The sum of total relative peak areas (peak area of compounds divided by peak area of internal standard) was twice as high in Temple than in Murcott, 21.9 for Temple, 11.5 for Murcott, respectively (Table  2). Terpenoid-related compounds contributed more than 85 and 95% of the total volatiles in Temple and Murcott respectively, also the volatile profile was markedly different. Valencene accounted for 9.4% of the total profile in Temple, whereas no valencene nor nootkatone was detected in Murcott. Sesquiterpenes were 0.15% and 3.10% and esters were 0.38% and 7.16% in Murcott and Temple, respectively. We found seven carotenoid-derived volatiles in Temple: nerol, neral, geranial, neryl acetate, α-ionone, geranyl acetone, and β-ionone. In contrast, only two of these, neryl acetate and geranyl acetone, were found in Murcott. D-limonene was the most abundant volatile compound which accounted for 80.8% and 64.4% of the volatile profile in Murcott and Temple, respectively. Murcott had two branched aldehydes, 3-methyl pentanal and 4-methyl hexanal, which were lacking in Temple. However, Temple had one branched alcohol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and one branched ester, ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, likely to have been derived from the branched alcohol, whereas Murcott did not have these compounds (Table  2). Differentially expressed proteins in Temple versus Murcott We identified 280 differentially expressed proteins in Temple versus Murcott (Additional file  1: Table S2). Of these identified proteins, 92 were significantly differentially expressed in juice sacs at the three ripening stages (fold change > 1.5, P < 0.05) (Table  3). We found 42, 54 and 45 expressed proteins in ripening stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3, respectively. There were 22 proteins in common between stage 1 and 2, 24 between stage 2 and 3, whereas only 9 proteins in common were identified between stage 1 and 3. Five proteins were present across all three stages: hypothetical protein (gi|225442225), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (gi|77417715), phospholipase D alpha (gi|169160465), plastid-lipid-associated protein (gi|62900641), and UDP-glucosyltransferase family 1 protein (gi|242199340). All proteins were more highly expressed in Murcott than Temple in stage 2, whereas most proteins were more highly expressed in Temple than Murcott in stage 1. In stage 3, 13 proteins were up-regulated versus 32 down-regulated in Temple versus Murcott. We found several important proteins involved in volatile production. Phospholipase D alpha (gi|169160465), a key enzyme involved in membrane deterioration which produces precursors to aliphatic alcohols and aldehydes, was up-regulated in Temple versus Murcott at stage 1, but not stage 2 and 3. The Family1 glycotranferases might affect biosynthesis and accumulation of glycosides that bind volatile terpenoids. Isopentenyl diphosphate Delta-isomerase I (gi|6225526) isomerizes isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and was up-regulated in Murcott versus Temple at ripening stage 2. Valencene synthase (gi|33316389) was the protein that was the most different between the two cultivars, being 25 times higher in Temple than in Murcott at ripening stage 3. Several proteins from the glycolysis pathway were identified: triosephosphate isomerase (gi|77540216), a triosphosphate isomerase-like protein (gi|76573375), and pyruvate decarboxylase (gi|17225598). All were only expressed in ripening stage 3, and were higher in Murcott than in Temple. A citrate synthase precursor (gi|624676) was found in ripening stage 1, upregulated in Temple in comparison with Murcott. In addition to citrus synthase, malate dehydrogenase (gi|27462762) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (gi|5764653) of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were also found and downregulated in Temple versus Murcott. Glutamate decarboxylase (gi|70609690) and aspartate aminotransferase (gi|255551036), involved in glutamate synthesis, were also identified. Gene annotation was conducted using the Blast2GO program for all 92 identified proteins. The biological interpretation was further completed by assigning them to metabolic pathways using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation. KEGG analysis assigned the 46 differentially expressed proteins to 48 metabolic pathways (Additional file  1: Table S3). Most biosynthetic pathways identified were glycolysis, citric acid cycle, sugar synthesis, amino acid synthesis and terpene synthesis. Additional file  2: Figure S1 shows the distributions of GO terms (2 nd level GO terms) according to biological processes, cellular components and molecular function. Most differentially expressed proteins were predicted to be involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism as well as in energy production. We found 10 enzymes involved in the glycolysis pathway and 16 enzymes involved in different amino acid pathways (Table  4; Additional file  1: Table S3)."," Background Although many of the volatile constituents of flavor and aroma in citrus have been identified, the knowledge of molecular mechanisms and regulation of volatile production are very limited. Our aim was to understand mechanisms of flavor volatile production and regulation in mandarin fruit. Result Fruits of two mandarin hybrids, Temple and Murcott with contrasting volatile and non- volatile profiles, were collected at three developmental stages. A combination of methods, including the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, gas chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography, was used to identify proteins, measure gene expression levels, volatiles, sugars, organic acids and carotenoids. Two thirds of differentially expressed proteins were identified in the pathways of glycolysis, citric acid cycle, amino acid, sugar and starch metabolism. An enzyme encoding valencene synthase gene (Cstps1) was more abundant in Temple than in Murcott. Valencene accounted for 9.4% of total volatile content in Temple, whereas no valencene was detected in Murcott fruit. Murcott expression of Cstps1 is severely reduced. Conclusion We showed that the diversion of valencene and other sesquiterpenes into the terpenoid pathway together with high production of apocarotenoid volatiles might have resulted in the lower concentration of carotenoids in Temple fruit.",NaN,"['Temple', 'Murcott', 'Temple Fruits', 'stage', 'Temple versus', 'versus Murcott', 'Table', 'proteins', 'ripening stage', 'found']","[titratable acidity, 2, α-ionone, β-ionone, 3, superoxide dismutase, phospholipase D alpha, plastid-lipid-associated protein, gi|62900641, UDP-glucosyltransferase family 1, Phospholipase D alpha, Family1 glycotranferases, triosephosphate isomerase, gi|77540216, triosphosphate isomerase-like, pyruvate decarboxylase, gi|17225598, malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, Glutamate decarboxylase, gi|70609690, aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate]",[],[],[],NaN

25,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4445982\eupmc_result.json,PMC4445982,"Results and discussion Genome sequencing, assembly and validation A whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy by generating long and short paired-end reads, along with long reads and mate-pair libraries was applied to assemble the 386 Mb genome sequence of  O. sanctum. The process workflow of the same has been provided in the Fig.  1. Two libraries (long and short reads) of Illumina HiSeq2000, one library of 454 GS FLX and one mate-pair library of SOLiD 5500XL were constructed. Illumina libraries were used to generate the contigs and Illumina paired-end data along with 454 GS FLX single end data were used for contig merging as a result of which scaffolds were generated. While Illumina generated 45.37 Gb data (Additional file  1), 454 sequencing resulted in 320.3 Mb (Additional file  2) data and SOLiD generated 12.68 Gb (Additional file  3) data representing approximately ~130-fold coverage of the predicted  O. sanctum genome. With the help of the two Illumina library data (short insert and long insert) the assembly showed significant improvement in respect of N50. Long- and short-paired end reads from Illumina deep sequencing was used to assemble a total of 107,785 contigs into 22,776 scaffolds. Super-scaffolding was performed in order to merge the existing gap-closed scaffolds into super-scaffolds using relative orientation of SOLiD mate pair reads. Finally, 9059 super-scaffolds of maximum length upto 2,211,552 bp were generated (Table  1). Out of the total super-scaffolds generated, 4159 super-scaffolds are larger than or equal to 1 kb in length (Table  1). The N50 length of contigs, scaffolds and super-scaffolds was found to be 12,769 bp, 61,854 bp and 303,233 bp respectively (Table  1). The total length of the gaps in the assembled scaffolds was 26.11 Mb in a total of 3999 super-scaffolds. The total number of gaps present is 45,803 considering even the presence of a single N as one gap. The biggest gap identified was of 4906 bp in length. Mate-pair reads significantly closed ~60 % of gaps between scaffolds and five-fold change in N50 value and N90 value was also observed where N50 increased from 61,242 to 303,233 while N90 from 12,534 to 73,672. In order to validate the genome assembly, a total of 69,117 transcripts generated from our previous study [ 16] were mapped to the genome data and more than 95 % transcripts (66,891) showed 100 % coverage (Additional file  4). De-novo assembly of chloroplast and mitochondria genome data The complete chloroplast (cp) genome of  O. sanctum is 142,524 bp in length (Fig.  2). Recently, Qian et al [ 17] had reported the chloroplast genome of  Salvia miltiorrhiza to be the smallest with the exception of  Epifagus virginiana [ 18] cp genome of order lamiales. But this investigation revealed  O. sanctum cp genome to be 8804 bp smaller than  S. miltiorrhiza (member of the  Ocimum family- lamiaceae) cp genome of length 151,328 bp. Hence  O. sanctum cp genome is now reported as the smallest of the Lamiales cp genomes as it is ~8800 bp smaller than  E. virginiana cp genome. The overall GC content of the  O. sanctum cp genome is 36.2 %, which is similar to the other reported asterid cp genomes [ 17,  19– 22]. The  O. sanctum cp genome was found to code a total 158 genes, including 43 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes and four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. The aligned reads of cp genome of  O. sanctum to other angiosperms (referred in materials and methods section) were assembled into contigs for finally generating the scaffolds using all the Illumina data. Similar procedure was carried out for mitochondrial genome (Additional file  5 and  6) assembly except considering  S. miltiorrhiza as the reference mitochondial genome. A total of 48 scaffolds from 140 contigs from cp genome, and 41 scaffolds from 124 contigs (Additional file  5 and  6) from the mitochondrial genome got generated. Genomic composition and SSR prediction GC content is an important indicator of the genomic composition including evolution, gene structure (intron size and number), gene regulation and stability of DNA [ 23]. Average GC content of  O. sanctum was 38.37 %. Earlier researchers have reported that across the broad phylogenetic sweep, genome size may be correlated with intron size [ 24– 26], suggesting that some fraction of genome size evolution takes place within genes [ 27]. While performing the annotation of gene models, taking  N. tabacum and  S. lycopersicum as references, it was found that the percent genes containing introns from these plants were 55.5 % and 64.5 %, respectively (Additional file  7). It has been observed that introns and their positions are highly conserved during land plant evolution excluding conifers [ 28,  29]. Comparative studies had revealed that intron lengths and the abundance of mobile repetitive elements have a direct correlation with genome size, such that large genomes have longer introns and a higher proportion of mobile elements [ 30,  31]. Intron sizes in the genes of  O. sanctum ranged from 5 bp to 8000 bp (Additional file  7). A reason for intron size variation among organisms may be due to inherent mutational processes generating insertions and deletions [ 24,  32– 35]. It was also reported that low distribution of recombination regions leads to increased intron size [ 36,  37]. Among different classes of molecular markers, microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are the most preferred for its array of applications in plant genetics and breeding due to their multi-allelic nature, reproducibility, co-dominant inheritance with high abundance and wide genome coverage [ 38,  39]. A total of 4827 sequences greater than 500 bp length were examined for SSR search out of which 2612 sequences were found having SSR repeats while 2364 sequences showed the presence of more than one SSR (Fig.  3). A sum of 142,601 SSRs were predicted, with the highest being mono-repeats (85,624) and (13,389) complex SSR’s. The sequences were checked for mono-repeats occurring at-least 10 times, di-repeats occurring at-least 6 times and tri/ tetra/ penta/ hexa-repeats occurring atleast 5 times. The SSR was classified as complex when two SSR’s were present within 100 bp distance of each other. On the other side, 1,166,753 sequences of less than 500 bp were identified, only 162 SSRs highest being mono-repeats (68) followed by complex SSR’s (57) (Fig.  3). Previously, we reported SSRs from the transcriptome of  O. sanctum [ 16] but the SSRs identified were very few in comparison to the present report. Similarly, efforts were made by researchers towards the development of molecular markers in order to carry out genetic diversity studies on  Ocimum sp. [ 40– 42]. But, SSRs reported from the present study with a large data set would be helpful in providing insights to the plant breeders and geneticists for evaluation of desired genotypes with varied essential oil compositions and also for further development of new species of  Ocimum. A gene density of ~30 genes per 100 kb and ~20 genes per 100 kb was observed in  O. sanctum gene model prediction taking  N. tabacum (tobacco) and  S. lycopersicum (tomato), respectively as references. Since  O. sanctum is a small genome plant, the gene density is similar to that of  Arabidopsis thaliana i.e., upto 38 genes per 100 kb [ 43]. Large genomes like barley and wheat show a gene density of about 5 genes per 23 kb [ 44] as it was suggested that the larger genomes would have accumulated non-coding sequences between the single-copy genes [ 45]. Gene prediction and annotation In order to assign putative functions to the predicted genes of  O. sanctum, they were compared against the NR (non-redundant) protein sequences of  Arabidopsis. The associated hits were searched for their respective GO. Based on sequence homology, 85,723 protein sequences were categorized into 31 functional groups under three main categories: biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC) and molecular functions (MF) (Fig.  4, Additional file  8). Genes were predicted from 22,776 scaffolds by mapping (BLASTP) the predicted proteins with UNIPROT with all Viridiplantae clade protein sequences. Out of 85,723 protein coding loci from 22,776 scaffolds, a total of 53,480 were annotated with UNIPROT (Additional file  9) but only 22,270 protein coding genes were found to be unique. On observing the plant species distribution of hits to UNIPROT database, maximum hits were from the plant  Genlisea aurea (Additional file  10) which is one of the smallest known genome among higher plants [ 46]. The number of unique protein coding genes (22,270) in the  O. sanctum genome, was in range as reported in potato, tomato [ 47], neem [ 48] and grapevine [ 49], having 35,004, 34,727, 20,000 and 30,434 protein coding genes, respectively. Ab initio gene model prediction was performed on scaffold sequences utilizing minimal information from the nearest available species. Overall, 130,526 and 87,918 proteins were predicted using training sets of  Nicotiana tabacum and  Solanum lycopersicum respectively. A total of 65,935 proteins were common between the two predictions. Gene annotation of the predicted proteins with BLASTP resulted in annotation of 80,516 NR proteins. A set of 38,868 of these annotated proteins were common to the predictions from  N. tabacum and  S. Lycopersicum, respectively. The un-annotated predicted proteins were scanned with Pfam and another 18,940 proteins got annotated with a predicted domain signature. Database annotation of assembled scaffold sequences greater than 500 bp was carried out for matching with the EST/mRNA sequences available for  Ocimum in the NCBI databases (Additional file  11). A total of 23,420 EST and 52 mRNA were queried, with a match to the assembled scaffolds for 21,984 of the EST/mRNA sequences at greater than 90 % sequence identity. Also  Arabidopsis sequences (Additional file  12) from TAIR database and  N. tabacum (Additional file  13) and  S. lycopersicum (Additional file  14) sequences from NCBI were Blast- checked against the  O. sanctum scaffolds with percent hitting scaffolds of 34.65 %, 4.9 % and 5.29 %, respectively. Database annotation of EST/mRNA from NCBI datasets identified the mitochondria and chloroplast expressed proteins. All of the 392 scaffolds identified were annotated to potentially map to these sequences (Additional file  15). Out of 392 scaffolds, 270 were redundant and only 122 were non-redundant. On the basis of annotation of chloroplast and mitochondria encoded proteins against TAIR database, it was found that out of 122 non-redundant scaffolds of  O. sanctum, 95 were chloroplastic while remaining 27 were mitochondrial. Phylogenetic analysis  To identify the phylogenetic position of  O. sanctum within the asterid lineage, multiple sequence alignments was performed using 63 protein-coding genes (Additional file  16) commonly present in the 32 complete cp genomes representing 10 families within five orders of asterids including Apiaceae, Araliaceae, Asteraceae, Convolvulaceae, Gesneriaceae, Lamiaceae, Oleaceae, Pedaliaceae, Rubiaceae and Solanaceae (Additional file  17). Two additional eudicot cp genomes,  Spinacia oleracea and  Arabidopsis thaliana, were set as outgroups. A phylogenetic tree was generated using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood method (Fig.  5). Bootstrap analysis showed that there were 25 out of 31 nodes with bootstrap values >95 %, and 14 of these had a bootstrap value of 100 %. The tree topologies formed two major clades, euasterids I and II. The results strongly supported the position of  Ocimum sanctum and  Salvia miltiorrhiza with 100 % bootstrap from the same family lamiaceae as the sister of the closely related species  Sesamum indicum and  Boea hygrometrica in the order Lamiales. As the chloroplast genome is considered to be free from evolutionary processes, like gene duplication/ deletion, intensive evolution and pseudogene formation, which are characteristically frequent among nuclear genes, this was included in the phylogenetic analysis [ 50]. Slow rate of sequence evolution in chloroplast DNA is appropriate to include cp genome in phylogenetic studies of the highly cross pollinated plant like  O. sanctum [ 51]. Pathway identification To identify the biological pathways functional in  O. sanctum 85,723 protein sequences from scaffolds were mapped to the reference canonical pathways in KEGG taking  Arabidopsis thaliana and  Oryza sativa as reference organisms, out of which only 6328 proteins got predicted in KAAS (Additional file  18). All transcripts were classified mainly under five categories: metabolism, cellular processes, genetic information processing, environmental information processing and others. Highest numbers of sequences were related to metabolism. Maximum percentage of the sequences fell under the category of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.  O. sanctum is good source of phenylpropene- eugenol and is one of the compounds which attributes to its medicinal property [ 52,  53]. Precursor molecules for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis are derived from the shikimate pathway while terpenoid biosynthesis utilizes isoprenoid precursors from cytosolic MVA (mevalonate) as well as plastidial MEP pathways (2-Cmethyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate/non-mevalonate pathways) [ 16]. On sorting 53,480 protein coding genes of  O. sanctum annotated from UNIPROT for phenylpropanoid (Fig.  6) and terpenoid (MEP and MVA) pathway genes (Fig.  6) it was found that the highest number of phenylpropanoid pathway genes were identified as compared to the terpenes. Since the  O. sanctum variety used in the present study is high-yielding, eugenol-rich, oil producing variety [ 54] with 83 % eugenol in the oil, it correlates with the presence of higher number of phenylpropanoid pathway genes. Interestingly, highest number transcripts of copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) were present among the mevalonate pathway genes (Fig.  6). This enzyme participates in gibberellin biosynthesis [ 55]. Not only gibberellins, but a wide range of secondary metabolites, including terpenes and alkaloids, are also derived either from  ent-copalyl pyrophosphate itself or from  ent-kaurene or  ent-kaurenoic acid, the next two intermediates in the metabolic pathway to gibberellins. Knowledge of these secondary metabolic pathways is very much limited as compared to gibberellin biosynthetic pathway, and is often little more than a speculation [ 56]. Further functional characterization studies for copalyl diphosphate synthase may help in proving the possibility of CPS involvement in terpene and alkaloid biosynthesis. Medicinal nature of  O. sanctum In this analysis  O. sanctum cp genome was observed to be evolutionarily nearest to  S. miltiorrhiza. In the absence of complete genome sequence data (unfinished draft genome) of  S. Miltiorrhiza, the chloroplast genome comparison analysis was taken into account. Both the plants are used widely in two different traditional medicine systems (Indian and Chinese, respectively), and hence may be implicated for similar molecules, activities  vis a vis the genes biosynthesizing metabolites. In addition, both plants have chromosome number described to be 2n = 16 [ 16,  57]. The active ingredients in  S. miltiorrhiza are both hydrophilic (phenolic acids like rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid B, lithospermic acid and dihydroxyphenyllactic acid) and lipophilic diterpene components (tanshinones, including structurally related tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, cryptotanshinone, and dihydrotanshinone I) [ 58]. These molecules are responsible for a wide array of activities like anti-bacterial, anti-oxidative and anti-viral to hepatoprotective activities. The chemical composition of Tulsi is highly complex, and the important are triterpene like urosolic acid (cardioprotective effect), phenolics like rosmarinic acid, apigenin, cirsimaritin, isothymusin and isothymonin (exhibiting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities), and important aroma components like 1, 8 cineole, linalool, methyl chavicol (estragole) and eugenol [ 16]. Phenolic acid compounds production by hairy root culture have been reported in both  O. basilicum and  S. miltiorrhiza [ 59]. In addition, the vast literature indicates phenylpropanoid derivatives in these two plants are responsible for a range of major activities. In this investigation also we could observe the dominance of phenylpropanoid pathway genes. The highest number of sequences among the mevalonate pathway genes in  O. sanctum are observed to be homologous to copalyl diphosphate synthases (CPS), that are involved in the biosynthesis of an important bioactive diterpene tanshinone in  S. miltiorrhiza [ 58]. As  O. sanctum is traditionally used for many aliments and the compounds of this plant are not fully investigated, the possibility exists for the discovery of tanshinone like compounds and other novel diterpenes."," Background Ocimum sanctum L. (O. tenuiflorum) family-Lamiaceae is an important component of Indian tradition of medicine as well as culture around the world, and hence is known as ""Holy basil"" in India. This plant is mentioned in the ancient texts of Ayurveda as an ""elixir of life"" (life saving) herb and worshipped for over 3000 years due to its healing properties. Although used in various ailments, validation of molecules for differential activities is yet to be fully analyzed, as about 80 % of the patents on this plant are on extracts or the plant parts, and mainly focussed on essential oil components. With a view to understand the full metabolic potential of this plant whole nuclear and chloroplast genomes were sequenced for the first time combining the sequence data from 4 libraries and three NGS platforms. Results The saturated draft assembly of the genome was about 386 Mb, along with the plastid genome of 142,245 bp, turning out to be the smallest in Lamiaceae. In addition to SSR markers, 136 proteins were identified as homologous to five important plant genomes. Pathway analysis indicated an abundance of phenylpropanoids in O. sanctum. Phylogenetic analysis for chloroplast proteome placed Salvia miltiorrhiza as the nearest neighbor. Comparison of the chemical compounds and genes availability in O. sanctum and S. miltiorrhiza indicated the potential for the discovery of new active molecules. Conclusion The genome sequence and annotation of O. sanctum provides new insights into the function of genes and the medicinal nature of the metabolites synthesized in this plant. This information is highly beneficial for mining biosynthetic pathways for important metabolites in related species.",NaN,"['Additional file', 'Genome', 'Additional', 'sanctum', 'genes', 'file', 'sequences', 'scaffolds', 'pathway genes', 'gene']","[mate-pair, GS, GS, SOLiD, short-paired, 107,785, gap-closed, SOLiD, 2,211,552, Mate-pair, 61,242, 73,672, 69,117, 66,891, lamiales, ~8800, ribosomal RNA, SSRs, 85,624, di-repeats, tri/ tetra/ penta/ hexa-repeats, 1,166,753, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, single-copy, 85,723, UNIPROT, 85,723, 53,480, 87,918 proteins, 65,935, 80,516 NR, 38,868, TAIR, NCBI, Blast-, NCBI, duplication/, phenylpropene- eugenol, 53,480, eugenol-rich, copalyl diphosphate synthase, CPS, gibberellin biosynthesis, copalyl diphosphate synthase, CPS, isothymonin, CPS]",[],[],[],NaN
26,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4452144\eupmc_result.json,PMC4452144,"Results Reaction of pure ( E)-β-farnesene with ozone and its protective effects We tested whether the reaction of ( E)-β-farnesene with ozone, which has been observed in smog chambers [ 28], could remove substantial amounts of ozone from the air surrounding a living plant, and whether such removal would prevent ozone-induced foliar necrosis. Injecting 1 µl pure ( E)-β-farnesene into empty chambers containing ca. 500 ppb ozone lowered within-chamber ozone concentrations by >100 ppb within a few minutes ( Fig 1A). The disappearance of ( E)-β-farnesene from chambers containing 350 ppb ozone ( Fig 1B) provided additional evidence that the drop in ozone resulted from reaction of ozone with ( E)-β-farnesene. To test whether  (E)-β-farnesene-mediated ozone destruction in the leaf headspace would protect plants, we supplemented the ozone-susceptible  N.  tabacum cv. BelW3 with external ( E)-β-farnesene diluted in acetonitrile and impregnated into cotton tampons. A dose of 2000 μg plant -1 h -1 visibly reduced ozone-induced foliar necrosis ( Fig 1C), but was unrealistically high given the sesquiterpene emission rates reported from plants [ 45]. In contrast, a physiologically plausible dose of 20 μg plant -1 h -1 was not protective ( Fig 1C). Leaf extractions showed that even during 350 ppb ozone fumigation, some ( E)-β-farnesene from the 2000 μg plant -1 h -1 treatment reached and was retained in the leaf, although the 10-fold greater leaf retention in the control fumigation suggested that most  (E)-β-farnesene was destroyed in the headspace ( Fig 1D). Sesquiterpene content and emission from transformed  N.  attenuata plants External supplementation indicated that the reaction of ( E)-β-farnesene with ozone could protect plants by destroying ozone in the headspace around leaves. Yet whether endogenous ( E)-β-farnesene production would be sufficient to achieve leaf protection, either by acting in the headspace or within the leaf itself, remained unclear. To test for benefits of endogenous production, we transformed  N.  attenuata with two versions of a maize sesquiterpene synthase expressed behind a constitutive 35S promoter. The enzyme ZmTPS10 (TPS10 line) yielded nearly equal amounts of ( E)-β-farnesene and  (E)-α-bergamotene, whereas the point mutant Zmtps10M produced primarily ( E)-β-farnesene ( Fig 2A and 2B).The amount of transgenic sesquiterpene emission dwarfed native sesquiterpene emission from the wild-type (WT) ( Fig 2A and 2B). Emission of α-duprezianine, the only sesquiterpene recorded from unwounded WT plants [ 38], was less than 5% of total emission in either transformed line and undetectable in leaf extracts. Emission rates were similar in quantity to the lower 20 μg/plant dose used in the BelW3 experiments and robust even to acute ozone exposure (3 h, 300 ppb) ( Fig 2A and 2B). TPS10 plants tended to emit higher levels of both sesquiterpenes following ozone exposure, although these increases were not statistically significant (Welch’s t-test, ( E)-β-farnesene:  t(2.29) = 1.11,  p = 0.36;  (E)-α-bergamotene:  t(2.35) = 1.21,  p = 0.33). Emission of the TPS10- and TPS10M-catalyzed sesquiterpenes from the transformed  N.  attenuata lines was approximately twice as high as the sesquiterpene emission rate measured from herbivore-damaged maize plants, and exceeded undamaged plant emission by an order of magnitude [ 22]. Within-leaf sesquiterpenes ( Fig 2C) qualitatively resembled emitted sesquiterpenes; within-leaf concentrations averaged 0.4 μg/g fresh mass and were on the same order of magnitude as the 1.4 μg/g observed in BelW3 leaves during the high-dose (2000 μg/plant) external supplementation experiments without ozone treatment ( Fig 1D). Leaf sesquiterpene pools in the transformants were similar to the 0.733 μg/g reported by Köllner and colleagues for seedling-stage, herbivore-elicited maize leaves [ 46], which was the highest value recorded among all tissue types and developmental stages. Ozone treatment of sesquiterpene synthase transformants Sesquiterpene synthase-transformed and WT  N.  attenuata had similar visible and physiological responses to ozone treatment. Leaf necrosis was apparent to equal extents in TPS10 and WT after the 6 h, 300 ppb ozone treatment ( Fig 3A). Ozone-fumigated leaves sustained 20-fold increases in salicylic acid (SA,  Fig 3B; treatment:  F(1, 12) = 734.3,  p<0.001) and significant decreases in moisture content ( Fig 3C; treatment:  F(1, 15) = 25.95,  p<0.001)) and photosynthetic rate ( Fig 3D; treatment:  F(1, 15) = 7.81,  p<0.016), all common effects of ozone exposure [ 47]. A two-way ANOVA showed no significant genotype by treatment interaction in any of these metrics (SA:  F(1, 12) = 0.88,  p = 0.37; moisture:  F(1, 15) = 0.07,  p = 0.80; photosynthetic rate:  F(1, 15) = 0.04,  p = 0.85). Surprisingly, ozone treatment had no significant effect on three markers of oxidative stress in leaves: malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation ( Fig 3E; treatment:  F(1, 12) = 0.55,  p = 0.47); oxidative radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) ( Fig 3F; treatment:  F(1, 12) = 0.49,  p = 0.50); and rutin ( Fig 3G; treatment:  F(1, 12) = 0.16,  p = 0.69), a flavonoid glycoside that dominates the leaf phenolic profile of  N.  attenuata and whose induction plays a role in UVB tolerance [ 39]. A TPS10M line (596.1, hereafter ""TPS10M2"") was also included in the experiment, but results from this line were omitted due to its delayed stem elongation: the leaves of the shorter TPS10M plants were further away from the ozone inlets at the top of the chamber and likely did not experience equivalent ozone concentrations. In numerous replicate experiments, responses of this TPS10M line to ozone did not differ from those of WT ( S3 Fig). UVB treatment of sesquiterpene synthase transformants To directly test for within-leaf antioxidant effects of sesquiterpenes, we exposed sesquiterpene synthase-transformed and WT plants to UVB irradiation. Since we had evidence of ( E)-β-farnesene’s reactivity and protective potential from the ozone experiments with BelW3, and we hypothesized that protection against UVB exposure would accrue from within-leaf terpenes, we used the TPS10M line with the highest leaf ( E)-β-farnesene content (line 596.1, TPS10M2). To control for effects of transformation unrelated to sesquiterpenes, we included a second, independently transformed TPS10M line (line 334.6, TPS10M1). The morphological responses of both TPS10M and WT leaves, which assumed a curled appearance and crispy texture, testified to the severity of the UVB exposure ( Fig 4A). After 8 days of treatment, phenolic content increased significantly in all lines ( Fig 4B; treatment:  F(1, 28) = 12.73,  p = 0.001), while chlorophyll fluorescence ( Fig 4C; treatment:  F(1, 29) = 55.20,  p<0.001) and photosynthetic rate ( Fig 4D; treatment:  F(1, 29) = 24.88,  p<0.001) were significantly decreased, but no significant differences emerged between responses of TPS10M and WT plants (genotype x treatment, phenolic content:  F(2, 28) = 0.62,  p = 0.55; chlorophyll fluorescence:  F(2, 29) = 0.79,  p = 0.47; photosynthetic rate:  F(2, 29) = 0.42,  p = 0.66). MDA measurements did not show a significant treatment effect ( Fig 4E; treatment:  F(1, 12) = 2.45,  p = 0.14). The daily UVB exposure was continued for a total of 8 weeks, leading to significant decreases in height ( Fig 4F; treatment:  F(1, 30) = 157.00,  p<0.001) and seed capsule number ( Fig 4G; treatment:  F(1, 30) = 38.15,  p<0.001), but again, no differences in responses to treatment appeared between genotypes (genotype x treatment, height:  F(2, 30) = 0.50,  p = 0.61; seed capsule number:  F(2, 30) = 0.16,  p = 0.86). Drought treatment of sesquiterpene synthase transformants We tested for ( E)-β-farnesene-mediated resistance to drought stress using the same two TPS10M lines used in the UV experiment. Within 3 d of treatment onset, all drought-treatment plants raised their leaves, a sign of water stress in  N.  attenuata. At the time of tissue harvest, 6 days into the treatment, abscisic acid (ABA) levels were double those in controls ( Fig 5A; treatment:  F(1, 24) = 13.39,  p = 0.001) and photosynthesis was decreased by 80% ( Fig 5B; treatment:  F(1, 30) = 562.33,  p<0.001), but responses did not differ between TPS10M and WT (genotype x treatment, ABA:  F(2, 24) = 0.60,  p = 0.56; photosynthesis:  F(2, 30) = 0.12,  p = 0.89). Although shoot MDA did not show a treatment effect ( Fig 5C; treatment:  F(1, 29) = 1.07,  p = 0.31), root MDA increased (treatment:  F(1, 27) = 12.57,  p = 0.001), but to a similar extent in all lines ( Fig 5D; genotype x treatment:  F(2,27) = 0.71,  p = 0.50). Ion leakage also increased (treatment:  F(1, 30) = 8.26,  p = 0.007). Increases tended to be less dramatic in the ( E)-β-farnesene emitter TPS10M1 than in WT, but TPS10M2 was no different from WT in its response, nor was the genotype x treatment term significant in an ANOVA ( Fig 5E; genotype x treatment:  F(2,30) = 1.53,  p = 0.23). Total fresh mass after 6 d of treatment ( Fig 5F; treatment:  F(1, 30) = 50.86,  p<0.001), plant height after 2 weeks of treatment ( Fig 5G; treatment:  F(1, 60) = 152.19,  p<0.001), and seed capsule count after an 11 d drying period in both treatment groups ( Fig 5H; treatment:  F(1, 60) = 16.94,  p<0.001) all showed significant declines with drought, but no differences between the responses of TPS10M and WT (genotype x treatment, fresh mass:  F(2, 30) = 1.72,  p = 0.20; height:  F(2, 60) = 0.53,  p = 0.59; seed capsule number:  F(2, 60) = 1.06,  p = 0.35).","Among the terpenes, isoprene (C5) and monoterpene hydrocarbons (C10) have been shown to ameliorate abiotic stress in a number of plant species via two proposed mechanisms: membrane stabilization and direct antioxidant effects. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (C15) not only share the structural properties thought to lend protective qualities to isoprene and monoterpene hydrocarbons, but also react rapidly with ozone, suggesting that sesquiterpenes may similarly enhance tolerance of abiotic stresses. To test whether sesquiterpenes protect plants against ozone, UVB light, or drought, we used transgenic lines of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata. The transgenic plants expressed a maize terpene synthase gene (ZmTPS10) which produced a blend of (E)-ß-farnesene and (E)-α-bergamotene, or a point mutant of the same gene (ZmTPS10M) which produced (E)-ß-farnesene alone,. (E)-ß-farnesene exerted a local, external, and transient ozone-quenching effect in ozone-fumigated chambers, but we found no evidence that enhanced sesquiterpene production by the plant inhibited oxidative damage, or maintained photosynthetic function or plant fitness under acute or chronic stress. Although the sesquiterpenes (E)-ß-farnesene and (E)-α-bergamotene might confer benefits under intermittent heat stress, which was not tested, any roles in relieving abiotic stress may be secondary to their previously demonstrated functions in biotic interactions.",NaN,"['Fig', 'treatment', 'ozone', 'β-farnesene', 'sesquiterpene', 'ozone treatment', 'plants', 'leaf', 'emission', 'sesquiterpene emission']","[TPS10 line, 2B).The, α-duprezianine, TPS10, TPS10-, μg/g, μg/g, μg/g, Köllner, herbivore-elicited, synthase-transformed, TPS10, WT, SA, TPS10M line, TPS10M2, TPS10M, TPS10M line, synthase-transformed, WT, TPS10M line, TPS10M2, TPS10M line, TPS10M1, TPS10M, TPS10M, 4F, E)-β-farnesene-mediated, TPS10M lines, drought-treatment, abscisic acid, ABA, 562.33, TPS10M, ABA, Ion, TPS10M1, TPS10M2, 5F, TPS10M]","['ZmTPS10', '(TPS10', 'TPS10', 'TPS10-', 'TPS10M-catalyzed', 'TPS10', 'TPS10M', '""TPS10M2"")', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M2).', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M1).', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M1', 'TPS10M2', 'TPS10M']",[],[],terpene synthase
27,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4473991\eupmc_result.json,PMC4473991,"Results Stage-specific variations of VOCs in dwarf ylang ylang flowers Flowers can emit different volatile compounds at different stages of development ( Dudareva   et al., 2000 ). Dwarf ylang ylang flowers have little floral scent when the petals are green, but their scent gradually becomes stronger as the flower matures. To examine the overall intensity and the diversity of the floral scent during flower development, total essential oils from flowers at four different stages of development were analysed by GC-MS ( Fig. 1).  Figure 1B and  Supplementary Fig. S1 show that the chemical composition of the essential oils from the floral bud stage to the three different stages of open flower development was very diverse, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Only 15 compounds that had meaningful levels of >0.1% of total volatile compounds were detected from floral buds ( Fig. 1B,  Table 1). The number of peaks increased progressively during maturation of flower buds into fully open flowers. More than 20, 27, and 45 volatile compounds were obtained from the three different stages of flower development: undeveloped small flower (I), mature green flower (II), and fully mature yellow flower (III). Hence, the fully mature stage represents the stage where there was maximum production of VOCs by the flowers. At this stage, the majority of the volatiles were terpenes with a few benzenoid/phenolpropanoid compounds. Out of 45 compounds identified, 31 were identified as mono- and sesquiterpenes using the mass spectra reference library ( Fig. 1B and  Table 1). Interestingly, >90% of the total identified terpenes were sesquiterpenes consisting of α-farnesene (31.50%), α-bergamotene (26.79%), germacrene D (13.26%), β-caryophyllene (11.57%), humulene (1.63%), farnesol (0.75%),  trans-β-farnesene (0.77%), and β-ylangen (0.63%), whereas monoterpenes were quantitatively less than 10%, comprising mainly  cis-β-ocimene (1.99%),  trans-β-ocimene (1.55%), and β-linalool (1.40%). Other aromatic compounds comprised <3%. The relative amounts of all identified volatiles are shown in  Table 1 (see mature yellow flowers, III). Dried yellow flowers of ylang ylang also showed a similar volatile composition ( Supplementary Fig. S2A, available at  JXB online). Compared with flowers, ylang ylang leaves contained very low levels of terpenes, comprising mainly α-pinene, β-caryophyllene, germacrene D, and phytol ( Supplementary Fig. S2B). Two sesquiterpenes, germacrene D and β-caryophyllene, could be found at all stages of development, and their levels were retained or slightly decreased during open flower development (#22 and #28,  Fig. 1B, and  Supplementary Fig. S3, available at  JXB online). However, the other two major sesquiterpenes, α-farnesene and α-bergamotene, were undetectable at the floral bud stage but were found during early flower development (#29 and #30 in I,  Fig. 1B, and  Supplementary Fig. S3) and subsequently became the most abundant components of essential oils at mature stages of flower development (II and III,  Fig. 1B). Interestingly, most of the monoterpenes except α-pinene were undetectable at the floral bud stage, but they gradually increased during open flower development ( Fig. 1B). Among the monoterpenes,  trans-β-ocimene, β-ocimene, and β-linalool were highly inducible during flower maturation (#9, #10, and #13,  Fig. 1B). Additionally, our GC-MS analysis identified several sesquiterpenes or sesquiterpene alcohols that decreased during flower maturation such as δ-elemene (#46), α-ylangene (#47), γ-cadinene (#48), and α-copaene-11-ol (#49). Other aromatic compounds such as benzenoid/phenolpropanoid and volatile fatty acids were found almost exclusively in mature yellow flowers ( Fig. 1B and  Supplementary Fig. S1,  Table 1). GC-MS analysis of flowers at night did not show any change in VOC profile, suggesting that there are no significant diurnal changes in the emission pattern ( Supplementary Fig. S4, available at  JXB online). RNA sequencing,  de novo assembly, and annotation of the transcriptome To profile the dwarf ylang ylang floral transcriptome, we sequenced RNA-seq libraries synthesized from the mature yellow flowers. Illumina sequencing runs generated more than 110 million reads of 101bp, and the quality of reads was evaluated by FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) ( Supplementary Fig. S5, available at  JXB online). Due to the absence of reference genomic sequences for ylang ylang, the Trinity method was used for  de novo assembly of short sequence reads ( Grabherr   et al., 2011 ). These assemblies generated a total of 45 379 unigenes with an N50 value of 2016bp ( Table 2). The assembled unigenes were BLASTed against the National Centre for Biotechnology Information non-redundant (nr) protein database and protein databases for  Arabidopsis thaliana,  Vitis vinifera, and  Oryza sativa. Among 45 379 unigenes, 30 539 unigenes (67.3%) were annotated through a BlastX search with E-values ≤1e–3 ( Table 2). Functional classifications of Gene Ontology (GO) terms of all unigenes were performed using Trinotate ( Quevillon   et al., 2005 ).  Figure 2 shows enriched GO terms for the top 1000 highly expressed transcripts. From our annotated unigenes, 16 were identified as TPSs that were more than 500bp. Of these, four unigenes contained full-length ORFs encoding TPS. RNA-seq analysis of different biosynthetic pathways active in flowers GC-MS analysis of the mature flowers showed that the majority of VOCs were terpenes. We used our RNA-seq data to analyse the expression profile of genes encoding enzymes for the precursor pathways leading to the formation of VOCs in mature flowers. The majority of ylang ylang orthologue unigenes were full length and showed high sequence similarity to known enzymes of these pathways from other plants ( Supplementary Fig. S6, available at  JXB online). The MEP and MVA pathways are the pathways leading to the formation of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Transcripts of all the enzyme genes involved in these two pathways were detected in our RNA-seq data, and their expression was validated by qRT-PCR ( Fig. 3). Additionally, the expression of these enzyme genes was also examined at earlier stages of flower development and in leaves by qRT-PCR. Genes encoding the MEP and MVA enzymes were active in all stages of flower development consistent with the high production of terpenes in the flowers ( Fig. 3A,  B). It has been reported that 1-deoxy- d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), the first enzyme of the MEP pathway, is important for the overall regulation of the pathway and is encoded by a small gene family ( Cordoba   et al., 2011 ). From our RNA-seq data, we were able to identify four different  DXS unigenes showing different levels of abundance in flowers and leaf. One of these,  DXS3, belonging to clade 2, which may be related to secondary metabolism ( Walter   et al., 2002 ;  Phillips   et al., 2007 ), was highly induced in stage III flowers ( Fig. 3A and  Supplementary Figs S7 and Fig. S8, available at  JXB online). The majority of the genes, except phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL), for the shikimate pathway enzymes, which produce phenylalanine for the production of benzonoids and phenylproponids, appeared to be expressed more in mature flowers ( Fig. 3C,  D). The significant benzenoids in VOCs were benzyl benzoate and benzyl salicylate, and the phenylproponoid was eugenol. These compounds were detected only in mature flowers (#18, #39, and #45,  Fig. 1B,  Table 1). Previous  in vitro experiments have indicated that benzyl benzoate might play a role in pollinator attraction ( Hoballah   et al., 2005 ;  Huber   et al., 2005 ) or in plant defence (miticide) ( Harju   et al., 2004 ). Phylogenetic analysis of  TPS genes from dwarf ylang ylang flowers Terpenes were the major VOCs of dwarf ylang ylang flowers. From the dwarf ylang ylang RNA-seq data, four full-length ORFs of  TPS genes were PCR amplified from cDNA pools of the flowers. Phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences of four  CoTPS cDNAs showed that CoTPS2 (561 aa) belonged to the TPS-a subfamily representing the sesqui-TPSs, whereas CoTPS1 (590 aa) and CoTPS3 (547 aa) fell into the TPS-b subfamily, which consists mainly of mono-TPSs ( Chen   et al., 2011 ;  Fig. 4A). CoTPS4 (586 aa) is a member of the TPS-g subfamily, which lacks the R(R)X 8W motif in the N-terminal region of mono-TPSs and produces acyclic monoterpenes ( Dudareva   et al., 2003 ;  Yuan   et al., 2008 ;  Chen   et al., 2011 ;  Fig. 4A). All four CoTPSs had the conserved aspartate-rich motif (DDXXD) and NSE/DTE motifs that chelate divalent metal ions, typically Mg 2+, in the C-terminal domain ( Fig. 4B). Both motifs are required for cyclization of the universal acyclic terpene precursors, such as GPP and FPP, to synthesize mono- and sesqui-terpene, respectively ( Chen   et al., 2011 ). The arginine-tryptophan motif, R(R)X 8W, present at the N terminus of most mono-TPS and in some sesqui-TPS and di-TPS, was found in CoTPS1, CoTPS2, and CoTPS3 but not in CoTPS4 ( Fig. 4B). One of the distinguishing structural features between mono- and sesqui-TPS is the presence of an N-terminal plastid transit peptide (Tp) sequence. Using the signal sequence analysis programs ChloroP ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP) and WoLF PSORT ( http://www.genscript.com/psort/wolf_psort.html), a putative N-terminal plastid Tp sequence of 41 and 35 aa for CoTPS1 and CoTPS4, respectively, was predicted, indicating they are likely to be mono-TPSs. However, we could not find a putative plastid Tp sequence for CoTPS3, which was supposed to be a mono-TPS belonging to the TPS-b subfamily. CoTPS2 did not contain a plastid Tp sequence, which correlated well with the prediction of it being a sesqui-TPS. The amino acid sequences of CoTPS1 and CoTPS2 had highest identity with the magnolia ( Magnolia grandiflora) TPSs Mg17 (70% similarity, 54% identity) and Mg25 (72% similarity, 55% identity) for α-terpineol and β-cubebene, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S9A, B, available at  JXB online) ( Lee and Chappell, 2008). CoTPS3 showed 65% amino acid similarity and 47% identity with mountain pepper ( Litsea cubeba)  trans-ocimene synthase ( Supplementary Fig. S9C) ( Chang and Chu, 2011). CoTPS4 was most similar to geraniol synthase from Madagascar periwinkle ( Catharanthus roseus) (92% similarity, 84% identity;  Supplementary Fig. S9D) ( Simkin   et al., 2013 ). Subcellular localization and expression of the four CoTPSs As well as phylogenetic analysis and bioinformatics-based attempts to classify TPSs, their subcellular localization is also important for function prediction. This was especially true for CoTPS3, since its function was unpredictable from the bioinformatics analyses based on amino acid sequences. To address this issue, we transiently expressed the full-length ORF of each CoTPS fused to a YFP reporter gene to produce a CoTPS–YFP fusion protein in  N. benthamiana leaves using  Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration.  Figure 5 shows that CoTPS1–YFP and CoTPS4–YFP, which had the N-terminal plastid Tp sequence, were localized in chloroplasts as expected, whereas CoTPS2–YFP and CoTPS3–YFP were distributed throughout the cytosol. Based on the results of the subcellular localization experiments, it is likely that CoTPS1 and CoTPS4 are involved in monoterpene synthesis in plastids, whereas CoTPS2 and CoTPS3 might produce sesquiterpenes in the cytosol. The transcript levels for the four  CoTPS genes at different developmental stages of dwarf ylang ylang flowers were examined by qRT-PCR. The expression levels of all four transcripts were very low or below detection limits in leaf tissues but greatly elevated in flower tissues ( Fig. 6). Transcripts for three  TPS genes,  CoTPS1,  CoTPS3, and  CoTPS4, were highest in mature green flowers (II), whereas  CoTPS2 was highly expressed at the floral bud stage ( Fig. 6). Functional characterization of CoTPSs The subcellular localization of each CoTPS–YFP fusion protein provided us with preliminary evidence to elucidate the function of each TPS. The exact functional annotation of a new TPS requires activity characterization of the recombinant protein. To determine the enzymatic activity of CoTPSs  in vitro, 6His-tagged CoTPS recombinant proteins purified from  E. coli BL21(DE3) ( Supplementary Fig. S10, available at  JXB online) were used for  in vitro assays. GPP (C10) or FPP (C15) was used as the common substrate for mono- and sesqui-TPS, respectively. Control assays using heat-inactivated recombinant 6His-tagged CoTPSs did not form any terpenes from GPP or FPP ( Supplementary Fig. S11, available at  JXB online).  Figure 7A shows that CoTPS1, a member of the TPS-b family, synthesized four products corresponding to β-thujene, sabinene, β-pinene, and α-terpinene from GPP, but not from FPP, which were found in the essential oil profiles of dwarf ylang ylang flowers (#1, #4, #5 and #7,  Fig. 1,  Table 1). These results suggested that CoTPS1 is a multifunctional β-thujene/sabinene/β-pinene/α-terpinene synthase that is able to catalyse the synthesis of a mixture of monoterpenes, namely β-thujene, sabinene, β-pinene, and α-terpinene. This is not surprising, as several multiproduct mono-TPSs that produce similar compounds, such as α-thujene, sabinene, α/β-pinene, α/γ-terpinene, have been reported widely in other plant species ( Lücker   et al., 2002 ;  Chen   et al., 2003 ;  Fäldt   et al., 2003 ;  Shimada   et al., 2004 ;  Fähnrich   et al., 2011 ). Similarly, recombinant CoTPS2 catalysed the synthesis of three compounds, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene, from FPP. CoTPS2 is a multifunctional β-ylangene/β-copaene/β-cubebene synthase capable of producing three sesquiterpenes, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene ( Fig. 7B). Many sesqui-TPSs are also known to be multifunctional ( Steele   et al., 1998 ;  Lee and Chappell, 2008). However, TPSs that produce β-ylangene/β-copaene/β-cubebene have not yet been reported. Of these three sesquiterpene compounds, we could only detect β-ylangene and β-cubebene in the flowers of dwarf ylang ylang (#23 and #27,  Fig. 1,  Table 1). CoTPS3 is a member of the TPS-b family with the unusual feature that it lacks a putative N-terminal Tp sequence. Our enzyme assays showed that CoTPS3 catalysed the formation of α-bergamotene from FPP ( Fig. 7C), which is a major sesquiterpene produced in the flowers of ylang ylang (#30,  Fig. 1,  Table 1). CoTPS4, which belongs to TPS-g family, was capable of utilizing GPP to synthesize an acyclic monoterpene, geraniol ( Fig. 7D). This was confirmed by comparison of retention time and mass spectra with those of an authentic standard ( Supplementary Fig. S11). This result was expected, as the protein showed the highest amino acid identity with geraniol synthases (84%) from Madagascar periwinkle ( Supplementary Fig. S9D) ( Simkin   et al., 2013 ). However, geraniol was not detected in our GC-MS analysis of ylang ylang flowers. Functional characterization of CoTPS  in vivo We further investigated whether CoTPSs would produce the same terpene products  in vivo using  Agrobacterium-mediated transient gene expression in tobacco leaves. The YFP-fused CoTPS1, CoTPS2, CoTPS3, or CoTPS4 was expressed in  N. benthamiana with or without co-expression of  Arabidopsis HMGR. HMGR catalyses a rate-limiting step of the MVA pathway and its overexpression is known to increases heterologous sesquiterpene production ( Song   et al., 2012 ;  Jin   et al., 2014 ). Analysis by GC-MS showed that the  in vivo results were consistent with those obtained  in vitro. CoTPS2–YFP clearly produced three compounds, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene, when it was co-expressed with AtHMGR ( Fig. 8A), whereas Co-TPS3 produced α-bergamotene when co-expressed with AtHMGR ( Fig. 8B). The expression of CoTPS2 or CoTPS3 alone without AtHMGR in  N. benthamiana did not produce any terpenes, which may be due to limiting amounts of the substrate, FPP ( Supplementary Fig. S12, available at  JXB online). CoTPS1 and CoTPS4 characterized as mono-TPS  in vitro failed to produce any new peaks  in planta, suggesting that they might require the co-expression of additional genes, probably a rate-limiting step in the non-MVA pathway. Alternatively, compounds formed by these TPSs might be further metabolized endogenously by the plants.","The pleasant fragrance of ylang ylang varieties (Cananga odorata) is mainly due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the flowers. Floral scents are a key factor in plant-insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to β-thujene, sabinene, β-pinene, and α-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate. The other two TPSs were identified as sesqui-TPSs. CoTPS3 catalysed the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to α-bergamotene, whereas CoTPS2 was found to be a multifunctional and novel TPS that could catalyse the synthesis of three sesquiterpenes, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene. Additionally, the activities of the two sesqui-TPSs were confirmed in planta by transient expression of these TPS genes in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration.","['Terpene synthase', 'volatile organic compounds', 'terpenes', 'Floral Scent', 'Cananga Odorata Var.

28,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4574175\eupmc_result.json,PMC4574175,"Results and discussion Production of geraniol by a wine yeast strain expressing the  GES gene of  O. basilicum and its metabolic fate in synthetic defined (YPD) media The truncated  O. basilicum GES cDNA [ 22] (GenBank Accession No. AY362553) coding for a geraniol synthase lacking the first 34 codons—which encode the plastid transit peptide—was cloned under the control of the  S. cerevisiaeACT1 (encoding actin) promoter ( ACT1p) and the  HIS3 (encoding imidazole glycerol-phosphate dehydratase) terminator ( HIS3t) into the binary vector YEplac195 [ 23]. The resulting plasmid (YEp195Ges) was used to transform the  S. cerevisiae T 73-4 [ 24] wine strain and the uracil prototrophic (ura +) transformants YR377 and YR378 (T 73Ges) were isolated. The growth rates of YR377, YR378 and the control strain YR70 (T 73-4 transformed with the empty plasmid) on liquid YPD media were almost identical, albeit slightly slower than that of the industrial strain T 73 (Fig.  1a) as observed previously for other recombinant yeasts [ 17]. This indicates that neither the amount of geraniol nor the putative reduction of precursors from the isoprenoid pathway apparently produce deleterious effects on yeast growth under such conditions. In addition, GC and GC–MS analyses of these culture media showed similar extraordinarily high geraniol yields (8,017.85 ± 1,245.81 and 7,859.12 ± 1,614.62 μg/L after 32 h) (Fig.  1b). These levels are about 16-fold higher than those produced by recombinant  S. cerevisiae laboratory strains expressing the same  GES gene, about 1.6-fold the amount produced by laboratory yeasts co-expressing  GES and an optimized farnesyl diphosphate synthase [ 25,  26], and about 120-fold the amount of linalool excreted by engineered T 73-4 wine strains expressing  LIS [ 17,  21]. These results clearly reinforce the previously shown importance of the genetic background of this industrial yeast for monoterpene production [ 21] but also that of the monoterpene synthase being expressed. In contrast to the T 73Lis strains that produced linalool as the only end product, and in agreement with the reported ability of  S. cerevisiae T 73 to metabolise supplemented geraniol and its reaction products [ 20], the T 73Ges strains produced geraniol (84.83%) and geraniol derivatives i.e. citronellol (10.92%), nerol (3.90%), linalyl acetate (0.13%), geranyl acetate (0.12%) and linalool (0.1%). As expected, monoterpene production by the control strains lacking  GES (YR70 and T 73) was practically negligible (7.13 ± 1.12 μg/L; >1,300-fold lower than YR377 and YR378) (Fig.  1b). YR377 was chosen for the microvinification experiments. Aromatic wines from neutral grapes using the self-aromatizing wine yeast YR377 Microvinification experiments were carried out in parallel on sterile Parellada white grape must using the wine yeast strain T 73-4 that carries the  GES expression cassette (YR377) and a control strain lacking  GES (YR70). Both alcoholic fermentations progressed similarly (Fig.  2b) and reached completion in about 19 days leaving approximately 2 g/L residual sugar (i.e. dry wine). Given the persistence of the ura + phenotype (around 85%) in YR377 and hence high maintenance of the  GES expression cassette throughout the process it is evident that neither the expression of the  GES gene nor its consequences affected the growth or fermentative capacity of the engineered wine strain. To evaluate the influence of  GES expression on wine aroma, volatile profiles were determined by GC and GC–MS (Fig.  3a). As expected given the aromatic neutrality of the Parellada grape, free geraniol was undetectable in wines produced by YR70. In contrast, geraniol concentrations (~750 μg/L) well in excess of its olfactory perception threshold (40–75 μg/L) and exceeding those present in wines obtained from the highly aromatic Muscat grapes (Additional file  1: Table S1) were found in wines fermented with the ‘self-aromatizing’ wine yeast YR377 (Fig.  3b; Table  1). Remarkably, GC analysis (Fig.  3) showed that apart from the geraniol peak there were also notable quantities (~810 μg/L) of additional monoterpenes and esters associated with strain YR377: citronellol, linalool, nerol, citronellyl acetate and geranyl acetate, resulting in a total terpene concentration >220-fold greater than the control wine. With the exception of nerol and citronellyl acetate, the other compounds are present above their perception thresholds (Table  1). The presence of geraniol and its derivatives will enrich these wines with flowery and fruity notes. GES and  E. coli-expressed recombinant GES both exclusively catalyze the synthesis of geraniol from GPP [ 22]. Our comparative GC–MS data (Figs.  2,  3) revealed that the same terpenes found in wine were also excreted by YR377 when grown in synthetic (YPD) medium. Thus during vinification the enzymatic activities intrinsic to this wine yeast strain are also able to metabolize geraniol and its derivatives resulting in their conversion to other monoterpenes and aromatic esters, a situation resembling the metabolic diversion occurring in tomato expressing the  GES gene [ 27]. The reduction of geraniol to citronellol and the acetylation of geraniol and citronellol are probably catalyzed by the oxidoreductase Oye2 and the alcohol acetyl transferase Atf1 [ 28], respectively. An obvious strategy to further expand our ability to modulate wine aroma would therefore be to promote or suppress the formation of these geraniol derivatives by modification of these enzyme activities. To investigate whether  GES expression could lead to additional changes in a wine’s volatile profile, determinations of other volatile compounds of oenological relevance were carried out on both recombinant yeast derived and control wines. The compositions and concentrations of higher alcohols (e.g. 2-phenylethyl alcohol) and acetate esters (e.g. isoamyl acetate), the presence of which is considered favorable for the aromatic properties of wines, were seen to be statistically similar in wines fermented with YR377 and YR70 strains (Table  1). Introduction of the  C. breweriLIS gene into wine yeast strain T 73-4 (T 73Lis) under the control of the  TDH3 yeast promoter was our first attempt to construct a self-aromatizing wine yeast [ 17]. This resulted in de novo accumulation in wine of linalool alone to levels exceeding its odor perception threshold. Remarkably, the amount of geraniol-derived linalool produced by YR377 (T 73Ges) was about 7.5 times greater than that obtained with T 73Lis (~141 versus ~19 μg/L) and the total de novo terpene concentration is more than 80-times greater, illustrating the importance of the MTPS employed in engineering strain T 73. These results justify the strategy of engineering the wine yeast isoprenoid pathway as a means of achieving efficient plant-derived aromatic monoterpene production during alcoholic fermentation. Mixed fermentation with T 73Ges and  S. cerevisiae strains not producing monoterpenes serves to modulate levels of terpenes In order to assess whether it would be feasible to produce wines with a predetermined monoterpene content, vinifications were conducted using mixed starters (1:1) of yeast strains YR377 and YR70 and were compared to those obtained using pure cultures of YR377. The monoterpene profiles of wines derived from mixed fermentations were directly related to the composition of the initial inocula. Thus the amounts of geraniol (~388 μg/L) and its derivatives (~311 μg/L) detected were about half of those obtained using inocula of YR377 alone (Table  2). Terpenes are also important flavor compounds in other fermented drinks. Geraniol, linalool and citronellol have all been shown to be important contributors to the floral, fruity and citrus flavors of beer [ 29], and biotransformations of these monoterpenes by ale and lager yeasts have been reported [ 19]. Engineered brewing-yeasts designed as vehicles for the de novo production of these monoterpenes thus have potential for use in the brewing industry. Moreover, certain monoterpenes have been shown to display a plethora of potential health benefits (see [ 5– 8] and references therein)."," Background Monoterpenes are important contributors to grape and wine aroma. Moreover, certain monoterpenes have been shown to display health benefits with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer or hypotensive properties amongst others. The aim of this study was to construct self-aromatizing wine yeasts to overproduce de novo these plant metabolites in wines. Results Expression of the Ocimum basilicum (sweet basil) geraniol synthase (GES) gene in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine strain substantially changed the terpene profile of wine produced from a non-aromatic grape variety. Under microvinification conditions, and without compromising other fermentative traits, the recombinant yeast excreted geraniol de novo at an amount (~750 μg/L) well exceeding (>10-fold) its threshold for olfactory perception and also exceeding the quantities present in wines obtained from highly aromatic Muscat grapes. Interestingly, geraniol was further metabolized by yeast enzymes to additional monoterpenes and esters: citronellol, linalool, nerol, citronellyl acetate and geranyl acetate, resulting in a total monoterpene concentration (~1,558 μg/L) 230-fold greater than that of the control. We also found that monoterpene profiles of wines derived from mixed fermentations were found to be determined by the composition of the initial yeast inocula suggesting the feasibility of producing 'à la carte' wines having predetermined monoterpene contents.

29,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4574478\eupmc_result.json,PMC4574478,"Results and Discussion Over three seasons, 19 blueberry genotypes were assayed for overall liking, texture liking, perceived sweetness, sourness, and flavor intensities by 217 panelists in 30 sensory panels, and for the biochemical measures of sucrose, glucose, fructose, soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), pH, and 52 volatiles ( S2 Table). A PLS model was constructed to determine the most relevant biochemical effectors of liking, intensity of sweetness, sourness, and blueberry flavor to be used for breeding selection. Six of these 19 genotypes (‘Emerald,’ ‘Endura,’ ‘Farthing,’ ‘Meadowlark,’ ‘Primadonna,’ and ‘Scintilla’) were sampled three times a season for three years in three locations to quantitate the biochemical variation due to environmental effects, and whether these differences were perceivable by humans. Blueberry genotypes vary significantly in scores for liking and perceived sensory intensities Genotypic relatedness based on pedigree and biochemical profiles were compared using hierarchical cluster analyses ( Fig 1). The dendrograms between the two analyses do not pair the same genotypes together in any instance, demonstrating the diversity of biochemistry that exists regardless of genotypic relatedness. This is likely due to the highly heterozygous nature of this autotetraploid species that extends beyond pedigree information. A cluster analysis based on molecular genetic relatedness between these individuals may show more similarity to biochemical clusters, and may be considered in future investigations. Of 153 blueberry samples assayed in sensory panels, every sample scored in the positive region of the hedonic scales (-100,+100) for overall liking and texture liking ( S2 Table,  Fig 2). Panelists scored berry texture on the hedonic gLMS scale to reduce artificially low scores in other scales in the incidence of poor texture. They then rated the individual sensory experiences of sweetness, sourness, and blueberry flavor on an intensity gLMS scale (0,+100) ( Table 1,  Fig 3). Additionally, panelists were asked to assign intensities of these sensory experiences with regard to an ideal blueberry. No genotype met panelists’ ideal sweetness intensity ( Table 1,  Fig 3A). In previous sensory studies with tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum L.) and strawberry ( Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne), panelists rated actual samples using the same scales and also indicated ideal sensory intensities for these fruits [ 22, 23]. This hypothetical blueberry value fell between the ideal sweetness scores (intensity gLMS scale) given for strawberry (42) and tomato (33) [ 22, 23]. This expectation that blueberry be sweeter than tomato is understandable given tomatoes’ savory role in culinary preparation. However, the expectation that a strawberry be sweeter than a blueberry is curious given their similar uses as fresh fruit and dessert, and blueberry’s typically higher sugar content compared to strawberry. On average, sourness was the lowest intensity experienced, but exhibited the most variation between berries among the three sensory intensities rated ( Table 1,  Fig 3B). The sourest berry, ‘Vireo,’ was twice the ideal sourness (36). ‘Chickadee’ came closest to having the ideal intensity of sourness for blueberries according to this group of panelists, and was rated just above average in overall liking. The genotype with the highest overall liking score, ‘Scintilla,’ was close to the ideal indicated sourness intensity (15;  S2 Table). The congruence with overall liking, measured sourness intensity, and ideal sourness intensity suggests that panelists are indeed able to numerically express ideal sourness intensity. Intensity of blueberry flavor exhibited the least variation in sample scores compared to perceived sweetness and sourness (1.5-fold variation;  Table 1), and like sweetness, also fell short of the panelists’ ideal flavor intensity ( Table 1,  Fig 3C). The lack of variation in flavor intensity among the 19 genotypes assessed may be due to poor panelist understanding of flavor (as opposed to taste), limited genetic diversity in flavor in the germplasm, or a combination of the two. Panel favorite ‘Scintilla’ had an above average flavor intensity (29;  S2 Table), second only to ‘Kestrel’ (32), which was also highly rated by panelists (24). In comparison, the ideal flavor intensities desired for strawberry and tomato were higher (45) [ 22, 23]. Given the quantities of volatiles reported in the literature for these three fruits via comparable collection methods and expressed in in ng gFW -1 h -1, blueberry emits fifteen times the volatiles compared to tomato, and about a third the volatiles emitted by strawberry [ 22, 23]. While this might explain why the panelists would expect an ideal strawberry to be more flavorful, it draws into question why the flavor intensity of an ideal tomato be higher than an ideal blueberry. The discrepancy between consumer ideals and actual products highlights the potential for breeding blueberry sensory attributes that exceed consumer expectations, ideally leading to increased repeat purchases, and expanded market potential for the crop. The perceivable sensory differences among blueberry genotypes indicate that the previously reported diversity in biochemical makeup [ 12– 19] is sufficiently variable to extract meaningful information relating to the sensory experience. Overall liking of blueberries is strongly related to favorable texture, intensities of sweetness, flavor and sourness To determine which sensory predictors measured in this study influenced the overall blueberry eating experience, pair-wise correlations between each panelists’ scores of overall liking, favorability of texture, and the sensory intensity measures of sweetness, sourness, and flavor were individually fitted ( S3 Table;  Fig 4A–4F shown are select significant relationships). These four measures were all individually significant contributors to the response overall liking of blueberry fruit ( P<0.001) with the best fit indicated by sweetness intensity (R 2 = 0.70), followed by liking of berry texture (R 2 = 0.68), and flavor intensity (R 2 = 0.63). Sourness intensity had a significantly negative relationship with overall liking (R 2 = 0.55). Overall liking increased as the texture was perceived as better, and as the fruit was more intensely sweet and flavorful. The relationship between overall liking and texture liking is a reasonable finding, as these are both rated on hedonic scales. If a panelist likes the berry, it is partially because they like that berry’s texture: the somatosensory experience of texture is inseparable from the rest of the sensory components [ 4]. That texture is such a strong sensory component of overall liking is at odds with our previously published blueberry perception study, in which flavor attributes were most indicative of purchase [ 3]. In the perception study, descriptions of poor blueberry texture, such as mealiness, seediness, and toughness, were the most powerful in decreasing blueberry purchase likelihood, but positive texture attributes (firmness, crispness) were generally perceived as neutral. This highlights a potential downside to consumer perception surveys: it is difficult to cognate the mechanical value of texture until it is experienced firsthand. Even then, texture is a complex experience that is difficult to parcel from other sensory components [ 4] which is the reasoning behind the use of the hedonic scale rather than some assemblage of descriptive intensity factors such as juiciness, firmness, and mealiness [ 24]. As the sourness of blueberry samples was perceived as more intense, the pleasure derived from the fruit decreased ( Fig 4C). Blueberry sweetness (Y) and sourness (X) were negatively correlated with each other (R 2 = 0.70,  P<0.0001,  Fig 4E) as expected due to mixture suppression of sweet and sour tastes [ 25, 26]. When the panel means (as opposed to individual panelist scores) of sensory measures were fit against each other, fits for texture, sourness, and flavor against overall liking went down (R 2 = 0.14, R 2 = 0.35, R 2 = 0.22, respectively,  P<0.0001) while the fit for sweetness went up (R 2 = 0.81,  P<0.0001). Changes in fit may be due to the elimination of personal bias for these sensory parameters when averages were used rather than individuals’ associations between ratings. This may also be due to the large range of the gLMS scales, and the variation in range use of the scales among panelists, which is accounted for when each panelist can be treated as a random effect. The relationship between flavor intensity (X) and texture liking (Y) was also linear (R 2 = 0.73,  P<0.0001,  Fig 4F). It is common for interaction to occur between olfaction and somatosensation [ 4]. A significant relationship between blueberry flavor intensity and juiciness has been previously reported [ 27]. These correlations may be a result of optimally ripe samples, where texture is ideal and flavor compounds are at a maximum [ 15]. In a peach ( Prunus persica L.) QTL mapping and fruit quality study, a locus controlling peach melting, firmness and several volatiles was found, suggesting either pleiotropic effects of a single gene upon these traits or an additional linkage locus [ 28]. However, the relationship between flavor and texture may be created post-fruit consumption. Differences have been found between whey protein gels of varying texture and their perceived flavor intensity, despite the fact that release of flavor compounds from the matrix was not changed due to gel texture differences [ 29], demonstrating the potential integration of these two discrete senses upon each other in the brain [ 4]. In considering primary biochemical drivers of the sensory experiences, it is known that sugars and acids are principal contributors to taste [ 30]. A commonly used indicator of fruit quality has been the ratio of soluble solids to titratable acidity of fruit. While SSC/TA was significantly correlated to overall liking, sweetness, and sourness in linear pairwise regressions, the individual measures SSC and TA explained more of the variance in sensory ratings than did the ratio ( S3 Table). Overall liking was significantly positively correlated to concentrations of all sugars (best fit was Total Sugars, R 2 = 0.20,  P<0.001,  Fig 4G) and negatively with increasing TA (R 2 = 0.14,  P<0.001,  Fig 4H). Perceived sweetness is best explained by measures of sugars, including Fructose (R 2 = 0.27,  P<0.0001  Fig 4I), Total Sugars (R 2 = 0.26,  P<0.0001), SSC (R 2 = 0.25,  P<0.0001), and Glucose (R 2 = 0.20,  P<0.0001). Although still significant, measures of Sucrose are much less suitable as a predictor of sweetness (R 2 = 0.08,  P = 0.0004). As in previous reports [ 31, 32], Sucrose was present in very low amounts in the blueberry fruit surveyed, accounting for 1.6% of total sugars on average ( S2 Table). Sweetness was negatively correlated with TA (R 2 = 0.27,  P<0.0001,  Fig 4J), while TA explained over half of perceived sourness (R 2 = 0.56,  P<0.0001,  Fig 4K). An even better explanatory variable of perceived sourness was pH (R 2 = 0.59,  P<0.0001,  Fig 4L). Of the top five best liked samples, pH measures ranged from 3.3 to 3.6, compared to the study range of 2.8 to 4.4 ( S2 Table). However, more sugar does not always equate to more sweetness. Of the top five sweetest samples, none of these is in the top five for total sugar concentration ( S2 Table). In fact, ‘Primadonna’ (2014 H1—first harvest from Haines City in 2014) was the fourth sweetest berry among all thirty panels, and had a below average concentration total sugars. Conversely, ‘Emerald,’ (2013, H2), which had the highest total sugar concentration of all samples assayed (140.4 mg gFW -1 vs. average = 100.5 mg gFW -1), scored below average for sweetness intensity (21 vs. average 23) and liking (20 vs. average 22), underscoring the sensory importance of many other compounds in the fruit matrix. This ‘Emerald’ sample was very acidic (pH = 3.0, average = 3.5; TA = 0.91, average = 0.41), while the ‘Primadonna’ sample was sub-acid (pH = 3.6; TA = 0.18). Additionally, in both strawberry and tomato fruits, aromatic volatile compounds have been discovered to contribute to sweetness beyond the effects of sugars [ 22, 23]. This introduces the possibility of breeding for a biochemical recipe that does not exclusively involve increasing sugar content and lowering acidity. From these results, it is clear that panelists can discern genotypic variation in blueberry sensory components. However, delivering and marketing a blueberry product of premium quality, as defined by excellent texture, increased sweetness and flavor, and a balance of sourness, would necessitate identifying biochemical quality measures to benchmark specially marketed products such that they would consistently meet consumer expectations of a higher quality berry. This would only be realistic if certain genotypes could be identified where these biochemical components do not suffer from high variation due to environmental effects, thereby yielding reliable fruit quality. Relating the human experience to biochemical makeup Since overall enjoyment of blueberries has been highly correlated with sweetness, flavor acceptability and blueberry-like flavor intensity ( Fig 4) [ 14], and the sensory experience is influenced by numerous compounds released upon blueberry mastication, an appropriate model to detect complex connections between these disciplines was sought. In this study we used a PLS model to explain the hedonic and sensory components associated with eating blueberries using biochemical measurements [ 33– 37]. Texture liking, for which no physical measure was made, was included in the explanatory variables, along with glucose, fructose, sucrose, TA, pH, and 52 volatile compounds, to explain the sensory components of overall liking, sweetness, sourness, and flavor. When texture liking was included, the model explained 70% of variation in the sensory measures. Upon removing texture liking from the model, 64% of the variation in sensory components was explained ( Table 2). The 6% increase in variation explained accounted for by texture is expected by the large contribution of texture liking to overall liking and flavor of blueberry fruit ( Fig 4A). The variation of each sensory aspect explained by the six highest and lowest biochemical effectors is shown in  Table 2. The sensory parameter with the most variation explained by biochemical measures was sourness, with 78% accounted for. The monosaccharide fructose was the most impactful effector of overall liking, sweetness and flavor, and detractor from sourness ( Table 2). Its structural isomer glucose was also important in overall liking, sweetness, and flavor, but did not act to decrease sourness in this model. Fructose has been shown to be perceivably sweeter than glucose at equivalent concentrations [ 38– 40]. It is known that the human sweetness receptor on the tongue undergoes varying conformational changes depending on the structure of the ligand that binds (e.g. fructose vs. glucose vs. artificial sweeteners), resulting in different degrees of perceived sweetness [ 41]. In the present study, sucrose did not contribute significantly to sweetness as it only accounts for approximately 1–2% of total blueberry sugars. Acidity as determined by pH also appeared to be important in all four sensory components assayed. TA was not associated with flavor but is a strong factor in the other three sensory components. Flavor had a strong relationship with fructose and pH, in addition to several volatiles also implicated in contributing to sweetness and sourness in this dataset ( Table 2). The influence of pH and fructose on the olfactory-mediated response of flavor may be due to difficultly for untrained consumer panelists to isolate flavor from taste. However, this could also be due to the integration of aromatics with taste in the fruit matrix and the brain; for example, pH can affect volatile emission in fruit tissue [ 42], and relative concentrations of compounds in solution can dramatically change their associated olfactory responses [ 43]. Interactions between taste and retronasal olfaction are also known to occur. For example, sweetness and other aromas have been shown to be enhanced depending on the combination of taste molecules and volatile molecules present in an ingested sample [ 6, 22, 23]. In the discussion of volatile compounds and their contribution to flavor, it should be noted that the specific aromatic descriptors of volatiles in the literature are limited in that concentration and interaction with the fruit matrix may alter sensory perception [ 43– 45]. Some of the volatiles included in the PLS model contribute to the explanation of more than one sensory descriptor as rated by the panelists. Volatile compounds β-caryophyllene oxide (CAS#1139-30-6) and 2-heptanone (CAS#110-43-0) are linked to an increase in overall liking, sweetness, and flavor in blueberries. β-Caryophyllene oxide has been identified in black currant ( Ribes nigrum L.), black ground pepper ( Piper nigrum L.), and hops ( Humulus lupulus L.) and has been described orthonasally as “spicy” [ 46– 48]. ‘Meadowlark’ constitutes samples with the highest concentrations of 2-heptanone, distributed across all years (2012–2014) and all locations (UFPSREU, Haines City, Waldo). 2-Heptanone has also been reported in strawberry, apple ( Malus domestica Borkh.), and passion fruit ( Passiflora edulis Sims) [ 49– 51]. Another pervasive compound, neral (CAS#106-26-3), is positively associated with liking and sweetness, but negatively associated with sourness. Neral is a geometric isomer of geranial, which together are recognized as ‘citral,’ and characteristic of lemon ( Citrus × limon L.) [ 52]. Although geranial is also found in these blueberry samples, it was not identified as contributing to the sensory experience, highlighting the point that enantiomers may have significantly different sensory qualities. The favorability of the fruit was negatively associated with several volatile compounds in this study, including two compounds that have often been associated with typical blueberry flavor in literature, linalool (CAS#78-70-6) and 1,8-cineole (CAS#470-82-6) [ 19,  53– 55]. In this PLS model, linalool and 1,8-cineole detracted from overall liking, sweetness and flavor. 1,8-Cineole also contributed to sourness. 1,8-Cineole was highest in samples which were harvested in the earliest part of the season (late March). Interestingly, linalool was highest in samples which were all harvested from the Waldo location (high tunnel production).  E-2-Hexenal (CAS#6728-26-3), which has been described orthonasally as fresh, leafy green, floral, sweet, and pungent [ 44], also reduced liking and sweetness in the model, and was a positive effector of sourness. This compound constituted the largest proportion of total volatile emission, and was especially high in early season selections during 2014. Two volatiles that were unique to explaining increases in blueberry flavor intensity were 2-undecanone (CAS#112-12-9) and 3-methyl-1-butanol (CAS#123-51-3). 2-Undecanone was characteristic of the variety ‘Scintilla.’ It has been previously reported in red raspberries ( Rubus idaeus L.) and blackberries ( Rubus spp.  hyb), and has been described orthonasally as floral and citrusy [ 56, 57]. 3-Methyl-1-butanol–a sweet, fruity, brandy-like compound found in tequila ( Agave tequilana Weber), and grape ( Vitis vinifera L.) and apple wines–was produced in the largest quantities by ‘Farthing’ and ‘Scintilla’ [ 58– 60]. Increasing these two volatile compounds in the breeding germplasm could result in increased flavor intensity, as desired by blueberry consumers. This model could be used to target up- and downregulation of particular compounds in blueberries for increased consumer favor. To develop a better tasting berry based on this model, breeders may want to consider targeting pH between 3.2 and 3.5, increasing sugars, particularly fructose, β-caryophyllene oxide, 2-heptanone, neral, 2-undecanone, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and decreasing linalool, 1,8-cineole, and  E-2-hexenal. However, also of consideration to the breeder is the reliability of biochemical production of these compounds in fruit, as determined by genetics, environment, and their interaction effects. G×E Effects To further develop a realistic set of breeding targets for improved flavor, a G×E study was conducted to quantify the variation exhibited by these target compounds and to indicate which were most available to manipulate genetically. Six of the genotypes (‘Emerald,’ ‘Endura,’ ‘Farthing,’ ‘Meadowlark,’ ‘Primadonna,’ and ‘Scintilla’) used to sample biochemical and sensory variance were grown in three locations and harvested over the course of three years to determine the effects of genotype and environmental variables on taste and flavor compounds. Volatile emission has previously been shown to vary by location in strawberry, ginger ( Zingiber officinale Roscoe), thyme ( Thymus daenensis Celak and  Thymus vulgaris L.), and peaches [ 28, 61– 64] and between open field and protected structures in strawberry, raspberry, and tomato [ 10, 61, 65]. Geographical and climactic differences of the locations in this study are listed in  S4 Table. Blueberry plants grown at the Waldo location were grown under high tunnels while plants at UFPSREU and Haines City were open field. To determine the source of variance for the biochemical effectors of flavor ( Table 2), a linear model in which E was broken down into Location (L) and Year (Y) was constructed. The significance and percent variance for each term in the model are listed in  Table 3. All compounds besides hexanoic acid were significant for genotypic variation ( P<0.0001). In contrast, methyl hexanoate (CAS#106-70-7) and linalool exhibited only effects of G ( P<0.01). 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one (CAS#110-93-0) had the highest amount of variation sourced from genetics (89%). 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one has been shown to be a conversion product from the terpenoid citral (isomeric mixture of neral and geranial) by citral lyase in  Penicillium digitatum spores [ 66], and does indeed have a significant negative pair-wise relationship to both neral and geranial in this blueberry biochemical study ( P = 0.03,  P<0.0001, respectively). Other compounds that had large genetic influence were 2-undecanone (82%), 2-nonanone (CAS#821-55-6) (80%), linalool (70%), and 1,8-cineole (51%). Formation of 2-undecanone is mediated by 3-oxolaurate decarboxylase [ 67]. Like 2-undecanone, linalool and 1,8-cineole also come from the terpenoid pathway and are both preceded by substrate geranyl diphosphate [ 68]. The high degree of genetic control over these compounds makes them ideal targets for breeding for improved blueberry flavor, and knowledge of their enzymatic and genetic regulation opens the potential for marker development. Seven biochemical measures had significant G×L×Y interaction effects, including fructose and TA ( Table 3). Glucose varied most based on berry genotype (19%) and year of harvest (16%). Fructose had a higher contribution of genetics at nearly a third. pH varied simply by location (30%) and year (6%) with no interaction effects. 1-Hexanol (CAS#111-27-3) and  E-2-Hexenal were the compounds most variable from year to year.  E-2-Hexenal has also been reported as having strong environmental effects in peach [ 28]. These compounds would make poor breeding targets due to their susceptibility to environmental variation. Although β-caryophyllene oxide exhibited L×G effects, 71% of its variation can be accounted for through genotypic effects alone ( Table 3). This oxidized sesquiterpenoid is the main product of a terpene synthase, which produces a number of volatile sesquiterpenes. Badoc and Lamarti [ 69] indicated that tropical climates favor the formation of oxidized forms of volatiles in dill ( Anethum graveolens L.), and in agreement, β-caryophyllene oxide concentrations increase as latitudes decrease in this study, although further studies would have to be conducted to confirm this correlation. 2-Heptanone also exhibited interaction effects of L, G, and Y, yet 54% of variation in its emission appears to be controlled genetically. Conversely, neral emission is less genetically controlled (18%) and is equally affected by L×G interaction effects (15%). These analyses suggest the potential to focus breeding resources on upregulating β-caryophyllene oxide and 2-heptanone rather than compounds such as neral. After focusing on compound performance across locations and years, we determined the significant variability of compounds for each genotype ( P<0.01) in the event that less predictable compounds could be prone to tighter biochemical regulation in a particular genetic background ( Table 4). ‘Emerald’ and ‘Scintilla’ had significant variability in the least number of compounds. ‘Endura’ was significantly variable for the highest number of compounds. ‘Endura’ was the only genotype to significantly vary for fructose concentration. Glucose was not variable in ‘Farthing’ and ‘Scintilla.’ ‘Scintilla’ also did not vary for pH or TA. All other genotypes had significant genotypic effects on pH. Based on these results, ‘Scintilla’ would be a good individual to use in crosses aimed at incorporating genetically regulated flavor compounds into new progeny because compounds tend to be predictable regardless of year and location, coupled with high sensory scores for the cultivar.","Breeding for a subjective goal such as flavor is challenging, as many blueberry cultivars are grown worldwide, and identifying breeding targets relating to blueberry flavor biochemistry that have a high degree of genetic control and low environmental variability are priorities. A variety of biochemical compounds and physical characters induce the sensory responses of taste, olfaction, and somatosensation, all of which interact to create what is perceived flavor. The goal of this study was to identify the flavor compounds with a larger genetic versus environmental component regulating their expression over an array of cultivars, locations, and years. Over the course of three years, consumer panelists rated overall liking, texture, sweetness, sourness, and flavor intensity of 19 southern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum hybrids) genotypes in 30 sensory panels. Significant positive correlations to overall liking of blueberry fruit (P<0.001) were found with sweetness (R2 = 0.70), texture (R2 = 0.68), and flavor (R2 = 0.63). Sourness had a significantly negative relationship with overall liking (R2 = 0.55). The relationship between flavor and texture liking was also linear (R2 = 0.73, P<0.0001) demonstrating interaction between olfaction and somatosensation. Partial least squares analysis was used to identify sugars, acids, and volatile compounds contributing to liking and sensory intensities, and revealed strong effects of fructose, pH, and several volatile compounds upon all sensory parameters measured. To assess the feasibility of breeding for flavor components, a three year study was conducted to compare genetic and environmental influences on flavor biochemistry. Panelists could discern genotypic variation in blueberry sensory components, and many of the compounds affecting consumer favor of blueberries, such as fructose, pH, β-caryophyllene oxide and 2-heptanone, were sufficiently genetically controlled that allocating resources for their breeding is worthwhile.",NaN,"['flavor', 'Table', 'liking', 'flavor intensity', 'sensory', 'blueberry', 'Fig', 'sweetness', 'sourness', 'intensity']","[‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’, ’, ’, ‘, ’, ’, ’, ‘, ’, 4A–4F, P<0.001, 4F, whey protein, TA (R 2, Fructose (R 2, Glucose (R 2, TA (R 2, ‘, ’ (, ‘, ’ (2013, H2, ‘, TA, ‘, ’, TA, CAS#110-43, “spicy”, 46–, ‘, ’, UFPSREU, CAS#106, ’, CAS#78-70, CAS#470, CAS#112-12-9, CAS#123-51-3, ’, ‘, ’, 58– 60, G×E, ‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’ ‘, ’, UFPSREU, P<0.0001, CAS#106-70-7, G ( P<0.01, CAS#110-93, CAS#821-55-6, 3-oxolaurate decarboxylase [ 67, G×L×, TA ( Table 3, Badoc, Lamarti [ 69], ’, ‘Endura, ’, ‘Endura, ’, ‘, ’, ’ ‘Scintilla’]",[],[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase

During Stage I—here, approximately from 0 to 30 DAFB—growth occurs by cell division and expansion in the entire pericarp. During Stage II (here, 31–45 DAFB) the endocarp (the innermost pericarp layer) and the seed develop, while the fruit mass and surface area remain essentially constant. Stage II was identified based on the second lag phase in the growth curve ( Figure 1a) and on the beginning and completion of hardening of the endocarp (not shown). In Stage III (here, 52–94 DAFB) fruit mass and surface area increase rapidly, primarily due to the expansion of mesocarp cells. Here, maxima of surface area expansion rate occurred in Stage I at approximately 24 DAFB (39.0 mm 2 day −1) and in Stage III at approximately 66 DAFB (60.0 mm 2 day −1), as calculated from the data of surface area development in  Figure 1a. As previously observed, 6 cuticle mass per fruit increased rapidly during Stage I, the rate of CM deposition reaching a maximum of approximately 117 µg per fruit per day about 24 DAFB in the present study. Thereafter, the CM deposition rate steeply decreased in Stage II and further Stage III, averaging only 5.4 µg per fruit per day at 66 DAFB ( Figure 1b), the time of the highest surface expansion rate. Tissue samples for RNA-seq analyses were collected in one or two biological replicates as indicated in  Figure 1c. In total, cDNA generated from 24 individual samples representing 14 developmental time points was sequenced. The procedure and outcome of the sequencing, pre-processing, and assembly are outlined in  Figure 2. Details on the pre-processing and assembly protocols, and the raw read and pre-processing results per sample are available as  Supplementary Method S1,  Supplementary Table S2 and  Supplementary Fig. S1. Directional sequencing of 24 indexed samples in pools of four yielded a total of 665 million raw reads of 100 bp length each. After pre-processing and  de novo assembly we obtained a final set of 68 101 assembled contigs of 107–14 149 bp length. Mapping of trimmed reads to the  de novo assembled contigs To estimate the abundance of the mRNA represented by each contig in each sample, raw reads were trimmed to 65 nucleotides and remapped to the 68 101 contigs. Contigs were then separated into three groups based on the mapped read counts, results of BLASTn analyses and contig lengths. Group 1 (34 695 contigs or 51% of all contigs) consists of ‘high abundance’ contigs, or sequences represented by at least 30 reads per sample or 75 reads in all 24 samples; contigs shorter than 200 bp were excluded. Group 2 (32712 contigs or 48%) consists of ‘low-abundance’ contigs, or sequences with read counts below the set threshold of 30 reads per sample or 75 reads in all 24 samples. Group 3 (694 contigs or 1%) consists of probable contamination from viral, bacterial or other sources (data not shown). The assembled sequences in Groups 1 and 2 are available as  Supplementary Data S1 and  S2. The mapping results for all groups and samples are presented in  Supplementary Table S3. For Group 1, the complete data on individual contigs including contig lengths, total read counts and BLAST results are available as  Supplementary Table S4. Table 1 summarizes statistics on contig length, GC content and other characteristics for Groups 1–3. Compared to other published plant transcriptomes that were assembled  de novo from Illumina reads, the N50 value (1413 bp) and the average length (740 bp) of the Group 1 contigs are among the highest values reported. 54 Considering that we used single reads instead of paired-end reads, this indicates that the chosen assembly strategy (pre-processing of the raw reads followed by multi-k-mer assembly using Velvet and super-assembly using CAP3) was successful. However, as with any  de novo assembly, our assembly has its shortcomings. For instance, sometimes two or more contigs without a sequence overlap were most likely derived from a single transcript, as suggested by the alignment of the contigs to their shared best hit. The length distribution of contigs in Group 1 was somewhat biased towards the contigs shorter than 600 bp, although a considerable number of the contigs were 2000 to 5000 bp long or longer ( Figure 3 and  Table 1). This length distribution is similar to that of the  P. persica predicted transcripts ( Figure 3). A total of 330 million reads (49.6% of all reads) mapped to Group 1 contigs, 99.8% of them being unique matches; 16.0% mapped to Group 3 and only 0.4% to Group 2 ( Table 1 and  Supplementary Table S3). Averaging over the 24 samples, 75% (s.d. 8%) of the mappable reads mapped to Group 1 contigs, 24% (s.d. 8%) to Group 3 and 0.5% (s.d. 0.1%) to Group 2 ( Figure 4). Gene expression levels were estimated by calculating FPKM values (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads 51), which normalize the raw read counts against the length of the contig and the total number of mappable reads in each sample. Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the FPKM values for all Group 1 contigs in two replicate samples, available for eight developmental stages, ranged from 0.900 (38 DAFB) to 0.996 (66 DAFB), meeting the proposed standard for RNA-seq experiments. 55 MA plots, created in the Mayday workbench using the FPKM values analogous to the method proposed by Wang  et al., 56 indicated only minor differences between replicates ( Supplementary Fig. S2). Annotation of the assembled contigs: BLAST searches, gene ontology analyses and InterProScan To detect similarities between the sweet cherry contigs and proteins in other plants, two independent BLAST searches were performed. First, the contigs were aligned against sweet cherry, peach, apple, grape vine and  Arabidopsis predicted peptides via the platform PAVE. 38 The second round of BLAST searches were performed against the SwissProt, RefSeq and nr databases via the platform Blast2GO (B2G). 47 The results of these BLAST searches against the two sets of databases are referred to as ‘PAVE hits’ and ‘B2G hits’, respectively. Results are shown for contigs that were detected at similar abundance levels in both biological replicates, where applicable. This subset of contigs covered 86% of all Group 1 contigs and was termed Group 1F (see also the section on ‘Materials and methods’). In Group 1F, 23 603 contigs (79%) had PAVE hits, while 74% of the contigs had B2G hits ( Table 2 and  Supplementary Table S4). Notably, several contigs without significant hits to  P. persica predicted peptides and complete ORFs sometimes had highly significant hits against the  P. persica genomic sequence. Although potentially functional, 57 such non-coding transcripts were not analyzed further. To estimate how well the assembled contigs represent expression of real genes and not just random sequences, a brief summary is given on the Group 1F contigs containing full-length ORFs. A full-length ORF was identified in 7628 contigs (25% of all), when the presence of a full-length ORF was predicted based on the alignment of the contig to its most similar PAVE hit: complete coverage from start to stop codon indicated a full-length ORF. More contigs are likely to be predicted to include full-length ORFs, if a different ORF finding procedure is applied. Here, the contigs with predicted full-length ORFs in Group 1F were 247–12 130 bp long (median 1563 bp;  Supplementary Table S4). Ninety-six percent of them had best hits against  P. persica, 77% had SwissProt hits, 97% had InterProScan matches and 82% had GO terms assigned ( Table 2 and  Supplementary Table S4). The InterProScan matches and GO terms assigned were largely consistent with each other and with the functions suggested by the best hits ( Supplementary Table S4).The assigned GO terms covered a wide range of processes, functions and cellular compartments from ‘cell division’ (171 contigs) and ‘chloroplast’ (1042 contigs) to ‘transcription factor activity’ (300 contigs) and ‘response to stimulus’ (2424 contigs) ( Figure 5 and  Supplementary Table S5). Based on sequence comparison with 1521 predicted transcription factors of  P. persica genome, 58 1009 contigs representing transcription factors in Group 1F were identified, 410 of which contained a full-length ORF ( Supplementary Table S4). Of the 58 transcription factor families in  P. persica, 54 were represented in Group 1F, and full-length ORFs were identified from 50 families. Among the contigs with full-length ORF, the largest transcription factor family was bZIP (33 contigs, or 8.0% of the 410 predicted transcription factors). Assuming that the distribution of TFs in sweet cherry genome is similar to the one in peach genome, the bZIP family is over-represented in fruit (51 genes or 3.4% of all TFs in peach). In peach genome, the largest transcription factor family is bHLH (130 members or 8.5% of all transcription factors); in the sweet cherry fruit transcriptome, bHLH family ranks fourth (26 contigs or 6.3%). Other TF families with at least 20 contigs with predicted full-length ORFs in Group 1F were MYB (30), C2H2 (26), WRKY (24), ERF (22) and C3H (20). Exocarp-specific transcripts are related to epidermis development and stress responses To systematically identify exocarp-specific transcripts, contigs with normalized FPKM values in the mesocarp samples below 1% were considered as ‘exocarp-specific’. Normalized FPKM values per sample were calculated after setting the sum of FPKM values in all 24 samples to 100%. According to this criterion, 1162 contigs in Group 1F were exocarp-specific, 219 of which contained a full-length ORF ( Supplementary Table S4). Gene ontology term enrichment analyses assigned several known epidermis-related processes and functions to the exocarp-specific contigs. For instance, in the category ‘biological process’, the most over-represented GO terms (false discovery rate <0.05) were ‘wax biosynthetic process, ‘cutin biosynthetic process’ and ‘response to salicylic acid stimulus’ ( Table 3). Wax and cutin biosyntheses are essential for cuticle formation, whereas salicylic acid signaling plays a major role in pathogen defense. The specific, over-represented biological processes assigned to the exocarp-specific contigs may be summarized as follows: (i) epidermis development; (ii) responses to biotic and abiotic stresses; (iii) hormone responses; and (iv) secondary metabolism ( Table 3 and  Supplementary Table S6). In the category ‘molecular function’, the most specific GO terms assigned to the contigs with full-length ORF were ‘carboxylesterase’, ‘transcription factor’, ‘monooxygenase’, ‘fatty acid elongase’ and ‘polyol transmembrane transporter’ activities ( Table 3 and  Supplementary Table S6). In the category ‘cellular component’, the only over-represented GO term was ‘apoplast’. Collectively, the GO term enrichment analyses confirmed that our ‘exocarp-specific’ contigs with full-length ORFs realistically reflect genes with preferential or specific expression in the fruit skin. The GO term enrichment analysis was repeated on all 1162 exocarp-specific contigs identified in Group 1F ( Supplementary Table S6). The results were in line with the results for the contigs with predicted full-length ORFs. Expectedly though, the number of over-represented GO terms were larger for the 1162 contigs (253) than for the 219 contigs (91) ( Supplementary Table S6). The most specific over-represented GO terms not identified among the 219 full-length ORF contigs included ‘protein autophosphorylation’, ‘glucosinolate’,’ cyanide’ and ‘terpenoid biosynthetic’ processes. Forty most abundant sweet cherry contigs and their expression patterns Next, we examined the forty most highly represented contigs in the sweet cherry skin transcriptome ( Table 4; details on the sequences in  Supplementary Table S4). The most abundant contig by far was Pa_24402 with a FPKM sum of 523 781 over the 24 samples, or 4.2 million mapped reads total. Its best B2G hit was GenBank accession P50694, a glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase or thaumatin-like protein, the most abundant soluble protein in the ripe sweet cherry fruit. 59 Five other ‘Top 40’ contigs also had B2G hits to published  P. avium sequences: Pa_11846 ( P. avium allergen 1), Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid transfer protein), Pa_00414 (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1), Pa_21625 (thaumatin-like protein) and Pa_03818 (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase). Altogether, based on the best hit descriptions, 11 of the 40 most abundant contigs represent proteins likely related to abiotic and biotic stresses, such as oxidative stress and responses to pathogens. Also, three further contigs described as putative transport proteins may also be associated with defense responses such as metallothionein-like proteins 60 and lipid transport protein. 61 The latter are predominantly expressed in surface tissues, 61 including citrus and tomato fruit. 26,  27 While relevant in constitutive and acute stress responses, many stress defense proteins were proposed to have other, developmental functions as well. For instance, Pa_10497 is a tentative  S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proenzyme, the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines, essential for stress responses and growth. 62 The other Top 40 transcripts encode cell wall structural proteins and expansins (eight contigs), proteins involved in protein biosynthesis or turnover (three contigs), enzymes of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (two contigs) and proteins related to cytoskeleton, gluconeogenesis, photosynthesis or unknown functions (one contig each) ( Table 4). Nine transcripts produced no hits in the BLASTx searches against SwissProt, RefSeq or nr databases with the applied settings. In addition to the above mentioned lipid transfer proteins, many of these Top 40 contigs from sweet cherry fruit were homologous to abundant transcripts in other fruits. For instance, abundant metallothionein expression was also reported in other fruits including banana 63 and pineapple. 64 Furthermore, several best hit descriptions were similar to the annotations of the most abundant transcripts in the peel transcriptome of pomegranate. 28 Common best hit descriptions included metallothionein, tubulin, lipid transfer protein, catalase, cysteine protease and  S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. Functions of the Top 40 contigs in sweet cherry transcriptome were further predicted by means of GO analyses. Of the 136 GO terms assigned to the Top 40 contigs, three cell wall-related terms were over-represented as compared to all Group 1F contigs ( Supplementary Table S7). Other relevant GO terms in the category ‘cellular component’ were associated with vacuole, plasma membrane or plastid. In the category ‘biological process’, the most relevant GO terms included ‘response to stimulus’ and ‘developmental processes’, while in the category ‘molecular function’, the most relevant GO terms were ‘binding’ and ‘hydrolase activity’ (Supplementary  Table S7). Global expression patterns in developing sweet cherry fruit: detection of five main patterns of gene expression We identified expression patterns or clusters on the whole transcriptome scale and focused on the exocarp-specific genes within selected clusters. Two partitional clustering algorithms implemented in the Mayday workbench 52 were used: The neural gas (NG) algorithm was applied to separate Group 1F contigs in five large clusters, followed by quality threshold (QT) clustering for more detailed expression patterns (see the section on ‘Materials and methods’). Neural gas clusters NG1 to NG5 contained 3053 to 8881 contigs each ( Supplementary Fig. S3a). Each NG cluster had a characteristic average or centroid expression pattern: elevated expression during Stages I and II (NG1), in the ovary shortly after flowering (0–10 DAFB; NG2), during Stage II and early Stage III (NG3), from mid-Stage II to maturity (NG4) and mainly in the mesocarp (NG5) ( Supplementary Fig. S3a and  Fig. 6a). Several over-represented GO terms were detected in each NG cluster ( Supplementary Table S8). For instance, in cluster NG2, the most specific, over-represented GO terms were related to translation, transcription and cell division. These functions are consistent with the high RNA levels in the tissue collected 3 and 10 DAFB (data not shown), reflecting the high cell division activity characteristic for this early stage of fruit development. Based on the GO analysis and the expression patterns, we expected to find the most exocarp-relevant contigs in clusters NG1, NG3 and NG4. Therefore, the following analyses concentrated on these three NG clusters. Only the GO terms in the category biological process will be considered below; the complete results are available in  Supplementary Table S8. Cluster NG1 contained 285 exocarp-specific contigs. Here, the most specific, over-represented terms were wax biosynthetic process, cutin biosynthetic process and fatty acid elongation. Other significantly over-represented, specific GO terms were (also) related to cuticle development, lipid metabolism, suberin biosynthetic process, responses to abiotic and biotic stimuli, cell-to-cell signaling and trichome differentiation. Suberin is typically present in endodermis and periderm, but not in the young fruit. Possibly, contigs annotated as related to suberin biosynthesis in fact participate in cutin biosynthesis, as suberin and cutin contain similar aliphatic monomers such as ω-hydroxy acids. 65 Cluster NG3 contained 493 exocarp-specific contigs. The most specific, over-represented GO terms here were response to salicylic acid stimulus, anthocyanin accumulation in tissues in response to ultraviolet light and response to abscisic acid stimulus ( Supplementary Table S8). Other over-represented GO terms included responses to biotic and abiotic factors, cell wall thickening and transmembrane transport, as well as terpenoid, polysaccharide and phenylpropane metabolism. In cluster NG4, the most specific, over-represented GO terms assigned to the 307 exocarp-specific contigs were response to salicylic acid stimulus, response to ethylene stimulus and response to bacterium. Other GO terms were related to protein autophosphorylation, response to biotic and abiotic factors, secondary metabolism and polyol transport. To summarize these GO term enrichment results for the three NG clusters, the most typical, exocarp-specific processes during Stages I, II, and III of the sweet cherry fruit development were cuticle formation and deposition, response to abscisic acid (ABA) and response to ethylene stimuli, respectively. Throughout the development, the exocarp is specifically engaged in defense responses to various biotic and abiotic factors. The expression data support the view that constitutive expression of defense genes in the sweet cherry exocarp protects the developing fruit and contributes to developmentally regulated resistance to pathogens. 66,  67 The results are also consistent with the view that the defense-related proteins may have other developmental roles as well. 68 Global expression patterns in developing sweet cherry fruit: identification of distinct patterns of coregulated genes The second largest QT cluster of NG3 (NG3-QT50) had a striking centroid expression pattern with maximum expression levels at the beginning of growth Stage II (31 DAFB). An exocarp-specific contig in this cluster, Pa_01687 (best B2G hit polyol transporter 5), with maximal expression from 31 to 45 DAFB ( Supplementary Fig. S3b), might be useful as a molecular marker for Stage II. This contig is interesting for its putative function in sugar transport. Pa_01687 is the best hit of  PcSOT2 (97% similarity,  e-value 0.0), a sorbitol transporter from sour cherry fruit, also highly expressed during Stage II. 83 Another putative sorbitol transporter sequence was nearly absent until 31 DAFB, but abundant thereafter to maturity (Pa_05395 in NG4-QT66). This developmental expression pattern is similar to the one of  PcSOT1, the major sorbitol transporter accounting for sugar accumulation in maturing sour cherry. 83 Like Pa_01687, the other major sorbitol transporter contig, Pa_05395 was exocarp specific ( Supplementary Fig. S3b). The predicted peptide sequences of Pa_05395 and  PcSOT1 were to 81% similar ( e-value 0.0). In the functional category cell wall metabolism, cluster NG3 includes contig Pa_03056 (NG3-QT46), homologous to a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase protein, XTH33. The abundance of the contig increased sharply 45 DAFB, and stayed at a high level until 59 DAFB, after which it was detected at a very low level only ( Supplementary Fig. S3b). The expression pattern suggests a specific role for the XTH gene in the cell wall rearrangements that preceed and accompany the increase in fruit growth rate ( Figure 1a) and softening 84 in Stage III. Exocarp-specific contigs with putative roles for cuticle formation in cluster NG3 included Pa_04929 (best hit cytochrome P450 716B2; with a total FPKM sum of 6030 a very highly abundant sequence), Pa_05584 (transhomeobox-leucine zipper protein ANL2), Pa_05276 (WAX2), Pa_06635 (ABC-transporter, WBC11) and Pa_07137 (ABC transporter). Pa_05584 was the best hit of the Arabidopsis HD-ZIP IV transcription factor gene  ANL2 (ANHOCYANINLESS2), and of the tomato  ANL2 homolog,  CD2 ( CUTIN DEFICIENT2). In  Arabidopsis and tomato, these HD-ZIP IV factor are essential regulators of cutin, wax and anthocyanin levels. 85–87 The expression pattern of Pa_05584 in sweet cherry fruit—exocarp-specific, high expression levels during stages II and III, lower but constant expression levels during Stage I—is consistent with roles in cuticular lipid and anthocyanin biosyntheses also for the sweet cherry fruit  ANL2/ CD2 homolog. In cluster NG4, with expression maxima from mid-Stage II through Stage III, the largest cluster, QT71, contained 1956 contigs with mostly increasing expression levels from 31 DAFB to maturity and highest expression levels after 66 DAFB. Interesting sequences in this cluster included the putative cell wall related contigs Pa_01792 (best hit pectin methylesterase) and Pa_07321 (xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase), tentatively active in the ripening associated softening of the fruit during Stage III. 84 In this cluster, 79 contigs represent transcription factors, such as Pa_02092 (best B2G hit NAC domain containing protein) and Pa_06479 (best B2G hit MYB75). The former contig was highly abundant throughout Stage III, while the expression of the latter one increases sharply 66 DAFB and is at maximum from 80 to 87 DAFB. Pa_06479 is the most highly abundant MYB family transcription factor sequence in the sweet cherry fruit transcriptome (total FPKM sum 6415). The predicted peptide sequence is identical with GenBank ADY15304.1, defined as R2R3-MYB transcription factor from  P. avium, and highly similar (85% similarity) with  PavMYB10, another previously identified R2R3 MYB factor sequence from sweet cherry. 88PavMYB10 was identified as a main positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the sweet cherry fruit. 88,  89 Consistent with such a function, the abundance of Pa_06479 increased with reddening of the fruit ( Supplementary Fig. S3b and  Figure 1a and 1c). The differences between the predicted amino acid sequences of Pa_06479 and  PavMYB10 are similar to the differences in varying amino-acid residues among the MYB10 protein sequences from several rosaceous species. 88 Cluster NG4-QT67, with centroid expression level elevated from 38 DAFB to maturity and an expression peak 66 DAFB, contains a putative pectate lyase, Pa_14097. With Pa_06731 (NG1-QT43), it is the most abundant pectate lyase transcript in the sweet cherry fruit transcriptome. It was the best hit of a ripening associated pectate lyase from apple (GenBank AY376878 14) and the third best hit of the ripening associated pectate lyase  PcPEL1 from sour cherry 73 (best hit of  PcPEL1 was Pa_03006, NG1-QT18; see above). Contig Pa_14097 was more expressed in the exocarp than in the mesocarp (80 DAFB exocarp, 1161±43 FPKM; mesocarp, 245 FPKM), suggesting that in sweet cherry fruit, this ripening associated pectate lyase is mostly relevant for the expansion growth of the exocarp cells. Altogether, the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022) was identified in eight contigs, four of which were also predicted to contain a full-length ORF. Other contigs relevant for the cell wall architecture in cluster NG4-QT67 include Pa_09347 (best hit expansin) and Pa_44853 (probable rhamnose biosynthetic enzyme). Both contigs share with Pa_14097 the sharp peak in expression level 66 DAFB, consistent with functions in cell wall re-arrangements that enable the rapid expansion growth at this developmental stage. 90 In addition to these cell wall-related contigs in cluster NG4-QT67, contig Pa_02283 (best hit cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthase 1) also had a sharp expression peak 66 DAFB, with lower but still elevated expression from 73 to 87 DAFB. In eukaryotic cells, CTP is required for phospholipid biosynthesis and CTP synthase is the key enzyme in the process. 91,  92 A function of the putative CTP synthase encoded by Pa_02283 in phospholipid biosynthesis in sweet cherry fruit is consistent with a high demand for membrane lipids during the maximum rate of fruit surface expansion 66 DAFB. Further contigs from cluster NG4 selected for  Table 5 encode enzymes involved in cuticular lipid biosynthesis, transcription factors and a sugar transporter. The unclustered, exocarp specific contig Pa_14729 encodes a putative glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT); its best B2G hit was GPAT6. The contig has two expression maxima, 17–24 DAFB and 66–87 DAFB. In  Arabidopsis, GPAT6 functions in cutin biosynthesis in petals and sepals. 93 The exocarp specific expression pattern with the peak during the highest rate of cuticle deposition (24 DAFB) in sweet cherry fruit is consistent with a function in the cutin biosynthetic pathway. Along these lines, the second maximum during Stage III is consistent with the low but detectable cuticle deposition rate at this late stage ( Figure 1b) and with the increased amounts of the main cutin constituents, 9(10)-hydroxy-hexadecane-1,16-dioic acid and 9(10),16-dihydroxy-hexadecanoic acid, at maturity as compared to 22 DAFB. 8 For fine resolution of expression patterns, the clusters NG1, NG3 and NG4 were subjected to QT clustering (minimum cluster size 20 contigs), resulting in 44, 51 and 71 QT clusters, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S3a). Selected QT clusters are shown in  Figure 6b. Selected contigs are listed in  Table 5 and their expression patterns are shown in  Supplementary Fig. S3b. To estimate the reliability of the expression patterns obtained using RNA-seq, we additionally determined expression levels for selected contigs in  Table 5 using RT-qPCR ( Supplementary Fig. S4). For the seven contigs, representing transcripts putatively relevant for cuticle formation, the correlation coefficients between the expression levels determined using the two methods ranged from 0.94 to 0.99 ( Supplementary Fig. S4). GO analysis detected over-represented GO terms assigned to the contigs in most of the large NG-QT clusters when compared to all Group 1F contigs. In cluster NG1-QT44 ( Figure 6b), with expression maxima from 3 to 24 DAFB, over-represented GO terms were related to the cellular components chloroplast, ribosome and cell wall, and to the biological processes translation, protein-chromophore linkage and GDP-L-fucose biosynthetic process ( Supplementary Table S8). Contigs homologous to cell wall modifying enzymes in this cluster included Pa_03454 (endo-1,4-β-glucanase), Pa_06233 (polygalacturonase), Pa_07062 (pectate lyase) and Pa_07115 (pectin methylesterase). Twenty-three of the 1363 contigs in cluster NG1-QT44 were exocarp-specific. Most of the over-represented GO terms associated with the exocarp-specific contigs were related to fatty acid metabolism. An example is the contig Pa_11433, whose best B2G hit was the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase gene  LACS1, involved in cutin and wax biosynthesis in  Arabidopsis69 ( Supplementary Table S4). Among the exocarp-specific contigs was also Pa_22147, a tentative MYB transcription factor gene with the highest similarity to the subgroup 9 of R2R3 MYB genes, known as regulators of epidermal cell differentiation and development. 70 Its expression peaked at 10–17 DAFB. A similar temporal expression pattern has Pa_11565, a contig present in mesocarp at a very low level (FPKM value 24 DAFB in exocarp 10.3%±0.3%, in mesocarp 1.4% of total FPKM). Its best B2G hit was SNAKIN-1, a constitutive defense protein 71 affecting cell division and cell wall composition in potato. 68 A  SNAKIN-1 homolog was also identified in developing tomato fruit, where it was 9.87-fold more abundant in the exocarp than in the mesocarp at the end of cell division stage. 20 In cluster NG1-QT43, with average expression pattern similar to NG-QT44 but the expression maximum shifted to 24 DAFB ( Figure 6b), the most specific, over-represented GO terms in the category biological process were folic acid metabolic process, photosynthesis and cutin biosynthetic process ( Supplementary Table S8). An example of the photosynthesis-related genes in this cluster was the Top 40 contig Pa_16626, whose best B2G hit was ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain. Cluster NG1-QT43 contained 56 exocarp-specific contigs. The most specific, over-represented GO terms assigned to the exocarp-specific contigs were related to lipid metabolism, in particular, cutin and wax biosyntheses ( Supplementary Table S8). An example is the contig Pa_06204, which is a homolog of  LACS2 in  Arabidopsis and involved in the cutin biosynthesis in sweet cherry (Declercq, 2013, unpublished data). Other exocarp-specific contigs were also homologous to genes related to cuticle formation such as  ATT1 (Pa_01043),  HTH (Pa_10336),  GPAT8 (Pa_00817),  GDSL lipase (Pa_01940),  KCS10 (Pa_01742) and the AP2/ERF family transcription factor  WIN1 (Pa_19618) ( Table 5). Most of these genes (except for the homologs of  HTH and  KCS10) were also among the ones identified previously as putatively involved in CM biogenesis in sweet cherry fruits, and their expression patterns here ( Figure 6 and  Supplementary Fig. S4B) were very similar to the ones reported. 29 A highly abundant contig in this cluster was Pa_02691, an ERF transcription factor homolog. With FPKM values of 1451 (±39) in exocarp and 150 in mesocarp 24 DAFB, the sequence was much more abundant in the exocarp than in mesocarp, but it was not strictly exocarp-specific. In the functional category cell wall modifying enzymes, the contig Pa_06731, homologous to pectate lyase, was somewhat more expressed in the exocarp than in the mesocarp, with a maximum at 24 DAFB (exocarp, 1466±14 FPKM; mesocarp 852 FPKM). The corresponding pectate lyase may be involved in cell wall loosening and rearrangement during the rapid cell fruit growth occurring at this time. The finding is in line with the expression peak of the apple pectate lyase  MdPL1 in growing apple. 72 In our transcriptome, a total of eight contigs contained the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022), four of which were predicted to represent full-length ORFs. Three of these contigs were in cluster NG1: The above mentioned Pa_07062 (NG1-QT44), Pa_06731, and, in cluster NG1-QT18, Pa_03006. The latter one had two prominent expression maxima, 24 and 66 DAFB, while the former ones were not expressed during Stage III. Interestingly, contig Pa_03006 was the best hit of a pectate lyase from sour cherry ( PcPEL1, GenBank BG319625; 98% identity), which was highly expressed during the Stage III, and only slightly upregulated during Stage I in developing sour cherry. 73 In cluster NG1-QT42, with expression maxima between 3 and 17 DAFB, the most specific, over-represented terms were related to ribosomes and translation. This is consistent with the high cell division activity characteristic for Stage I. Over-represented GO terms among the 29 exocarp-specific contigs of this cluster were carboxylesterase and tyrosine decarboxylase activities ( Supplementary Table S8,  Supplementary Table S4). All four sequences annotated with the GO term carboxylesterase activity were homologous to GDSL esterase/lipase and peaked 17 DAFB. In cluster NG1-QT39 with expression maxima 17–24 DAFB the most specific, over-represented terms were hexose biosynthetic process, fatty acid biosynthetic process and Golgi apparatus. Among the 50 exocarp-specific contigs in this cluster was one specific, over-represented GO term: transferase activity, transferring acyl groups other than amino acyl group. The seven contigs annotated with this term included Pa_14662 (best B2G hit long-chain-alcohol O-fatty-acyltransferase WSD1, wax ester synthase/acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase) and Pa_00867 (best B2G hit BAHD acyltransferase DCR, DEFECTIVE IN CUTICULAR RIDGES), the former one possibly involved in wax and the latter one in cutin biosynthesis. Notable contigs in cluster NG1-QT39 further included two putative transcription factors (an AP2 family member, Pa_00973 and an MYB family member, Pa_23194, best B2G hit MYB66), a putative (hemi)cellulase (Pa_10720) and a lipid transport protein (Pa_22556, best BG2 hit uncharacterized GPI-anchored protein). The best PAVE hit of the latter contig was another assembled sweet cherry cDNA encoding a putative lipid transport protein,  PaLTPG1 (GenBank JU090722), tentatively involved in cuticle deposition in sweet cherry fruit. 29 Other exocarp-specific, putatively cuticle-related contigs in cluster NG1-QT39 included Pa_14044 and Pa_04572. The best BG2 hit of Pa_14044 was the putative aminoacrylate hydrolase RutD from  Vitis vinifera, while the contig is also the best sweet cherry hit of the Arabidopsis protein BODYGUARD (BDG) ( e-value 10×10 −169, 61% amino-acid identity), an extracellular α/β superfamily hydrolase essential for cuticle formation. 74 Pa_14044 was the only contig in the assembled sweet cherry fruit transcriptome to contain the multi domain PLN03087, ‘BODYGUARD 1 domain containing hydrolase’ (NCBI conserved domains search 75). Contig Pa_04572, with the best B2G hit GDSL esterase/lipase LTL1, was the second best sweet cherry hit ( e-value 10 −157, 86% similarity) of the tomato CD1 protein, a GDSL lipase and putative cutin polymerase in tomato fruit epidermis. 76,  77 However, the best hit of tomato CD1 was Pa_16669 ( e-value 10 −159, 86% similarity), a member of cluster NG1-QT36 ( Supplementary Fig. S3a). Cluster NG-QT36 also contained Pa_22209, another exocarp-specific GDSL lipase/esterase homolog with a full-length ORF. In cluster NG1-QT37, over-represented GO terms were related to chloroplast. No over-represented GO terms were identified in the six exocarp-specific contigs of this cluster. A putatively cuticle-relevant, exocarp-specific contig in this cluster is Pa_08841 with the best B2G hit the ERF transcription factor SHINE2 from  Arabidopsis, and the best PAVE hit the previously identified SHINE family transcription factor  PaWINB, potentially involved in CM formation in the sweet cherry fruit. 29 In total, we identified three contigs in the sweet cherry fruit transcriptome containing a full-length ORF, which most likely represent ERF family transcription factors from the SHINE clade, previously associated with regulation of cutin and wax deposition: 78,  79 Pa_08841, Pa_02691 and Pa_19618 (the latter two were in cluster NG-QT43). The recently characterized  SlSHINE3, 80 a regulator of cuticle development in tomato fruit and ortholog of Arabidopsis  SHINE3 was most similar to Pa_08841 at the peptide level (69% positives,  e-value 3×10 −57) and to Pa_19618 at the nucleotide level (85% identity,  e-value 3×10 −32). Smaller QT clusters in NG1 also contained several interesting contigs. For instance, potentially relevant for the cell wall architecture, Pa_13423 is a putative pectin methyl esterase inhibitor, highly abundant in the fruit with a maximum expression during 24–31 DAFB (NG1-QT32). A number of other contigs also shared high sequence similarity with pectin methyl esterase inhibitors, Pa_13423 being the most abundant one (total FPKM sum 25363). Indeed, its expression was much higher than that of any pectin methyl esterase homologs in the transcriptome. The unclustered contig Pa_00883 represents a putative (hemi)cellulase, present at a high level especially, while the rate of expansion growth was high (24 and 66 DAFB). Exocarp-specific contigs with probable relevance for wax biosynthesis included Pa_00478 (best hit WAX2, or CER1), Pa_06166 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 6) and the Top 40 contig Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid-transfer protein, allergen Pru av 3) in cluster NG1-QT28, and the unclustered contig Pa_08907 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 19). Contigs Pa_08907 and Pa_06166 were, together with Pa_01742 (NG1-QT43), the only three exocarp-specific contigs in Group 1F, which contained a full-length ORF and the InterPro motif very-long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (IPR012392), essential in wax biosynthesis. Pa_08907 was present at much lower levels than the other two but, interestingly, its expression peaked at equal levels during Stage I and during Stage III, while the two major KCS transcripts were abundant mainly during Stage I. Based on the expression patterns, cluster NG1 was likely to contain most of the contigs with potential relevance to the process of our key interest, cuticle formation. Therefore, clusters NG3 and NG4 will be described in less detail than cluster NG1. In the largest QT cluster of NG3 (NG3-QT51) the most specific, over-represented GO terms included photorespiration (or oxidative photosynthetic carbon pathway), terpene biosynthetic process and ABA 8′-hydroxylase activity. The most abundant contig with the latter GO term was Pa_06858, with an expression maximum from 38 to 45 DAFB. The contig is best hit of PacCYP707A2, the most abundant ABA 8′-hydroxylase transcript in the mesocarp of developing sweet cherry fruit. 81 The expression patterns of the gene from Stage II to maturity in the exocarp of the cultivar Regina (this work) and in the mesocarp of cultivar Hongdeng 81 were very similar. The consistent expression patterns underline the importance of this ABA degrading enzyme for the development of the sweet cherry fruit. Tightly regulated expression of genes in ABA turnover may account for the previously reported low and high ABA levels before and after onset of sweet cherry fruit ripening, respectively. 81,  82","The exocarp, or skin, of fleshy fruit is a specialized tissue that protects the fruit, attracts seed dispersing fruit eaters, and has large economical relevance for fruit quality. Development of the exocarp involves regulated activities of many genes. This research analyzed global gene expression in the exocarp of developing sweet cherry (Prunus avium L., 'Regina'), a fruit crop species with little public genomic resources. A catalog of transcript models (contigs) representing expressed genes was constructed from de novo assembled short complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences generated from developing fruit between flowering and maturity at 14 time points. Expression levels in each sample were estimated for 34 695 contigs from numbers of reads mapping to each contig. Contigs were annotated functionally based on BLAST, gene ontology and InterProScan analyses. Coregulated genes were detected using partitional clustering of expression patterns.

In orange fruits, the monoterpene D-limonene accumulates at very high levels in oil glands from the peel. Drastic down-regulation of D-limonene synthase gene expression in the peel of transgenic oranges harboring a D-limonene synthase transgene in antisense (AS) configuration altered the monoterpene profile in oil glands, mainly resulting in reduced accumulation of D-limonene. This led to fruit resistance against Penicillium digitatum (Pd), Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) and other specialized pathogens. Here, we analyze resistance to pathogens in independent AS and empty vector (EV) lines, which have low, medium or high D-limonene concentrations and show that the level of resistance is inversely related to the accumulation of D-limonene in orange peels, thus explaining the need of high D-limonene accumulation in mature oranges in nature for the efficient attraction of specialized microorganism frugivores.","['Citrus', 'Volatiles', 'Monoterpene', 'Penicillium digitatum', 'Defense', 'secondary metabolism', 'D-limonene', 'Necrotroph', 'Xanthomonas Citri Subsp Citri']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN
32,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4654506\eupmc_result.json,PMC4654506,"Results Illumina sequencing and assembly of sequence reads In this study, nine cDNA libraries were constructed and subjected to Illumina deep sequencing. We obtained 337,669,638 raw reads and 319,425,972 clean reads from the three developmental-stage libraries after eliminating primer and adapter sequences and filtering out low-quality reads. We obtained 130,981 contigs from these reads. Based on the paired-end reads, these contigs were further assembled into primary unigenes using CLC Genomics Workbench (version: 6.0.4;  Table 1). Finally, using CAP3 EST, we spliced the primary unigenes a second time and obtained a transcriptome database for  S.  oblata. The  de novo assembly generated 104,691 final unigenes ( Table 1). The distribution of unigene sequence length is shown in  Fig 2. Approximately 30% of the unigenes were 401–600 bp in length, 23% were 201–400 bp, and 47% were >600 bp ( Fig 2). Unigene annotation All unigenes for  S.  oblata were searched against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) database using BlastX with a cut-off E-value of 10–5. Among these unigenes, approximately 42% showed significant similarity to known proteins in the NR database, and 29% were matched to the SwissProt database ( Table 2). In further analysis of the matching unigenes, we found that  S.  oblata unigenes were most closely matched with gene sequences from  Vitis vinifera, followed by  Solanum tuberosum,  S.  lycopersicum,  Theobroma cacao, and  Populus trichocarpa ( Fig 3). In addition to the NCBI NR and SwissProt databases,  S.  oblata unigenes were aligned with Gene Ontology (GO), eukaryoticorthologous groups of proteins (KOG), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). In total, 42% of the unigenes provided significant BLAST results; of these, approximately 84% had matches in the GO database, 45% had matches in the KOG database, and 25% had matches in KEGG ( Table 2). The significance of a BLAST search depends on the length of the query sequence; thus, short reads obtained from sequencing are rarely matched to known genes [ 38]. Approximately 23% of the unigenes we identified were short (200–400 bp), which might help to explain the proportion that did not match. In other words, these short reads generated by sequencing or assembly might have resulted in the low significance[ 25]. GO classification of unigenes We used Blast2GO to classify the functions of the predicted  S.  oblata unigenes. Of the 104,691 final unigenes, 36,967 were successfully annotated by GO assignments. The annotated unigenes were assigned into three main GO categories and 62 subcategories, and some belonged to more than one of the three categories ( Fig 4). Based on annotation against the NR database, 33,208 GO terms were assigned. The greatest proportion (~62%) was assigned to biological processes (GO: 0008150); the others were assigned to molecular functions (GO: 0005575; ~24%) or cellular components (GO: 0003674; ~14%) ( Fig 4). Among the biological processes, dominant subcategories included cellular, metabolic, and single-organism processes and response to stimulus and biological regulation were also important ( Fig 4). The large proportion of annotated unigenes involved in metabolic processes suggested that novel genes involved in pathways of secondary metabolite synthesis could be identified. Dominant subcategories of cellular components included cells, cell parts, organelles, and membranes. Molecular function subcategories with the largest numbers of annotated unigenes were catalytic activity, binding, transporter activity, and nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity ( Fig 4,  S2 File). KOG classification of unigenes The KOG database is a useful platform for functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes. Based on sequence homology, 19,956 unigenes were assigned to the KOG functional classification into 25 categories denoting their involvement in cellular processes, biochemistry and metabolism, signal transduction, and other functions ( Fig 5). Signal transduction mechanisms were dominant, and general functional prediction and posttranslational modification–protein turnover–chaperones shared a large proportion of genes ( Fig 5,  S3 File). However, 924 unigenes (4.6%) were assigned to the category of secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism, which suggests that identification of novel genes involved in secondary metabolism pathways is a promising area of study ( S3 File). Metabolic pathway assignment by KEGG The KEGG database places emphasis on biochemical pathways and provides an alternative approach to the categorization of gene function. Here, 12,388 annotated unigenes were assigned to 286 KEGG pathways ( S4 File). Metabolic pathways had the most representation (~23%), followed by biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (~13%). Several signaling pathways (AMPK, MAPK, p53) and biosynthesis pathways of important secondary metabolites (e.g. phenylpropanoid, carotenoid, flavonoid, flavone and flavonol, anthocyanin, volatile terpenoids) were represented ( S4 File). These data provide a valuable resource for further mining pathways of interest in  S.  oblata. We focused on the metabolic pathways involved in flower pigments and scents biosynthesis. Flavonoids are primary compounds affecting the formation of flower or fruit color, and three pathways are involved in flavonoid metabolism: the anthocyanin, flavonoid, and flavone/flavonol biosynthetic pathways [ 39]. Among these pathways, 55 unigenes (average length,1130 bp) were associated with flower pigment synthesis, including 16 unigenes annotated to anthocyanin biosynthesis, 31 unigenes annotated to flavonoid biosynthesis, and 14 unigenes annotated to the flavone/flavonol biosynthetic pathway ( S5 File). Further analysis revealed that nine unigenes were between 300 and 500 bp, 20 unigenes were between 500 and 1000 bp, and 26 unigenes were >1000 bp; moreover, all unigenes had very high homology with the NR database (E <10 –12) ( S5 File). In addition, six unigenes were annotated to both the flavonoid and the flavone/flavonol biosynthetic pathway, which suggested that these genes could be key nodes in the three flavonoid metabolic pathways ( S5 File). Volatile terpenoids are important components of the floral scent in  S.  oblata[ 40]. Three metabolic pathways: terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, and limonene and pinene degradation contributed to the biosynthesis of terpenoid volatiles, and 213 unigenes (average length,1069 bp) were annotated ( S5 File). Among these, 45% of the unigenes were involved in limonene and pinene degradation, 43% were involved in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, and only 25 unigenes were clustered in monoterpenoid biosynthesis ( S5 File). This analysis of the metabolic pathways of flower pigment and floral scent helps to provide a basis for cloning and functional analysis of the key genes involved these important characteristics of  S.  oblata. Variation in gene expression among flower development stages Among the annotated unigenes, we found that 83,343 genes were expressed in samples of all three developmental stages, and 2,203, 1,510, and 1,682 genes were found to be expressed specifically in the SOFB, SOB, and SOF stages, respectively ( Fig 6A). To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during flower development, we performed genome-wide expression analysis for the SOFB, SOB, and SOF developmental stages ( Fig 1). Following Anders and Huber [ 27], we identified genes that were differentially expressed between two samples by comparing SOB and SOFB, SOF and SOB, and SOF and SOFB. In total, 1,068 differentially regulated genes, including 645 upregulated and 423 downregulated genes, were identified in SOB compared to SOFB ( Fig 6B). The functional annotations and statistics for all DEGs between SOB and SOFB are in the  S6 File. We also classified the functions of the 1,068 DEGs by Blast2GO. Among biological processes, dominant subcategories included metabolic processes, cellular processes, and single-organism processes. In cellular components, the two largest subcategories were cell and cell parts. Catalytic activity was dominant in the molecular functions section ( S7 File). GO enrichment analysis showed that most of the upregulated DEG sets were related to biological processes, cellular components, molecules, and DNA binding ( S8 File). The KEGG enrichment classification showed that 23 groups were significantly enriched, and most of these were upregulated primarily in the SOB library, which was correlated with metabolic and biosynthesis pathways of secondary metabolites ( S8 File). Based on sequence homology, the 1,068 DEGs were assigned to the KOG functional classification into 23 categories ( S1 Fig). Compared with SOB, more DEGs were identified in SOF ( Fig 6B), and the statistical information for these DEGs is summarized in the  S6 File. The results of the GO functional classification between the SOF and SOB stages were similar to those for the comparison of SOB to SOFB ( S9 File). GO enrichment analysis indicated that approximately half of the gene sets were downregulated and half were upregulated in the SOF library. The downregulated genes were mainly related to responses, chloroplasts, membranes, and cytosol, and the upregulated genes were related to molecular functions, kinase activity, nuclei, and biological processes ( S10 File). In the KEGG classification, 32 groups were significantly enriched, and about half of these genes were upregulated and half were downregulated in the SOF library. These enriched genes were mainly related to metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites ( S10 File). The KOG functional classification showed that the DEGs between the two stages were also assigned to 23 categories ( S2 Fig). We also compared gene expression between SOF and SOFB, and found 3298 genes with differential expression ( Fig 6B). The functional annotations and statistical information of all 3298 DEGs are summarized in the  S6 File. GO functional classification indicated that the most of the 3298 DEGs were involved in metabolic processes, cellular processes, and single-organism processes in the biological process section; the dominant subcategories were cell and cell parts in the cellular components section; and catalytic activity was the dominant subcategory in the molecular functions section ( S11 File). GO enrichment analysis showed that most of the gene sets were downregulated in the SOF library, and these genes were mainly related to epigenetics, flower development, cytosols, and binding ( S12 File). KEGG classification showed that 14 groups were significantly enriched, and most of these genes were downregulated in the SOF library and were related to ribosomes and DNA replication ( S12 File). In KOG functional classification, the DEGs between the two stages were also assigned to 24 categories ( S3 Fig). Genes related to flower pigment biosynthesis and floral scent metabolism During development, the flowers of  S.  oblata underwent rapid changes in color and scent, from green and unscented (SOFB) to amaranth and slightly scented (SOB), and then to lilac with very strong scent (SOF). We focused on genes related to flower pigment biosynthesis and scent metabolism, and chose some genes that showed significant differential expression among the three developmental stages ( Fig 7). The functional annotation for these unigenes was provided in  S13 File. For example, contig_2561 showed lower expression levels in SOFB and SOF than in SOB and was homologous with  Catharathus roseus cinnamic acid 4-hydrolase (C4H), related to flavonoid biosynthesis. Other genes associated with anthocyanins biosynthesis showed higher expression levels in SOB and SOF than in SOFB. These genes included contigs_52106 (homologous with  Perilla frutescens chalcone synthase, CHS), 14647 (homologous with  Camellia chekiangoleosa flavanone 3-hydroxylase, F3H), 9238 (homologous with  Petunia×hybrida flavonol synthase, FLS), 22308 (homologous with  Eustoma grandiflorum anthocyanidin synthase, ANS), and 32424 (homologous with the  Olea europaea flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase, 3GT). In addition, some genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways, such as contig_38186 (homologous with COMT1), contig_27568 (homologous with DOMT-like) and contig_33752 (homologous with GT) displayed the highest expression in the SOF stage, which indicated that these genes located downstream of anthocyanin biosynthesis. In particular, the mean FPKMs of contig_27568 were 1.08, 1.43, and 4295 in each SOFB, SOB, and SOF stage, respectively (P = 0), which means that the  DOMT-like gene might be specifically and strongly expressed at the SOF stage ( S6 File). Some key genes related to fragrance biosynthesis showed a significant difference in expression among the three flower developmental stages. The functional annotation for these unigenes is shown in the  S13 File. The contigs_3232 (homologous with  Salvia miltiorrhiza1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase, DXS), 33311 (homologous with  Nicotiana tabacum hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, HMGR), 13388 (homologous with  S.  miltiorrhiza geranyldiphosphatesynthase, GPS), and 33785 (homologous with  Oryza sativa subsp.  Japonica1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, DXR) had the highest levels of expression in SOF and encoded key enzymes involved in biosynthesis of terpenoid volatiles; however, the three terpenoid synthase genes with contigs_22002 (homologous with camphene/tricyclene synthase [TPS3] of  S.  lycopersicum), 19143 (terpene synthase[TPS] of  O.  europaea), and 41137 ([3S]-linalool/[E]-nerolidol synthase [LIS] of  V.  vinifera) showed the highest expression levels in SOF. In contrast, contigs_2134 and 18066 from terpene degradation genes showed the highest expression in SOFB and SOB, respectively. In addition, we found that some cytochrome P450 genes involved in metabolism of terpenoid volatiles, such as contigs_2134 (homologous with  V.  vinifera cytochrome P450 76A2, CYP76A2), 819 (homologous with  A.  thaliana cytochrome P450 78A7, CYP78A7), and 17171 (homologous with  V.  vinifera cytochrome P450 77A3, CYP77A3), showed the highest expression in SOFB stage. However, contig_18066 (homologous with  V.  vinifera cytochrome P450 77A2, CYP77A2) displayed higher expression in SOB and SOF than in the SOFB stage. Finally, we found that three genes,  DXS (contig_3232),  TPS (contig_19143), and  LIS (contig_41137), were induced specifically and strongly (>100-fold change in expression) at the SOF stage ( S6 File). Apart from the structural genes, nine transcription factors regulating anthocyanin and fragrance biosynthesis were found in this study ( S6 File). We found that the six genes encoding the transcription factors [e.g., contigs 28146 (homologous with  Prunus avium transcription factor R2R3-MYB), 28147 (homologous with  Theobroma cacao transcription factor MYB), 38962 (homologous with  Camellia sinensis transcription factor R2R3-MYB1), 25616 (homologous with  Citrus sinensis transcription factor bHLH79), 9153 (homologous with  S.  tuberosum transcription factor bHLH147), and 64997 (homologous with  Fragaria vesca bHLH79-like transcription factor)] showed higher expression in SOB and SOF than in the SOFB stage. However, the other three genes [e.g., contigs_11688 (homologous with  A.  thaliana transcription factors MYB44), 21735 (homologous with  S.  tuberosum transcription factor bHLH3), and 20570 (homologous with  A.  thaliana transcription factor bHLH48)] displayed higher expression in SOFB than in the other two stages ( S6 File). Real-time Quantitative PCR Validation of RNA-seq Results To validate the sequencing data, 22 genes involved in flower pigment biosynthesis and fragrance metabolism were selected for real-time qPCR with gene-specific primers designed using Primer version 5.0 ( S1 File). The expression patterns of these genes in each flower developmental stage are shown in  Fig 8. Using  S.  oblata DSK2B as a reference gene, expression patterns determined by real-time qPCR were consistent with those obtained by RNA-Seq ( Fig 7,  Fig 8), confirming the accuracy of the RNA-Seq results. We also obtained identical real-time qPCR results using  S.  oblata ACT-7 as a reference gene ( S4 Fig).Thus, the data generated here can be used to investigate specific flowering genes that show comparative expression levels among different developmental phases.","Syringa oblata Lindl. is a woody ornamental plant with high economic value and characteristics that include early flowering, multiple flower colors, and strong fragrance. Despite a long history of cultivation, the genetics and molecular biology of S. oblata are poorly understood. Transcriptome and expression profiling data are needed to identify genes and to better understand the biological mechanisms of floral pigments and scents in this species. Nine cDNA libraries were obtained from three replicates of three developmental stages: inflorescence with enlarged flower buds not protruded, inflorescence with corolla lobes not displayed, and inflorescence with flowers fully opened and emitting strong fragrance. Using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique, 319,425,972 clean reads were obtained and were assembled into 104,691 final unigenes (average length of 853 bp), 41.75% of which were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Among the annotated unigenes, 36,967 were assigned to gene ontology categories and 19,956 were assigned to eukaryoticorthologous groups. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database, 12,388 unigenes were sorted into 286 pathways. Based on these transcriptomic data, we obtained a large number of candidate genes that were differentially expressed at different flower stages and that were related to floral pigment biosynthesis and fragrance metabolism. This comprehensive transcriptomic analysis provides fundamental information on the genes and pathways involved in flower secondary metabolism and development in S. oblata, providing a useful database for further research on S. oblata and other plants of genus Syringa.",NaN,"['File', 'Fig', 'unigenes', 'SOF', 'Genes', 'SOB', 'SOFB', 'homologous', 'biosynthesis', 'SOF stage']","[337,669,638, 319,425,972, CLC, 401–600, 10–5, 200–400, nucleic acid, KOG, –chaperones, ~23, AMPK, MAPK, p53, flavone/flavonol, length,1130, flavone/flavonol, S5, –12, S5, flavone/flavonol, S5, S5, S5, 83,343, SOFB, SOFB, SOFB, SOFB, SOFB, SOFB, SOFB (, KOG, SOFB, S12, S12, KOG, SOFB, contig_2561, SOFB, C4H, SOFB, contigs_52106, chalcone synthase, CHS, hybrida flavonol synthase, anthocyanidin synthase, 32424, europaea flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase, contig_38186 (homologous with, contig_27568, contig_33752 (homologous with, GT, contig_27568, SOFB, contigs_3232, miltiorrhiza1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate, 33311 (homologous with, 33785 (homologous with, contigs_22002 (homologous with camphene/tricyclene synthase [, 41137 ([3S]-linalool/[E]-nerolidol synthase, contigs_2134, 18066, SOFB, cytochrome P450, contigs_2134 (homologous with, cytochrome P450 76A2, CYP76A2, cytochrome P450 78A7, CYP78A7, 17171 (homologous with, cytochrome P450 77A3, CYP77A3, SOFB, contig_18066 (homologous with, cytochrome P450 77A2, SOFB, contig_3232, contig_19143, contig_41137, 28146, MYB, 25616, 64997 (, SOFB, MYB44, SOFB, gene-specific, DSK2B, 8)]","['[TPS3]', 'synthase[TPS]', 'TPS']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase

We investigated the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpene (6R,7S)-himachala-9,11-diene in the crucifer flea beetle Phyllotreta striolata, a compound previously identified as a male-produced aggregation pheromone in several Phyllotreta species. A (6R,7S)-himachala-9,11-diene-producing sesquiterpene synthase activity was detected in crude beetle protein extracts, but only when (Z,E)-farnesyl diphosphate [(Z,E)-FPP] was offered as a substrate. No sequences resembling sesquiterpene synthases from plants, fungi, or bacteria were found in the P. striolata transcriptome, but we identified nine divergent putative trans-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (trans-IDS) transcripts. Four of these putative trans-IDSs exhibited terpene synthase (TPS) activity when heterologously expressed. Recombinant PsTPS1 converted (Z,E)-FPP to (6R,7S)-himachala-9,11-diene and other sesquiterpenes observed in beetle extracts. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PsTPS1 mRNA in P. striolata males led to reduced emission of aggregation pheromone, confirming a significant role of PsTPS1 in pheromone biosynthesis. Two expressed enzymes showed genuine IDS activity, with PsIDS1 synthesizing (E,E)-FPP, whereas PsIDS3 produced neryl diphosphate, (Z,Z)-FPP, and (Z,E)-FPP. In a phylogenetic analysis, the PsTPS enzymes and PsIDS3 were clearly separated from a clade of known coleopteran trans-IDS enzymes including PsIDS1 and PsIDS2. However, the exon-intron structures of IDS and TPS genes in P. striolata are conserved, suggesting that this TPS gene family evolved from trans-IDS ancestors.","['aggregation pheromone', 'Sesquiterpene Synthase', 'Isoprenyl Diphosphate Synthase', 'Flea Beetle', '(6R,7s)-himachala-9,11-diene']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN
35,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4865098\eupmc_result.json,PMC4865098,"Results Thirty-eight to 44 million clean reads were obtained from infected and control plants and mapped to the  Citrus sinensis ‘Valencia’ reference genome [ 13], with approximately 73 % for CTV-B2, 76 % for the healthy, CTV-B6 and CaLa-B232 libraries (Additional file  1: Figure S1). Dramatic differences in the transcriptome profiles of sweet orange trees were observed in response to the three pathogens. Many more transcripts identified in the citrus gene database were up-regulated than down-regulated in response to the three pathogens (Additional file  1: Figure S2). More transcripts were differentially expressed in response to CaLas-B232, followed by CTV-B6 and CTV-B2 (Additional file  1: Figure S2). Among these differentially expressed transcripts (DETs), 50 transcripts were up-regulated, while only two transcripts were down-regulated in response to all three pathogens (Fig.  1). The number of transcripts regulated in response to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (105 up and two down) was approximately four times the number of transcripts regulated in response to the two strains of CTV (27 up and 0 down) or CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232 (22 up and 3 down) (Fig.  1). The number of DETs responding to CaLas-B232 only (412 up and 15 down) was much larger than the number responding only to CTV-B2 (143 up and 37 down) or CTV-B6 (146 up and 72 down) (Fig.  1). A similar pattern was also found when the DETs were identified using the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (Fig.  2). DETs with unknown functions were also identified (Additional file  1: Table S1). Plant Gene Sequence Enrichment Analysis (PlantGSEA) was performed with excellent  p-values and low false discovery rates to reveal perturbed pathways. The functions of DETs observed in response to all three pathogens were mainly associated with the maintenance of circadian rhythms, such as flowering and photoperiodism, response to stimulus and response to other organism and signaling (Additional file  1: Table S2). DETs observed in response to CTV-B2 and CTV-B6 were disproportionally involved in hormone related responses, signaling pathways, and water stress (Additional file  1: Table S3). DETs observed in response to CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232 disproportionally encoded binding activities, including to iron, tetrapyrrole and heme molecules, which could affect chloroplast function, in addition to genes that respond to biotic stimulus or stress (Additional file  1: Table S4). A much larger set of DETs observed in response to both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 disproportionally encoded biological process (BP) functions in signaling, defense, immune and stress responses and other BPs (Additional file  1: Table S5). DETs observed to respond only to CTV-B2 were mainly associated with molecular functions (MF) and cellular components (CC) (Fig.  3) and disproportionately functioned in active transport of molecules across membranes and cell junctions (Additional file  1: Table S6). In contrast, the DETs observed to respond only to CTV-B6 or CaLas-B232 were primarily involved in BPs (Fig.  3). The long lists of DETs observed in response to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 are the reflection of the BPs disrupted by the severe disease symptoms caused by these pathogens, although symptoms had not yet developed in the tissues at the time they were sampled. Genes whose products functioned in transcription and inositol metabolism, as well as membrane bound intracellular organelles were up-regulated but signaling pathways were down regulated in response to CTV-B6 (Additional file  1: Table S7). The effects on inositol metabolism and membrane bound organelles could represent either the cause or an effect of chloroplast dysfunction seen in citrus infected by this pathogen, and negative regulation of signaling pathways likely impedes the defense response of the host. The long list of DETs that were observed in response only to CaLas-B232 included a large group associated with response to fungal pathogens, programmed cell death, hypersensitive responses and other host defense responses, and the production of jasmonic acid (JA) catalytic activity (Additional file  1: Table S8). The substantial number of genes annotated as ‘response to fungus’ may be correlated with the root decline and rot caused by CaLas and a potential interaction with  Phytophthora spp. [ 14,  15]. Similar defense responses could also be triggered by effectors secreted by CaLas and delivered by fungus. DETs were also assigned to several specific function groups by Mapman (Fig.  4), including cell wall, hormone metabolism, secondary metabolism, transcription factors and signaling  etc. Many pathways related to biotic stress were affected by CTV-B2, CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Fig.  5). For more complete information about DETs, please refer to the supplemental information (Additional file  1: Table S9). Stress response Many disease resistance (R) genes were differentially regulated in response to CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232, and fewer to CTV-B6 (Additional file  1: Figure S4G), including CC (TIR)-NB-LRR (coiled-coil/Toll-interleukin1 receptor-nucleotide binding-Leucine rich repeat) and NB-ARC (nucleotide binding-adaptor shared by APAF-1, certain  R gene products and CED4) domain-containing disease resistance proteins, the largest and well-characterized group of R genes. Transcripts encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs) were especially regulated in response to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  4). The expression of Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (PI), located in the cell wall and responsive to peroxidase, was significantly up-regulated only in response to CaLase-B232 (Table  4). Remarkably, a transcript encoding accelerated cell death 2 (ACD2) was highly up-regulated only responding to CTV-B2 (Table  4). Oxidation/reduction processes Transcripts related to the peroxidase super family were also differentially regulated in response to the three pathogens (Additional file  1: Table S9). Peroxidase 2 (PA2) mRNA accumulated in response to CTV-B2 (Table  4). Transcripts encoding WCRKC thioredoxin1 (WCRKC1), likely involved with redox homeostasis in the chloroplast, were greatly up-regulated only responding to CTV-B6 (Table  4). Transcripts encoding oxidoreductase, a zinc-binding dehydrogenase family protein, were up-regulated in response to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  4). Development, protein degradation and miscellaneous functions Transcripts encoding thiazole biosynthetic enzyme (THI1, TZ, THI4) were up-regulated responding to all three pathogens, especially CTV-B6 (Additional file  1: Table S9). Thiamine biosynthetic genes respond to bacteria, and also act in starch and maltose metabolism [ 35]. These enzymes may contribute to the accumulation of starch in leaves of diseased trees. Transcripts encoding gigantea (GI) and NAC domain containing protein 2 involved in the development and strengthening of secondary cell walls were strongly up-regulated in response to all three pathogens (Table  4). A set of transcripts involved in protein degradation were also differentially regulated in response to the three pathogens (Additional file  1: Table S9), consistent with a previous result that protein degradation and misfolding processes were activated in citrus fruits infected with CaLas [ 36]. A larger set of transcripts encoding UDP-glycoyl transferase and cytochrome P450 were differentially regulated in response to all three pathogens (Additional file  1: Table S9). Both UDP-glycoyl transferase and cytochrome P450 are involved in secondary metabolism, responses to biotic and abiotic stress and oxidation/reduction process. A transcript encoding a concanavalin A-like (ConA-like) protein with a jacalin-like lectin domain was very highly up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  4). Jacalin-related proteins were demonstrated as components in plant defense system [ 37]. RT-qPCR validation of RNA-seq results Thirty-eight genes were tested by replicated RT-qPCR. Expression levels ranged from −7 to 8 (log 2FC) (Additional file  1: Table S10). Spearman’s rho values, 0.821 for CTV-B2, 0.687 for CTV-B6 and 0.813 for CaLas-B232, indicated excellent correlations between Gfold analysis of the RNA Seq libraries and RT-qPCR (Fig.  6). All primers showed amplification efficiencies between 90–110 % (Additional file  1: Table S11) and melting curves showed single peaks for the evaluated genes (Additional file  1: Figure S3). Genes involved in cell wall and cell organization Many transcripts related to cell wall modification and cell organization were differentially regulated, especially in response to CaLas-B232 (Additional file  1: Figure S4A). Transcripts encoding xyloglucan endotransglycosylase 6 (XTR6) were up-regulated by infection with all three pathogens (Table  1). A gene annotated as encoding a plant invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI), was strongly up-regulated in response to CaLas-B232 (Table  1). Inhibition of pectin methyl esterase would strengthen the cell wall and is a common defense response [ 16,  17]. Another set of genes encoding expansin were up-regulated in response to CaLas-B232, in accordance with another study [ 10]. Expansin functions to loosen the structure of cell walls. Taken together this set of genes could contribute to the thickening and stiffening of leaves that occurs as a primary symptom of HLB and distortions of phloem cell walls as CaLas multiplies [ 18]. Transcripts encoding cellulose synthesis, including cellulose synthase-like B3 (CSLB3) and A2 (CSLA2), were sharply up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  1). A transcript encoding COBRA-like protein 7 precursor (COBL7), likely involved in the deposition of cellulose, were also remarkably up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  1), all consistent with a stronger cell wall in response to CTV-B2. A pectin lyase-like superfamily protein and beta-D-xylosidase 4 (XYL4) protein related to cell wall degradation were down-regulated by infection with CTV-B6 (Table  1). Transcripts encoding phloem protein (PP2-B13 and PP2-B15) were strongly down-regulated in response to CTV-B2 (Table  1), but up-regulated by infection with CaLas-B232. The expression of PP2-B10 gene was up-regulated by CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  1). Because these phloem proteins move with assimilate from source to sink tissues [ 19], they may be markers for altered source sink flow of assimilates. Transcripts encoding NPR3 and NPR4, participating in cell organization, were also up-regulated responding to CaLas-B232 (Table  1). Transcripts encoding CYP83B1, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates and defense response by callose deposition, were up-regulated by both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 [ 20] (Table  1). Transcription factors (TFs) The expression of transcription factors, including WRKYs, B-box, MYB, bHTH, heat shock transcription factors (HSF), CDR1, pseudo-response regulator (PRR), ABR1, and jumonji domain-containing protein (JMJD5), were differentially modulated in response to the three pathogens. This was especially the case in trees infected by CTV-B6 (Additional file  1: Figure S4B). Transcripts encoding PRR5 and PRR7 were up-regulated responding to all three pathogens (Table  2). A transcript encoding PRR3 was up-regulated by infection with CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  2). Transcripts encoding JMJD5, a histone demethylase, and CCT motif family protein were up-regulated in response to both CTV strains (Table  2). JMJD5 participates in circadian systems in both plants and animals [ 21]. The expression level of the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene was down-regulated in response to the three pathogens, especially CTV-B6 (Table  2), consistent with down-regulation in flavedo (FF) and vascular tissue (VT) of both symptomatic ‘Hamlin’ and ‘Valencia’ sweet orange infected with CaLas [ 22]. Plant-specific WRKY transcription factors with a DNA-binding domain are involved in plant senescence, plant defense and response to various environmental stresses [ 23,  24]. Expression of WRKY13 and WRKY 70 were especially up-regulated by infection with CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232. WRKY27 and WRKY50 were also up-regulated in response to both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 and WRKY28, WRKY33 and WRKY40 also were up-regulated in response to CaLas-B232 (Table  2). The expression of  constitutive disease resistance ( CDR1) gene, encoding an aspartic protease, was very strongly induced in response to both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232, but not at all to CTV-B2 (Table  2).  CDR1is involved in salicylic-acid-dependent inducible resistance responses and over-expression of  CDR1 enhances resistance to bacterial pathogens in Arabidopsis [ 25]. A Myb-like HTH (helix-turn-helix) transcription factor was very highly down-regulated by infection with CTV-B2, but up-regulated with CaLas-B232 (Table  2). Transcripts encoding an integrase-type DNA-binding protein (ABR1), responsive to ethylene stimulus, were up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  2). Transporters Many transporter genes were differentially regulated in response to the three pathogens, especially CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232 (Additional file  1: Figure S4C). Transcripts encoding 4 zinc transporters (ZIP1, 4, 5 and 11), especially ZIP4 and ZIP5, were up-regulated in association with CaLas infection, but down regulated responding to CTV-B2, consistent with symptoms of zinc deficiency in HLB-diseased plants (Table  2). Transcripts encoding cyclic nucleotide gated channel 1 (CNGC1), involved in cyclic nucleotide or calcium transport, were differentially up-regulated in response to the three pathogens (Table  2). Transcripts encoding copper transporter 1 (COPT1) were up-regulated in response to all three pathogens (Table  2). Transcripts encoding ABC-2 type transporters were highly up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  2). These ATP-binding cassette transporters typically function to export substrates from eukaryotic cells [ 26]. The expression of phosphate transporter 1;7 (PHT1;7) was induced by infection with CaLas-B232 (Table  2), consistent with a prominent role of phosphate deficiency in the HLB disease syndrome [ 27]. The expression of another phosphate transporter PHT1;4 was slightly up-regulated in response to both strains of CTV (Table  2). Transcripts encoding an oligopeptide transporter 7 (OPT7), involved in transport of small peptides [ 28], were up-regulated by infection with CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  2). Hormone metabolism Transcripts encoding jasmonic acid carboxyl methyl transferase (JMT) were highly up-regulated responding to the three pathogens (Table  3). Transcripts encoding lipoxygenase 2 (LOX2), a key enzyme in the synthesis of JA [ 29], and involved in the JA signaling pathway, were highly up-regulated in response to CaLas-B232, but not to the other pathogens (Table  3). Different transcripts of the senescence-related gene (SRG1), involved in ethylene metabolism, were induced in response to the three pathogens (Table  3). The expression of ethylene responsive element binding factors (ERF1 and ERF104), involved in ethylene signal transduction, was also up-regulated by infection with CaLas-B232 (Table  3). A transcript encoding a gibberellin-regulated protein was down-regulated only by infection with CTV-B6 (Table  3). Secondary metabolism Many different transcripts encoding 2-oxoglutarate and Fe (II)-dependent (2OG-Fe (II)) oxygenases were highly up-regulated in response to all three pathogens (Table  3). Transcripts encoding terpene synthase (TPS21), involved in isoprenoid and terpenoid metabolism, were induced up to eight fold by infection with CTV-B2, and to a lesser extent infection by CaLas-B232, but were repressed by CTV-B6 (Table  3). These perturbations of the terpenoid pathways likely contribute to the different volatile components detected following infection by CTV or CaLas [ 30,  31]. The expression of O-methyltransferase (OMT), participating in flavonoid and phenylpropanoid metabolism, was up-regulated in response to both strains of CTV (Table  3). A transcript encoding geranylgeranyl pyrophosphatesynthase1 (GGPS1), also involved in isoprenoid biosynthetic process, was strongly up-regulated in response to CTV-B2 and less so to CaLas-B232 (Table  3). Transcripts encoding homogentisate phytyltransferase (VTE2) were up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2, but were down-regulated by infection with CTV-B6 and did not respond to CaLas-B232 (Table  3). VTE2 catalyzes the synthesis of tocopherol, which plays an important role in protecting chloroplast membranes. The expression of VTE2 was induced in symptomatic and repressed in asymptomatic leaves of sweet orange in response to CaLam [ 32]. Transcripts encoding terpenoidcyclases/proteinprenyl transferase were also significantly up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  3). Laccase genes  LAC4,  LAC5 and  LAC7 participating in simple phenol metabolism, were over-expressed in response to CaLas-B232 (Table  3). Transcripts encoding UDP-glucosyl transferase 74B1 (UGT74B1) involved in plant secondary metabolism and playing a potential role in stress or defense responses were up-regulated by both CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232 [ 33] (Table  3). Signaling Plant receptor-like proteins/kinases (RLPs/RLKs) regulate developmental processes and respond to pathogens and abiotic stresses [ 34]. A large number of transcripts encoding RLRs/RLKs, including leucine rich repeat (LRR) kinases, wall-associated kinases (WAKs) and Domain of Unknown Function 26 (DUF26) kinases, were differentially expressed in response to all three pathogens, and very notably to CaLas-B232 (Additional file  1: Figure S4F). The expression of LRR kinases were up-regulated responding to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 but not to CTV-B2, consistent with their role in defense response [ 34]. These included RLP6, RLP9, RLP13, RLP14, RLP15 and RLP45, which were consistently up-regulated by infection with CaLas-B232 and CTV-B6 (Table  4). Transcripts related to wall associated kinases were differentially expressed in response to CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232, including WAK2 and WAK7 (Table  4). Notably, the expression of two members of DUF26 RLKs, cysteine-rich RLK2 (CRK2) and receptor-like kinase1 (RLK1), was significantly induced by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  4). The expression of E1-E2 ATPase was up-regulated in response to all three pathogens. The expression of EF-hand binding protein and calmodulin (CaM) was induced responding to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  4). Transcripts encoding cold-circadian rhythm RNA binding-like protein (CCR-like, CCL) were up-regulated in response to all three pathogens, especially CTV-B6, approximately five fold (Table  4)."," Background Huanglongbing (HLB) and tristeza, are diseases of citrus caused by a member of the α-proteobacteria, 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CaLas), and Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) respectively. HLB is a devastating disease, but CTV strains vary from very severe to very mild. Both CaLas and CTV are phloem-restricted. The CaLas-B232 strain and CTV-B6 cause a wide range of severe and similar symptoms. The mild strain CTV-B2 doesn't induce significant symptoms or damage to plants. Results Transcriptome profiles obtained through RNA-seq revealed 611, 404 and 285 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) after infection with CaLas-B232, CTV-B6 and CTV-B2. These DETs were components of a wide range of pathways involved in circadian rhythm, cell wall modification and cell organization, as well as transcription factors, transport, hormone response and secondary metabolism, signaling and stress response. The number of transcripts that responded to both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 was much larger than the number of transcripts that responded to both strains of CTV or to both CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232. A total of 38 genes were assayed by RT-qPCR and the correlation coefficients between Gfold and RT-qPCR were 0.82, 0.69, 0.81 for sweet orange plants infected with CTV-B2, CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232, respectively. Conclusions The number and composition of DETs reflected the complexity of symptoms caused by the pathogens in established infections, although the leaf tissues sampled were asymptomatic. There were greater similarities between the sweet orange in response to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 than between the two CTV strains, reflecting the similar physiological changes caused by both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232. The circadian rhythm system of plants was perturbed by all three pathogens, especially by CTV-B6, and the ion balance was also disrupted by all three pathogens, especially by CaLas-B232. Defense responses related to cell wall modification, transcriptional regulation, hormones, secondary metabolites, kinases and stress were activated by all three pathogens but with different patterns. The transcriptome profiles of Citrus sinensis identified host genes whose expression is affected by the presence of a pathogen in the phloem without producing symptoms (CTV-B2), and host genes whose expression leads to induction of symptoms in the plant (CTV-B6, CaLas-B232).","['Huanglongbing', 'Host-pathogen interactions', 'Gfold']","['Table', 'Additional file', 'response', 'Transcripts encoding', 'Additional', 'up-regulated', 'transcripts', 'encoding', 'file', 'infection']","[CTV-B2, CTV-B6, CaLa-B232, CaLas-B232, CTV-B6, CTV-B2 (Additional file, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, DETs, CaLas-B232, CTV-B2 (143 up, CTV-B6 (146, DETs, CTV-B2, CTV-B6, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, heme molecules, DETs, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, BPs, S5, CTV-B2, DETs, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, BPs, DETs, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, BPs, CTV-B6 (Additional file, CaLas-B232, ‘, CTV-B2, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, DETs, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, CTV-B6 (Additional file, S4G, coiled-coil/Toll-interleukin1 receptor-nucleotide binding-Leucine, APAF-1, CED4, R, heat shock proteins, HSPs, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (PI, peroxidase, CaLase-B232, CTV-B2 (Table  4, peroxidase, Peroxidase 2, PA2, CTV-B2 (Table  4, WCRKC thioredoxin1, WCRKC1, CTV-B6 (Table  4, oxidoreductase, dehydrogenase, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, THI1, CTV-B6 (Additional file, UDP-glycoyl transferase, cytochrome P450, UDP-glycoyl transferase, cytochrome P450, concanavalin A-like, CTV-B2 (Table  4, RNA-seq, −7, CTV-B2, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, Gfold, Seq, 90–110 , CaLas-B232, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase 6, XTR6, invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI, CaLas-B232, pectin methyl, esterase, CaLas-B232, HLB, cellulose synthase-like, B3 (, CSLB3, A2 (, CSLA2, CTV-B2 (Table  1, COBRA-like protein 7, COBL7, CTV-B2 (Table  1, pectin lyase-like, beta-D-xylosidase 4, XYL4, CTV-B6 (Table  1, PP2-B13, PP2-B15, CTV-B2 (Table  1, CaLas-B232, PP2-B10, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, NPR3, NPR4, CaLas-B232, CYP83B1, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, WRKYs, B-box, MYB, bHTH, HSF, CDR1, pseudo-response, ABR1, jumonji domain-containing protein, JMJD5, CTV-B6 (Additional file, PRR5, PRR7, PRR3, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, JMJD5, histone, JMJD5, LHY, CTV-B6 (Table  2, vascular tissue (VT), WRKY13, WRKY 70, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, WRKY27, WRKY50, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, WRKY28, WRKY33, WRKY40, CaLas-B232, CDR1, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, CTV-B2 (Table  2, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, ABR1, CTV-B2 (Table  2, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, S4C, ZIP1, ZIP4, ZIP5, CTV-B2, HLB-diseased, CNGC1, copper transporter 1, COPT1, ABC-2 type transporters, CTV-B2 (Table  2, phosphate transporter 1;7, CaLas-B232, phosphate transporter, PHT1;4, oligopeptide transporter 7, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, lipoxygenase 2, LOX2, CaLas-B232, SRG1, ERF1, ERF104, CaLas-B232, CTV-B6 (Table  3, Fe (II)-dependent, 2OG-Fe (II)) oxygenases, TPS21, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, CTV-B6 (Table  3, O-methyltransferase, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphatesynthase1, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, homogentisate phytyltransferase, CTV-B2, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, VTE2, VTE2, terpenoidcyclases/proteinprenyl transferase, CTV-B2 (Table  3, Laccase, CaLas-B232, UDP-glucosyl transferase 74B1, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, receptor-like proteins/kinases, RLPs/RLKs, RLRs/RLKs, wall-associated kinases, CaLas-B232, S4F, LRR kinases, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, CTV-B2, RLP6, RLP9, RLP13, RLP14, RLP15, RLP45, CaLas-B232, CTV-B6 (Table  4, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, WAK2, WAK7, cysteine-rich RLK2, CRK2, receptor-like kinase1, RLK1, CTV-B2 (Table  4, EF-hand binding protein, calmodulin (, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, cold-circadian, CCR-like, CTV-B6]","['(TPS21),']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
36,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4870700\eupmc_result.json,PMC4870700,"Results Genes encoding NCS in the sacred lotus genome We checked the annotation of the sacred lotus genome 30, and four putative  NCS genes, designated  NnNCS1 through  NnNCS4, were identified, with accession numbers of NNU_21731-RA, NNU_21732-RA, NNU_14334-RA, and NNU_21730-RA, respectively, in the public domain (lotus-db.wbgcas.cn). To validate their putative coding sequences, primer pairs for each  NCS gene were designed to amplify cDNAs prepared from young leaf of cv. WSL253 and the PCR products were subsequently cloned and sequenced. As a result, full coding sequences of three  NCS genes,  NnNCS1,  NnNCS3, and  NnNCS4, were successfully isolated and deposited in GenBank with accession numbers  KT963033,  KT963034, and  KT963035, respectively. Meanwhile, several attempts were made to isolate cDNA fragments of  NnNCS2 from three different tissues (leaf, petiole, and petal) of four cultivars, Lianxia, WSL253, Fenshiba, and Shuimeiren. However, no PCR products were amplified. We checked the genomic DNA sequence of the putative  NnNCS2 gene, and found that it showed a high level (95%) of similarity with  NnNCS1. However,  NnNCS2 had a single nucleotide deletion adjacent to the GC dinucleotide at the 5′ border of the intron ( Fig. S2). This single nucleotide deletion caused frameshift, resulting in a truncated and nonfunctional protein due to a premature stop codon. Thus,  NnNCS2 is deemed to be a pseudogene. To determine the copy gene number of  NCS in lotus, the coding sequences of  NnNCS1 were compared against the draft genome of sacred lotus ‘China Antique’ 30. As a result, three additional  NCS paralogs, termed  NnNCS5, NnNCS6, and  NnNCS7, were identified. The full coding sequences of  NnNCS5 were confirmed by whole cDNA amplification and sequencing.  NnNCS7 was initially identified to be located on scaffold_3159, but this scaffold is very short and only covers the first exon. The second exon was subsequently recovered by PCR-based genome working. The cDNA sequences of  NnNCS5 and  NnNCS7 were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers  KU234431 and  KU234432, respectively. However, the putative  NnNCS6 gene contained only partial coding sequences ( Fig. S3), and its transcripts were not detected in three different tissues (leaf, petiole, and petal) of four cultivars, Lianxia, WSL253, Fenshiba, and Shuimeiren. Thus,  NnNCS6 is deemed to be a pseudogene. In addition,  NnNCS3 was located on scaffold 17, while  NnNCS1,  NnNCS2,  NnNCS4, NnNCS5, and  NnNCS6 were located next to each other within an 83 kb region on scaffold 8 ( Fig. 1A). All the  NnNCS genes were composed of two exons and one intron. The coding-sequence lengths of  NnNCS1,  NnNCS3,  NnNCS4,  NnNCS5 and  NnNCS7 were 489, 486, 468, 513, and 492 bp, respectively.  NnNCS1 and  NnNCS7 shared the highest level (83.8%) of identity in coding DNA sequences, and they showed approximately 65% identity in coding DNA sequences with  NnNCS3 and  NnNCS5.  NnNCS4 had approximately 55% identity in coding DNA sequences with other  NnNCS genes. The deduced amino acid sequences of  NnNCS1,  NnNCS3,  NnNCS4,  NnNCS5, and  NnNCS7 genes were 162, 161, 155, 170, and 164 in length, respectively.  NnNCS1,  NnNCS3,  NnNCS5 and  NnNCS7 genes shared over 50% identity in amino acid sequences with each other, while they showed approximately 40% identity in amino acid sequences with  NnNCS4. In addition, all the deduced amino acid sequences of the  NnNCS genes contained a glycine-rich loop ( Fig. 1B), the ligand binding domain of Bet v1 protein family. Subcellular localization of the NnNCS amino acid sequences was predicted using several programs, including SignalP4.1, WoLF PSORT, and Protcomp 9.0. However, the result indicated that none of the lotus NnNCS proteins contained any signal peptides. This suggests that the lotus NnNCS proteins are probably localized in cytoplasm. Phylogenetic analysis of  NCS genes and their homologs The NCS enzyme belongs to Bet v 1 protein family and its activity was biochemically characterized in a limited number of species, including opium poppy ( Papaver somniferrum) 23, yellow meadow-rue ( Thalictrum flavum) 2131, Japanese goldthread ( Coptis japonica) 32, and  Sinopodophyllum hexandrum33. Besides NCS, Bet v 1 family also includes plant intracellular pathogenesis-related class 10 (PR-10) proteins, cytokinin binding proteins (CSBPs), major latex proteins (MLPs), and ripening-related proteins. However, the PR-10/Bet v1 allergen proteins do not possess NCS activity although they share similarity to NCS proteins 34. Thus, phylogenetic analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between the lotus  NnNCS genes and members of the Bet v1 family. All the  NCS genes tested were divided into two subfamilies, designated  NCSI and  NCSII clades, but separated from the PR-10/Bet v1 allergen family ( Fig. 2). The  NCSI subfamily consisted of four  NnNCS genes,  NnNCS1,  NnNCS3,  NnNCS5, and  NnNCS7, and functionally characterized  NCS genes from Ranunculus such as California poppy, opium poppy, Japanese goldthread, and yellow meadow-rue. The  NCSII subfamily was composed of the lotus  NnNCS4 gene and  NCS genes from both eudicots, such as tea, cotton, and cacao, and monocots, such as rice, wheat, and maize. Gene expression profiles of the  NnNCS genes in sacred lotus Spatial and temporal expression patterns of the five lotus  NCS genes,  NnNCS1,  NnNCS3,  NnNCS4,  NnNCS5, and  NnNCS7, were investigated in 10 cultivars ( Fig. 3). Overall,  NnNCS7 was the predominant  NnNCS transcript in leaf, petiole, and petal of most tested cultivars ( Fig. 4). In contrast, the transcript levels of  NnNCS5 were extremely low or undetectable in leaf, petiole, and petal of most tested cultivars, but  NnNCS5 was relatively highly expressed in leaf and petiole of cv. Xuehuou. Similarly,  NnNCS4 showed extremely low or undetectable expression levels in leaf, petiole, and petal of most tested cultivars, but predominantly expressed in young and mature leaves of two cultivars, Rongjiao and WSL40. The transcripts of the remaining two  NnNCS genes,  NnNCS1 and  NnNCS3, were detected in all tested tissues. Expression of  NnNCS3 was high in petioles of three cultivars, Rongjiao, Fenshiba, and Yupeng, and in petals of most tested cultivars, such as Simeihuang, WSL253, Rongjiao, WSL40, Fenshiba, Yupeng and Shuimeiren. However, the expression levels of  NnNCS1 were very low compared with  NnNCS7 and/or  NnNCS3 transcripts. In addition, the tested cultivars were composed of white-flower and pink-flower genotypes. However, no relationship was observed between the expression pattern of  NnNCS genes and the flower color. Total alkaloid content in various tissues of sacred lotus Total alkaloid content was measured for the same accessions selected for qRT-PCR analysis ( Table 1). On average, the alkaloid contents in young leaf, mature leaf, young petiole, mature petiole, and petal were 2.28, 2.26, 0.34, 0.19, and 0.35 mg/g FW, respectively. There was a wide range of alkaloid content in leaf across the tested cultivars, while a relatively narrow range of alkaloid content was observed for either petiole or petal across the tested cultivars. Overall, alkaloids were most abundant in the leaf, with a 6 to 12-fold higher amount as compared to both petiole and petal. The alkaloid content in the leaf ranged from 0.66 to 4.32 mg/g FW. Three cultivars, Lianxia, Rongjiao, and Simeihuang, had higher levels of alkaloids in young leaf than in mature leaf, whilst three cultivars, Xiaojinluan, Yupeng, and Fenshiba, showed higher levels of alkaloids in mature leaf than in young leaf. The remaining cultivars, WSL253, Xuehuou, Shuimeiren, and WSL40, showed no great difference in total alkaloid content between young and mature leaves. Alkaloid content in petiole ranged from 0.08 to 0.50 mg/g FW. Five cultivars, Rongjiao, Xiaojinluan, Simeihuang, Yupeng, and Fenshiba, showed 2- to 3-fold decrease in total alkaloid content compared with young petiole, while a slight decrease was observed for the rest five cultivars. On average, mature petiole showed an approximately 2-fold decrease in total alkaloid content compared with young petiole. In petal, the highest level of alkaloid accumulation (0.88 mg/g FW) was observed for cv. Yupeng bearing red-colored flowers, whilst the lowest level of alkaloid accumulation (0.07 mg/g FW) was observed for white flower cultivar Xiaojinluan and red flower cultivar Fenshiba. No relationship was observed between alkaloid accumulation and petal color. Relationship between the  NnNCS gene expression and alkaloid accumulation To investigate the potential role of  NCS genes in alkaloid accumulation, we analyzed the relationship between the  NCS gene expression and alkaloid accumulation.  NnNCS4 showed almost undetectable expression levels in leaf, petiole, and petal of three cultivars, Xiaojinluan, Simeihuang, and Xuehuou. Similarly,  NnNCS5 showed almost undetectable levels of expression in leaf, petiole, and petal of four cultivars, Shuimeiren, WSL40, Yupeng, and Fenshiba. As mentioned above, all tested cultivars accumulated alkaloids in different tissues, with relative abundance of alkaloids in young and/or mature leaves. These results indicated that both  NnNCS4 and  NnNCS5 play little role in alkaloid accumulation in sacred lotus. The other three  NCSI genes,  NnNCS1,  NnNCS3, and  NnNCS7, were expressed in various tissues of all tested cultivars. Since bisbenzylisoquinoline-type alkaloids are synthesized mainly in lamina 29, we further conducted correlation analysis to investigate the degree of linear relationship between the  NCS gene expression level and alkaloid content in leaf. The expression of  NnNCS7 ( r = −0.404,  P < 0.05) was significantly correlated with alkaloid contents in leaf, whereas, no significant correlation was identified for either  NnNCS1 ( r = 0.140,  P > 0.05) and  NnNCS3 ( r = 0.110,  P > 0.05). Taken together, the results above suggested that the  NCSI genes are involved in the biosynthesis of alkaloids in sacred lotus.","Sacred lotus is rich in biologically active compounds, particularly benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs). Here, we report on isolation of genes encoding (S)-norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) in sacred lotus, which is a key entry-enzyme in BIA biosynthesis. Seven NCS genes, designated NnNCS1 through NnNCS7, were identified in the sacred lotus genome, and five are located next to each other within a 83 kb region on scaffold 8. The NCS genes are divided into two subfamilies, designated NCSI and NCSII. The NCSII genes are universal in plants, while the NCSI genes are only identified in a limited number of dicotyledonous taxa that produce BIAs. In sacred lotus, only NnNCS4 belongs to the NCSII subfamily, whilst the rest NCS genes within the NCSI subfamily. Overall, the NnNCS7 gene was predominantly expressed in all tested tissues, and its expression is significantly correlated with alkaloid content in leaf. In contrast, the NnNCS4 expression shows no significant correlation with alkaloid accumulation in leaf, and its lack of expression cannot inhibit alkaloid accumulation. Taken together, these results suggest that the NCSI subfamily is crucial for BIA biosynthesis, and its origin may represent an important evolutionary event that allows certain plant taxa to produce BIAs.",NaN,"['NCS genes', 'NCS', 'NNU', 'Genes', 'alkaloid content', 'alkaloid', 'NnNCS genes', 'NCS gene', 'cultivars', 'leaf']","[NNU_21731-RA, NNU_21732-RA, NNU_14334-RA, NNU_21730-RA, lotus-db.wbgcas.cn, WSL253, Lianxia, WSL253, Shuimeiren, ’, NnNCS6, scaffold_3159, Lianxia, WSL253, Shuimeiren, NnNCS5, Bet v1, NnNCS amino acid, Protcomp 9.0, lotus NnNCS, Bet v 1, meadow-rue, hexandrum33, NCS, Bet v 1, cytokinin binding proteins, CSBPs, PR-10/Bet v1 allergen, NCS proteins, Bet v1, PR-10/Bet v1 allergen, meadow-rue, WSL40, Yupeng, Simeihuang, WSL253, WSL40, Yupeng, Shuimeiren, pink-flower, Lianxia, Simeihuang, Xiaojinluan, Yupeng, WSL253, Xuehuou, Shuimeiren, WSL40, Xiaojinluan, Simeihuang, Yupeng, Xiaojinluan, Simeihuang, Xuehuou, Shuimeiren, WSL40, Yupeng, bisbenzylisoquinoline-type alkaloids]",[],[],[],NaN
37,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4883687\eupmc_result.json,PMC4883687,," Background Bph3, a major brown planthopper (BPH) resistance locus derived from the rice cultivar Rathu Heenati (RH), has been used as a stable donor of traits that improve highly susceptible aromatic rice varieties in Thailand. Map-based cloning was initiated using a set of isogenic lines (ILs) harboring the major Bph3 locus on chromosome 6. IL genomes were scanned with a 57 K Affymetrix Rice GeneChip to identify the gene responsible for Bph3. Findings Single-feature polymorphism (SFP) mapping was used to localize 84 candidate genes. An expression analysis of 15 selected candidate genes in the aromatic rice cultivar KDML105 (KD) and the ILs under normal conditions revealed two differentially expressed sequences. Following hopper feeding, only one candidate gene, Os04g27430, was differentially expressed. Os04g27430 encodes a putative sesquiterpene synthase (STPS) gene that was induced by BPH feeding in ILs. An antixenosis test in three selected ILs revealed a major role for STPS in insect preference during the first 120 hours of the rice-insect interaction. Functional SNPs in exon 5 that resulted in the deletion of seven amino acids in the susceptible rice line were identified. Moreover, three additional SNPs associated with three transcription binding sites were also identified, which might explain the differential response of Os04g27430 during the anti-feeding test. Conclusion Os04g27430 is the second known rice STPS induced by BPH. The gene may involve an antixenosis BPH resistance mechanism. The combination of the STPS and the Bph3 locus was more effective than Bph3 alone in the tested ILs.",NaN,[],[],[],[],[],NaN
38,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4964374\eupmc_result.json,PMC4964374,"2. Results 2.1. Quality Traits of Apricot during Development and Ripening Fruits were classified into five different stages (immature green, S1, maturation green, S2; turning, S3; green ripe, S4; and full ripe, S5) and picked according to peel color ( Table 1 and  Figure 1). Skin color changed dramatically between maturity stages and ripening. The longitudinal and equatorial diameters of cultivars tested varied from 16.25 to 50.85 mm and 20.83 to 49.55 mm during the development and ripening period, respectively ( Figure 2a,b), while the weight increased from 2.6 to 54.35 g. Hongyuxing (HY) had the largest two diameters and fruit weight ( Figure 2c), which presented the large fruit shape, and Danxing (DX) and Yechengheiyeyxing (YC) were the medium-sized fruit cultivars, Luntaixiaobaixing (LT) and Baixing (BX) were the small fruit cultivars. The development of fruits tested was characterized by cell enlargement (0–27 or 32 days), rapid enlargement (0–57 or 91 days) and a period of retarded enlargement (74–101 days). With the development and ripening, the titratable acid (TA) level decreased to the lowest point (<0.55 mmol·L −1 H +) at the full-ripe stage. Yechengheyexing (YC) and Luntaixiaobaixing presented low TA level at ripe stage (<0.4 mmol·L −1 H +), they are low acid cultivars ( Figure 2d). In contrast, the total soluble solids (TSS) of fruit increased from 6.7 to 20.47 Brix, TSS of all tested cultivars increased rapidly after turning stage ( Figure 2e). For almost all cultivars tested, the TSS increased to double the amount of turning stage at the full-ripe stage, and Danxing (DX) had the highest TSS. A similar trend in change was observed in the ratio of TSS/TA ( Figure 2f), the index increased slowly from 2.15 to 6.46 during early development period (S1 to S2), and then increased from 5.78 to 17.78 during the middle period (S3 to S4), at last increased rapidly from 17.78 to 49.75 (S4 to S5) during the ripening period. Fruit softened rapidly during development and ripening ( Figure 2g). The firmness of fruit for all cultivars tested declined from 47.83 to 2.15 N, and the firmness of all fruit tested was less than 6 N at the full-ripe stage. Danxing (DX) had the lowest firmness of the tested cultivars (2.15 N). The levels of ethylene production increased from stage 1 (S1) to stage 4 (S4), then decreased at the stage 5 (S5) ( Figure 2h), and an obvious peak of ethylene were observed at the stage 4 (S4) for all tested fruits (8.24–11.55 ng·kg −1·s −1). 2.2. Changes in Sugars during Fruit Development and Ripening As shown in  Figure 3a, all sugars including fructose, glucose, sucrose and total sugars kept increasing during the whole development period. From the turning stage (S3) to the full-ripe stage (S5), the sugar contents increased especially steeply. Trace sorbitol was detected in fruit tested at all developmental stages. Even though no significant differences of sugar content during the early development (from S1 to S2) were found in all tested fruits, significantly higher fructose was observed in Danxing (DX), Luntaixiaobaixing (LT) and Baixing than those in Hongyu (HY) and Yechengheiyexing (YC) during ripening (from S3 to S5). The content of all sugars identified and total sugars in Luntaixiaobaixing (LT) were found significantly higher than those in other cultivars during ripening. Though higher contents of fructose, glucose, sucrose and total sugars were found in Danxing (DX), Yechengheiyexing (YC) and Luntaixiaobaixing (LT) peels than their pulps during the whole development period, significantly lower level of sugars were found in Hongyuxing (HY) pulps than those in its peels. At the same time, no marked difference of sugar content was found between Bainxin peels and pulps during the whole development period. Therefore, the difference of sugar contents between peels and pulps may dependent on the cultivar. As for the ratio of sugars ( Figure 3b), on the whole, ratio of glucose in fruit decreased significantly during the whole development period, it decreased from 70.17% to 19.43% in peels and 70.17% to 19.17% in pulps of tested cultivars, respectively. However, glucose was the predominant sugar during the early development (from S1 to S3) and still accounted for 38.6%–71.42% of total sugar in peels and 45.08%–70.68% of total sugar in pulps. Similar to glucose, the ratio of fructose also decreased from 21.46% to 4.56% in peels and from 21.46% to 4.82% in pulps during the whole development period. As the second major sugar at the early stage, fructose accounted for 11.41%–21.46% of total sugar in peels and 13.1%–21.46% of total sugar in pulps. However, the ratio of sucrose increased from 10.98% to 69.92% in peels of tested cultivars and 10.98% to 72.22% in pulps of tested cultivars during the whole development period, and become the major sugar in all cultivars tested during ripening (from S3 to S5), accounting for 35.94%–69.92% of total sugars in peels and 27.55%–71.62% of total sugars. Glucose become the second major sugar during ripening, it represented 19.43%–55.64% of total sugar in peels and 19.17%–55.88% in pulps of cultivars tested. During the ripening period, fructose was found at the lowest level of all tested sugars, only accounting for 4.56%–12.14% in peels and 4.82%–16.57% in pulps of cultivars tested. 2.3. Changes in Organic Acids during Fruit Development and Ripening As shown in  Figure 4a, all organic acids including oxalate, tartrate, quinate, malate, citrate, fumarate and total organic acids mostly increased during the early stages of fruit development (from S1 to S3) and decreased until fruits were full-ripe (from S4 to S5). Oxalate, tartrate, quinate, malate, citrate, and fumarate decreased from 2.07 to 0.07 mg/g FW, from 1.56 to 0.12 mg/g FW, from 33.47 to 2.98 mg/g FW, from 27.72 to 6.44 mg/g FW, from 10.22–3.53 mg/g FW and from 0.03–0.01 mg/g FW, respectively. Quinate, malate and citrate were the predominant organic acids throughout the whole fruit development and ripening period. Oxalate and tartrate were found at lower levels, while trace fumarate was also detected in the fruit of cultivars tested during the whole development period. The content of quinate in HY, YH and LT increased to the peak at the turning stage of fruit development, whereas BX accumulated the largest amount of quinate at stage 2 (S2), then decreased to the lowest point at the full-ripe stage (S5). The level of quinate in DX almost kept deceasing throughout the whole development period. Except for HY, higher level of quinate in pulps were found than in peels. DX had the highest quinate content of all tested cultivars. YC and BX presented significantly lower level of quinate than other cultivars tested. Malate in DX, YC and BX increased to the highest level at stage 2 (S2), and then kept decreasing. Malate in DX and LT reached the highest level at stage 3 (S3) and stage 4 (S4). Higher level of malate in peels of DX, YC and LT were observed than in their pulps. A significantly lower level of malate was found in YC than other cultivars tested. The level of citrate kept increasing until stage 3 (S3) or stage 4 (S4) of fruit development, and then decreased at the full-ripe stage. HY presented the lowest level of citrate than other cultivars tested. Except for YC, oxalate generally decreased throughout the whole development period, and the lowest level of oxalate was found in HY. Significantly higher levels of oxalate were found in pulps than in peels. Tartrate was only detected in YC, LT, BX and DX peels, and the content of tartrate in peels tested increased to the highest level at stage 3 (S3), and then declined. Higher levels of tartrate in peels were observed than in pulps. Total acid had a similar trend to that of quinate. DX had significantly higher organic acids identified than other cultivars. As for the ratio ( Figure 4b), quinate, malate and citrate are the predominant organic acids in apricot regardless of developmental stage. Malate is the first major organic acid in apricot. The ratio of malate in fruit decreased from 71.97% to 34.14% in peels and 69.78% to 21.25% in pulps of cultivars tested, respectively. The ratio of quinate also decreased from 55.03% to 7.09% of total organic acids in peels and from 55.03% to 15.57% in pulps during development and ripening, respectively. However, the ratio of citrate increased significantly from 0% to 36.52% in peels and 0% to 45.98%, respectively. Quinate and malate account for more than 85% of total organic acids at the early stage, they are the major organic acids of fruit tested during early development. However, with the increase in the ratio of citrate in fruit, quinate, malate and citrate occupied 93% of total organic acids in both peels and pulps. The ratio of oxalate and tartrate to total organic acids was only 0%–6.47% and 0%–5.87%, respectively. From the ratio of individual organic acid to total organic acids, YC, LT and BX had a richer variety of organic acids than DX and HY. 2.4. Changes in Aroma Volatiles during Development and Ripening A total of 46 aroma compounds were identified, including eight aldehydes, five alcohols, seven esters, five norisoprenoids, eight lactones, ten terpenes and six acids ( Table S2). Among them, 18 aroma compounds, including three aldehydes (hexanal, ( Z)-3-hexenal, ( E, Z)-2,6-nonadienal), three apocarotenoids (β-damascenone, β-ionone, dihydro-β-ionone), five lactones (γ-octalactone, δ-octalactone, γ-decalactone, δ-decalactone, γ-dodecalactone), five terpenes (β-myrcene, linalool, α-terpineol, geraniol, limonene) and two esters (hexyl acetate, ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate), were the major aroma compounds in apricots by odor activity values (OVA) method. The OVAs of these 18 aroma compounds were more than 1 ( Table 2). γ-decalactone was the highest OVA compound in all cultivars tested, it ranged from 145 to 319 with the highest OVA in LT peel. β-ionone was the second major aroma compound in apricot fruit tested. It ranged from 40 to 506. The OVA of β-ionone in LT and BX were 4.65-16.09 times greater than those in other cultivars. γ-dodecalactone was the third major aroma compound and it ranged from 37.21 to 160 with the highest level in LT peel. High OVAs of β-damascenone (180) and hexyl acetate (183), ( E, Z)-2,6-nonadienal (319), and α-terpineol (103) were found in DX, whereas high OVAs of β-ionone (506), γ-dodecalactone (160), γ-decalactone (319) and hexyl acetate (183) was found in LT. Significantly higher OVAs were observed in peels than pulps for all cultivars tested. Changes in 18 major aroma compounds during the whole development period are given in  Figure 5. The contents of hexanal, ( Z)-3-hexenal and ( E, Z)-2,6-nonadienal decreased rapidly throughout the whole development period ( Figure 5a). The total aldehydes decreased from 1170 to 47.8 μg/kg FW. Significantly higher aldehydes were observed in peels than in pulps. As the most abundant aroma compounds in apricot, the contents of β-damascenone, β-ionone and dihydro-β-ionone increased dramatically during fruit ripening, especially the major apocarotenoids. The content of β-ionone increased from 155 to 1875 μg/kg FW in peels and from 30 to 1026 μg/kg FW in pulps of all cultivars tested. It is very interesting that the content of β-ionone, dihydro-β-ionone and total apocarotenoids in LT and BX were significantly higher than those in other cultivars, especially the β-ionone. Similarly, the contents of apocarotenoids in peels were significantly higher than those in the pulps of cultivars tested. Lactones were the second most abundant aroma compounds, and γ-decalactone was the predominant lactone, it ranged from 17.14 to 350.71 μg/kg FW in peels and 5–277.14 μg/kg FW in pulps, respectively. BX had the highest γ-decalactone in cultivars tested. Total lactones also increased rapidly during the ripening period. Conversely, β-myrcene, linalool, α-terpineol, geraniol and limonene all decreased through the ripening period. Linalool was the predominant terpene in these fruits, and it decreased from 987 to 122 μg/kg FW in peels and from 356 to 45 μg/kg FW in pulps during the whole development period. DX had the highest level of linalool and total terpenes during fruit ripening. Two major esters, hexyl acetate and ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, increased during the whole development period, especially as the predominant, ester hexyl acetate increased from 13 to 365 μg/kg FW in peels and 3 to 76 μg/kg FW in pulps, respectively. LT peel had the highest level of total esters. The contents of total aldehydes and terpenes in all cultivars decreased rapidly during fruit development and ripening, while the contents of total lactones and apocarotenoids kept increasing during this period ( Figure 5b). It is interesting that the contents of individual and total apocarotenoids in LT and BX were significantly higher than those in other cultivars in both peels and pulps ( Figure 5). On the whole, peels presented significantly individual or total aroma volatiles than pulps. 2.5. Effect of Flavor Compounds and Ripening on Consumer Acceptance The result showed that flavor compounds and sensory attributes account for 83% of total variability in consumer acceptability ( Figure 6a). Cultivar and development stage appeared to be the main differentiating factors. Fruits were clearly distributed in different locations in the score plot, based on the stage of cultivars or development variable. The DX, HY and YC were located on the lower left side of the PC1, and LT and BX on the right side of the PC1, while cultivar-stage points were clearly separated from the cultivar-stage points ( Figure 6a).  Figure 6b suggested that cultivar—stage DXS4, HYS4 and YCS4 were not the best fruit for consumers mainly due to high level of n-hexanal, malic acid, organic acid content and high sourness; whereas LTS5, BXS5, especially LTS5, were the best mainly due to high contents of β-ionone, γ-decalactone, sucrose, citrate, sweetness, aroma and flavor ( Figure 6b,c). These results suggested that excellent flavor quality and consumer acceptability have a positive relationship with the levels of these above parameters. 2.6. Enzymes Involved in Flavor Compound Metabolism during Development and Ripening Nine enzymes involved in sugar metabolism were analyzed in apricot fruit during the whole development process ( Figure 7a). With regard to enzymes involved in sucrose accumulation, significant increase of activities in sucrose synthase (SS) responsible for synthesis direction (SSthy) and sucrose phosphatesynthase (SPS) were found throughout the whole development process. A significant increase of activity in SS responsible for degradation direction (SSca) was also observed during the development process, although to a lesser extent than SSthy and SPS. Significantly higher levels of SSthy, SPS and SSca were found in LT than those in other cultivars. In addition to synthesis, sucrose can also be cleaved by neutral invertase (NI) and acid invertase (AI), no significant changes were found for these enzymes. Sorbitol can be inverted into fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), and a significant increase SDH enzyme activity was observed during the whole development period ( Figure 7b). Fructose can be cleaved by fructokinase (FK), nevertheless, no significant change was found during ripening process ( Figure 7b). In addition, sorbitol can be also oxidized into glucose by sorbitol oxidase (SO), and a significant increase was found during whole development period ( Figure 7c). In contrast, glucose can be cleaved by glucokinase (GK), however, no significant change was observed in the enzyme activity. For all cultivars tested, no significant differences in the nine enzymes for sugar metabolism were observed between peels and pulps. Six enzymes involved in organic acid metabolism were analyzed in apricot during the fruit development and ripening process. Quinate dehydrogenase (QH) is responsible for converting 3-dehydroquinate into quinate, and significant decrease was found in apricot during fruit development process ( Figure 7d). With regard to malate, malate synthase (MS) is the key enzyme for synthesis, and a significant decrease in its activity was observed throughout the whole development process, which was consistent with the decrease of malate content ( Figure 7e). Significantly higher levels of MS enzyme activity was found in YC fruit than in other cultivars. Malate can also be metabolized by NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), and NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME), and a significant increase in these enzymes were found in cultivars tested in both peels and pulps, which leads to the decease of malate content during the development and ripening process ( Figure 7e). Citrate synthase (CS) mainly is responsible for the citrate biosynthesis, and the activity was induced significantly during fruit development and ripening ( Figure 7f). It is reported that glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity participates in regulating cytosolic pH, while no significant change in GAD activity was found in apricot throughout whole development process ( Figure 7f). Similar to the enzymes of sugar metabolism, no significant differences in the six enzymes for organic acid metabolism were observed between peels and pulps. Significant increase of lipoxygenases (LOX), hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), alcohol acyl-transferases (AAT), Acyl-CoA Oxidase (ACX) activities were found throughout the whole development period of apricot fruit ( Figure 7g–j). Similar remarkable increase trend was observed in peels or pulps of apricot tested during fruit development process. A rapid significant increase in carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCD) activity was found during fruit development process in both peels or pulps tested ( Figure 7k), whereas the terpene synthase (TPS) activity decreased significantly during this process ( Figure 7l). On the whole, the enzyme activities of aroma volatiles metabolism in peels were significantly higher than those in pulps of all cultivars tested. 2.7. Correlation between Enzymatic Capacities and Flavor Compound Accumulation To search for possible links between enzymatic activities and flavor compounds accumulation, a Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed. As seen in  Figure 8a, the contents of fructose, glucose and sucrose are significantly positively correlated with SPS activity ( p < 0.01). Similarly, a significant positive correlation was observed between the contents of sucrose, total sugars and Ssthy activity ( p < 0.01). In contrast, a significant negative correlation was found between the contents of sucrose, total sugars and Ssca activity. No other significant correlations were found between the enzyme activities of sugar metabolism and sugar accumulation. Regarding organic acids ( Figure 8b), the content of malate was significantly positively correlated with MS activity, but negatively with NADP-ME and NAD-ME activities ( p < 0.01). The content of citrate was significantly positively correlated with CS activity, but negatively with GAD activity ( p < 0.01). As shown in  Figure 8c, ester and lactone accumulation is significantly positively correlated with LOX, HPL, ADH, AAT and ACX activities ( p < 0.01), however, significant negative correlations were found between the content of aldehydes and ADH activity. The contents of apocarotenoids and terpenes are significantly positively correlated with CCD and TPS activities, respectively.","Sugars, organic acids and volatiles of apricot were determined by HPLC and GC-MS during fruit development and ripening, and the key taste and aroma components were identified by integrating flavor compound contents with consumers' evaluation. Sucrose and glucose were the major sugars in apricot fruit. The contents of all sugars increased rapidly, and the accumulation pattern of sugars converted from glucose-predominated to sucrose-predominated during fruit development and ripening. Sucrose synthase (SS), sorbitol oxidase (SO) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) are under tight developmental control and they might play important roles in sugar accumulation. Almost all organic acids identified increased during early development and then decrease rapidly. During early development, fruit mainly accumulated quinate and malate, with the increase of citrate after maturation, and quinate, malate and citrate were the predominant organic acids at the ripening stage. The odor activity values (OAV) of aroma volatiles showed that 18 aroma compounds were the characteristic components of apricot fruit. Aldehydes and terpenes decreased significantly during the whole development period, whereas lactones and apocarotenoids significantly increased with fruit ripening. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) results revealed that β-ionone, γ-decalactone, sucrose and citrate are the key characteristic flavor factors contributing to consumer acceptance. Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCD) may be involved in β-ionone formation in apricot fruit.","['Metabolites', 'Fruit quality', 'Apricot', 'Organic acids', 'Flavor', 'Volatiles', 'Sugars']","['Figure', 'Development', 'development period', 'Fruit Development', 'cultivars tested', 'peels', 'cultivars', 'fruit', 'tested', 'Ripening']","[S4, S5, g.

We show here that bacteria from ocean sediments can also release complex bouquets of volatiles. The actinomycete Salinispora tropica produces cyclohexenyl compounds not previously known in nature, such as methyl cyclohex-2-ene-1-carboxylate (9), methyl 2-(cyclohex-2-en-1-yl)acetate (10), methyl (E/Z)-2-(cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)acetate (11/12), and related alcohols 8 and 13. These compounds were identified by GC/MS and confirmed by synthesis. In addition, rare spiroacetals, aromatic compounds, short-chain acids and esters, alcohols, and various cyclic compounds were produced by the bacteria. The biosynthesis of the cyclohexenyl compounds is closely coupled to that of cyclohexenylalanine (4), a building block of salinosporamide A, a proteasome inhibitor produced by S. tropica. Analysis of S. tropica strains that harbor knockouts of the salinosporamide biosynthetic genes salX and salD, coupled with feeding experiments, revealed that 3-(cyclohex-2-en-1-yl)-2-oxopropanoic acid (60) and 3-(cyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)-2-oxopropanoic acid (isomers 61 and 62) are important intermediates in the biosynthesis of salinosporamide A, 4, and 8-13.","['Amino acids', 'Natural products', 'marine bacteria', 'actinomycetes', 'Spiroacetals']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN
40,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5234130\eupmc_result.json,PMC5234130,"Results and discussion De novo assembly and functional annotation De novo RNA-seq approach facilitates analysis of transcriptome for an organism without sequenced genome such as rose-scented geranium [ 21]. Transcriptome sequencing of rose-scented geranium foliage on Illumina platform generated a total of 16.05 million raw reads. The filtered reads were deposited in NCBI Short Read Achieve (SRA) database under accession number SRP078041. A total of 15.44 million high quality reads were  de novo assembled into 78,943 nonredundant contigs (>200 bp length), with an average length of 623 bp and N50 length of 752 bp (Table  1). The total size of the assembled transcriptome was amounted as 49.23 Mb, with average GC content of 44.97%. Majority of the contigs (53.92%) had 200 to 500 bp lengths. The lengths of 30.86% contigs (24,366) were ranged from 501 to 1000 bp, followed by 14.98% contigs (11,826) of 1001–3000 bp. Only 24 transcripts were detected in the range of 4001–7500 bp (Fig.  2). All the transcripts of the rose-scented geranium were searched (BLASTx) against known proteins in NR database, annotating a total of 51,802 contigs. A total of 611 plant species contributed the annotated contigs in the top-scoring BLASTx hits against NR protein database (Additional file  3). Out of these, top five species that contributed the greatest number of annotated contigs were  Vitis vinifera,  Theobroma cacao, Jatropha curcas,  Citrus sinensis, and  Ricinus communis (Fig.  3). The results provided transcript sequence information, their expression and putative function of the genes expressed in the leaves of rose-scented geranium (Additional file  3) . The transcriptome data is a useful resource for identifying genes with putative roles in various biochemical activities and pathways in the volatile oil plant.  Functional categorization The contigs having sequence homology with uniprot annotations were subjected to GO assignments under biological processes, cellular component and molecular function categories. A total of 25,776 transcripts were assigned to at least one GO term (Additional file  4). In the category of biological processes, transcripts related to transcription regulation, translation, carbohydrate metabolic process, transmembrane and intracellular protein transports were predominant. In molecular functions, genes involved in ATP binding, DNA binding, zinc ion binding, nucleic acid binding and structural constituent of ribosome were abundantly expressed. In cellular components, genes related to integral component of membrane, nucleus, intracellular, cytoplasm and ribosome were the most abundant classes (Additional file  1: Figure S2). A total of 54,104 rose-scented geranium contigs could be mapped to 12,381 non-redundant  A. thaliana protein sequences (Additional file  5). The orthologous  A. thaliana gene ids were used to perform MapMan analysis. MapMan results visualized significant representation of genes associated with secondary metabolic biosynthesis pathways as terpenes, flavonoids, and phenylpropanoids (Additional file  1: Figures S3 and S4). The secondary metabolites participate in active defense mechanism of plants providing protection from a wide range of stresses [ 25]. Accordingly, MapMan analysis revealed putative genes quoted as involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses (Additional file  1: Figure S5). Terpene biosynthesis Rose-scented geranium produces essential oil, containing fragrant as well as other specialized metabolites with antioxidant, antimicrobial, and human health-promoting effects, in specialized tissues of leaves known as glandular trichomes. Terpenes are the largest and the most diverse class of natural products, and constitute a major component of essential oil in rose-scented geranium. They are produced as a homologous series of molecules as polymers of isoprene, the C 5 precursor molecules being IPP and/or DMAPP that are generated via the process of isoprenogenesis [ 11,  26]. In plants, isoprenogenesis occurs through two discrete biosynthetic pathways: the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway in cytosol and the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (MEP/DOXP) pathway in plastids. Their relative contribution for isoprenes, to be used in terpenoid biosynthesis, depends on many factors such as specific sub-classes of terpenoids, specific terpenoidal molecules, quantitative level of production and environmental conditions. Generally, the MEP/DOXP pathway generates monoterpenes and diterpenes, whereas the MVA pathway is largely responsible to produce sesquiterpenes and triterpenes [ 27]. However, there are exceptions to this generalization and exchange of precursors as well between the two pathways [ 28], for example, the MEP/DOXP pathway synthesizes sesquiterpenes along with monoterpenes in  Antirrhinum majus [ 29]. In MVA pathway, IPP is biosynthesized by sequential actions of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase/acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT), hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA synthase (HMGS), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), mevalonate kinase (MVK), phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MVD) (Fig.  4). AACT condenses two molecules of acetyl CoA to biosynthesize acetoacetyl CoA, and then HMGS combines acetyl CoA with acetoacetyl CoA generating hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) [ 30]. The transcriptome analysis identified three unique putative genes for AACT (e-value: 1e −48 to 0) and four for HMGS (e-value: 1e −30 to 0) in rose-scented geranium. A total of thirteen unique putative transcripts represented NADPH-dependent enzyme- HMGR (e-value: 3e −21 to 0) in rose-scented geranium, which catalyzes the biosynthesis of mevalonate from HMG-CoA [ 17,  31]. The sequence analysis of putative AACT, HMGS and HMGR genes suggested that they contain full-length open reading frames (ORFs). Mevalonate is transformed into mevalonate 5- di phosphate by two phosphorylation reactions catalyzed by MVK and PMK. Thereafter, MVD converts mevalonate 5- di phosphate into the key isoprene unit, IPP. The transcriptome examination revealed homologies with four MVK (e-value: 2e −41 to 6e −126), one PMK (e-value: 2e −41 to 3e −52), and two MVD (e-value: 2e −47 to 9e −51) putative unique genes. IPP is enzymatically isomerized into DMAPP by isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI), and thus providing two types of phosphorylated isoprenes (IPP and DMAPP) for isoprenoid biosynthesis. The transcriptome analysis identified five representative contigs for IDI (e-value: 1e −56 to 5e −129). Sequence analysis suggested presence of complete ORFs in the putative IDI gene.  In DOXP pathway, biosynthesis of IPP or DMAPP involves seven enzymatic steps (Fig.  4). The condensation of pyruvate and D -glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) is catalyzed by 1-deoxy- D -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), producing 1-deoxy- D -xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) that is transformed into 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) by 1-deoxy- D -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) or MEP synthase [ 17]. A total of 9 and 8 unique putative genes were identified related to DXS (e-value: 2e −24 to 0) and DXR (e-value: 3e −29 to 0), respectively. Computational analysis predicted full-length sequences of the candidate protein-coding DXS and DXR genes. The enzyme 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (MCT) catalyzes conversion of MEP into 4-(cytidine 5′ -diphospho)-2-C-methyl- D-erythritol (CDP-ME), which is then transformed into 2-phospho 4- (cytidine 5′ -diphospho) 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol (CDP-ME2P) by 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (CMK). The enzymatic actions of 2-C-methyl- D -erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MDS) and (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate synthase (HDS) causes sequential conversion of CDP-ME2P into C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (ME 2,4 cPP), and then 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate (HMBPP). Finally, biosynthesis of IPP happens from HMBPP by (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HDR) [ 30]. The transcriptome investigation identified three unique putative contigs for CMK (e-value: 2e −17 to 5e −146), two for MDS (e-value: 1e −29 to 3e −91), three for HDS (e-value: 1e −41 to 6e −77), and five for HDR (e-value: 7e −27 to 4e −110). The putative CMK and MDS genes showed full-length ORFs in sequence analysis. The C5 units, IPP or DMAPP, may be linked together by head to tail condensation reaction resulting terpenes of different classes e.g. mono, sesqui, di and triterpenes. The first condensation step of IPP and DMPP is catalyzed by geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS), synthesizing geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP). GPP is substrate for monoterpene biosynthesis by enzymatic actions of monoterpene synthases (MTPS), such as geraniol synthase and linalool synthase. Catalysis of sequential coupling of IPP units to GPP results farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) by farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) enzymes, respectively. FPP and GGPP are substrates for sesquiterpene and diterpene biosynthesis, catalyzed by sesquiterpene synthases (STPS) and diterpene synthases (DTPS) [ 32,  33]. The transcriptional profiling identified two representative unique transcripts for GPPS (e-value: 1e −54 to 2e −146), three for FPPS (e-value: 2e −56 to 8e −155), ten for GGPPS (e-value: 5e −21 to 2e −164), thirteen for MTPS (e-value: 1e −32 to 0), five for STPS (e-value: 9e −20 to 6e −166), and ten unique contigs for DTPS (e-value: 3e −14 to 1e −106). Full-length sequences were obtained in case of the candidate genes for GGPPS, MTPS (ocimene synthase) and STPS (germacrene D synthase). The essential oil of rose scented geranium contains several mono-, di and sesquiterpenes. The main components which determine its aroma are citronellol, geraniol, linalool and their esters [ 34]. In addition, significant quantities of isomenthone, menthone, nerol,  cis-and  trans-rose oxides, α-terpineol, α -pinene, myrcene, and β-phyllandrene contributes to its aroma [ 26]. In agreement with the aroma profile of this plant, significant level of expression was observed for the putative genes encoding geraniol synthase, linalool synthase, myrcene synthase, β-ocimene synthase, limonene synthase, germacrene synthase, nerolidol synthase, cadinene synthase, copalyl diphosphate synthase, kaurene synthase, and BAHD acyltransferase. In the annotated rose-scented geranium leaf transcriptome, a total of 158 contigs were mapped on 103 unique proteins involved in terpene biosynthesis, with significantly low e-value (Fig.  4; Additional file  6). The putative protein-coding genes exhibited presence of conserved ORFs, and many of them were likely to contain complete ORFs, suggesting identification of relevant transcripts involved in the terpene biosynthetic pathways. The putative genes involved in downstream steps of the MEP pathway exhibited relatively higher expression as compared to the MVA pathway (Additional file  6), which is in agreement with abundance of monoterpene hydrocarbons in essential oil of geranium plants [ 5,  27]. The sequence information and transcriptional pattern of the putative genes would be useful in understanding molecular mechanism and engineering of terpene biosynthesis in rose-scented geranium . Tartaric acid biosynthesis pathway The plant-derived metabolite, tartaric acid, is of high human value as a vital antioxidant and flavorant in food products. Recently, our group established a process for production of scented natural tartaric acid from rose-scented geranium biomass  per se or from residual water after hydro-distillation of the geranium foliage [ 13]. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C), the most abundant soluble antioxidant in cells of higher plants, is a putative biosynthetic precursor in the formation of tartaric acid. Tartaric acid biosynthesis is the result of catabolism of the six-carbon ascorbic acid. The hydrolysis of ascorbic acid may follow cleavage between the carbon atoms 2 and 3 or 4 and 5, with still unresolved plant-species specific preference of the alternative cleavage pathways [ 35]. The 2–3 cleavage in ascorbic acid results oxalic acid and threonic acid, further oxidizes into tartaric acid [ 36]. Alternatively, ascorbic acid is converted to idonic acid, and the latter into an intermediate compound 5-keto D-gluconic acid by the action of an enzyme called idonate dehydrogenase. The intermediate compound is then cleaved between carbon atoms 4 and 5 resulting tartaric acid [ 12]. Though, intermediates of tartarate biosynthesis from ascorbic acid have been characterized chemically, enzymes catalyzing all the reactions are yet to be identified. Geraniaceae family plants have been suggested to follow C2-C3 cleavage in ascorbic acid during tartarate biosynthesis [ 12,  35,  36]. However, no enzymatic or genomic information about the metabolic steps is known. The transcriptome analysis of rose-scented geranium notified substantial level of expression for idonate dehydrogenase (IDH) (Fig.  5). The sequence analysis of IDH gene revealed 80% protein sequence identity with that of  Vitis venifera (XP_010662490) at 99% query coverage and zero e-value. As IDH is involved in C4-C5 cleavage of ascorbate [ 35], the findings indicate the possibility of operation of both the C2/C3 and C4/C5 pathways of ascorbic acid hydrolysis for tartarate biosynthesis in rose-scented geranium . Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway is the principal route for biogenesis of the precursor multifunctional metabolite ascorbic acid in higher plants [ 37,  38] . Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway is based on photosynthesis-based carbon flux and catalyzed by a series of enzymes, such as GDP-D-mannose 3′, 5′ epimerase (ME), GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (GP), L-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase (GPP), L-galactose dehydrogenase (GD), and L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GLDH) [ 39]. The transcriptome investigation identified six unique putative genes representing ME (e-value: 8e −47 to 0), four for GP (e-value: 1e −24 to 2e −117), one for GPP (e-value: 8e −46 to 9e −64), sixteen for GD (e-value: 1e −28 to 0), and one putative gene for GLDH (e-value: 2e −122 to 0). Full-length transcripts with relevant putative ORFs were obtained for the aforementioned key enzymes involved in ascorbate biosynthesis. Transcripts were also identified for two other ascorbic acid biosynthetic routes arising from  myo-inositol and pectin (Fig.  5), as reported in few plants [ 35]. A total of 189 contigs could be mapped on 130 unique genes belonging to ascorbic acid and tartaric acid biosynthesis (Additional file  7). Anacardic acid biosynthesis pathway Anacardic acid (2-hydroxy-6-alkylbenzoic acid) is a dietary and medicinal phytochemical structurally similar to salicylic acid. It has been reported to be produced in glandular trichomes of Geraniaceae plants, conferring pest resistance [ 40– 42]. Pest resistant and susceptible genotypes exhibit predominance of unsaturated (22:1 ώ 5 and 24:1 ώ 5) and saturated (22:0 and 24:0) anacardic acid, respectively [ 40,  43]. The biosynthesis of anacardic acid could happen through polyketide mechanism using fatty acids as precursor molecules [ 41,  44]. Carbon elongation in anacardic acid is achieved by utilizing acetate units derived from malonyl-CoA. Acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] desaturase and type III polyketide synthase (PKS), a muilti module protein, catalyzes condensation reaction steps of anacardic acid biosynthesis [ 41]. In transcriptome data, a total of 114 contigs were identified, with substantial level of expression, showing homology with thirteen type-III PKS (e-value: 3e −19 to 0) and six Acyl ACP desaturase (e-value: 1e −53 to 5e −175) putative genes (Fig.  6; Additional file  8). However, their involvement as candidate genes in anacardic acid biosynthesis need to be further validated.  Putative genes for transcription factors and hormones Transcription factors (TFs) modulate, qualitative and quantitative transcriptional behavior of genes at spatial and temporal level regulating various metabolic pathways. The rose-scented geranium contigs were annotated against all plant TFs. A total of 15,666 contigs were mapped on 3,440 all plant TF genes at an e-value cut-off of 1e −5 (Additional file  9). The putative genes for the TF families- bHLH, MYB, WRKY, C2H2, CH, NAC, MYB-related, GRAS, FAR1, and bZIP were significantly abundant in the transcriptome data (Fig.  7a). The TFs belonging to bHLH, MYB, AP2/ERF, and WRKY families execute key roles in regulation of biosynthesis of terpenes, which is the largest secondary metabolite family [ 45– 49]. Some of the TF genes have been characterized for regulating biosynthesis of terpene secondary metabolites in different plants e.g.  AaWRKY1,  AaERF1,  AaERF2,  AaORA1,  AabZIP1,  GaWRKY1,  TaWRKY1,  HbEREBP1,  HbWRKY1,  OsTGAP1, and  MsYABBY5 [ 50]. Transcripts were identified for orthologous putative genes of these TFs (e-value: 3e −8 to 0) in the transcriptome data (Fig.  7b; Additional file  9). Some of the putative TFs exhibited presence of complete ORFs in the sequence e.g.  AaWRKY1, AabZIP1, GaWRKY1,  HbWRKY1, and  MsYABBY5. These could be potential candidates for metabolic engineering and improvement of the production of secondary metabolites in rose-scented geranium . Signaling molecules known as phytohormones regulate the plant development and physiological processes, and responses to environment and endogenous factors. In the transcriptome data, a total of 9,453 rose-scented geranium transcripts were matched with 516 protein sequences (e-value >1e −5) of  A. thaliana belonging to different hormones: abscisic acid, auxin, ethylene, brassinosteroid, salicylic acid, gibberellin, cytokinin, and jasmonic acid (Fig.  8; Additional file  10). When analyzed hormone related transcripts with ≥ 5 Log2 FPKM, orthologous genes for abscisic acid, ethylene, auxin and brassinosteroids were found most abundant, followed by salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and gibberellin (Additional file  10). Plant hormones such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid have been noted as potential elicitors of secondary metabolite biosynthesis [ 48,  51].  The sequence and transcriptional pattern information of TFs and hormones would be useful in understanding secondary metabolism as well as engineering of biosynthesis of value-added compounds (e.g. terpene and tartaric acid) in rose-scented geranium. SSR detection Simple sequence repeats (SSR) are locus-specific, co-dominant, abundant in genome, and multiallelic molecular markers with high rates of transferability across the species [ 52,  53]. Mining of SSRs was carried out to enable the development of molecular markers in rose-scented geranium . In total, 6040 SSR motifs (mono to hexa nucleotides) were identified in 5380 contigs (Additional file  11), which corresponds to 6.8% of the total unique transcripts. The result agrees with previous studies reporting approximately 3–7% of expressed sequences with putative SSR motifs [ 54]. Out of these analyzed transcripts, 571 contained more than one SSR, whereas, 316 were in compound form (Table  2). The highest frequency of SSR was of tri-nucleotide (50%), followed by di- (28.13%) and mono-nucleotide (18.95%), as represented in Table  2. These SSR motifs could be potential candidates for development of transcript based microsatellite marker, helpful in analyzing molecular mapping, marker assisted selection, and functional genetic variation in rose-scented geranium and related  Pelargonium species.  Assembly validation The  de novo transcriptome assembly, done by Trinity assembler tools, was validated by using standard PCR. End-to-end primers were designed using sequences of four randomly selected putative genes of different size  viz 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (689 bp), GDP mannose 3′, 5′ epimerase (799 bp), WRKY-4 (992 bp) and zeaxanthin epoxidase (369 bp). PCR assay, using first strand cDNA of rose scented geranium leaf as template, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis yielded amplicons of expected size of the respective transcripts (369 to 992 bp), validating transcriptome assembly (Additional file  1: Figure S6). Validation of putative gene expression via semi-quantitative and real-time PCR To validate the expression of putative genes in RNA-seq data, semi-quantitative and real-time PCR analyses were performed for selected transcripts belonging to terpene and tartaric acid pathways, transcription factor and hormone regulation. The comparative analysis revealed similar expression pattern as observed in transcriptome analysis (Fig.  9; Additional file  1: Figure S7). "," Background Rose-scented geranium (Pelargonium sp.) is a perennial herb that produces a high value essential oil of fragrant significance due to the characteristic compositional blend of rose-oxide and acyclic monoterpenoids in foliage. Recently, the plant has also been shown to produce tartaric acid in leaf tissues. Rose-scented geranium represents top-tier cash crop in terms of economic returns and significance of the plant and plant products. However, there has hardly been any study on its metabolism and functional genomics, nor any genomic expression dataset resource is available in public domain. Therefore, to begin the gains in molecular understanding of specialized metabolic pathways of the plant, de novo sequencing of rose-scented geranium leaf transcriptome, transcript assembly, annotation, expression profiling as well as their validation were carried out. Results De novo transcriptome analysis resulted a total of 78,943 unique contigs (average length: 623 bp, and N50 length: 752 bp) from 15.44 million high quality raw reads. In silico functional annotation led to the identification of several putative genes representing terpene, ascorbic acid and tartaric acid biosynthetic pathways, hormone metabolism, and transcription factors. Additionally, a total of 6,040 simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs were identified in 6.8% of the expressed transcripts. The highest frequency of SSR was of tri-nucleotides (50%). Further, transcriptome assembly was validated for randomly selected putative genes by standard PCR-based approach. In silico expression profile of assembled contigs were validated by real-time PCR analysis of selected transcripts.

41,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5281624\eupmc_result.json,PMC5281624,"Results Heat treatment and berry temperature recording HT was applied locally on clusters of Cabernet Sauvignon fruiting cuttings at 3 developmental stages, namely middle-green, veraison and middle-ripening (Figure  1A). Three different sets of 25 plants per condition (control or HT) were used for each developmental stage. HT was applied every day during 14 d from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. to mimic usual daytime temperature course of sunlight-exposed berries. Under control conditions, average daytime berry flesh temperature measured were 26.5°C ± 1.4 (control green stage, GC clusters), 25.8°C ± 2.2 (control veraison stage, VC clusters), and 26.2°C ± 2.5 (control ripe stage, RC clusters). HT increased the average daytime pulp temperature to 34.7 ± 1.4°C, 33.7 ± 1.9°C, and 35.2 ± 2.5°C for GHT, VHT, and RHT clusters respectively (Figure  1B). Depending on the developmental stage, this experimental set-up led to average pulp temperature differences of 8.2°C ± 1.3 (GHT vs. GC), 7.9°C ± 1.1 (VHT vs. VC) and 9.0°C ± 0.8 (RHT vs. RC) between heat-treated and control berries (Figure  1B). The HT imposed during the herbaceous stage delayed the onset of anthocyanin accumulation by 2 to 3 weeks (GHT  vs GC berries), (Figure  2A). Furthermore, for control clusters 4 weeks were needed to reach complete color turning stage (100% clusters ( n = 25) while at least one additional week was required to reach the same stage in the heated clusters. However, even at the last stage, the percentage of uncolored berries per cluster (46%) remained much higher than in control clusters (8%) (Figure  2C). A similar delay in the increase in total soluble solids (TSS) content was also observed in stressed berries (Figure  2B) while the average berry weight was not affected by the treatments (data not shown). Biochemical analysis of the treated berries The biochemical content of berries collected at harvest from control fruiting cuttings was compared with that of berries exposed to a 2-week period HT at 3 different developmental stages (Table  1). The berry hexose content (glucose and fructose) at harvest was not affected whenever the fruit-localized HT took place. By contrast, applying HT at veraison and to a lesser extent at ripening stage decreased malate content while tartrate content was slightly higher in VHT clusters than in other samples. In the present study, 20 amino acids including the non-proteinogenic ones were quantified. The concentration of 7 amino acids (THR, ARG, TYR, PHE, CYS, LYS, GABA) was significantly increased by a HT applied at veraison or ripening stages. Conversely, the PRO amount decreased dramatically after mid-ripening treatment (Table  1). The total anthocyanin concentration (TSA) in berry skin at harvest was reduced by about 50% in VHT and RHT when compared to control and GHT berries (Table  1). Interestingly, the GHT berries that colored later (Figure  1, Supplementary data) displayed a TSA comparable to control berries at harvest. Cabernet Sauvignon berries contained higher amounts of tri-hydroxylated anthocyanins than di-hydroxylated ones in both control and heated conditions. Heat exposure preferentially decreased the proportion of dihydroxylated anthocyanins, regardless of the period of HT treatment (Table  1). Acylated anthocyanins represented a higher proportion of the total anthocyanin pool in HT berries (Table  1). The concentration of malvidin-3- O-glucoside, which is the most abundant anthocyanin in Cabernet Sauvignon berries (Dimitrovska et al.,  2011; Lorrain et al.,  2011) remained unaffected at harvest whereas the amount of one of its acylated forms (malvidin-3- O-(6′-acetyl)-glucoside) was significantly increased in GHT clusters. By contrast, the concentrations of dephinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and of their 3-acetyl-glucoside derivatives were severely reduced by heat irrespectively of the period of treatment in GHT, VHT and RHT berries. The inhibiting effect of HT on the corresponding 3-coumaroyl-glucoside derivatives was less pronounced. Alteration of global berry transcriptome in response to localized heat treatment Principal component analysis of the whole normalized gene expression dataset showed that the 3 replicates of each experimental condition are well-grouped and therefore adequate for further analysis (Figure  3; Supplementary Figure  1). Principal component 1 (PC1) and PC2 explained 26% of the total variance in gene expression and can be attributed to development. PC1 (18.9%) clearly separated the green stage from both veraison and ripening stages, whereas separation between veraison and the two other stages can be distinguished on PC2 (7.1%) (Supplementary Figure  1). PC3 explained 6.2% of the total variance and splits HT from control samples in a similar proportion whatever the developmental stage. Finally, the samples were clearly separated according to the treatment duration, potentially reflecting a developmental dependent response (Figure  3). A total of 7518 transcripts were differentially expressed (fold change > 2,  p-value adj. < 0.05) in at least one of the 9 conditions (Supplementary Table  1), corresponding to 25.4% of the unigenes represented on the microarray slide. The overlaps in DEGs under these nine conditions were depicted with 3-way Venn diagrams, according to developmental stage (Figure  4A) or stress duration (Figure  4B). The strongest HT effect was observed for the herbaceous stage with 5287 DEGs, compared to 4122 and 5061 DEGs identified after HT exposure at veraison and ripening stage, respectively (Figure  4A; Supplementary Table  2). A total number of 4141, 6612, and 3717 genes were deregulated after 1, 7, and 14 days of HT, respectively (Figure  4B; Supplementary Table  2). Except for one condition (V14D), the number of up-regulated genes was always higher than the number of down-regulated genes. The strongest HT effect was observed at G7D with 4024 DEGs (2135 up-regulated and 1889 down-regulated genes, 7 and 6% of the grapevine unigenes, respectively) whereas the smallest effect (577 DEGs) was observed in G1D. The comparison of all 9 conditions showed that only 36 genes were steadily induced under HT condition whereas continuously down-regulated transcripts were not found (Supplementary Table  3). These genes will be further considered in the discussion section below. Identification of significantly altered functional categories according to the stage and the treatment duration To gain insight into the functional categories impacted by HT, the 7518 DEGs were distributed into 35 MapMan functional categories, the so-called BINs (Usadel et al.,  2005). The proportion of DEGs representing each category was determined for each of the nine experimental conditions (Figure  5). Functional enrichment analysis was performed to better identify the significantly altered functional categories according to the stage and the stress duration. HT triggered a wide range of effects on the berry transcriptome (Figure  5; Supplementary Table  4). Twenty-seven of the 35 MapMan BINs were significantly altered in HT berries in at least one condition, but only 3 functional categories, namely “Stress” (BIN 20), “Protein” (BIN 29) and “Secondary metabolism” (BIN 16), were profoundly affected in all 9 conditions. The 24 other categories were differentially affected according to the developmental stage and the stress duration, and particularly correspond to Photosynthesis (BIN 1), Cell wall (BIN 10), Hormone metabolism (BIN 17), RNA (BIN 27), DNA (BIN 28), Signaling (BIN 30), and Transport (BIN 34). “Stress” -associated BIN Four hundred twenty seven DEGs were related to the functional category “Stress” and mainly belonged to the “abiotic/heat stress” cluster (Supplementary Table  5; 98 out of the 427 “Stress” DEGs). Most of the transcripts associated to “heat stress” category were predominantly up-regulated (Supplementary Figure  2A) and belong to the HSP family (Heat Shock Protein). Transcripts encoding universal stress proteins (USPs; VIT_17s0000g04260, VIT_04s0079g00610, VIT_08s0032g00590) also accumulated in response to HT. “Protein” -associated BIN HT deeply affects protein homeostasis. Indeed, numerous HSP and chaperones genes were up-regulated in HT berries (Supplementary Tables  5,  6). These proteins play an important role in protein-protein interactions (Kotak et al.,  2007a; Bokszczanin and Fragkostefanakis,  2013). The abundance of several FK506-binding protein (FKBP) related transcripts was also increased by HT (VIT_19s0015g01100, VIT_07s0031g01150, VIT_08s0007g04340, VIT_13s0064g00580, VIT_01s0011g00930, VIT_00s0260g00070). These proteins belong to the large family of peptidyl prolyl cis–trans isomerases that can function as chaperones. Protein synthesis and degradation were also strongly affected in heated berries as suggested by the 60 DEGs linked to protein synthesis category and the 348 genes belonging to proteolysis (Supplementary Tables  5,  6). Protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays an essential role in diverse cellular pathways, cell-cycle progression, DNA repair, and degradation of damaged proteins as well as in signal transduction. Particularly, UPS components are major players in plant acclimation to abiotic stresses (Stone,  2014; Guerra et al.,  2015). In the present study, 167 transcripts potentially linked to the ubiquitin machinery were deregulated after HT (102 up-, 56 down-, 9 both up- and down-regulated transcripts; Supplementary Table  6). Most of these DEGs encode different putative ubiquitin ligases (E3). Orthologs of each of the 3 major E3 classes (namely RING-type (Really Interesting New Gene); HECT-type (Homology to E6-Associated Carboxyl- Terminus), and U-box-type) were up-regulated in heat-stressed berries. While some E3-like transcripts accumulated whatever the developmental stage (VIT_09s0002g00220, VIT_12s0034g01390, VIT_05s0124g00230, VIT_06s0009g03670, VIT_08s0040g02600, VIT_19s0027g00320), most of these were transiently or specifically deregulated at a particular stage. For instance, some E3-related transcripts were only HT up-regulated during the herbaceous stage (VIT_17s0000g09790, VIT_18s0041g01090, VIT_14s0068g02150, VIT_14s0066g02580, VIT_08s0056g01410) whereas others responded to HT during veraison or ripening stages (VIT_19s0015g00660, VIT_01s0011g02950, VIT_01s0026g00300, VIT_07s0005g01360, VIT_08s0007g04790, VIT_18s0001g02280, VIT_00s0160g00270, VIT_18s0001g06220). Furthermore, the CRL group (Cullin based Ring E3 ligases), corresponding to the largest class of ubiquitin ligases (Stone,  2014), and especially the CUL1 based E3s, [also referred to as Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF)] were strongly impacted by HT. Indeed, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis adaptor protein S-Phase kinase-associated protein (SKP; VIT_03s0038g02480) and many F-box proteins are up-regulated at the transcriptional level upon HT. “Secondary metabolism” -associated BIN While many structural genes were transcriptionally affected in HT berries, the positive regulatory genes identified so far in grapevine were either weakly ( VviMYBPA1, VviMYB14, VviMYB15, VviMYBF1) or not deregulated ( VviMYBA1, VviMYBA2, VviMYBA3, VviMYC1, VviMYCA1, VviMYBPA2) in HT berries (Supplementary Table  11). Accordingly, HT did not affect the amount of  VviGT1 transcript (VIT_16s0039g02230) that encodes the anthocyanidin glycosyltransferase catalyzing the limiting step for anthocyanin accumulation and are a direct target of VviMybA1 transcription factor (TF; VIT_02s0033g00410) (Cutanda-Perez et al.,  2009). For comparison, no effect of HT was observed on  VviMYBA1 transcripts in berries from fruiting cuttings (Carbonell-Bejerano et al.,  2013), whereas a  VviMYBA1 repression was reported in two others studies (Yamane et al.,  2006; Rienth et al.,  2014). It is also noteworthy that both  VviMYBC2-L3 (VIT_14s0006g01620) and  VviMYB4b (VIT_04s0023g0371) transcripts were transiently enhanced in VHT and RHT berries, respectively. These two TFs were recently described as negative regulators of the phenylpropanoid pathway in grape (Cavallini et al.,  2015). While HT did not significantly impact the expression of genes known to act in the transport of flavonoids (reviewed by Zhao ( 2015), either directly ( VviAM1, VviAM3, VviABCC1, VviMATE1, VviMATE2) or indirectly  (VviGST1, VviGST4), the present work pointed out a significant deregulation of many putative ABC or MATE transporters and Glutathion S-transferase family members (Supplementary Tables  1,  11). It cannot be excluded that these proteins could be involved in the control of flavonoid transport in HT grape berries, as well. In addition to synthesis, stabilization and vacuolar sequestration, the anthocyanin content can also be modulated through degradation that may involve enzymes such as laccases, polyphenol oxidases, class III peroxidases, and β-glucosidases (Oren-Shamir,  2009). Our experiments showed a strong HT effect on the expression of laccase genes, potentially impacting the polymerization rate of various phenolic compounds. Out of the 93  laccase-annotated genes in the grapevine genome, 33 transcripts were deregulated by HT (Supplementary Table  12). Interestingly, the laccase  TT10 ( Transparent Testa 10, VIT_18s0075g00600) showed a maintained up-regulation by HT whatever the stage of development. In Arabidopsis,  TT10 was proposed to participate in the oxidative polymerization of phenolic compounds (Pourcel et al.,  2005). In a similar way, numerous genes encoding putative polyphenol oxidases (4), peroxidases (25) and β-glucosidases (16) were impacted by HT (Supplementary Table  12). In the present study, HT induced several  peroxidase genes including class III type (VIT_07s0130g00220, VIT_18s0001g06850) whereas others were repressed (VIT_18s0001g06840, VIT_18s0001g06890). Recently, Movahed et al. ( 2016) showed that the expression of 3 of the 5  peroxidase genes (VIT_14s0066g01850, VIT_06s0004g07770, VIT_07s0191g00050, VIT_11s0016g05320 and VIT_18s0072g00160) that were most strongly expressed in grape berry pericarp during ripening was influenced by temperature elevation. In agreement with these results, the present data also pinpoints the alteration of 4 of these genes (VIT_14s0066g01850, VIT_06s0004g07770, VIT_11s0016g05320 and VIT_18s0072g00160) in response to HT but with different kinetics and intensities. The secondary metabolism produces compounds of critical importance for berry quality and wine bitterness and astringency (Lund and Bohlmann,  2006; Ali et al.,  2010; Kuhn et al.,  2014; Robinson et al.,  2014). Three hundred twenty seven DEGs were related to “Secondary metabolism” and mainly belonged to the subcategories “isoprenoids,” “phenylpropanoid-lignin,” and “flavonoids” (Supplementary Table  7). Numerous genes affected by HT correspond to aroma and aroma-precursor related gene. Terpenes (predominantly eucalyptol, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene) are usually present at low levels in Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, accumulating during the preveraison stage whereas benzene derivatives (2-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethanal) appear at late ripening (Kalua and Boss,  2009; Robinson et al.,  2014). The strong repression of genes encoding the  1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (VIT_05s0020g02130, VIT_09s0002g02050, VIT_11s0052g01730, VIT_11s0052g01780) suggests that volatile terpenoids biosynthesis may be decreased by HT (Supplementary Table  7). The 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase catalyzes the synthesis of isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP), which is the precursor of all terpenes. The condensation of IPP and its isomer DMAPP (dimethylallylpyrophosphate) forms geranyl diphosphate (GPP) that is used by terpene synthase (TPS) to produce monoterpenes and derivatives. The Pinot Noir reference genome contains 89 putative  TPS, among which half have been functionally characterized (Martin et al.,  2010). Among the 55 probe sets giving reliable results and representing transcripts of functional, partial and pseudo  TPS on the NimbleGen array (Cramer et al.,  2014), 16 transcripts showed differential abundance in HT berries (Supplementary Table  8). Thirteen  TPS were transiently repressed in GHT, VHT and or RHT clusters whereas only three  TPS were upregulated by HT ( VviTPS25, VviTPS26, VviTPS50). From the literature, most of these  TPS accumulate at the late stages of ripening in vineyard conditions (Cramer et al.,  2014). Finally, the transcript abundance of several terpene-related genes decreased in berries directly exposed to HT, in a similar way to that observed after exposing the whole vine to HT (Rienth et al.,  2014). These repressed genes encode geraniol 10-hydroxylase, (-)-germacrene D synthase and linalool synthase (Supplementary Table  8). Within the terpene family, carotenoids are a complex subgroup of isoprenoid pigments playing diverse roles in plants and providing nutritional value. Carotenoids also lead to C 13-norisoprenoids which contribute the characteristic aromas of  Vitis vinifera varieties (Mendes-Pinto,  2009). Among the 42 putative grape carotenoid metabolic genes (Young et al.,  2012), 21 transcripts showed differential abundance after HT in at least one of the 9 conditions, most of these being down-regulated (Supplementary Tables  7,  9). The abundance of 2 out of 3 phytoene synthase transcripts ( VviPSY, VIT_12s0028g00960, VIT_06s0004g00820), encoding the enzyme that catalyzes the first step committed to carotenoid biosynthesis, decreased upon HT. This down-regulation was also observed for downstream genes, namely phytoene dehydrogenase (VIT_04s0023g01790), carotene desaturase (VIT_14s0030g01740), carotenoid isomerase (VIT_08s0032g00800, VIT_12s0035g01080), lycopene cyclase (VIT_06s0080g00810, VIT_11s0016g01880) and carotene hydroxylase (VIT_04s0023g00080). The β-carotene hydroxylase 2 transcripts ( VviBCH2, VIT_16s0050g01090) were the only ones strongly accumulating under HT, and especially at the herbaceous stage. Methoxypyrazines (MPs) are strongly odorant volatile molecules with vegetable-like fragrances that participate to the distinct herbaceous/ bell pepper characters of some wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon (Dunlevy et al.,  2009; Darriet et al.,  2012; Kuhn et al.,  2014). Isobutyl methoxypyrazine (IBMP) is the predominant MP in Cabernet Sauvignon berries, accumulating throughout the pre-veraison stage before declining during the ripening phase. The last step of its biosynthesis was recently deciphered in grapevine, through the unambiguous identification of VviOMT3 (VIT_03s0038g03090), an  O-methyltransferase capable of converting the nonvolatile precursor 2-hydroxy-3-isobutylpyrazine (IBHP) into IBMP (Dunlevy et al.,  2013; Guillaumie et al.,  2013). By contrast to VviOMT4, VviOMT1 and VviOMT2 are active with a broad range of substrates but methylate IBHP  in vitro, although with poor affinity (Dunlevy et al.,  2010). Interestingly,  VviOMT3 transcripts were strongly repressed in green berries exposed to HT (Supplementary Table  7). A similar decrease was also observed in GHT berries for  VviOMT4 (VIT_03s0038g03080) and  VviOMT1 (VIT_12s0059g01790) transcripts, whereas  VviOMT2 (VIT_12s0059g01750) remained unaffected. Grape berry phenolics derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway participate to sensory properties, color and protection against environmental stress (Teixeira et al.,  2013). Our biochemical analysis highlighted the dramatic effects of local warming on the onset of veraison and on the final anthocyanin contents in berries at harvest (Table  1; Figure  2). MapMan analysis (Figure  6) shows the contrasted heat responses of DEGs related to the general phenylpropanoid and to the flavonoid biosynthesis pathways (Figure  6; Supplementary Figure  3; Supplementary Table  10). The transcriptomic responses of GHT samples clearly differed from both VHT and RHT samples. During the herbaceous stage, genes involved in the general phenylpropanoid pathway ( phenylalanine ammonia-lyase PAL, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase C4H, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase 4CL) were induced by HT regardless to the stress duration. By contrast, in VHT and RHT samples, the same genes were up-regulated after 1 day, but strongly repressed after 7 and 14 days of treatment. Many transcripts related to the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were repressed in GHT clusters. Two  chalcone synthase transcripts ( VviCHS1: VIT_14s0068g00920,  VviCHS2: VIT_14s0068g00930) encoding the first committed enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis (Parage et al.,  2012) were repressed after 7 days. A significant repression by HT was also observed for many flavonoid transcripts of the late biosynthetic pathway, such as  flavonoid 3′ -hydroxylase ( VviF3′ H, VIT_11s0016g01020, VIT_11s0016g01030, VIT_09s0002g01090 ), flavonoid 3′ 5′ -hydroxylase ( VviF3′ 5′ H),  dihydroflavonol 4-reductase ( VviDFR, VIT_16s0039g02350, VIT_18s0001g1280) and  leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase ( VviLDOX, VIT_08s0105g00380), whereas the  flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene ( VviF3H, VIT_16s0098g00860) was up-regulated (Figure  6; Supplementary Figure  3; Supplementary Table  10). The HT led to contrasted effects on the same set of genes in VHT and RHT clusters when compared with GHT.  VviF3H transcript was significantly less abundant whereas  VviCHI (chalcone isomerase, VIT_19s0014g00100) and  VviF3′ H genes were mostly up-regulated. Moreover, the repressive effect of HT on  VviF3′ 5′ H isoforms was not observed in VHT clusters and only transiently detected in RHT berries. In addition, the structural genes  VviANR ( anthocyanidin reductase, VIT_00s0361g00040), and  VviLAR ( leucoanthocyanidin reductase, VIT_01s0011g02960, VIT_17s0000g04150) involved in proanthocyanidins (PA) synthesis were significantly repressed under HT, according to the stage and/or duration of the stress. The anthocyanidin aglycones are further modified through glycosylation, methylation and acylation events, leading to the production of a wide variety of anthocyanin compounds. Glycosylation of flavonoids is catalyzed by enzymes from the large glycosyltranferase (GT) family, represented by 240 genes in the grape genome (Ono et al.,  2010). Glycosylation enhances the structural diversity and modifies the functional properties of these secondary metabolites. For instance, the expression of  UFGT [ UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase, renamed  VviGT1, VIT_16s0039g02230 (Parage et al.,  2012)], catalyzing the 3-O-specific glycosylation of anthocyanidin is critical for the coloration of grape skin (Boss et al.,  1996). Twenty-nine putative  VviGT were deregulated in berries exposed to HT (Figure  6; Supplementary Figure  3; Supplementary Table  10). Despite the loss of anthocyanins upon HT,  VviGT1 expression remained unaffected by HT. By contrast,  VviGT5 (VIT_11s0052g01600) and  VviGT6 (VIT_04s0023g01290) transcripts were strongly down-regulated in VHT and RHT clusters.  VviGT5 and  VviGT6 drive the glycosylation of flavonols, which increase their water solubility and their accumulation (Ono et al.,  2010). In grapevine, anthocyanins can also be modified through the action of  O-methyltransferases (AOMTs) and acyltransferases (ACTs) before being transported into the vacuole (Fournier-Level et al.,  2011; Rinaldo et al.,  2015). These modifications modulate berry color by reducing anthocyanin reactivity and increasing their stability and solubility in water. None of the two grape  AOMTs ( VviAOMT1; VIT_01s0010g03510,  VviAOMT2; VIT_01s0010g03490) that were previously described as effective anthocyanin 3′- and 3′,5′- O-methyltransferase (Hugueney et al.,  2009; Lücker et al.,  2010; Fournier-Level et al.,  2011) was significantly deregulated by HT (Supplementary Table  10). However, other putative  VviAOMTs transcripts (VIT_11s0016g02610, VIT_07s0031g00350, VIT_03s0063g00140, VIT_12s0028g03110), were transiently up- or down-regulated by HT depending on the ripening stage and stress duration. HT also modified the transcript amounts of various  ACTs (Supplementary Table  10). Indeed, 5 putative  ACTs were transiently repressed in GHT berries (VIT_12s0134g00590, VIT_12s0134g00630, VIT_12s0134g00600, VIT_12s0134g00650, VIT_12s0134g0660), whereas 3  ACTs (VIT_03s0017g00870, VIT_12s0134g00590, VIT_12s0134g00630) were up-regulated in both VHT and RHT berries. VIT_03s0017g00870 corresponds to Vvi3AT, an enzyme recently associated to the production of the common grape berry acylated anthocyanins (Rinaldo et al.,  2015). Stilbenes and lignins represent branching points in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Stilbenes are a small family of phytoalexins synthesized by plants in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Under normal growth conditions, berries stilbene content increases from veraison to ripening, with significant differences among  V. vinifera varieties (Gatto et al.,  2008). Forty-eight  stilbene synthases (STSs) genes catalyzing the biosynthesis of the stilbene backbone were found in grapevine genome. This represents an unusual example of functional redundancy (Parage et al.,  2012). Most of these (39 genes) were impacted in berries exposed to HT, displaying a quite similar and noticeable expression profile (Figure  6; Supplementary Figure  3; Supplementary Table  10). In GHT clusters, 18  STS transcripts accumulated after 1 and 7 d of treatment before being repressed at 14 d. In VHT and RHT fruits, the  STSs were transiently induced at 1 d and then strongly repressed over the 2 weeks of experiment. Lignification can also be induced as a response to various biotic and abiotic stresses, as shown in Citrus fruit after postharvest HT (Yun et al.,  2013). Conversely, the cell wall lignin content was reduced in the skin of grape mature berries experiencing a water stress (Vannozzi et al.,  2012; Fernandes et al.,  2015). In the present study, numerous transcripts (39) potentially involved in the lignin biosynthetic pathway differentially accumulated in HT berries (Figure  6; Supplementary Figure  3; Supplementary Table  10). Two  cinnamoyl-CoA reductase ( VviCCR) gene isoforms were affected in an opposite way by HT, VIT_14s0066g01150 being induced, and VIT_09s0070g00240 being repressed. In GHT and VHT clusters, the transcript levels of 16  cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase ( VviCAD) genes were mainly repressed whereas a few ones accumulated in RHT berries. The content of 3  ferulate 5-hydroxylase transcripts ( VviF5H) was reduced in both VHT and RHT berries. Finally, HT led to contrasted effects on  caffeic acid O-methyltransferase ( VviCOMT) and peroxidase transcripts (catalyzing the polymerization of monolignols into lignins).","Reproductive development of grapevine and berry composition are both strongly influenced by temperature. To date, the molecular mechanisms involved in grapevine berries response to high temperatures are poorly understood. Unlike recent data that addressed the effects on berry development of elevated temperatures applied at the whole plant level, the present work particularly focuses on the fruit responses triggered by direct exposure to heat treatment (HT). In the context of climate change, this work focusing on temperature effect at the microclimate level is of particular interest as it can help to better understand the consequences of leaf removal (a common viticultural practice) on berry development. HT (+ 8°C) was locally applied to clusters from Cabernet Sauvignon fruiting cuttings at three different developmental stages (middle green, veraison and middle ripening). Samples were collected 1, 7, and 14 days after treatment and used for metabolic and transcriptomic analyses. The results showed dramatic and specific biochemical and transcriptomic changes in heat exposed berries, depending on the developmental stage and the stress duration. When applied at the herbaceous stage, HT delayed the onset of veraison. Heating also strongly altered the berry concentration of amino acids and organic acids (e.g., phenylalanine, γ-aminobutyric acid and malate) and decreased the anthocyanin content at maturity. These physiological alterations could be partly explained by the deep remodeling of transcriptome in heated berries. More than 7000 genes were deregulated in at least one of the nine experimental conditions. The most affected processes belong to the categories ""stress responses,"" ""protein metabolism"" and ""secondary metabolism,"" highlighting the intrinsic capacity of grape berries to perceive HT and to build adaptive responses. Additionally, important changes in processes related to ""transport,"" ""hormone"" and ""cell wall"" might contribute to the postponing of veraison. Finally, opposite effects depending on heating duration were observed for genes encoding enzymes of the general phenylpropanoid pathway, suggesting that the HT-induced decrease in anthocyanin content may result from a combination of transcript abundance and product degradation.","['High temperature', 'Climate change', 'Grapevine', 'Microclimate', 'Microarrays', 'Berry Development', 'Metabolomics/metabolite Profiling']","['Supplementary Table', 'VIT', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Supplementary', 'Figure', 'Table', 'berries', 'genes', 'stage', 'RHT berries']","[middle-green, middle-ripening (Figure  1A, °C ±, °C ±, °C ±, ±, °C, ±, °C, ±, °C, VHT, °C ±, °C ±, °C ±, heat-treated, ARG, TYR, GABA, VHT, RHT, malvidin-3- O-glucoside, Dimitrovska, malvidin-3- O-(6′-acetyl)-glucoside, dephinidin, VHT, well-grouped, PC2, PC2, G7D, G1D, “Stress”, “Protein”, BIN 29, “, ”, ”, “Stress”, “abiotic/heat, “, ”, “heat stress”, HSP, Heat Shock Protein, USPs, VIT_17s0000g04260, VIT_04s0079g00610, VIT_08s0032g00590, “, ”, HSP, chaperones, Bokszczanin, Fragkostefanakis, FK506-binding protein, FKBP, VIT_19s0015g01100, VIT_07s0031g01150, VIT_08s0007g04340, VIT_13s0064g00580, VIT_01s0011g00930, VIT_00s0260g00070, peptidyl prolyl cis–trans isomerases, UPS, cell-cycle, UPS, ubiquitin, ubiquitin ligases, E3-like, VIT_09s0002g00220, VIT_12s0034g01390, VIT_05s0124g00230, VIT_06s0009g03670, VIT_08s0040g02600, VIT_19s0027g00320, E3-related, VIT_17s0000g09790, VIT_18s0041g01090, VIT_14s0068g02150, VIT_14s0066g02580, VIT_08s0056g01410, VIT_01s0011g02950, VIT_01s0026g00300, VIT_07s0005g01360, VIT_08s0007g04790, VIT_18s0001g02280, VIT_00s0160g00270, VIT_18s0001g06220, Cullin, ubiquitin ligases, CUL1, Skp1-Cullin-F-box, SCF, S-Phase kinase-associated, F-box, “, ”, VviMYB15, VviMYBF1, VviMYBA1, VviMYBA2, VviMYBA3, VviMYC1, VviMYCA1, VviMYBPA2, VIT_16s0039g02230, anthocyanidin glycosyltransferase, VviMybA1 transcription factor, TF, VIT_02s0033g00410, VIT_04s0023g0371, VHT, VviAM1, VviAM3, VviABCC1, VviMATE1, VviMATE2, VviGST1, VviGST4, MATE, Glutathion S-transferase, laccases, class III peroxidases, Oren-Shamir, laccase, VIT_18s0075g00600, peroxidases (25), class III type (VIT_07s0130g00220, VIT_18s0001g06850, VIT_18s0001g06890, VIT_14s0066g01850, VIT_06s0004g07770, VIT_07s0191g00050, VIT_11s0016g05320, VIT_18s0072g00160, VIT_14s0066g01850, VIT_06s0004g07770, VIT_11s0016g05320, VIT_18s0072g00160, “, ”, “, ”, “flavonoids”, aroma-precursor, 2-phenylethanal, Kalua, Boss, VIT_05s0020g02130, VIT_09s0002g02050, VIT_11s0052g01730, VIT_11s0052g01780, isopentenylpyrophosphate (, geranyl diphosphate, terpene synthase, VviTPS25, VviTPS26, VviTPS50, terpene-related, Carotenoids, Mendes-Pinto, VviPSY, VIT_12s0028g00960, VIT_06s0004g00820, VIT_04s0023g01790, VIT_14s0030g01740, carotenoid isomerase, VIT_08s0032g00800, VIT_12s0035g01080, VIT_11s0016g01880, carotene hydroxylase, VIT_04s0023g00080, VviBCH2, VIT_16s0050g01090, MPs, MP, VviOMT3 (, VviOMT4, VviOMT1, VviOMT2, VIT_03s0038g03080, VHT, C4H, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase 4CL, VviCHS1, VIT_14s0068g00920, VIT_14s0068g00930, VviF3′ H, VIT_11s0016g01020, VIT_11s0016g01030, VIT_09s0002g01090, 4-reductase, VviDFR, VIT_16s0039g02350, VIT_18s0001g1280, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, VIT_08s0105g00380, VviF3H, VIT_16s0098g00860, VHT, chalcone isomerase, VIT_19s0014g00100, anthocyanidin reductase, VIT_00s0361g00040, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, PA, GT, VIT_16s0039g02230, 3-O-specific, VIT_11s0052g01600, VIT_04s0023g01290, VHT, AOMTs, ACTs, VIT_01s0010g03510, anthocyanin 3′-, 3′,5′- O-methyltransferase, VIT_11s0016g02610,, VIT_07s0031g00350, VIT_03s0063g00140, VIT_12s0028g03110, VIT_12s0134g00590, VIT_12s0134g00630, VIT_12s0134g00600, VIT_12s0134g00650, VIT_12s0134g0660, VIT_03s0017g00870, VIT_12s0134g00590, VIT_12s0134g00630, VHT, VIT_03s0017g00870, Vvi3AT, VHT, VviCCR, VIT_14s0066g01150, VIT_09s0070g00240, alcohol dehydrogenase, 5-hydroxylase, VHT, O-methyltransferase, VviCOMT, peroxidase]","['(TPS)', 'TPS,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'VviTPS25,', 'VviTPS26,', 'VviTPS50).', 'TPS']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
42,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5291992\eupmc_result.json,PMC5291992,"Results Volatile compounds of two tangerines The same 72 volatile compounds were observed in the flavedo of two cultivars, among which 47 were accurately quantified and 25 were tentatively quantified. These volatile compounds were divided into 12 classes, including 20 sesquiterpenes, 16 monoterpenes, 6 monoterpene alcohols, 5 monoterpene aldehydes, 3 monoterpene ketones, 3 monoterpene esters, 3 monoterpene oxides, 6 aldehydes, 4 esters, 3 alcohols, 3 acids and 1 unknown compound (Table  1).  However, concentrations varied largely among different volatile compounds. For example, in NRH, the concentrations varied from 67384.04 ± 20472.24 μg/g ( d-limonene) to 1.11 ± 0.21 μg/g (tetradecanoic acid). Additionally, the concentrations of specific volatile compounds also varied between NRH and ZHJ. Except for monoterpene oxides, alcohols, aldehydes and esters, all other 8 classes of volatiles had significantly higher total concentrations in NRH than in ZHJ. For example, the total concentrations of monoterpene aldehydes, monoterpene ketones, acids and the unknown compound in NRH were 1.45-, 1.30-, 2.10- and 2.37-fold of those in ZHJ, respectively. Volatile terpenoids in both tangerines The predominant volatile organic compounds detected in two cultivars were terpenoids. The total terpenoid concentrations in NRH and ZHJ were 75840.46 μg/g and 59786.27 μg/g, respectively, accounting for about 99.60 and 99.48% of the total volatiles (Table  1). The 16 detected monoterpenes accounted for the highest proportion (>98%) of the total volatiles in both tangerines (Fig.  2), while others only accounted for 1.72 and 1.91% of the total volatiles in NRH and ZHJ, respectively. Notably, the concentrations of 10 out of the 16 monoterpenes were higher in NRH, with  d-limonene being the most abundant in both cultivars, followed by  γ-terpiene,  β-myrcene,  α-pinene and  β-pinene (>200 μg/g). However, the concentrations of both  β- cis-ocimene and  β-phellandrene were significantly higher in ZHJ than in NRH.  As for the 6 monoterpene alcohols detected in both tangerines, they were at higher concentrations in NRH, particularly  α-terpineol. Both tangerines accumulated the highest level of  β-linalool among all monoterpene alcohols, which amounted to 148.35 ± 12.96 μg/g in NRH and 134.82 ± 13.93 μg/g in ZHJ, respectively. The total amount of monoterpene aldehydes in NRH was 1.45-fold that in ZHJ. Citronellal was found to be the major component of monoterpene aldehydes, whose concentration was 101.00 ± 10.47 μg/g and 85.77 ± 15.28 μg/g in two cultivars, respectively; while for other monoterpene aldehydes, including  α-citral,  β-citral, ( E)-2-hexenal and perillal, their concentrations varied from 6.19 μg/g to 86.66 μg/g. Except for citronellal and ( E)-2-hexenal, other 3 monoterpene aldehydes were significantly different in concentration between the two tangerines, with relatively higher levels being detected in NRH. A total of 3 monoterpene ketones, namely piperitone, carvone and 2-cyclohexen-1-one, (S)-3-methyl-6-(1-methylethenyl), were identified. Each of the three monoterpene ketones had higher concentration in NRH, especially 2-cyclohexen-1-one, (S)-3-methyl-6-(1-methylethenyl) (3.81-fold that in ZHJ;  P < 0.01), and their total concentration in NRH was 1.30-fold that in ZHJ. Two monoterpene oxides were identified, including  trans-limonene oxide and  cis-limonene oxide. Total monoterpene oxide concentration was lower in NRH than in ZHJ. Three monoterpene esters were detectable in both tangerines, and their total concentration was similar in NRH and ZHJ (32.82 μg/g and 30.66 μg/g, respectively). Sesquiterpenes were detected to be the richest class, which included 20 volatile compounds from the two tangerines. Germacrene B was the dominant sesquiterpene, followed by  β-farnesene,  δ-elemene, germacrene D and  β-elemene, whose concentrations were all above 40 μg/g. However, only  α-bergamotene was at a significantly higher level in NRH (1.16-fold that in ZHJ). Non-terpenoidsvolatile compounds determined in both tangerines Non-terpenoid volatile compounds detected in both tangerines A total of 17 non-terpenoid volatiles were identified, including 3 alcohols, 6 aldehydes, 3 acids, 4 esters and 1 unknown. Among these volatile compounds, aldehydes showed the highest abundance, which was up to 219.94 μg/g and 220.49 μg/g and accounted for 72.5 and 71.8% of the total non-terpenoid volatiles in NRH and ZHJ, respectively. NRH contained significantly higher 1-octanol, nonanal, decanal, hendecanal and  trans- p-mentha-2,8-dienol than ZHJ ( P < 0.05), while the concentration of  n-hexadecanoic acid was extremely significantly different between the two tangerines ( P < 0.01). Carotenoid profiles Seven carotenoids were determined in both years (2010 and 2011), including violaxanthin, 9-Z-violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, lutein,  β-cryptoxanthin,  β-carotene and phytoene (Table  2). NRH accumulated higher levels of total carotenoids (456.87 μg/g in 2010, 395.49 μg/g in 2011).  β-cryptoxanthin was the most abundant carotenoid, accounting for more than 30% of total carotenoids in both tangerines, followed by 9-Z-violaxanthin (77.73–108.84 μg/g). All carotenoids, except for antheraxanthin and lutein, were higher in NRH than in ZHJ. In 2010, the contents of violaxanthin, 9-Z-violaxanthin,  β-cryptoxanthin,  β-carotene, phytoene and total carotenoids in NRH were significantly higher than those in ZHJ. NRH had lower contents of antheraxanthin and lutein than ZHJ, and the difference in lutein content reached significant level. Similar results were obtained in 2011.  Limonoid aglycones in both tangerines Two limonoid aglycones (limonin and nomilin) were also detected in the juice sacs of NRH and ZHJ in 2010 and 2011 (Table  3). ZHJ showed significantly higher concentration of limoninin in both seasons. In contrast, nomilin concentration was significantly higher in NRH in both years.  Phytohormones in NRH and ZHJ The concentrations of ABA, JA, IAA and SA were evaluated in the juice sacs of fruits in 2010 and 2011 (Table  4). ABA was the most abundant (>900 ng/g) among all the phytohormones investigated; JA was at the second abundant among the 4 phytohormones; and SA was detected in trace or very low levels; while IAA was undetectable in 2 years.  The levels of ABA and JA in ZHJ were all significantly higher than those in NRH. ZHJ accumulated extremely significantly higher ABA than NRH in both years (2010, 1.4-fold; 2011, 1.9-fold;  P < 0.01). Concentrations of JA in ZHJ and NRH were at the same levels in 2010, while a 1.2-fold significant difference was observed in 2011."," Background Niurouhong (Citrus reticulata Blanco. Niurouhong) (NRH) is a spontaneous beef-red flesh mutant with distinctive flavor compared with its wild type orange-red flesh Zhuhongju (ZHJ). To illustrate the biochemical mechanism of its special flesh color and flavor, fruits at commercial mature stage were used to profile the volatiles in the flavedo and determine the levels of carotenoids, limonoid aglycones and phytohormones in the juice sacs in two seasons. Results Our results showed the content of total volatile terpenoids in NRH was 1.27-fold that in ZHJ. The components of volatiles were found to be common between the two tangerines. This result indicates that the distinctive flavor of NRH might not be derived from the presence/absence of specific volatiles; instead, it was derived from the altered concentrations or balance of α-citral, β-citral, 2-cyclohexen-1-one, (S)-3-methyl-6-(1-methylethenyl) and n-hexadecanoic acid. Analyses of the contents of total and specific carotenoids indicated that the beef-red color of NRH flesh might be largely attributed to the over accumulation of β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene. However, lower ABA level was found in NRH than in ZHJ, reflecting a possible feedback regulation of ABA biosynthesis on carotenogenesis and the balance in the metabolism among terpenoids. Conclusions Collectively, our study suggested that the MEP pathway was enhanced in NRH tangerine. However, a certain unknown co-regulatory mechanism might be present in the metabolism pathway of secondary metabolites (especially terpenoids) in beef-red flesh mutant. Our study provides new insights into the regulatory network of terpenoid metabolism and mutation mechanism of red-fleshed citrus.","['Carotenoids', 'Phytohormone', 'Terpenoids', 'Volatile', 'Limonoid Aglycones', 'Citrus Reticulate Blanco', 'Niurouhong']","['NRH', 'ZHJ', 'Volatile compounds', 'monoterpene', 'concentrations', 'total', 'significantly higher', 'higher', 'Volatile', 'tangerines']","[67384.04 ± 20472.24 μg/g, 2.10-, 59786.27 μg/g, E)-2-hexenal, perillal, E)-2-hexenal, 219.94 μg/g, 220.49 μg/g, hendecanal, p-mentha-2,8-dienol, 9-Z-violaxanthin, 9-Z-violaxanthin, 77.73–108.84 μg/g, 9-Z-violaxanthin, limonin, limoninin, ABA, JA, SA, ABA, JA, SA, ABA, JA, ABA, JA]",[],[],[],NaN
43,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5301923\eupmc_result.json,PMC5301923,"Results (+)-Valencene is one of the characteristic volatile compounds in mature sweet orange Following earlier comparative studies ( Del Rio   et al., 1992 ;  González-Mas   et al., 2011 ;  Miyazaki   et al., 2011 ), the volatile compounds from six species of citrus fruit (mandarin, sweet orange, bitter orange, hybrids, pummelo, and citron) plus some new cultivars, (satsuma, ‘Newhall’ and ‘Fengjie’) were analysed. A total of 119 volatiles were identified from these citrus fruit, including 16 monoterpenes, 37 sesquiterpenes, 36 monoterpenoids, 10 sesquiterpenoids, 14 aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols, and six aliphatic esters ( Supplementary Table S4). Differences in volatile profiles were observed between the samples and fifteen characteristic volatile compounds from citrus species were successfully identified ( Fig. 1). Bitter orange was characterized by (+)-cycloisosativene and copaene. The volatile profile of citron fruit was complex:  cis-α-bisabolene, α-bisabolol, elixene, and β-bisabolene were exclusively found in citron but germacrene B, camphor, α-bergamotene, ( E)-geranial, and neral were also found to be characteristic for citron due to their relative higher concentrations as compared to the other species. Hybrid cultivars had a higher concentration of octylacetate while the pummelo species were characterized by (–)-α-panasinsen, farnesol and (+)-valencene. Sweet orange was characterized by the volatile compound (+)-valencene, which was much more abundant than in other citrus species ( Fig. 1). Screening for  CitAP2/ERF genes encoding proteins that activate the  Terpene Synthase 1 ( CsTPS1) promoter CsTPS1 has previously been characterized as the key gene encoding the enzyme terpene synthase that catalyzes (+)-valencene biosynthesis ( Sharon-Asa   et al., 2003 ). Therefore, we screened a large set of citrus transcription factors for activation or inhibition using the promoter of  CsTPS1 and a dual-luciferase assay ( Supplementary Fig. S1). Previously, an AP2 domain transcription factor ( CrORCA3) was reported as a regulator of terpenoid indole alkaloids ( van der Fits and Memelink, 2000). However, a linkage between a  CitAP2/ERF transcription factor and developmental accumulation of (+)-valencene in sweet orange fruit has not yet been demonstrated. Utilizing the promoter of  CsTPS1 and a dual-luciferase assay, the  CitAP2/ERF genes were screened to identify any that activated the  CsTPS1 promoter (–573~–1bp region). Among the  CitAP2/ERFs, one transcription factor,  CitAP2.10, showed a 2.1-fold trans-activation effect on the  CsTPS1 promoter ( Fig. 2). Association of  CitAP2.10 and  CsTPS1 expression and (+)-valencene accumulation during ‘Newhall’ fruit development The percentage content of five classes of aroma substances in citrus peel (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpenoids, monoterpenoids, others) was analysed and the relative change in content during fruit development was measured, using fruits harvested 120 DAFB as a reference point (set as 0). The most significant class of volatiles that accumulated was the sesquiterpenes ( Fig. 3), which had doubled by 180 DAFB and increased 12-fold by 210 DAFB, while the other four classes of aroma substances remained relatively less abundant ( Fig. 3). The main sesquiterpene that accumulated during fruit development was (+)-valencene, which increased by 9-fold and 93-fold at 180 DAFB and 210 DAFB, respectively, which was much higher than any of the other volatiles ( Fig. 3). The expressions of  CitAP2.10 and  CsTPS1 were analysed in parallel with volatile accumulation in sweet orange ‘Newhall’ ( Fig. 3). The results indicated that mRNAs for  CsTPS1 and  CitAP2.10 accumulated during maturation of sweet orange fruit (120 DAFB to 210 DAFB). Thus,  CitAP2.10 expression was positively correlated with  CsTPS1 activity and (+)-valencene accumulation. Modulation by ethylene and 1-MCP of (+)-valencene content and expression of  CitAP2.10 and  CsTPS1 The correlation between  CitAP2.10 and (+)-valencene was further tested by treatment with exogenous ethylene and 1-MCP (an ethylene antagonist). The results indicated that ethylene enhanced and 1-MCP inhibited (+)-valencene biosynthesis. In control fruit ( Fig. 4) (+)-valencene content increased by approximately 16.4% between 0 d and 4 d, whereas treatment with ethylene enhanced valencene content by 30.9% and treatment with 1-MCP reduced it to 6.89% over the same time period. Further analysis of gene expression indicated that  CsTPS1 mRNA showed the same accumulation pattern as (+)-valencene in fruit in response to both ethylene and 1-MCP treatment.  CitAP2.10 transcript abundance was significantly higher than in the control following ethylene treatment, and significantly lower in fruit treated with 1-MCP relative to the control ( Fig. 5). Trans-activation activity of  AtWRI1, a homolog of  CitAP2.10 on the  CsTPS1 promoter The results above indicate that  CitAP2.10 is positively associated with  CsTPS1 and also with the accumulation of the metabolite (+)-valencene. In order to verify the regulatory role of CitAP2/ERF, four Arabidopsis  AtWRI genes showing the closest similarity to  CitAP2.10 ( Supplementary Fig. S2) were isolated and their  trans-activation activities were tested using the dual-luciferase assays. The results ( Fig. 6) indicated that  AtWRI1 functioned in a similar way to  CitAP2.10 and was able to activate the  CsTPS1 promoter, while the other three  AtWRI genes had limited effects. Transient over-expression in ‘Newhall’ fruits Citrus is a perennial woody plant and stable transformation is difficult and time-consuming. Thus, a more rapid and efficient transient overexpression assay was chosen to examine the function of  CitAP2.10 in vivo.  CitAP2.10 and the empty vector were separately injected on opposite sides of the equatorial portion in the same fruit and the volatiles of these parts were analysed 5 d after infiltration. The results indicated that introducing  CitAP2.10 accelerated (+)-valencene synthesis ( Fig. 7). The (+)-valencene content of the peels infiltrated with  CitAP2.10 was 1.04 μg.g −1, representing a significant ( P<0.01) increase compared with peels infiltrated with empty vector (0.62 μg.g −1). Accumulation of endogenous  CsTPS1 mRNA occurred concomitantly with the increase in (+)-valencene ( Fig. 7).","Aroma is a vital characteristic that determines the quality and commercial value of citrus fruits, and characteristic volatiles have been analyzed in different citrus species. In sweet orange, Citrus sinensis, the sesquiterpene (+)-valencene is a key volatile compound in the fruit peel. Valencene synthesis is catalyzed by the terpene synthase CsTPS1, but the transcriptional mechanisms controlling its gene expression are unknown. Here, the AP2/ERF (APETALA2/ethylene response factor) transcription factor, CitAP2.10, is characterized as a regulator of (+)-valencene synthesis. The expression pattern of CitAP2.10 was positively correlated with (+)-valencene content and CsTPS1 expression. Dual-luciferase assays indicated that CitAP2.10 could trans-activate the CsTPS1 promoter. Ethylene enhanced expression of CitAP2.10 and this effect was abolished by the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene. The role and function of CitAP2.10 in (+)-valencene biosynthesis were confirmed using the Arabidopsis homolog (AtWRI1), which also transiently activated the CsTPS1 promoter. Furthermore, transient over-expression of CitAP2.10 triggered (+)-valencene biosynthesis in sweet orange fruit. These results indicate that CitAP2.10 regulates (+)-valencene synthesis via induction of CsTPS1 mRNA accumulation.","['Ethylene', 'Transcriptional regulation', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Terpene synthase', 'TPS', 'sweet orange', 'Citap2/erf', 'Citrus Volatile', 'Valencene.']","['Del Rio', 'Fig.', 'Valencene', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'fruit', 'sweet orange', 'DAFB', 'volatile compounds', 'volatile', 'orange']","[Del Rio   , ‘Newhall’, ‘Fengjie’, α-bisabolol, α-bergamotene, octylacetate, (–)-α-panasinsen, CsTPS1, CsTPS1, Sharon-Asa   , dual-luciferase, AP2, CrORCA3, dual-luciferase, –573~–1bp, ‘Newhall’ fruit, CitAP2/ERF, dual-luciferase, ‘Newhall’ fruits]","['CsTPS1)', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
44,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5341033\eupmc_result.json,PMC5341033,"Results Transcriptome sequencing, assembly and annotation M. koenigii leaf cDNA library was prepared ( Table S2) and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. Obtained sequences/raw reads were deposited at NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) and Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) databases under the accession numbers SRR2970920 (Bioproject PRJNA304945 and Biosample SAMN04311782) and GFCO01000000, respectively.  De novo assembled contig lengths were distributed between <150 bp to >4000 bp ( Fig. S1a). The average transcript length and mean GC% of assembled contigs were 1163.43 bp and 40.79%, respectively ( Table S2 and  Fig. S2a). Contigs having <150 bp length were excluded from downstream analysis. Analysis of FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million Mapped reads) showed that 102857 contigs, representing 90.28% of total contigs, were having ≥1 FPKM ( Fig. S1b). Annotation of these contigs against public databases showed that 87417 (84.98%) contigs had at least one significant hit against NCBI database ( Table S3 and  Fig. S2b,c). The top BLASTX hit of each 87417 contigs against NCBI nr database revealed similarity with sequences of 650 organisms, of which only six were having occurrence frequency of >1000 transcripts. Among the six organisms,  Citrus clementia exhibited the highest occurrence frequency of 47.8% followed by  Citrus sinensis with 35.5% ( Fig. S1c). In total, 35812 (40.97%) annotated contigs representing 2636 “GO” terms were distributed among three main ontologies comprising “biological processes” with maximum number of 1265 terms followed by “molecular function” and “cellular components” with 1035 and 336 terms, respectively ( Fig. S3). Secondary metabolic pathways in curry leaf To gain insight into secondary metabolic pathways in  M. koenigii, all assembled contigs with ≥150 bp and ≥1 FPKM were mapped against KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database using KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS). A total of 25809 contigs were annotated and mapped to 325 canonical pathways including primary and secondary metabolic processes ( Fig. S4). Maximum percentage of contigs (39.02%) were found to be involved in metabolism, of which 9.9% contigs were putatively involved in 30 secondary metabolic pathways ( Fig. 2 and  Fig. S4). Majority of the contigs under “secondary metabolic pathways” were annotated to be involved in terpenoid biosynthesis (22.5%), including terpenoid backbone, mono-, sesqui-, di-, and tri-terpenoid biosynthetic pathways ( Fig. 2). Also, significant percentage of contigs belonged to phenylpropanoid (19.1%) and different alkaloid biosynthetic pathways (16.9%). Within terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, 60 contigs corresponding to 7 genes of MEP pathway and 43 contigs for 6 genes of MVA pathway were identified with a cumulative FPKM of 3413 and 509, respectively ( Table 1). The number of annotated contigs for downstream genes were 11 (IDI), 15 (GDS), 41 (GGDS) and 6 (FDS) with a cumulative FPKM of 833, 292, 1906 and 74, respectively. Mono- and sesqui- terpene synthases were represented by 36 and 70 contigs having FPKM of 2828 and 1928, respectively ( Table 1). Contigs related to anthranilate pathway leading to synthesis of quinolone included 112 contigs accounting for 5 genes with a combined FPKM of 4661 ( Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis of polyketide synthases from  M. koenigii The enzymes catalyzing quinolone formation belong to a group of multifunctional polyketide synthases (PKSs). PKSs characterized from plants belong to PKSIII superfamily, which is broadly classified into chalcone synthase-type (CHS-type) PKSIII and non-chalcone synthase type (non-CHS type) PKSIII ( Fig. 3). Search of curry leaf transcriptome to identify candidates that could be involved in carbazole alkaloid biosynthesis resulted in 44 contigs annotated as PKSs, which were having a combined FPKM of 2169. Out of these contigs, 4 full length PKS candidates (MkPKS1-4) were identified and used to build phylogenetic relationship with other characterized PKSs. While MkPKS1 was grouped with the CHS-type PKSIII suggesting it to be a chalcone synthase (CHS), MkPKS2 was grouped together with non-CHS type PKSIII that are involved in the formation of different alkaloids ( Fig. 3). MkPKS3 and MkPKS4 were grouped with multifunctional PKSs from bacteria and fungus that included MtPKS1 ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis PKS) involved in the synthesis of the immunomodulatory phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) 10 and PaPQSH ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone synthase) synthesizing quinolone as a signaling molecule 11 ( Fig. 3). The catalytic triad Cys-His-Asn present within the active sites of all characterized type-III PKSs from plants was also found in MkPKS1 and MkPKS2 ( Fig. S5). This catalytic triad catalyzes the repetitive condensations of C 2 units derived from CoA-linked starter molecules 12. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the role of PKSs in synthesizing one or multiple steps of carbazole alkaloids may be hypothesized. Genes for downstream carbazole alkaloid formation In addition to PKS candidates, transcriptome mining also yielded contigs for prenyltransferases (PTs), methyltransferases (MTs), and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450s), of which some may be involved in the formation of carbazole alkaloids 39. A total of 119 contigs were annotated as PTs in the transcriptome having different metabolic pathways assigned to them. However, 17 contigs with “prenyltransferase activity” were not assigned to any putative pathways indicating that they could be further studied for their involvement in prenylation of quinolone ( Table S4). In the case of MTs, out of 172 annotated contigs, 37 were annotated as either “MT”, “MT family protein” or “putative/uncharacterized MTs” ( Table S5), suggesting their possible role in alkaloid biosynthesis.  M. koenigii transcriptome also comprised 452 CYP450 candidates that were distributed among 38 CYP450 families ( Table S6). Among them, candidates belonging to various CYP450 gene families reported in the biosynthesis of terpenoids and alkaloids were also identified. They included CYP51, CYP71, CYP73, CYP76, CYP82, CYP88, CYP98, CYP706 and CYP716 families. Future functional studies on these candidates may shed light on their involvement in carbazole alkaloid biosynthesis. Phylogenetic analysis of  M. koenigii terpene synthases Search for TPS candidates using KEGG, NCBI and uniprot databases yielded 160 contigs annotated as putative TPSs ( Table 1). Further search for full length TPS candidates yielded 7 full length sequences designated as MkTPS1 to 7 encoding putative mono-, sesqui- and di- terpene synthases. Phylogenetic analysis of these TPS proteins showed that MkTPS1 (602 aa), MkTPS3 (607 aa) and MkTPS4 (608 aa) were clustered with TPS-b subfamily, which consisted mainly monoterpene synthases, whereas MkTPS2 (560 aa), MkTPS5 (562 aa) and MkTPS6 (562 aa) grouped with TPS-a subfamily representing sesquiterpene synthases ( Fig. 4). MkTPS7 (781 aa) formed a separate clade with TPS-e subfamily consisting of diterpene synthases. While MkTPS1 and MkTPS3 exhibited highest identities to  C. limon γ-terpinene synthase (Clγ-TPNS) (86% identity) and limonene synthase (ClLIMS) (71% identity), respectively, MkTPS4 was closest to  Populus alba isoprene synthase (PaIPS) (54% identity) ( Fig. 4). Within TPS-a subfamily, MkTPS2 showed highest identity (83%) to δ-elemene synthase from  C. jambhiri (RlemTPS4). MkTPS5 and MkTPS6 exhibited 63 and 88% identities to  C. sinensis valencene synthase (CsVLS) and  C. unshiu linalool synthase (CuLIS), respectively, whereas MkTPS7 exhibited 65% identity to  Malus domestica kaurene synthase (MdKS), a diterpene synthase. The arginine-tryptophan rich motif “R(R)X 8W” was found at the N-terminus of all TPSs except MkTPS7 of TPS-e subfamily that lacks this motif or may have a highly modified version of it 13 ( Fig. S6). This motif may play a role in the initiation of isomerization-cyclization reaction or stabilizes the protein through electrostatic interaction 13. All seven TPS proteins contained highly conserved arginine-rich motif “RXR” that is believed to assist in directing the diphosphate anion away from the reactive carbocation after ionization 14. Also, aspartate-rich metal ion binding motifs “DDXXD” and “(N/D)DXX(S/T)XXXE” were present at the C-terminus of all MkTPS protein sequences ( Fig. S6). Subcellular localization of MkTPS1 and MkTPS2 To understand volatile terpenoid biosynthesis in curry leaf, two candidates, MkTPS1 (GenBank accession no. KX171229) and MkTPS2 (GenBank accession no. KX171230) having highest FPKM of 127.27 and 45.83, respectively, were characterized.  In silico prediction analysis indicated that MkTPS1 and MkTPS2 to be plastidial and cytosolic, respectively, suggesting their putative mono- and sesqui- TPS activities ( Table S7). To confirm their subcellular localization, the open reading frames (ORFs) of  MkTPS1 and  MkTPS2 were fused upstream of, and in frame with, GFP and the fusion constructs were transformed into  Arabidopsis protoplasts. While the green fluorescence of MkTPS1 (100)-GFP fusion protein was localized in the plastids similar to the RbTP-GFP that served as positive control for plastid localization, MkTPS2 (100)-GFP exhibited cytosolic localization similar to the GFP control ( Fig. 5). This was in agreement with other known monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases and indicated that MkTPS1 and MkTPS2 could be involved in the formation of mono- and sesqui- terpenes emitted from  M. koenigii leaves. Functional characterization of MkTPS1 and MkTPS2 The coding regions of  MkTPS1 and  MkTPS2 were sub-cloned into pET32a expression vector, the encoded proteins were expressed in  Escherichia coli, and purified recombinant proteins were analyzed for TPS activities. For  MkTPS1cloning, the transit peptide was truncated at second methionine (Met-40) to avoid the formation of inclusion bodies, which is a typical feature of monoterpene synthases 1516. GC-MS analysis of the reaction products of MkTPS1 showed the formation of predominantly sabinene utilizing GPP as substrate whereas there was no product formed in the case of boiled enzyme ( Fig. 6). Further, chiral analyses of the reaction products showed that MkTPS1 catalyzed the formation of (−)-sabinene. Chiral GC analysis of leaf essential oil also confirmed the presence of (−)-sabinene as a major leaf volatile along with (−)-α-pinene and (+)-sabinene ( Fig. 6). Sabinene synthases (SSs) have been reported from five plant species including  Salvia officinalis (SoSS) 17,  C. jambhiri (RlemTPS2) 18,  Picea sitchensis (PsSS) 19,  Thuja plicata (TpSS) 20 and  Hedychium coronarium (HcTPS7) 21. Among the characterized SSs, MkTPS1 exhibited highest homology (80%) to RlemTPS2 ( Table S8). Amino acid alignment revealed that catalytic active site residue Asn-348 is present at the 7 th position upstream of metal ion binding “DDXXD” motif in MkTPS1 ( Fig. S6). In the case of MkTPS2, the product analysis showed the formation of α-farnesene with FPP as substrate. There was no product formation either in the boiled protein control ( Fig. 7) or with GPP as substrate, indicating that MkTPS2 is a sesquiterpene synthase with  bona fide α-farnesene synthase activity ( Fig. 7a). Next, the geometric isomeric nature of the identified α-farnesene was determined to be ( E,E)-α-farnesene by comparison with authentic farnesene mix ( Fig. 7b and  Fig. S10). Among the characterized plant α-farnesene synthases, MkTPS2 exhibited highest identity (54%) with  Vitis vinifera (E,E)-α-farnesene synthase (VvαFS1) 13 that catalyzed the formation of α-farnesene from FPP. Amino acid sequence alignment of MkTPS2 with characterized plant α-farnesene synthases showed the presence of all conserved characteristic motifs of terpene synthases ( Fig. S8). Involvement of MkTPS1 and MkTPS2 in the formation of curry leaf volatiles In order to determine the involvement of characterized MkTPSs in curry leaf volatiles formation, tissue specific gene expression and headspace volatile compounds of  M. koenigii leaves were analyzed. Before proceeding for quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) analysis to determine the expression of  MkTPS1 and  MkTPS2, two endogenous reference genes  actin and  F-BOX were selected and validated for transcript normalization. Among them,  actin exhibited highest stability in different tissues ( Fig. S9). Root was used as calibrator to determine the relative expression in other tissues. Results showed the highest expression of both  MkTPS1 and  MkTPS2 in green berry and mature leaf followed by flower and stem ( Fig. 8). While  MkTPS1 exhibited ~13.5 and ~11.5 fold expression in berry and leaf, the expression of  MkTPS2 was also higher in above tissues (~9 fold and 8 fold respectively). Among the two candidates,  MkTPS1 exhibited higher transcript abundance compared to  MkTPS2 in mature leaf and green berry ( Fig. 8). Highest expression of both  MkTPS1 and  MkTPS2 in leaf and berry (which are the parts of the plant known for their higher aroma levels), indicated their involvement in the formation of major terpene volatiles. Subsequent GC-MS analysis of  M. koenigii leaf volatiles revealed that, the emitted volatiles were dominated by monoterpenes with sabinene as the major compound ( Fig. S11). The highest mRNA expression of MkTPS1 that catalyzes the formation of (−)-sabinene and the presence of (−)-sabinene as the major volatile compound indicated the involvement of MkTPS1 in (−)-sabinene formation in curry tree leaf. However, ( E,E)-α-farnesene formed by MkTPS2 was not detected in the headspace of curry leaf ( Fig. S11).","Curry tree (Murraya koenigii L.) is a rich source of aromatic terpenes and pharmacologically important carbazole alkaloids. Here, M. koenigii leaf transcriptome was generated to gain insight into terpenoid and alkaloid biosynthesis. Analysis of de novo assembled contigs yielded genes for terpene backbone biosynthesis and terpene synthases. Also, gene families possibly involved in carbazole alkaloid formation were identified that included polyketide synthases, prenyltransferases, methyltransferases and cytochrome P450s. Further, two genes encoding terpene synthases (MkTPS1 and MkTPS2) with highest in silico transcript abundance were cloned and functionally characterized to determine their involvement in leaf volatile formation. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions revealed the plastidial and cytosolic localization of MkTPS1 and MkTPS2, respectively. Enzymatic characterization demonstrated the monoterpene synthase activity of recombinant MkTPS1, which produced primarily (-)-sabinene from geranyl diphosphate (GPP). Recombinant MkTPS2 exhibited sesquiterpene synthase activity and formed (E,E)-α-farnesene as the major product from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Moreover, mRNA expression and leaf volatile analyses indicated that MkTPS1 accounts for (-)-sabinene emitted by M. koenigii leaves. Overall, the transcriptome data generated in this study will be a great resource and the start point for characterizing genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of medicinally important carbazole alkaloids.",NaN,"['Fig.', 'contigs', 'Table', 'formation', 'FPKM', 'synthases', 'synthase', 'leaf', 'analysis', 'annotated contigs']","[sequences/raw, SRA, SRR2970920, PRJNA304945, Biosample SAMN04311782, GFCO01000000, GC%, 102857, ≥1, 87417, 87417, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “cellular, ”, ≥150 , ≥1, 25809, “, ”, anthranilate, PKSIII, chalcone synthase-type, non-chalcone synthase type, MkPKS1-4, MkPKS1, chalcone synthase, CHS, MkPKS2, MkPKS3, MkPKS4, MtPKS1, PaPQSH, MkPKS1, MkPKS2 ( Fig. S5, MTs, cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP450s, PTs, “prenyltransferase, ”, MTs, “MT”, “MT, ”, “putative/uncharacterized MTs”, S5, CYP450, CYP450, CYP450, CYP51, CYP71, CYP76, CYP82, CYP88, CYP98, NCBI, TPSs ( Table 1, MkTPS1, MkTPS1 (602 aa, MkTPS3, MkTPS4 (608 aa, MkTPS2 (560 aa, MkTPS5 (562 aa, MkTPS6 (562 aa, TPS-e, MkTPS1, MkTPS3, Clγ-TPNS, MkTPS4, MkTPS2, MkTPS5, MkTPS6, CsVLS, MkTPS7, MdKS, “R(R)X, ”, MkTPS7, TPS-e, “RXR”, aspartate-rich metal ion binding motifs, “DDXXD”, “(N/D)DXX(S/T)XXXE”, MkTPS, MkTPS1, MkTPS2, MkTPS1, MkTPS2 (GenBank, MkTPS1, MkTPS2, GFP, MkTPS1 (100)-GFP, MkTPS2 (100)-GFP, GFP, MkTPS1, MkTPS2, MkTPS1, MkTPS2, pET32a, MkTPS1, MkTPS1, (−)-sabinene, TpSS, HcTPS7, MkTPS1, Asn-348, “DDXXD”, MkTPS1 ( Fig. S6, MkTPS2, MkTPS2, E)-α-farnesene, MkTPS2, E)-α-farnesene synthase, MkTPS2, MkTPS1, MkTPS2, ~13.5, green berry ( Fig. 8), MkTPS1, MkTPS1, MkTPS2]","['TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'MkTPS1', 'TPS', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS3', 'MkTPS4', 'TPS-b', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS5', 'MkTPS6', 'TPS-a', 'MkTPS7', 'TPS-e', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS3', 'MkTPS4', 'TPS-a', 'MkTPS2', '(RlemTPS4).', 'MkTPS5', 'MkTPS6', 'MkTPS7', 'TPSs', 'MkTPS7', 'TPS-e', 'TPS', 'MkTPS', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'TPS', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'TPS', 'MkTPS1cloning,', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS1', '(RlemTPS2)', '(HcTPS7)', 'MkTPS1', 'RlemTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2,', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPSs', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2,', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']","['Citrus', 'Citrus']",terpene synthase
45,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5404360\eupmc_result.json,PMC5404360,"Results Volatile Terpenes of  S. miltiorrhiza Determined by GC-MS To analyze volatile terpenes in root, stem, leaf and inflorescence of  S. miltiorrhiza, fresh tissues were extracted with hexane and subjected to GC-MS. In total 20 terpenes were detected, including 8 monoterpenes, 11 sesquiterenes, and 1 diterpenes ( Figure   1). Of the four organs sampled, leaf contained the most diversified terpenes, with at least 18 compounds (8 monoterpenes, 10 sesquiterpenes) being identified by searching NIST database and retention indices ( Garms et al., 2010). By contrast, root had the lowest diversity, as GC-MS identified only 1 diterpene (ferruginol). Notably, ferruginol was not present at a detectable level in the aerial tissues examined. Isolation of Terpene Synthase Genes and Phylogenetic Analysis We searched  S. miltiorrhiza transcriptomes ( Yang et al., 2013) for TPSs, and amplified cDNAs by 5′- and 3′-RACE. Three cDNAs, namely  SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and  SmSTPS3 (GenBank accession numbers are  KY432512,  KY432513, and  KY432514), were isolated. They all encode proteins of 546 amino acids, which are highly identical to each other with the sequence identity of 97∼99%. Based on  S. miltiorrhiza genome sequence database ( Xu et al., 2016),  SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and  SmSTPS3 are duplicates arranged as a cluster in the genome. Searching of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein database showed that the three proteins share a high (62%) sequence identity to germacrene A synthase PatTpsCF2 (AY508728) from  Pogostemon cablin ( Deguerry et al., 2006), another Lamiaceae species which is particularly rich in sesquiterpenes ( Swamy and Sinniah, 2015). The three proteins of  S. miltiorrhiza contain the conserved domain DDxxD involved in the coordination of divalent ions and water molecules, and a modified NSE/DTE domain [ND]D[LIV]x[ST]x 3E at the  C-terminal involved in metal cofactor binding ( Whittington et al., 2002). In addition, a modified RRx 8W motif exists at the  N-terminal ( Figure   2), which is related to cyclic products formation ( Martin et al., 2010;  Liu et al., 2014). Terpene synthases of plants are divided into eight clades or subfamilies designated TPS-a through TPS-h, with a minimum identity of 40% in each clade, and most angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases are clustered into TPS-a subfamily ( Bohlmann et al., 1997;  Pazouki and Niinemets, 2016). SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and SmSTPS3 appear to be typical sesquiterpene synthases ( Figure   3). Enzyme Activities of the Three TPSs The three putative terpene synthases were then expressed in  E. coli cells ( Supplementary Figure   S1). The purified fusion proteins were incubated with farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrate, and Mg 2+ as a metal cofactor. SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2 and SmSTPS3 all converted FPP into a single and same 204 Da sesquiterpene product, corresponding to the chemical formula C 15H 24 ( Figure   4). Its MS spectrum is closely resemble those of valencene by searching NIST database, however, the retention time of this enzymatic product in GC-MS analysis is different to that of authentic (+)-valencene ( Supplementary Figure   S2), suggesting that it may share the same skeleton with valencene. Kinetic analysis with FPP in the presence of Mg 2+ showed that the  K  m values of SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2 and SmSTPS3 are 25.35, 24.20, and 10.44 μM, the estimated  k  cat are 2.09 s -1, 2.07 s -1 and 1.53 s -1, and the  k  cat/K  m values are 8.27 × 10 4 s -1⋅M -1, 8.56 × 10 4 s -1⋅M -1, and 1.48 × 10 5 s -1⋅M -1, respectively ( Table   1). Thus, these three synthases have similar catalytic activities, though SmSTPS1 and SmSTPS2 are slightly more efficient. These parameters are in the normal range of plant TPSs. Structural Analysis of the Enzymatic Product To elucidate the structure of the enzymatic product of three putative terpene synthases, we collected 4.5 mg this compound through large scale incubation experiment. The  1H and  13C NMR spectroscopic data of this sesquiterpene product ( Table   2) were analogous to those of (+)-eremophilene ( Schifrin et al., 2015), a stereoisomer of (+)-valencene, but their MS data are different; furthermore, in GC-MS separation of (+)-eremophilene and (+)-valencene mix, peak of (+)-valencene eluted before (+)-eremophilene ( Schifrin et al., 2015), whilst in our GC-MS analysis of (+)-valencene and this esequiterpene product mix, (+)-valencene eluted after this compound ( Supplementary Figure   S2). All of these suggest that these compounds are structurally similar. The detailed 2D NMR analysis allowed the construction of the structure of the sesquiterpene ( Supplementary Figures   S3–  S8). The  1H- 1H chemical shift correlation spectroscopy (COSY) correlation of an olefinic proton (δ H = 5.36) to H-2, and its heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) correlations to C-3, and C-9 indicate the presence of C1-C10 double bound. The other olefinic protons (δ H = 4.74,  J = 15 Hz) have HMBC cross peaks with C-7 and C-13 methyl group, locating the exo-isopropylidene group at C-7. The HMBC correlations of C-15 methyl group to C-3, C-4, and C-5; And C-14 methyl group to C-4, C-5, C-6, and C-10 attached these two methyls at C-4 and C-5, respectively. Thus, this compound has the same planar structure as valencene and eremophilene, which harbors three chiral centers of C-4, C-5, and C-7, indicating the existence of eight stereoisomers. The GC-MS and NMR data of this compound are different to those of (+)-valencene, (-)-4-epieremophilene ( Zhao et al., 2004) and (+)-eremophilene ( Schifrin et al., 2015), and thus their enantiomers (-)-valencene, (+)-4-epieremophilene, and (-)-eremophilene, only leaving (+)-5-eremophilene and (-)-5-eremophilene as two possible candidates. The rotating frame overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) data are in agreement with this assignment. The optical rotation analysis gave a [α] 24 value of -29.4 (ethanol). Taken together, this compound was unambiguously determined as (-)-5-epieremophilene, which is neither isolated nor synthesized previously. And these three sesquiterpene synthases are  S. miltiorrhiza (-)-5-epieremophilene synthases. Transient Expression of SmSTPS1 in  Nicotiana benthamiana Because (-)-5-epieremophilene was not detected from the extracts of  S. miltiorrhiza plants, we adopted a transient expression system to produce recombinant proteins in leaves of  N. benthamiana ( Peyret and Lomonossoff, 2013;  Sainsbury and Lomonossoff, 2014), in order to further assay the activity of  S. miltiorrhiza (-)-5-eiperemophilene synthase  in planta. After 4 d of the infiltration of  Agrobacterium harboring pEAQ-SmSTPS1, the leaves were gathered and extracted. We found that, compared to the extracts from control  N. benthamiana leaves, an extra peak with the retention time of approximately 16 min appeared when SmSTPS1 was expressed, which was determined to be (-)-5-epieremophilene by GC-MS ( Figure   5). Spatial Expression Patterns and Hormone Induction Relative expression levels  SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and  SmSTPS3 in root and aerial organs were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The three (-)-5-epieremophilene synthase genes were mainly expressed in leaf and inflorescence, and their transcript levels were low or undetectable in stem and root. In general,  SmSTPS1 was expressed at a higher level than the other two, and its transcripts were most abundant in leaf.  SmSTPS2 was weakly expressed and exhibited a clear expression only in leaf, whereas  SmSTPS3 was expressed predominantly in inflorescence ( Figures   6A–  C). Thus, the three  STPS genes were differentially regulated in  S. miltiorrhiza plants. Next, we examined responses of the three sesquiterpene synthase genes to phytohormone treatments. Since  SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and  SmSTPS3 were all expressed in  S. miltiorrhiza leaves, changes in their expression levels in leaves were analyzed after hormone treatments. We found that, although the three sesquiterpene synthases share high similarities in sequences and catalytic activities, they responded differentially to different phytohormones at transcription level.  SmSTPS1 was induced strongly by ethylene (ET) and moderately by MeJA, abscicic acid (ABA) and gibberellin A 3 (GA 3) ( Figure   6D),  SmSTPS2 responded not only to ET but also to ABA ( Figure   6E), and  SmSTPS3 was up-regulated slightly only by ABA ( Figure   6F)."," Salvia miltiorrhiza , a medicinal plant in China, has been used for thousands of years to treat coronary heart diseases. Although biosynthesis of tanshinones, a group of diterpenoids in  S. miltiorrhiza , has been extensively investigated, to date we know little about the formation of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in this medicinal plant. Here, we report the characterization of three sesquiterpene synthases, named SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and SmSTPS3, which catalyzed the formation of a new compound, (-)-5-epieremophilene. Additionally, the (-)-5-epieremophilene biosynthesis activity of SmSTPS1 was confirmed by transient expression in  Nicotiana benthamiana.  Despite the similar enzyme activities of SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and SmSTPS3, the three (-)-5-epieremophilene synthase genes displayed different spatial expression patterns and responded differently to hormone treatments, implicating their specific roles in plant-environment interactions. Our results provide valuable data to understanding the biosynthesis and composition of terpenes in plant.","['Salvia miltiorrhiza', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Natural products', 'Terpene Synthases', '(-)-5-Epieremophilene']","['Volatile Terpenes', 'Figure', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Results Volatile', 'analyze volatile', 'Terpene synthases', 'sesquiterpene synthases', 'synthases', 'miltiorrhiza', 'valencene']","[5′-, 3′-RACE, SmSTPS2, SmSTPS2, AY508728, Deguerry, TPS-a, TPS-h, SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, SmSTPS3, farnesyl diphosphate, Mg 2, SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, SmSTPS3, Its, Mg 2, SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, SmSTPS3, μM, × 10 4, SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, Schifrin, Schifrin, δ, H-2, δ, Schifrin, (+)-5-eremophilene, (-)-5-eremophilene, α] 24, SmSTPS1, pEAQ-SmSTPS1, SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, SmSTPS2, ABA, gibberellin A 3, GA 3, ABA, ABA]","['TPSs,', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2,', 'SmSTPS3', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2,', 'SmSTPS3', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-h,', 'TPS-a', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2,', 'SmSTPS3', 'TPSs', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2', 'SmSTPS3', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2', 'SmSTPS3', 'SmSTPS1', 'SmSTPS2', 'TPSs.', 'SmSTPS1', 'pEAQ-SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS1', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2,', 'SmSTPS3', 'SmSTPS1', 'SmSTPS2', 'SmSTPS3', 'STPS', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2,', 'SmSTPS3', 'SmSTPS1', 'SmSTPS2', 'SmSTPS3']",[],[],terpene synthase
46,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5405137\eupmc_result.json,PMC5405137,"Results Fruit ripening assessment Fruits were non-destructively sorted into four ripening classes based on color. The homogeneity of each fruit batch was successively confirmed by destructive quality assessments such as texture, pH, titratable acidity, and soluble solid content, on randomly picked fruits. Principal component analysis based on fruit textural proprieties (Supplementary Figure  1), beyond a distinct separation of  Vaccinium cultivars, revealed a clear separation of the four harvest ripening stages, mostly explained by the variability of the first principal component (PC1: 95.6%). More ripe fruits were characterized by a greater deformation due to the applied forces while more unripe fruit had a higher resistance to the forces (F_Min and F_Max) that resulted also in a greater area under the deformation curve. As expected, textural differences between ripe and over ripe fruits were not as discernible as for the more unripe (green and pink) ones. However, differences between these two classes were magnified by the results of pH, treatable acidity (TA), and total soluble solids (TSS; Supplementary Figure  2). Overripe fruits of each cultivar were indeed characterized by higher pH and TSS-values and lower TA. Chemical composition of blueberry aroma assessed by SPME-GC-MS The gas chromatographic analysis by SPME-GC-MS assessed on five  Vaccinium cultivars (“Biloxi,” “Brigitta Blue,” “Centurion,” “Chandler,” and “Ozark Blue”) harvested at different ripening stages (green, pink, ripe, over ripe) allowed the detection of 106 VOCs, among which only six were not identified (reported as “Unknown”; Table  1). Esters, 25 in total, were the most represented chemical class. Other classes of compounds are aldehydes (18 compounds), alcohols (16), monoterpenes (14), ketones (7), acids (4), hydrocarbons (4), sesquiterpenes (3), lactones (1), and norisoprenoids (1). Based on VOC relative concentration, aldehydes were the most abundant class (in terms of total chromatographic area) since they covered almost 50% of the overall  Vaccinium volatile profile (Figure  1). The highest fraction of aldehydes was composed by C6 aldehydes such as (E)-2-hexenal, hexanal, (Z)-3-hexenal, hexadienal, or heptenal. These compounds, predominantly detected in unripe fruits, decreased during fruit ripening with slight variability between cultivars. Remarkably, some isomers of these aldehydes, such as (Z)-3-hexenal and (E)-2-hexenal, did not show the same evolution during fruit ripening. For instance, while (Z)-3-hexenal concentration decreased exponentially during ripening, (E)-2-hexenal concentration reached the utmost level at the pink stage and it lasted till the full ripe stage. Hexanal, the third aldehyde based on average concentration levels, after (E)-2-hexenal and (Z)-3-hexenal, revealed a production trend similar to (E)-2-hexenal one. Over 35% of the blueberry chromatographic profile was determined by alcoholic compounds (Figure  1). Nevertheless, this result should be discreetly considered since the largest fraction of these compounds was covered by ethanol. Besides ethanol, (Z)-3-hexenol and (Z)-2-hexenol were the most abundant alcohols. These alcohols, synthesized from their corresponding aldehydes [(Z)-3-hexenal and (Z)-2-hexenal], revealed an opposite evolution during fruit ripening. (Z)-3-hexanol was mostly synthesized by green blueberry and it suddenly decreased during fruit ripening. (Z)-2-hexenol amount, instead, increased linearly during fruit ripening and it reached significantly different end-levels at the overripe stage, according to the genotype. Likewise, hexanol was synthesized during fruit ripening and it reached different concentration that were genotype specific; for instance fruits of “Brigitta Blue,” differently from the other four cultivars considered in this study, were characterized by an extremely high amount of hexanol in the overripe stage. Another important fraction of the blueberry volatile profile was composed by monoterpenes (Figure  1), being 1,8-cineole and linalool two main elements of this chemical family: 1,8-cineole was mostly synthesized in green fruit and it rapidly reduced during fruit ripening; linalool was mostly produced in fruit at pink stage and preserved during the last phases of fruit ripening with different end-level amount according to the cultivar. A production course similar to the one of linalool was found also for geranyl acetone. Most of the other terpenes detected in blueberry, such as limonene, α-terpinolene, or α-terpineol, were mostly synthesized between the pink and ripe stage. Esters, although been present at lower average amount compared to the aforementioned compounds (Figure  1), had an important role to fully characterized the blueberry aroma, mostly at the overripe maturity stage. Most of the esters, such as ethyl acetate, methyl isovalerate, or ethyl isovalerate were largely synthesized in overripe fruit, while, contrariwise, only few esters, for instance (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, were detectable at high concentration in green fruit. Seven ketones were detected in blueberry fruit. 2-heptanone and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one were the two molecules with the higher chromatographic area. 2-heptanone, as well as 2-undecanone and 2-nonanone, were mostly detected in green fruit, with significant amount differences among cultivars. Their content decreased till trace levels during fruit ripening. 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one was instead detectable in blueberry in all ripening stages without any distinct course related to fruit ripening. Four hydrocarbons (octane, ethyl benzene, p-xylene, and m-xylene) were identified and, even if present in all ripening stages, they were mostly expressed in the ripe and overripe stages. The remaining fraction of the blueberry aroma profile was composed by four volatile acids (hexanoic acid, octanoic acid, nonanoic acid, and decanoic acid), three sesquiterpenes (δ-elemene, (E)-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide), one norisoprenoid (β-damascenone), and one lactone (butyrolactone). Apart from caryophyllene, for the most produced only in green fruits, all these compounds were stable during all ripening phases except for the overripe fruits of “Brigitta Blue” that were characterized by an increased level of hexanoic acid and octanoic acid content. Effect of ripening and genetic differences on the blueberry aroma profile Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out to describe relations among blueberry cultivars, ripening stages, and VOCs (Figure  2A). Sixty-five percent of the total variability was accounted for the first three principal components. Differences related to fruit ripening stages were mostly explainable by the first principal component (PC1: 40%), while differences between cultivars were better defined using the second component (PC2: 15%). Moreover, the variability described by the second principal component was essential to distinguish fruit belonging to the “ripe” or “overripe” classes. Overripe blueberries were indeed differentiated from ripe ones by more negative values of PC2, without any significant variations of PC1. This variability concurred with an increased concentration of compounds already present at significant levels in ripe fruits (such as ethyl benzene, xilene, hexanol, or 1-octen-3-ol), and, mostly, with the synthesis of compounds not detectable (or detectable only at trace levels) in ripe fruits that were for the most esters (i.e., ethyl acetate, methyl 3-methylbutanoate, or ethyl 3-methylbutanoate; loading plot Figure  2B). In addition, overripe fruits were characterized by a lower concentration of monoterpenes (i.e., limonene, linalool, α-terpineol, and β-myrcene) that were fully synthesized in ripe fruit. PCA analysis indicates that VOC emission of fruit at green maturity stages was characterized by high levels of aldehydes (i.e., 3-hexenal, 2-hexenal, 2-pentenal, or 2-heptenal) and of alcohols derived by these aldehydes, for instance (Z)-3- hexen-1-ol and 3-methyl butanol. The aromatic profile of unripe fruit was completed by some hexenyl esters (i.e., 3-hexenyl acetate, 3-hexenyl butanoate), one aromatic ester (ethyl benzoate), several ketones (i.e., 2-heptenone and 2-nonanone), one monoterpene (1,8-cineole), and by the sesquiterpenes (E)-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide. The aromatic profile of fruit harvested at the pink ripening stage was mostly defined by both the aforementioned compounds (for the most aldehydes) detected in greens stage blueberries, which concentrations decreased at this ripening stage. Moreover, some monoterpenes, such as linalool, linalool oxide, 4-terpineol and geranyl acetate were produced at this ripening stage. All VOCs detected in this study, beyond the biochemical classification, were grouped based on their concentration fold changes disclosed during the entire ripening process. All compounds were significantly sorted into eight clusters defined by SOTA (Self-organizing tree algorithm) analysis (Figure  2C, Table  1). Indeed, SOTA algorithm allowed a clustering based on relative fold changes of a compound among time series. The two groups with the higher number of VOCs were “cluster_1” and “cluster_8” respectively represented by 31 and 33 compounds. VOCs belonging to “cluster_1” were mostly produced by green blueberries and they were suddenly reduced during fruit ripening. Oppositely, compounds of “cluster_8” were exclusively synthesized in the last ripening step in overripe fruits. All left compounds were divided into the remaining six clusters (from “cluster_2” to “cluster_7”), which showed different dynamics patterns of VOCs concentration fold changes from green to over ripe. Direct injection VOC profiling by PTR-ToF-MS A PLS regression network was created combining VOC data obtained by SPME-GC-MS and PTR-ToF-MS analysis (Figure  4). Based on the obtained regressions, graphically reported in the loading plot of Figure  4A, the network was built on significant ( p < 0.01) correlations between VOCs detected by SPME-GC-MS and masses quantified by PTR-ToF-MS only taking into account correlation values >0.6 or <–0.6. The gradient color coding of the edges (blue and red gradient color), as well as the line thickness, denotes the level of correlation (0.6–1). Most of the PTR-ToF-MS peaks considered in this study were putatively identified (Table  2) based on PLS regression analysis,  in silico fragmentation of the compounds previously detected by SPME-GC-MS, and fragmentation analysis of commercial standards. Indeed, lots of incorrect attributions would be obtained by merely considering the SPLS results. For instance  m/z 89.06 was highly correlated ( R > 0.9) with at least eight VOCs detected by SPME-GC-MS, such as the esters methyl-2-methylbutanoate or 3 methyl-3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoate and the alcohols 1-octanol or 1-nonanol, even though all these molecules were differently fragmented during protonization. Therefore, ethyl acetate resulted to be the only detected compound by SPME-GC-MS highly correlated with  m/z 89.060 and with an accurate chemical fragmentation. Fruit samples analyzed by PTR-ToF-MS were prepared similarly to the ones used for SPME-GC-MS analysis in order to compare these two methodologies. The PTR-ToF-MS setting adopted in this study allowed the detection of the full VOC spectra in 1 s. Only the first 30 s of the full measurement (120 s) were analyzed and averaged, in order to avoid possible measurement inaccuracies caused by an excessive dilution of the sample headspace. The whole VOC spectra, assessed in triplicate for samples, were reduced from 293 to 105 masses, applying noise, and correlation coefficient thresholds (Table  2). PCA analysis (Figure  3A) was carried out to describe the blueberry VOC profile regarding cultivars (“Biloxi,” “Brigitta Blue,” “Centurion,” “Chandler,” and “Ozark Blue”) and ripening stages (green, pink, ripe, overripe). Seventy-two percent of the total variation was accounted for the first three principal components. Similarly to SPME-GC-MS analysis, differences between fruit sampled at different ripening stages were mostly explainable by the first principal component (PC1: 43%), while the second component (PC2: 18%) mostly defined differences between cultivars. Furthermore, PC2 variability allowed the separation of overripe fruit from ripe ones: overripe fruits, besides the cultivar “Chandler,” were all displaced into the PCA quadrant determined by positive values of PC1 and negative ones of PC2. Based on the loading plot (Figure  3B), this discrimination was mostly explainable by masses related to alcohols such as  m/z 29.040 and 47.049 (ethanol),  m/z 34.037 (methanol isotope; the nominal mass of methanol,  m/z 33.030, was not considered in this study because in some samples its concentration was above the maximum threshold of accuracy), acetone ( m/z 59.048), acetaldehyde ( m/z 45.033), formaldehyde ( m/z 31.019), and several masses tentatively associated to esters such as  m/z 61.028, 75.044, 89.060, 103.076, 117.092, 131.107. The aroma profile of unripe fruits, especially of the green ones, was mostly defined by negative values of PC1 that means a higher concentration of masses related to aldehydes, such as  m/z 99.080, 81.070, 69.070, or 43.019, esters with “green” fragrances such as hexadienal and hexenyl acetate ( m/z 97.06 and 143.108), butyrolactone ( m/z 87.044), and sulfuric compounds ( m/z 63.026 and 93.037, tentatively identified as dimethyl sulfide and 2-(methylthio)ethanol). Almost one third of the PTR-ToF-MS masses was not strongly correlated ( R < 0.5) with any of the three principal components. These masses, indeed, were detectable only at low concentrations (average level lower than 2 ppbv) and/or they did not vary significantly between cultivars and ripening stages such as for  m/z 107.08 (ethyl benzene and/or xylene) and  m/z 95.086 ((E)-2-heptenal). As for SPME-GC-MS analysis, all 105 masses detected by PTR-ToF-MS were grouped into eight significant SOTA clusters based on their concentration fold changes during the entire ripening process (Figure  3C, Table  2). As formerly revealed by the PCA analysis, “cluster_1” grouped a set of 36 masses that did not significantly vary between cultivars and ripening stages. “Clusters_2, _3, and _4” sorted VOCs that were mostly produced by unripe fruits and they diminished during fruit ripening. Each of the three clusters was characterized by a different depletion slope of VOCs concentration. The remaining VOCs, that were mostly produced during fruit ripening, were arranged into the remaining four clusters, namely “cluster_5, _6, _7, and _8.” “Cluster_5” was composed by seven VOCs masses whose concentration was highest in fruits assessed at the pink ripe stage. This concentration remained stable, or it slightly diminished, during the last ripening phases (ripe and overripe). The main masses grouped into this cluster were:  m/z 47.013 (formic acid);  m/z 83.086 (hexenols and/or hexenal fragment);  m/z 101.09 (hexenal);  m/z 127.113 (6-methyl-5-heptenone and terpenes such as myrcene and limonene);  m/z 155.144 (terpenes such as linalool, geraniol, or cineole). “Cluster_6” gathered five VOCs masses characterized by a constant and almost linear concentration increment during fruit ripening. Some of these masses were  m/z 61.028 (acetic acid and common ester fragment),  m/z 85.100 (hexanol),  m/z 93.07 (monoterpene fragment), and  m/z 105.071 (phenethyl alcohol). “Cluster_7” was only composed by three VOC masses namely  m/z 59.049 (acetone),  m/z 135.118 and 153.129 (HO-trienol). These VOCs were mostly produced by fruit analyzed at ripe stage. “Cluster_8,” lastly, counted 12 VOCs masses whose concentration stood at low basal levels till the ripe stage and it greatly rose in overripe fruit. Among these compounds there were masses related to ethanol ( m/z 29.040, 47.049, and 63.043), to methanol ( m/z 34.037 and 51.043) and to ester compounds ( m/z 75.044, 89.060, 103.076, 117.092, and 131.107). VOCs characterization of vaccinium species by PTR-ToF-MS In addition to the previous study, PTR-ToF-MS methodology was applied to identify the VOCs profiles of different blueberry species assessed at the full ripe stage. In detail, we analyzed four cultivars of  V. corymbosum L. (“Brigitta Blue,” “Chandler,” “Liberty,” and “Ozark Blue”), three cultivars of  V. virgatum Aiton (“Centurion,” “Powder Blue,” and “Sky Blue”), three ecotypes of  V. myrtillus L. propagated from different mountain locations of Trentino, and one accession of  V. cylindraceum Smith. The entire volatile profiles assessed for these 11 accessions, in five biological replicates, were organized and depicted by the heat map showed in Figure  5A, using a data-set reduced to 98 masses by applying noise and correlation coefficient thresholds (all data are “centered” and “scaled”). The vertical dendrogram of the heat map shows the grouping of PTR-ToF-MS masses based on their relative abundance. On the same heat map all blueberry accessions were organized by a hierarchical clustering, based on VOCs relative content. The hierarchical clustering revealed a significant grouping of the  Vaccinium accessions based on their taxonomic differences, since each of the four species was grouped into a clearly separate cluster. This separation was also confirmed by the PCA analysis done on Log-transformed data (Figure  5B). Seventy-nine percent of the total variability among aroma profile was accounted for the first three principal components (PC1: 39%; PC2: 26%; PC3: 14%). Based on these PCA results, all cultivars were properly and distinctly distributed based on their aromatic profile confirming the defined clusterization among  Vaccinium species and low variability among biological replicates. For instance, the aromatic profile of  V. myrtillus L. and  V. cylindraceum Smith accessions were significantly distinct mostly based on PC1 and PC3-values. According to the PCA loading plot (Supplementary Figure  4) this separation was mostly explainable by a higher concentration of most of detected compounds (negative values of PC1).  V. corymbosum L. and  V. virgatum Aiton, instead, mostly differed according to PC3-values. However, the variability among these last two species was broad, with cultivars characterized by an intense VOC profile, such as “Chandler” or “Centurion,” and others with reduced VOC concentrations, such as “Brigitta Blue.” All these indicative differences in aroma composition detected by PTR-ToF-MS are summarized into the Venn diagram (Figure  5C) where the VOCs significantly ( p < 0.01) more detectable in each  Vaccinium species are grouped together (Supplementary Table  1). Among the four species assessed in this study,  V. cylindraceum L. was the most aromatic one. Its aroma profile was defined by 30 masses that were measured at significantly higher concentration such as some alcohols ( m/z 47.049 and 85.100), ester fragments (i.e.,  m/z 61.028, 75.044, and 89.059), aldehydes ( m/z 83.085, 97.065, and 99.080), and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds ( m/z 95.049 and 107.086). The  V. myrtillus L. ecotypes were characterized by a less intense VOC profile than  V. cylindraceum L. This profile, on average levels, was defined by an increased amount of  m/z 81.070 (C6 aldehyde and terpene fragment) and some ester related masses (i.e.,  m/z 103.076, 117.092, 131.107, and 143.108). The four cultivars of  V. corymbosum L. differed from the other accessions for 21 masses. However, these VOCs were detectable at lower concentration, since only nine of them revealed at concentration higher than 2 ppbv, such as some terpene related masses (i.e.,  m/z 93.037, 127.113, or 137.135). Lastly, the VOCs profile of the cultivars of  V. virgatum Aiton revealed several masses detected at the same level of  V. corymbosum L. (13 masses) and  V. cylindraceum Smith (11 masses), and 7 masses significantly more produced with only three of them with concentration higher than 2 ppb v ( m/z 59.049, 105.071, and 115.113).","Blueberry ( Vaccinium  spp.) fruit consumption has increased over the last 5 years, becoming the second most important soft fruit species after strawberry. Despite the possible economic and sensory impact, the blueberry volatile organic compound (VOC) composition has been poorly investigated. Thus, the great impact of the aroma on fruit marketability stimulates the need to step forward in the understanding of this quality trait. Beside the strong effect of ripening, blueberry aroma profile also varies due to the broad genetic differences among  Vaccinium  species that have been differently introgressed in modern commercial cultivars through breeding activity. In the present study, divided into two different activities, the complexity of blueberry aroma was explored by an exhaustive untargeted VOC analysis, performed by two complementary methods: SPME-GC-MS (solid phase microextraction- gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and PTR-ToF-MS (proton transfer reaction-time of flight-mass spectrometry). The first experiment was aimed at determining the VOC modifications during blueberry ripening for five commercially representative cultivars (""Biloxi,"" ""Brigitta Blue,"" ""Centurion,"" ""Chandler,"" and ""Ozark Blue"") harvested at four ripening stages (green, pink, ripe, and over-ripe) to outline VOCs dynamic during fruit development. The objective of the second experiment was to confirm the analytical capability of PTR-ToF-MS to profile blueberry genotypes and to identify the most characterizing VOCs. In this case, 11 accessions belonging to different  Vaccinium  species were employed:  V .  corymbosum  L. (""Brigitta,"" ""Chandler,"" ""Liberty,"" and ""Ozark Blue""),  V. virgatum  Aiton (""Centurion,"" ""Powder Blue,"" and ""Sky Blue""),  V. myrtillus  L. (three wild genotypes of different mountain locations), and one accession of  V. cylindraceum  Smith. This comprehensive characterization of blueberry aroma allowed the identification of a wide pull of VOCs, for the most aldehydes, alcohols, terpenoids, and esters that can be used as putative biomarkers to rapidly evaluate the blueberry aroma variations related to ripening and/or senescence as well as to genetic background differences. Moreover, the obtained results demonstrated the complementarity between chromatographic and direct-injection mass spectrometric techniques to study the blueberry aroma.","['Breeding', 'Ripening', 'Flavor', 'VOCs', 'Ptr-tof-ms', 'Vaccinium Spp.', 'Spme-gc-ms']","['Fruit ripening', 'Fruit', 'ripening', 'ripening stages', 'Figure', 'VOCs', 'Fruits', 'Brigitta Blue', 'masses', 'concentration']","[F_Min, TSS-values, “, ” “, ”, “Ozark, Blue”, “, ”, (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, (Z)-2-hexenol, (Z)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexanol, (Z)-2-hexenol, “, Blue, ”, green fruit, α-terpineol, (Z)-3-hexenyl, green fruit, green fruit, β-damascenone, “, PC2, “, ”, “, ”, PC2, α-terpineol, (Z)-3- hexen-1-ol, 2-heptenone, “cluster_8”, “cluster_8”, “cluster_2”, “cluster_7”, –0.6, “, ” “, ”, “Ozark, Blue”, PC2, PC2, “, ”, PC2, 29.040, 34.037, 33.030, 61.028, 75.044, 89.060, 103.076, 117.092, 131.107, 43.019, “green”, 143.108, 93.037, 95.086, “cluster_1”, “Clusters_2, _4”, 83.086, 6-methyl-5-heptenone, 155.144, “Cluster_6”, 61.028, 85.100, “Cluster_7”, 135.118, 153.129 (HO-trienol, “Cluster_8, ”, 63.043, 89.060, 103.076, 117.092, 131.107, “, Blue, ”, “Ozark, Blue”, “, ” “, Blue, ”, “Sky, Blue”, “, ”, “, ”, PC2, PC3-values, PC3-values, “Chandler”, “, ”, “, Blue, ”, Venn, Its, 85.100, 61.028, 75.044, 89.059, 97.065, 107.086, C6 aldehyde, 103.076, 117.092, 131.107, 143.108, 127.113, 137.135, v ( m/z 59.049, 105.071, 115.113]",[],[],[],NaN
47,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5432621\eupmc_result.json,PMC5432621,"Results and discussion Our study gives an example of the systems biology approach. Systems biology has been successfully applied to the discovery of regulatory and biosynthetic genes involved in the control of metabolite production (Yuan et al.,  2008; Liberman et al.,  2012), including examples from grape (Zamboni et al.,  2010; Fortes et al.,  2011; Agudelo-Romero et al.,  2013; Costantini et al.,  2015; Malacarne et al.,  2015; Suzuki et al.,  2015; Wen et al.,  2015; Savoi et al.,  2016). Metabolic analysis The present work provides a temporal profiling of aromatic compounds in the Moscato Bianco ripening berry. The protocol used for the chemical analysis was optimized for molecules belonging to the monoterpenoid class, however it allowed the simultaneous quantification of additional metabolites. In particular, the content of 21 monoterpenoids, 3 C 13-norisoprenoids, 5 phenylpropanoids/benzenoids and 3 C 6 aliphatic compounds was quantified from pre- veraison to over-ripening in 2005, 2006, and 2007. For several compounds a coherent accumulation trend was observed in the different years (Figure  1 and Supplementary Figure  S1A). The most significant correlation between seasons was observed for free linalool, nerol, α-terpineol, hydroxy-diendiol I + hydroxy-trienol, hydroxy-diendiol II, hexanol,  cis-3-hexen-1-ol, bound linalool, geraniol, nerol,  trans-furan linalool oxide and benzyl alcohol. Other metabolites appeared instead to be more sensitive to seasonal effects, like rainfall and temperature (Supplementary Figure  S1B). Hereafter, we will refer to 2006, which is the year assayed by microarray analysis. The most abundant metabolites were monoterpenes (hydroxy-diendiol I,  trans-geranic acid, linalool, geraniol and nerol), with concentrations higher than 600 μg/kg of berries (Figure  2 and Supplementary Figure  S2). The majority of monoterpenoids reached the highest amount in their glycosidically bound form. The main exceptions are represented by high oxidation state monoterpenes, like the two pyran linalool oxides, the two diendiols and rose oxide I. A clear prevalence of the free form was also observed for the C 6 aliphatic compounds, while the most abundant C 13-norisoprenoids and phenylpropanoids/benzenoids were glycosidically bound, in agreement with previous analyses (Sánchez Palomo et al.,  2006; D'Onofrio et al.,  2016). The quantity of many metabolites was significantly (at least 2-fold) altered during ripening. The compounds that changed most with respect to pre- veraison were linalool, geraniol, nerol, cis/ trans-8-hydroxy-linalool, hydroxy-diendiol I and II in both forms;  cis-furan linalool oxide,  trans-geranic acid, 7-hydroxy-geraniol, 7-hydroxy-citronellol, hydroxy-trienol in their free form;  trans-furan linalool oxide, 3-oxo-α-ionol, methyl salicylate, hexanol and  cis-3-hexen-1-ol in their bound form (Supplementary Figures  S3A,D, Supplementary Table  S4). The pattern of accumulation along berry development varied with the metabolite (Figure  2 and Supplementary Figure  S2). The concentration of the three compounds mainly contributing to Muscat aroma (linalool, geraniol, and nerol) was from low to moderate before  veraison (August 17 or stage E-L 34.5 in this work) and then increased during ripening. Free linalool reached its maximum on September 13 (technological maturity or stage E-L 38) and decreased during over-ripening. A similar behavior was observed in 2005 and 2007, even though the peak corresponded to slightly earlier stages (Figure  1E), proving that technological and aroma ripening might not occur at the same time (Vilanova et al.,  2012). Otherwise, free geraniol and nerol as well as the three bound forms showed a steady increase in their content during the sampling period. These results confirm previous findings (Günata et al.,  1985; Ebang-Oke et al.,  2003; Piazzolla et al.,  2016). Several additional patterns were observed. For example, the four linalool oxides could be detected at berry onset; their concentration reached a minimum between July 31 (stage E-L 31.5 in this work) and August 8 (stage E-L 33) and then increased in at least one of the two forms to peak on September 13 (stage E-L 38) in their free form. While the glycosidically bound forms of the two diendiols showed a similar pattern of accumulation, free hydroxy-diendiol I and hydroxy-trienol were highly concentrated before  veraison and decreased over the course of berry ripening, with a trend opposite to that of free hydroxy-diendiol II (Figures  1,  2). The high content of free hydroxy-diendiol I and hydroxy-trienol at berry onset, when free linalool was not yet produced, may indicate that their accumulation is regulated independently from that of their precursor. In the attempt of simplification, metabolite network analysis was performed on a total of 52 (26 free and 26 glycosidically bound) compounds. Metabolite grouping was obtained through hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis by using different metabolic data sets (Figure  3 and Supplementary Figures  S3,  S4). It is clearly evident that most monoterpenes are tightly correlated, which is indicative of their common metabolic origin and in agreement with previous findings (Ilc et al.,  2016b). In particular, when considering the absolute amount of free metabolites at 13 time points, three main clusters (AU > 95%) could be identified: (1)  cis-pyran linalool oxide (OxD),  trans-pyran linalool oxide (OxC),  trans-furan linalool oxide (OxA) and  cis-furan linalool oxide (OxB); (2) geraniol, nerol,  cis-8-hydroxy-linalool, benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol,  trans-geranic acid, citronellol, hydroxy-diendiol II,  trans-8-hydroxy-linalool, linalool, hexanol,  trans-3-hexen-1-ol, rose oxide I, rose oxide II and α-terpineol; (3) 4-terpineol and hydroxy-diendiol I + hydroxy-trienol. Additionally, within the second cluster a clear separation could be noticed between linalool on one side, geraniol and nerol on the other side (Figure  3A and Supplementary Figure  S4A). Oppositely, when considering the absolute amount of bound metabolites at 13 time points a single significant cluster was obtained, which included most of the analyzed compounds. It can be easily noticed that bound  cis-furan linalool oxide (OxB) has a peculiar behavior with respect to the other three linalool oxides (Figure  3B and Supplementary Figure  S4C). Microarray analysis Gene expression in Moscato Bianco berry skin at stages 2–5 was compared to stage 1 (pre- veraison). The two biological replicates assayed at each stage were confirmed to perfectly cluster together (Supplementary Figure  S5). The total number of differentially expressed probes (DEPs) in at least one comparison was 2,228, which corresponds to 15% of the chip probes (Supplementary Table  S5). As expected, the highest number of DEPs was observed in stage 5 vs. stage 1 (616 up-regulated and 1,132 down-regulated probes), whereas the lowest number was recorded in stage 2 vs. stage 1 (452 up-regulated and 506 down-regulated probes). A number of DEPs were common among comparisons (21, 19, and 28% of common DEPs among 2, 3, and 4 comparisons, respectively), whereas 32% of the DEPs were regulated at only one time point (data calculated from Supplementary Table  S5). Microarray validation via real-time PCR Specific primers were designed for 15 candidate genes and the change in their expression during berry development was analyzed in skin tissues by qRT-PCR to validate the microarray dataset (Figure  4). A strong relationship was found between the microarray and qPCR fold changes in the expression levels of the 15 genes (overall Pearson correlation coefficient  r = 0.84, with individual values ranging from 0.47 to 1), indicating the reliability of the whole transcriptome assay (Figure  4 and Supplementary Table  S3). Discovery of a link between transcriptome and metabolome in aroma development Potential links between transcripts and metabolites were established based on correlation and clustering approaches, though they do not necessarily imply causation. To this purpose, 4,450 probes with adjusted  p-values < 0.05 in all comparisons were considered, which included 1,906 out of the 2,228 DEPs with a cut-off of 2 fold-change and adjusted  p-value < 0.01. Integration of 2006 transcriptomic and metabolic data Pairwise correlation Significant (at the 0.05 or 0.01 level) Pearson correlations could be established only in the absence of Benjamini and Hochberg ( 1995) correction for multiple testing (Supplementary Table  S6). Consequently, this result was employed as criterium in the following candidate gene selection only in combination with additional supporting evidence. In the two-step strategy, positive pairwise expression correlations were discovered between 33 enzyme/transporter-coding genes correlated to metabolites and several regulatory genes within the microarray (Supplementary Table  S6). Correlation biclustering Correlation clustering between transcripts and metabolites resulted in the identification of 419 biclusters, that are groups of probes with a common behavior toward a group of metabolites. The clustered probes and metabolites were found to belong to a number of biclusters ranging from 1 to 10 and from 3 to 182, respectively (Supplementary Table  S7). Soft clustering Based on their expression profile across stages 1–5, the selected 4,450 probes and 52 metabolites were clustered into nine distinct Mfuzz groups (Figure  5 and Supplementary Table  S8). The distribution of probes per cluster within each MapMan functional category is shown in Supplementary Figure  S6 and the enriched categories within each cluster are indicated in Figure  5. Probes annotated with the Mapman functional category “Secondary metabolism” were not found to be significantly over-represented in any cluster. Free geraniol and nerol were attributed to a distinct cluster (cluster 6) with respect to free linalool (cluster 9), which reflects their Pvclust clustering (Figure  3A and Supplementary Figure  S4A). This separation is mainly due to the decrease of free linalool, but not geraniol and nerol, from technological maturity onwards (Figure  2). The highly similar accumulation trend of geraniol and nerol likely reflects a common chemical origin (nerol is a geometrical isomer of geraniol), while their relationship with linalool is less clear. Oppositely, the bound forms of the three monoterpenoids accumulated to a similar extent (cluster 4 in Figure  5), suggesting dynamic changes in the distribution and concentration of these compounds. Selection of candidate genes Several genes with a potential association to aroma-related compounds were identified from the probes correlated and clustered with those metabolites (Supplementary Table  S9, Supplementary Discussion in Supplementary  Data1 and Supplementary Table  S10). In particular, the contrasting behavior of free linalool and free geraniol/nerol encouraged us to search for genes specifically related to one or the other profile. The existence of linalool-specific metabolic pathways is even more intriguing if we consider that the prevalence of the linalool class on the geraniol one clearly distinguishes Moscato Bianco from other aromatic varieties (D'Onofrio et al.,  2016). From this broad gene set, the most promising candidates for monoterpene biosynthesis and its regulation were further selected (Table  2) based on supporting evidence from the literature, e.g., a relevant role for the homolog gene in other plant species, the co-localization with QTLs for monoterpene content (with a special attention to the linalool-specific QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 10, which were also detected in the Moscato Bianco genetic background by Battilana et al.,  2009), or the coexpression from public transcriptomic databases with genes involved in the metabolic pahways under study, which may indicate functional association according to the “guilt-by-association” principle. Hereafter, we discuss the most interesting findings from the present work; obvioulsy, we can't exclude that additional genes not included in this microarray platform may participate in monoterpene biosynthesis, as well as we can't know  a priori whether our findings will be reproduced in other Muscat varieties with a genetic background different from Moscato Bianco. Monoterpene skeleton biosynthesis Early terpenoid pathway genes. The role of  VvDXS isoforms in the development of aroma was previously investigated by real-time PCR on the same samples of Moscato Bianco analyzed here (Battilana,  2009), for which reason we did not repeat the analysis. In that study a significant up-regulation of  VvDXS1 was found to precede the peak of linalool, geraniol and nerol resulting in a positive correlation between  VvDXS1 expression profile and monoterpenoid accumulation. On the Grape AROS V1.0 array no probe could be found for  VvDXS1, whereas four probes corresponding to other  DXS isoforms (VIT_04s0008g04970 and VIT_00s0218g00110) were not differentially expressed during Moscato Bianco berry ripening. Several pieces of evidence from different plant species suggest that flux control in the MEP pathway does not converge on a single rate-limiting enzyme, such as DXS, but may involve other enzymes like DXR (1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase) and HDR (Vranová et al.,  2012; Hemmerlin,  2013). The lack of significant modulation and the decreasing trend during berry ripening observed for  VvDXR in our study (VIT_17s0000g08390 in Figure  4) do not support a regulatory role, in agreement with Rodríguez-Concepción et al. ( 2001) and Mendoza-Poudereux et al. ( 2014). Oppositely, the expression of  VvHDR (VIT_03s0063g02030 in Figure  4) is consistent with the  veraison-initiated accumulation of monoterpenes, as reported by Martin et al. ( 2012) and Wen et al. ( 2015) (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). Middle and late terpenoid pathway genes. In other plant species GPPS works as a heterodimeric complex; in particular, the levels of GPPS small subunit, but not GPPS large subunit, might play a key role in regulating monoterpene biosynthesis (Tholl et al.,  2004). Consistently, the AROS probes for GPPS large subunit genes (VIT_04s0023g01210 and VIT_18s0001g12000) were neither differentially expressed during Moscato Bianco berry ripening nor correlated to any monoterpene. No probe could be identified for the GPPS small subunit. Only three probes for terpene synthases are present on the Grape AROS V.1 array, which are not specific to any single gene prediction. One of them, showing the best match to the sesquiterpene synthases VIT_18s0001g04280 and VIT_18s0001g04530, was up-regulated during Moscato Bianco berry ripening (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). It is worth noting that the same genes were reported to correlate with linalool and α-terpineol (Savoi et al.,  2016). An interesting candidate gene for the biosynthesis of monoterpenes is a nudix hydrolase (VIT_10s0003g00880), whose expression increases along berry development (Figure  4). The corresponding probe belongs to cluster 4, which also harbors several monoterpenes (Table  2, Supplementary Tables  S8,  S9). Recently, a rose nudix hydrolase was reported to convert geranyl diphosphate to geranyl monophosphate, which in turn is hydrolyzed to geraniol by a phosphatase activity (Magnard et al.,  2015). This alternative and completely new terpene synthase-independent route for monoterpene production might play a role also in other plants, including grapevine. Secondary monoterpene transformations Extensive oxidative monoterpene metabolism has been reported in grapes and wine, with a percentage of linalool oxygenation ranging from 52 to 97% (Ilc et al.,  2016b). The main linalool oxidation products are  trans/ cis-8-hydroxy-linalool (by hydroxylation),  trans/ cis pyranoid/furanoid linalool oxides and polyhydroxylated derivatives or polyols like the odorless hydroxy-diendiol I and II (by epoxidation and hydrolysis). Similarly, C-8 oxygenated geraniol and citronellol derivatives can be formed through hydroxylation, whereas the oxidation to geranial and neral (altogether named citral) is supposedly mediated by alcohol dehydrogenases. Geranic acid is another oxidation product of geraniol. Rose oxide is generated from citronellol by allylic hydroxylation and acid-catalyzed cyclization. Citronellol in turn arises from the reduction of geraniol and nerol (hydrogenation). Members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 71 and 76 families were recently shown to metabolize linalool in  Arabidopsis thaliana (Ginglinger et al.,  2013; Höfer et al.,  2014; Boachon et al.,  2015). Interestingly, the CYP76 gene family has encountered an evident expansion in the grape genome (Nelson et al.,  2008). In order to identify genes potentially implicated in grape monoterpenoid metabolism we looked in VTCdb database ( http://vtcdb.adelaide.edu.au/Home.aspx) for CYP genes coexpressed with linalool synthases, as in Ginglinger et al. ( 2013). This information was then added to our transcriptomic and metabolic integrated datasets. On this base, we propose some genes (VIT_15s0048g01490, VIT_15s0048g01590, VIT_18s0001g13790, VIT_00s0389g00030, VIT_00s0389g00040) and eventually additional ones as potential CYPs involved in linalool metabolism (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). Most of these candidates have been never reported elsewhere, and thus deserve further attention. Conversely, VIT_15s0048g01490 and VIT_18s0001g13790 were recently characterized by Ilc et al. ( 2017) but their biochemical activity was only tested on a limited number of compounds. Our findings suggest instead that these genes might play a role in the production of a broader set of hydroxylated and/or epoxidized products as in other species (Meesters et al.,  2007; Ginglinger et al.,  2013; Höfer et al.,  2013,  2014; Boachon et al.,  2015) and, even if the need for further oxidoreductases can not be excluded (Ilc et al.,  2016a), they encourage to check this hypothesis by analyzing additional substrates (geraniol, nerol, citronellol) and products (e. g. pyranoid/furanoid linalool oxides, hydroxy-diendiols, geranic acid, rose oxides) in CYP enzymatic assays. We also propose an epoxide hydrolase (VIT_04s0023g02610) to be assessed for involvement in monoterpene oxidative metabolism (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). Based on their sequence similarity with terpenoid glucosyltransferases from different plant species and on their membership in biclusters harboring some glucosylated monoterpenes, we propose that VIT_03s0180g00200, VIT_03s0180g00320 (Table  2) and eventually other genes reported in Supplementary Table  S9 (VIT_03s0091g00040, VIT_03s0180g00280, VIT_05s0062g00430, VIT_05s0062g00520, VIT_05s0062g00630, VIT_05s0062g00640) might code for enzymes that glucosylate monoterpenes along with additional metabolites. Most of these genes have been investigated in previous works but they were not considered as candidates for monoterpene glucosylation in view of their decreasing expression during berry development (Khater et al.,  2011; Bönisch et al.,  2014a, b). However, they might be involved in the production of glucosylated monoterpenes with a similar trend, like the high oxidation state monoterpenoids sharing the same biclusters (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9), which were not quantified in those papers. This hypothesis is not contradicted by the lack of gene annotation referring to the “Monoterpenoid biosynthesis” pathway and of positive correlation between transcript and monoterpenyl glucoside accumulation, as the same holds for the biochemically characterized monoterpenol glucosyltransferase  VvGT7 (Table  2) and may be explained by the broad substrate tolerance and overlapping enzymatic activities of the large GT family. Monoterpenyl glucosides are only intermediates within the glycosylation pathway and post-transcriptional control is additionally involved (Bönisch et al.,  2014a). Monoterpene transport Terpene transport within the cell and into the apoplast is an almost unexplored field. It may engage multiple pathways, e.g., (1) insertion of the hydrophobic terpenes into vesicle membranes followed by transport and fusion to the plasma membrane, (2) carrier proteins (like GSTs, glutathione S-transferases, and ABC, ATP-binding cassette transporters) that conduct these molecules to the (plasma) membrane, and (3) direct diffusion between the endoplasmic reticulum and/or plastidial (stromule) membranes and the plasma membrane (Ting et al.,  2015). The fusion of vesicles with target membranes is mediated by a group of proteins called SNAREs (soluble NSF attachment protein receptors). Surprisingly and still without a clear underlying mechanism, both sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes were boosted when vesicle fusion was inhibited in  Nicotiana benthamiana (Ting et al.,  2015). Moreover, two  Arabidopsis linalool synthases were detected in vesicular structures associated with the plastids (Ginglinger et al.,  2013). Based on these findings, we included among our candidates a gene coding for a SNARE associated Golgi protein (VIT_02s0012g01630). Plant ABCG transporters play a role in the flux of secondary metabolites, particularly of terpenoid origin (Kang et al.,  2011). Interestingly, we found an ABCG gene (VIT_16s0039g00010) that shows a profile consistent with monoterpene accumulation and is coexpressed with several monoterpene synthases in VTCdb. We also selected a glutathione S-transferase (VIT_08s0040g03040) and two amino acid permeases (VIT_06s0009g01140 and VIT_08s0007g05210), which are coexpressed with monoterpene biosynthetic genes in VTCdb and positively correlated to several monoterpenes in the present study (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). Monoterpene biosynthesis transcriptional regulation Recent works (Cramer et al.,  2014; Wen et al.,  2015) suggested that a group of ERF6-type transcription factors clustered on chromosome 16 are involved in aroma accumulation, based on the correlation of their transcript abundance and the transcript abundance of several terpenoid pathway genes. For some of these regulatory genes, e.g., the orthologs of  CrORCA2, CrORCA3, and  AaERF1 (De Geyter et al.,  2012), no probe was found among the 4,450 probes used for our integrative analysis. Other  ERF genes reported in the mentioned papers (VIT_16s0013g00950, VIT_16s0013g00980, VIT_16s0013g00990, VIT_16s0013g01030, VIT_16s0013g01050, VIT_16s0013g01060, not listed in Supplementary Table  S9) belonged to clusters 1, 2, 7 and did not show any relevant positive correlation with monoterpenes. However, some of the AROS probes had only a partial match with these genes, as a consequence they might correspond instead to  ERF gene isoforms not involved in flavor determination. Conversely, the genes VIT_16s0100g00400 and VIT_18s0001g05250 showed an expression profile consistent with the accumulation of monoterpenes in Moscato Bianco ripening berry (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). We also observed an interesting behavior (Figure  4, Table  2, and Supplementary Table  S9) for TFs of the MYB (VIT_14s0066g01090) and NAC (VIT_19s0014g03300) families that promote mono- and sequiterpene production in other plant species (Reeves et al.,  2012; Nieuwenhuizen et al.,  2015). In particular, VIT_14s0066g01090 ( MYB24) has been proposed as a candidate transcriptional regulator of (mono)terpene biosynthesis also in grapevine (Matus,  2016; Savoi et al.,  2016), for which reason it deserves further attention. Finally, based on the negative effect of GBF1 (G-box binding factor 1) and ZCT (zinc-finger  Catharanthus transcription factor) proteins on the expression of the TIA (terpenoid indole alkaloid) biosynthetic genes  Str (strictosidine synthase) and  Tdc (tryptophan decarboxylase) (Sibéril et al.,  2001; Pauw et al.,  2004), we selected two genes (VIT_15s0046g01440 and VIT_18s0001g09230) negatively correlated with monoterpene accumulation during Moscato Bianco berry ripening (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). One of the signals dramatically impacting isoprenoid biosynthesis in higher plants is light, which activates the MEP pathway at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (Rodríguez-Concepción,  2006; Cordoba et al.,  2009; Vranová et al.,  2012; Mannen et al.,  2014). Sunlight exclusion limits the synthesis and accumulation of terpenes also in grape berries (linalool and the bound forms being the most responsive) by especially affecting  DXS and  TPS genes (Zhang et al.,  2014; Friedel et al.,  2016; Joubert et al.,  2016; Matus,  2016; Sasaki et al.,  2016). Our findings (Figure  4, Table  2, and Supplementary Table  S9) are consistent with a role, among others, for  HY5 ( LONG HYPOCOTYL5, VIT_04s0008g05210) in the regulation of light-induced terpenoid biosynthesis in grapes, in agreement with other evidences (Carbonell-Bejerano et al.,  2014a, b; Zhou et al.,  2015; Loyola et al.,  2016). The isoprenoid pathway has also been reported to be under the circadian clock control. In particular, the emission of volatile terpenoids follows a diurnal rhythm and genes encoding enzymes involved in IPP biosynthesis (especially those from the MEP pathway) and downstream pathways are coexpressed with circadian clock genes and show typical circadian expression profiles (Cordoba et al.,  2009; Vranová et al.,  2012; Pokhilko et al.,  2015). Some probes on the AROS array correspond to a gene of the circadian oscillator (VIT_15s0048g02410) and fall into clusters harboring several monoterpenes (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). The expression profile of a number of additional transcription factors (including master regulators) and genes potentially involved in the post-transcriptional regulation (Hemmerlin,  2013) overlaps monoterpene accumulation during Moscato Bianco berry ripening, which supports a role in the control of monoterpene biosynthesis for VIT_01s0026g01970, VIT_02s0012g01040, VIT_02s0012g01240, VIT_02s0234g00100, VIT_03s0038g02500, VIT_04s0023g00130, VIT_04s0023g01250, VIT_04s0023g02950, VIT_06s0004g07550, VIT_07s0031g01320, VIT_07s0031g01930, VIT_07s0104g01050, VIT_08s0007g05880, VIT_09s0054g01780, VIT_10s0003g03190, VIT_12s0028g03860, VIT_00s0214g00090, VIT_00s0463g00020 (Figure  4, Table  2, Supplementary Table  S9). To our knowledge, these genes represent new regulatory candidates for the production of several (cluster 4) or specific metabolites, like linalool (cluster 9) and geraniol/nerol (cluster 6), as suggested by their co-localization with QTLs and their correlation with enzyme/transporter genes correlated to metabolites. Integration of transcriptomic and metabolic data over multiple seasons to verify a subset of candidate genes In order to confirm the above links between transcriptome and metabolome in aroma development, the 15 genes assessed by both microarray and real-time analyses were also tested for correlation with the metabolic profile over three seasons, which were considered as three biological replicates (Table  3 and Supplementary Figure  S1A). Significant correlations were found for all the genes except  VvDXR (confirming the results from 2006 data) and  VvHDR, which probably precedes monoterpene accumulation. Several compounds were affected, especially in their glycosidically bound form. Unsurprisingly, most of the metabolites with no correlation showed an inconsistent profile among seasons (e.g., free OxA and citronellol, bound α-terpineol) or a decreasing trend along berry ripening (e.g., free HO-diendiol I + HO-trienol and bound OxB). Though not ensuring a punctual conformity to the observations from a single year (Table  2), the findings from multiple seasons (Table  3) prove the general consistency of the outcomes of different techniques and years and argue for the reliability of the whole set of results based on the integration of 2006 transcriptomic and metabolic data.","Monoterpenes confer typical floral notes to ""Muscat"" grapevine varieties and, to a lesser extent, to other aromatic non-Muscat varieties. Previous studies have led to the identification and functional characterization of some enzymes and genes in this pathway. However, the underlying genetic map is still far from being complete. For example, the specific steps of monoterpene metabolism and its regulation are largely unknown. With the aim of identifying new candidates for the missing links, we applied an integrative functional genomics approach based on the targeted metabolic and genome-wide transcript profiling of Moscato Bianco ripening berries. In particular, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of free and bound terpenoid compounds was combined with microarray analysis in the skins of berries collected at five developmental stages from pre- veraison  to over-ripening. Differentially expressed metabolites and probes were identified in the pairwise comparison between time points by using the early stage as a reference. Metabolic and transcriptomic data were integrated through pairwise correlation and clustering approaches to discover genes linked with particular metabolites or groups of metabolites. These candidate transcripts were further checked for co-localization with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting aromatic compounds. Our findings provide insights into the biological networks of grapevine secondary metabolism, both at the catalytic and regulatory levels. Examples include a nudix hydrolase as component of a terpene synthase-independent pathway for monoterpene biosynthesis, genes potentially involved in monoterpene metabolism (cytochrome P450 hydroxylases, epoxide hydrolases, glucosyltransferases), transport (vesicle-associated proteins, ABCG transporters, glutathione S-transferases, amino acid permeases), and transcriptional control (transcription factors of the ERF, MYB and NAC families, intermediates in light- and circadian cycle-mediated regulation with supporting evidence from the literature and additional regulatory genes with a previously unreported association to monoterpene accumulation).","['Development', 'Grapevine', 'Integration', 'Candidate gene', 'Berry skin', 'Monoterpene', 'Muscat', 'Metabolic And Transcript Profiling']","['Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary Figure', 'VIT', 'Table', 'Supplementary', 'Figure', 'Moscato Bianco', 'linalool', 'genes', 'linalool oxide']","[Savoi, 3 C 6, α-terpineol, hydroxy-diendiol I, hydroxy-trienol, hydroxy-diendiol II, hydroxy-diendiol I, C 6, hydroxy-diendiol I, 7-hydroxy-geraniol, 7-hydroxy-citronellol, hydroxy-trienol, 3-oxo-α-ionol, D, Günata, Ebang-Oke, hydroxy-diendiol I, hydroxy-trienol, hydroxy-diendiol II, hydroxy-diendiol I, hydroxy-trienol, hydroxy-diendiol II, rose oxide I, rose oxide II, α-terpineol, hydroxy-diendiol I + hydroxy-trienol, Hochberg ( 1995), “, ”, geraniol/nerol, linalool-specific, linalool-specific, “, ”, obvioulsy, VIT_04s0008g04970, VIT_00s0218g00110, enzymes like DXR, Vranová, Hemmerlin, Rodríguez-Concepción, Mendoza-Poudereux et al., VIT_03s0063g02030, GPPS small, GPPS large subunit, AROS, GPPS large subunit genes, VIT_04s0023g01210, GPPS small, VIT_18s0001g04280, VIT_18s0001g04530, α-terpineol, VIT_10s0003g00880, hydrolase, cis-8-hydroxy-linalool, alcohol dehydrogenases, cytochrome P450, CYP, Boachon, CYP76, VTCdb database ( http://vtcdb.adelaide.edu.au/Home.aspx, CYP, Ginglinger et al.

48,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5514130\eupmc_result.json,PMC5514130,"Results and Discussion To identify the volatile/s mediating guava-repellent effect, we analysed which chemicals are emitted from intact guava leaves by headspace solid phase microextraction, which provides a more representative overview of the volatile profile emitted by living plants than traditional methods of solvent extraction or steam distillation 18. As the guava effect is present all year round 19 but plant emission profiles may vary depending on leaf developmental stage, environmental conditions and even the hour of the day 18, VOC analyses were performed under a range of conditions (Fig.  1). In all samples, sesquiterpenes were the predominant volatiles and ( E)-β-caryophyllene (from now on referred to as β-caryophyllene) was the major VOC, constituting between 20.61 ± 3.80% and 58.92 ± 7.44% of total VOCs. Coincidently, one of the most abundant VOCs present in guava oil extracts is also β-caryophyllene, independently of the cultivar and the location 6,   11–  17. On the other hand, citrus leaves release mainly (more than 80%) monoterpenes, while β-caryophyllene is barely emitted 20,   21 (Suppl. Fig.  1). Thus, its abundance and continuous emission from guava leaves and its absence in citrus leaf emission profiles suggest that β-caryophyllene may be responsible for the repellence of guava leaves to the psyllid. To test this,  D.  citri response to β-caryophyllene was evaluated in a 4-arm olfactometer (Fig.  2). Dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), which has been reported as a potent  D.  citri repellent 8,   19 was used as control. When tested with clean air, the psyllid responded equally to each of the four arms, indicating no positional bias in the bioassay (Suppl. Fig.  2). Overall, the mean percentage of psyllids that made a choice during the various olfactometer tests was 42.30 ± 1.79 (%, mean ± SE), ranging from 34.23 to 55.74%. This range matches with studies of others (24–68%), in which the response of  D.  citri was also evaluated in a 4-arm olfactometer 8.  Similarly to guava leaves, which had no repellent effect at low doses (when just a few leaves were assayed, i.e. below 2.5 g of fresh weight) 7, 0.01 to 0.10 μg of β-caryophyllene per μL of hexane did not elicit a response in the psyllid (Fig.  2). β-caryophyllene had a repellent effect from a dose of 1 μg/μL (Fig.  2), about 5-fold less than the minimum dose of DMDS required to repel the psyllid according to both our results (500 μg, Fig.  2) and those of other authors 8, who showed that 430 μg was the lowest dose of DMDS affecting attraction of  D.  citri to citrus volatiles. Our result fits well with the high response of psyllid olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) to β-caryophyllene, which could be detected by the psyllid at the lowest concentration among more than 100 volatiles tested 22. The repellent effect of β-caryophyllene was maintained at least up to a dose ten-time higher, but it was lost when 50 μg/μL (5 mg) of compound was evaluated. Also in a T-maze olfactometer, 5 mg of β-caryophyllene elicited no response in  D.  citri23. The loss of the repellent effect of both β-caryophyllene and DMDS at higher doses is not well understood and needs more investigation, but could perhaps be related to antennal receptor saturation or desensitization to odour, as has been proposed for the attraction response of  Drosophila larvae 24. Recently, it has also been proposed that high doses of the  D.  citri attractant methyl salicylate may disrupt their sensory capability 25. Modification of volatile blends by genetic engineering has been shown to modify the behaviour of insects in relation to plants. For example,  Arabidopsis plants engineered for producing (3 S)-( E)-nerolidol and ( E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene or a blend of sesquiterpenes, became attractive to carnivorous predatory mites 26 or to parasitic wasps 27, respectively, while linalool-producing  Arabidopsis plants became repellent to the aphid  Myzus persicae28. We wondered then if induced emission of β-caryophyllene could make the non-host plant  Arabidopsis thaliana repellent to  D.  citri. To that end we generated a β-caryophyllene synthase (At5g23960) overexpression line emitting much more β-caryophyllene (about three orders of magnitude higher) than Col-0 wild type (WT) plants 29 (Fig.  3a, Suppl. Fig.  3). We also used an At5g23960 knock out (KO) line, which does not produce β-caryophyllene 30. Response of  D.  citri to plants from all three lines (OE, KO and WT), which showed comparable numbers of open flowers, closed flowers and siliques (Table  S1), were tested in four-arm olfactometer assays. Psyllids exposed to the WT and KO line did not show any response, indicating that  Arabidopsis itself with or without β-caryophyllene had no repellent effect on  D.  citri (Fig.  3b). Conversely, when the OE line was assayed, psyllids spent significantly less time in the transgenic odour fields, thus confirming a repellent effect of β-caryophyllene on the insect. By comparing the mean time that psyllids spent in clear air fields when exposed to KO and OE lines, a repellence index of 24.68 ± 2.26% was obtained for OE. The WT line did not exhibit any repellent effect on the psyllids, despite the fact that their flowers emit a complex mixture of terpenes with β-caryophyllene as the dominant one 31. However, as other self-pollinating plants, the rate of VOC emission from  Arabidopsis Col-0 flowers is small 31 (Fig.  3a), so this result is not surprising as β-caryophyllene and guava leaves were not repellent at low doses 7 (Fig.  2). Interestingly, β-caryophyllene emission by the OE line in olfactometer assays was comparable to that of the standard compound when used at 1 μg/μl, 0.10 ± 0.01 and 0.16 ± 0.01 ng/ml, respectively.  In recent years, it has been shown that plant-produced VOCs play an essential ecological role mediating the interactions between plants and other organisms. For example, it is now well known that foliar VOCs are among the most important cues that facilitate insect herbivores to locate host plants at a distance 32. These olfactory cues are mediated mainly by the perception of specific blends or ratios of ubiquitous plant VOCs, rather than by specific compounds 32,   33. So much so that VOCs functioning as attractive signals in the context of the total host volatile blend can act as repellents when offered individually 34. Therefore, before developing a pest control strategy based on the use of a repellent VOC, it is important to check the effect of the compound in the aromatic context in which its use is desired. Thus, we also evaluated whether the repellent effect of β-caryophyllene was maintained in a psyllid-attractive citrus bouquet consisting of sweet orange flushes with small developing leaves which are preferred by  D.  citri for feeding and oviposition 35. As expected, when the citrus leaves were supplemented with the minimum repellent dose of β-caryophyllene (at 1 μg/μL) they became less attractive to the psyllids, with a repellence index of 22.34 ± 2.36% (data not shown), illustrating the potential use of β-caryophyllene to make citrus hosts less attractive to  D.  citri. Besides olfaction,  D.  citri also relies on visual cues for finding their host 36. Moreover, in olfactory tests to assess attractiveness, a strong response is only obtained when olfactory cues are presented together with visual stimuli 37. Consequently, β-caryophyllene influence on  D.  citri ability to find host plants was evaluated in behavioral assays with flushing sweet orange plants, combined with or without  Arabidopsis lines emitting (OE) or not (KO) β-caryophyllene (Fig.  4; Suppl. Fig.  4). In each treatment, the number of psyllids settled on sweet orange leaves was counted over a period of 48 h. More than half (59.17 ± 2.88%) and almost all (80.00 ± 3.26, 89.17 ± 2.29%) of the released insects were able to locate the sweet orange plant when presented alone at 8, and 24–48 h after their release, respectively. At all the times analysed, when sweet orange plants were caged with  Arabidopsis, the number of psyllids settled on the orange leaves diminished, between 1.37 and 3.50 fold, regardless of whether the  Arabidopsis line emitted β-caryophyllene or not, indicating that non-host plants presence interfered with the ability of  D.  citri for localising their host. These results coincided with that of non-choice studies in which it was shown that the presence of guava, but also cotton, reduced the speed at which psyllids find and settle on the citrus host 38. At all but one time of inspection, psyllids were found on non-host  Arabidopsis plants (Suppl. Fig.  5), up to about 8.33 ± 0.01% at 48 h. Settling on non-host, such as guava, cotton, tomato and azalea ( Rhododendron simsii) plants has also been reported before 38,   39. On the other hand, 24 h after release of the psyllids, differences in the number of insects settled on sweet orange plants started to become visible between OE and KO treatments (Fig.  4). In those cages in which OE was used, the number of insects settled on sweet orange was reduced by 19.40 and 15.21% in comparison with KO, at 24 and 48 h, respectively. It is also interesting to note that the number of psyllids that were not able to find the citrus host was slightly increased in those trials in which the  Arabidopsis β-caryophyllene overproducing line was used (Fig.  5). As these effects were attributable to the emission of β-caryophyllene by the OE line, it can be concluded that this compound actively interferes in the location of the host by the HLB vector. If compared to sweet orange plants presented alone, the reduction of  D.  citri settling on citrus leaves when the β-caryophyllene overproducing line was co-presented was 43.75 and 27.10% after 24 and 48 h, respectively (Fig.  4). These values are very close to the reductions in the number of psyllids found on citrus plants when grapefruit leaves were presented together with guava leaves as compared to just grapefruit leaves alone, about 50 and 30% after 1 and 2 days 38.  In conclusion, we have identified a volatile compound from guava, namely β-caryophyllene, which at certain doses exerts a repellent effect on  D.  citri (Fig.  2). Other guava volatiles may contribute to its repellence 8,   40. β-caryophyllene-induced repellence was evident in doses lower than that required for DMDS-induced repellence, and, in addition, the former does not present an unpleasant odour, so it could be used in the field through slow release chemical dispensers as was proposed for DMDS 8,   19. However, the volatility, instability and production costs of β-caryophyllene may be problematic for use in agriculture. This could be solved by expressing the genes for their biosynthesis in plants of interest. The success of this strategy has already been demonstrated in transgenic tobacco lines with increased emission of patchoulol, linalool and isoprene that became less attractive to herbivory/oviposition than their wild type counterparts 41–  43. Also, transgenic tobacco, corn and wheat plants capable of producing β-farnesene, the main component of the alarm pheromone for many aphids, were unattractive/repellent for these insects 44–  46. In this work, we have demonstrated that the emission of β-caryophyllene at levels above a certain concentration has the ability of turning a neutral non-host plant to  D.  citri into a repellent one (Fig.  3) and that the effect that this compound exerts on the psyllid is maintained even if presented in a background of citrus volatiles (Figs  4 and  5). Although the olfactometer tests with commercial β-caryophyllene indicate that the compound is repellent to the psyllid, the cage assays carried out in combinations of transgenic  Arabidopsis with sweet orange plants suggest that the emission of β-caryophyllene by the OE line confuses the insects that are therefore not able to detect the volatile mixture of their citrus host. Foreseeably, transgenic citrus plants overproducing β-caryophyllene would become less attractive or even repellent to the vector of HLB, thus limiting spreading the latter. These GM-citrus cultivars would themselves constitute a ‘push’ crop able to drive the psyllid out of the field, thereby avoiding the need of spending resources to manage a repellent intercrop. In the case of large monoculture fields, as those commonly found in Brazil and USA (2 nd and 3 rd world citrus producers), use of these transgenic citrus cultivars would change the habitat cues used by insects to detect the host over long distances 47. Moreover, the ‘push’ effect may be supplemented by the use, as cover crop, of other psyllid-repellent plants, as  Eupatorium catarium,  Lippia graveolens and  Allium spp. 48–  50. Alternatively, the cover crop may be a transgenic plant overproducing β-caryophyllene. It has been reported that the efficiency of push and pull behaviour controlling elements is often not only additive but synergistic 51, so the push strategy proposed here could be combined with a pull strategy to attract the psyllids. Orange jasmine ( Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack) is a  D.  citri preferred host and its potential use as a trap for  D.  citri has been already indicated 52. So, as  D.  citri populations are much more prevalent on crop borders 53, planting orange jasmine on the outer edges of the groves would prevent psyllid movement into the crop. Intensive insecticide treatments on orange jasmine trap could greatly reduce  D.  citri population, which would be concentrated in these plants, especially if combined with β-caryophyllene-emitting citrus cultivars as push. Furthermore, the use of GM non-attractant/repellent β-caryophyllene over-emitting citrus plants for psyllid control may reduce the amount of insecticide treatments currently used to mitigate HLB expansion, which incurs huge economic and environmental costs 54.","Production of citrus, the main fruit tree crop worldwide, is severely threatened by Huanglongbing (HLB), for which as yet a cure is not available. Spread of this bacterial disease in America and Asia is intimately connected with dispersal and feeding of the insect vector Diaphorina citri, oligophagous on rutaceous host plants. Effective control of this psyllid is an important component in successful HLB management programs. Volatiles released from the non-host guava have been shown to be repellent to the psyllid and to inhibit its response to citrus odour. By analysing VOC emission from guava we identified one volatile compound, (E)-β-caryophyllene, which at certain doses exerts a repellent effect on D. citri. Non-host plant rejection mediated by (E)-β-caryophyllene is demonstrated here by using Arabidopsis over-expression and knock-out lines. For the first time, results indicate that genetically engineered Arabidopsis plants with modified emission of VOCs can alter the behaviour of D. citri. This study shows that transgenic plants with an inherent ability to release (E)-β-caryophyllene can potentially be used in new protection strategies of citrus trees against HLB.",NaN,"['Fig.', 'β-caryophyllene', 'Suppl.

The results for  M. persicae and  A. gossypii were totally different:  M. persicae could not go down beyond the third generation (F 3) (only a few sterile offspring was seen), while  A. gossypii went down to F 23 at this point. Our experiments showed that the developmental duration of the first-instar  M. persicae nymphs of the first generation (F 1) reared on artificial diet was significantly longer than that of  M. persicae reared on pepper plants ( P < 0.01), while the developmental durations of the diet-reared second-, third- and fourth-instar nymphs were not significantly different from those of pepper-reared ones ( P = 0.198, 0.581 and 0.771, respectively) (Table  1). The development of diet-reared  M. persicae adults was obviously delayed compared with that of pepper-reared counterparts ( P < 0.01). As a whole, the diet-reared  M. persicae aphids lived highly significantly longer than pepper-reared ones ( P < 0.01), and their fecundity was also extremely significantly decreased compared to that of pepper-reared  M. persicae aphids ( P < 0.01).  Unlike  M. persicae,  A. gossypii reared on artificial diets exhibited no significant difference from cotton-reared aphids in the developmental duration over different developmental stages from the fifth generation on (N 1,  P = 0.453; N 2,  P = 0.285; N 3,  P = 0.127; N 4,  P = 0.139; adult,  P = 0.761) (Table  2; data for F 17), although the fecundity of diet-reared  A. gossypii was significantly decreased compared with cotton-reared aphids ( P < 0.01). Considering that  A. gossypii lived much better on the artificial diets than  M. persicae,  A. gossypii aphids (F 17) and their offspring reared on artificial diets, antibiotic-treated diets and plants were sampled for volatile analysis to examine the effects of host plants and endosymbionts on the biosynthesis of EβF in the present study.  Elimination of  Buchnera and its effects on aphid development and fecundity The elimination efficiency of antibiotic treatment against  Buchnera bacteria was not only dependant on the antibiotic treatment time but also the rearing time on normal diets after antibiotic treatment. As shown (Figs  1 and Supplementary Figure  S1),  Buchnera bacteria in  M. persicae could be effectively eliminated by reared on normal diets for 10 days in addition to treatment with tetracycline or rifampicin for 12–14 days. Rearing aphids on normal diets for 5 days after antibiotic treatment for 12–14 days could not successfully eliminate  Buchnera from its host. For molecular detection of  Buchnera in A. gossypii, we also cloned and sequenced its  ispA gene (GenBank acc.no. KX999117), which was 847 bp in length and encoded a protein of 282 amino acids. Specific primers (C- ispA-F/R) designed based on this sequence was used to detect the existence of  Buchnera in  A. gossypii, and the results showed that the same antibiotic treatment protocol could also effectively eliminate  Buchnera bacteria from  A. gossypii. Meanwhile, the effects of antibiotic treatment on the development and fecundity were also observed, which indicated that antibiotic diets could fully erase the reproductive ability of both  M. persicae and  A. gossypii, whereas its effect on the longevity of  M. persicae was not significant ( P = 0.621), but significant on that of  A. gossypii compared with antibiotic-free diet ( P = 0.03) (Tables  1 and  2).  Analysis of volatile releases from aphids by SPME and GC-MS The volatiles from diet-reared, antibiotic-treated and cotton-reared  A. gossypii were analyzed by SPME and GC-MS. The standard solution was a mixture including ( E)-β-farnesene (EβF) and its isomeride α-farnesene (Supplementary Figure  S2A). The retention time for EβF was 10.94, with a molecular weight of 204 (Supplementary Figure  S2B), and the retention time for α-farnesene was 10.72. The volatiles from  A.gossypii reared on cotton plants contained EβF (Fig.  2A), and the aphids reared on artificial diets (F 17) could also release EβF (Fig.  2B). The aphids treated with antibiotics for 14 days and then reared on antibiotic-free diets for 10 or 22 additional days could still release EβF (Fig.  2C,D). In addition, we could also detect volatile releases from both cotton-reared and diet-reared single aphids of  A. gossypii, though the amounts of EβF were very small (Fig.  2E,F).  Quantitative analysis of cornicle secretions The proportion of aphids emitting cornicle droplets was significantly lower when reared with artificial diet and under antibiotic treatment than that when reared on cotton plants ( P < 0.001), but the proportion had no significant difference between the aphids treated with and without antibiotics ( P = 0.123) (Table  3). The mean weight of antibiotic-treated individual aphid was reduced by 50% compared with untreated aphids ( P < 0.01), but there was no difference between cotton plant-reared and normal diet-reared aphids ( P = 0.231). The EβF concentration of diet-reared aphid, measured as per milligram of aphid (ng), was not significantly different from those of the plant-reared ( P = 0.407) and antibiotic-treated aphids ( P = 0.024), though the mean amount of EβF per mg of antibiotic-treated aphid was reduced by approximately 12 ng compared with that of plant-reared aphids ( P = 0.006) (Fig.  3A). In addition, the amount of EβF per antibiotic-treated aphid (ng) was significantly less than those of plant-reared ( P < 0.01) and diet-reared aphid ( P < 0.01) (Fig.  3B), reduced by approximately 50%, but there was no significant difference between plant-reared and normal diet-reared aphids ( P = 0.380). ","(E)-β-farnesene (EβF) is the major component of the alarm pheromone of many aphid species, but where EβF is synthesized in aphids is only partly understood. There are at least three most possible sources for the alarm pheromone: host plants, aphid obligate endosymbiont and aphids themselves. Here we eliminated the possibility of host plants and the obligate endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola as the sources for EβF released by aphids. We excluded the possible effects of host plants on EβF biosynthesis by rearing aphids on non-plant diets. Both the diet-reared aphids, including the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii and the green peach aphid Myzus persicae, could still release EβF based on solid-phase micro-extraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometer analysis. Meanwhile, we treated host aphids with antibiotics to fully eliminate Buchnera bacteria. Though the treatment seriously affected the development and fecundity of host aphids, the treated aphids could still release EβF, and there was no significant difference in the EβF concentration as per the aphid weight under different rearing conditions. Taken together, our experimental results suggest that host plants and obligate endosymbionts are not the sources for EβF released by aphids, indicating that it is most probably the aphid itself synthesizes the alarm pheromone.",NaN,"['persicae', 'aphids', 'gossypii', 'diets', 'artificial diets', 'Buchnera', 'reared', 'antibiotic treatment', 'Fig.', 'diet-reared']","[pepper-reared, pepper-reared, pepper-reared, pepper-reared  M. persicae aphids, cotton-reared, cotton-reared aphids, EβF, 12–14, 12–14, cotton-reared  A., EβF, EβF, EβF, EβF, EβF, cotton-reared, EβF, EβF, EβF, EβF]",[],[],[],NaN

From a total of 20,755 unique transcripts from the merged assembly, 92.22% transcripts were annotated while 954 transcripts (4.59%) encoded hypothetical proteins and 661 (3.17%) remained unidentified. BLASTx statistics revealed maximum hits from  Citrus sinensis and  C. clementina followed by  Theobroma cacao, Jatropha curcas, Vitis venifera and  Ricinus communis (Fig.  1a). Total 74,330 GO terms related to various biological processes (BP), molecular functions (MF) and cellular components (CC) were assigned to these 20,755 unique transcripts. Metabolic, cellular and single organism processes followed by biological regulation and localization were the most abundant terms under the BP category; binding and catalytic activity related terms under MF category; while, organelle, membrane and macromolecular complex terms under the CC category, respectively (Fig.  1b, Supplementary Figure  SF1).  Unique transcripts were assigned enzyme commission (EC) number to determine the involvement of these transcripts in various BPs. Total 4,611 ECs were assigned from oxidoreductase, transferase, hydrolase, ligase, lyase and isomerase classes; wherein, transferases were the most abundant followed by hydrolases in all the eight tissues (Fig.  1c). These assigned ECs represented 142 known pathways from the KEGG database ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) 31–  33, which are potentially functional in Alphonso mango fruit development and ripening. Most of these pathways were saturated with higher number of annotations from transcriptome data e.g. metabolism of starch, sucrose and various amino acids including methionine and biosynthesis pathway of ethylene, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids (Supplementary Figure  SF2). Transcriptome changes through flower to fruit and fruit development to ripening Variations in the transcriptome were studied using several parameters, such as differentially expressed transcripts, transcripts distinctive to a stage and gene ontology enrichment during flower to fruit transition and through process of fruit development and ripening. Differentially expressed transcripts Comparison between adjacent tissue stages was carried out to identify differentially expressed transcripts at each stage of fruit development and ripening (Table  3, Supplementary Table  ST1). Flower to fruit of 30DAP, 524 transcripts were down regulated while 181 were up-regulated. Among the down-regulated transcripts alpha-amylase and subtilisin inhibitor-like (contig_6593), carbonic anhydrase (contig_5377), chitinase (contig_4907) and maternal effect embryo arrest 59 (contig_4949) exhibited the highest fold change (>2-fold); while homeodomain-like protein (contig_12912 and 12913), cytochrome p450 - cyp72a219-like (contig_4083), heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein (contig_5948) and inositol-3-phosphate synthase (contig_9620) were highly up-regulated (>2-fold).  Transition from 30 DAP to 60 DAP resulted in up-regulation of 73 and down-regulation of seven transcripts. Important down-regulated transcripts were, n-acetyltransferase (contig_1261), 9- cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (contig_1680), protein reversion-to-ethylene sensitivity (contig_9164) and ethylene receptor 2 (contig_6147). While important up-regulated transcripts were nucleotide sugar transporter family protein (contig_6337), beta-xylosyltransferase (contig_4150), various cellulose synthase catalytic subunits and laccases. Comparison of 60 DAP fruit tissue with 90 DAP pulp and skin tissue, respectively revealed down-regulation of beta-xylosyltransferase, beta-d-xylosidase, cellulose synthase and galacturonosyl transferase; whereas spx and exs domain-containing protein was up-regulated in both 90 DAP pulp and skin. Up-regulation of homeobox protein sbh1, gdsl esterase lipase, caffeoyl shikimate esterase, hydroperoxide lyase, udp-rhamnose:rhamnosyl transferase and pectinesterase inhibitor was evinced from 90 DAP pulp tissue compared to that in 60 DAP fruit tissue. Evaluation of differentially expressed transcripts between pulp and skin of 90 DAP revealed very few transcripts down-regulated in skin with none of them showing change more than 2-fold, while 54 transcripts were up-regulated in 90 DAP skin tissue including the important ones as DNA mismatch repair protein msh5, acyl carrier protein, amino-acid permease, calcium-transporting ATPase, isoflavone reductase and various disease resistance proteins. During ripening of Alphonso pulp from 90 DAP to 5 DAH, 42 transcripts were up-regulated (>2-fold) including methyltransferase, amino-acid permease, chloroplastic 9- cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, beta-galactosidase and protein phosphatase mainly, whereas 52 transcripts were down-regulated, important ones being few disease resistance proteins, peroxidase, sucrose synthase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The highest level of differential expression was evinced through transition from 5 DAH to 10 DAH among all the ripening tissues wherein 418 transcripts were down and 191 were up-regulated. These stages are known for non-climacteric to climacteric transition during Alphonso fruit ripening based on metabolite analysis 17,   34. Prominently down regulated transcripts were phospholipase-A LCAT3, sugar phosphate exchanger, auxin-responsive protein IAA9, abscisate β-glucosyltransferase and membrane-associated kinase regulator with more than 3-fold change, while up-regulated transcripts were aspartic proteinase nepenthesin, UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, peroxidase, bidirectional sugar transporter sweet1-like, omega-6 fatty acid desaturase and squalene monooxygenase. During the transition from 10 DAH to 15 DAH stage, increased phosphate metabolism was evident. Total 30 transcripts were up-regulated mainly including phospholipase-D, inorganic pyrophosphatase, phosphate transporter, transcription factor glk2 and DNA translocase, whereas 12 transcripts were down-regulated and important ones were aspartic protease, plastocyanin-like domain protein, annexin d2-like and glucuronosyltransferase (>2-fold). Idiosyncratic transcripts for the stage Various transcripts unique to each of these stages (Fig.  2, Table  4, Supplementary Table  ST2) representing multiple stage specific processes were identified during this comparative analysis. A total of 388 transcripts were identified as unique to flower tissue, which mostly included various transcription and translation factors, late embryogenesis abundant proteins, stress-sensitive and dehydration-responsive element-binding protein-1b and various ribosomal proteins.  Similarly, distinct transcripts specific to fruit developing and ripening stages were identified, wherein 1,090 and 27 transcripts were idiosyncratic to the fruit developing and ripening stages, respectively (Supplementary Table  ST2). Various auxin and gibberellin induced and regulated proteins as well as several proteins responsible for various vacuole activities, multiple disease resistance proteins and various terpene synthases were distinct to the developing stages. Transcripts encoding for multiple transcription and translation factors during Alphonso fruit development were also detected. Interestingly multiple ethylene responsive transcription factors along with the protein reversion-to-ethylene sensitivity were uniquely revealed in the developing stages. Whereas, NIN-like protein, respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein d-like, rhamnogalacturonate lyase b-like, lectin receptor kinase, gag protein and methionine Υ-lyase were exclusive to the Alphonso ripening stages. Similarly, WRKY transcription factor 43, b3 domain-containing val3 and ap2 ERF domain-containing transcription factors were uniquely identified from the ripening stages. Several hypothetical and uncharacterized proteins were also found to be Alphonso ripening specific and their characterization might help to reveal the ripening process in Alphonso. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment Fisher’s exact test was performed to understand over- and down-represented GOs (p-value ≤ 0.001) during the transition, which gave an overall picture of the Alphonso mango development and ripening (Fig.  3). During the flower to 30 DAP fruit transition certain GOs were over-expressed such as post-embryonic developmental and anatomical structure morphogenesis process, response to abiotic stimulus and various plastid and thylakoid processes. At the same time, hydrolysis of  O-glycosyl compounds and UDP-glycosyltransferase activity along with the methyltransferase, sucrose metabolic and lipid biosynthetic activities coding GOs were down-represented. 30 DAP to 60 DAP transition described enriched GOs for starch and sucrose metabolic process, fatty acid, cellulose and vitamin biosynthetic processes, protein glycosylation, response to oxidative stress and heat along with HSP binding. During the same event cell differentiation, growth and cell death in addition to the anatomical structure morphogenesis, secondary metabolic process and response to biotic stimulus coding GOs were observed to be decreased. Comparison between 60 DAP fruit and 90 DAP pulp revealed over-represented GOs for cell differentiation and cell growth, response to biotic stimulus, secondary metabolic process, tropism and regulation of gene expression. While, starch and sucrose metabolic processes,  O-glycosyl hydrolase UDP-glucosyltransferase activities, fatty acid biosynthesis and catabolic processes along with the lipid transport, various amino acid and terpenoid biosynthesis and cell wall biogenesis were down-represented. 90 DAP pulp and skin tissues showed over-expression of various ion, ADP and sequence-specific DNA binding activities along with the response to hormone, chemical and organic substances in the skin tissue; whereas only cytoplasm and cytoplasmic part related GOs were found to be down-expressed in the skin compared to that in the pulp at 90 DAP.  Transition of 90 DAP pulp to 5 DAH pulp revealed only over-representation of GOs such as biosynthesis of RNA, aromatic compounds, and nucleobase containing compounds; binding of various ions; regulation of primary, cellular, nitrogenous compounds, RNA biosynthesis processes and gene expression and response to hormone, chemical and organic substance. Surprisingly, none of the GOs showed significant (P-value ≤ 0.001) enrichment during the transition from 5 DAH to 10 DAH and reflected as the stationary phase of Alphonso mango ripening. The 10 DAH (mid ripe stage) to 15 DAH (ripe stage) transition showed over-expression of many GOs such as binding of various ions; phospholipid, glycolipid, amino acid, co-enzyme and water soluble vitamin biosynthetic processes; methyltransferase, UDP-glycosyltransferase and  O-glycosyl hydrolase activities; starch, sucrose metabolic processes, gluconeogenesis and glycolytic process; protein phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, folding, protein modification and small protein conjugation along with the regulation and response to oxidative stress, oxidoreductase activity and redox homeostasis. While the GOs related to plastid and cytosol; post embryonic development; response to abiotic and endogenous stimulus; anatomical structure morphogenesis, plasma membrane, cell differentiation and communication were down-represented. Spatial changes in transcriptome at 90 DAP In case of Alphonso mango, 90 DAP stage is a mature raw stage of the fruit and is considered as the right stage of fruit harvest (0 DAH) for further artificial ripening of the fruit 35. Hence transcriptome analysis of skin and pulp were separately carried out at this stage. Overall 90 DAP skin was found to be metabolically more active compared to the 90 DAP pulp with respect to differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table  ST1), unique genes (Supplementary Table  ST2) and enriched GOs (Fig.  3). In the skin, 54 transcripts were up-regulated whereas only four were down-regulated compared to the pulp. Among the up-regulated transcripts (>2-fold), isoflavone reductase, transcription and translation regulatory proteins, hydrolases, methyltransferase etc. were more prominent; whereas four down-regulated transcripts were membrane and cytoplasm related GOs. Unique transcripts upon comparison between 90 DAP pulp and skin showed carotene and xanthophylls biosynthesis related contigs, beta-carotene hydroxylase (contig_5406) and anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase, flavor related various terpene synthases and ripening related contigs such as ethylene-responsive transcription factors, pectate lyase, pectin esterase and cellulase as unique to skin compared to the pulp. Interestingly, in comparison of 5DAH stage with 90 DAP pulp few of these transcripts such as isoflavone reductase (contig_5337) and beta-carotene hydroxylase (contig_5406) were observed to be idiosyncratic to 5 DAH stage as seen in 90 DAP skin stage. Similarly, transcripts encoding enzymes involved in pectin degradation (contigs_9578, 9579, 18096 and 3603) were found to be upregulated (>2-fold) in the comparison between 10DAH vs 90 DAP pulp and 15 DAH vs 90 DAP pulp. These finding suggest progression of ripening related molecular processes in the pulp of 5 DAH and onward stages which were initiated at 90 DAP skin and highlight initiation of Alphonso ripening process from skin and its probable progress towards fruit stone. Genes involved in the flavor biogenesis in Alphonso mango Quantitatively mono-terpenes are abundant in Alphonso followed by sesqui-terpenes 2,   35. The present data revealed six contigs encoding mono-terpene synthases ( limonene synthase1, limonene synthase2, beta ocimine synthase1, beta ocimine synthase2,  isoprene synthase1 and  isoprene synthase2), five contigs encoding sesquiterpene synthases ( germacreneD synthase1, germacreneD synthase2, nerolidol synthase1, nerolidol synthase2 and  alpha farnesene synthase) and three contigs coding for di-terpene synthases ( ent-kaurene synthase and  casbene synthase (E,E)-geranillinalool synthase). Phylogenetic analysis (Fig.  4) of these genes along with other plant terpene synthases (TPS) showed distribution of these genes in to the TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-e and TPS-f clades, respectively 36.  Furaneol and mesifuran are the two furanones from Alphonso mango and their synthesis by  enone oxidoreductase ( EO) and  O-methyltransferase ( OMTS), respectively have been described earlier 10,   11. Multiple contigs coding for  quinone oxidoreductase and  O-methyltransferases were detected in the present analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of these contigs with the characterized genes revealed another similar transcript variant for the  MiEO (Supplementary Figure  SF3), whereas none of the contigs showed similarity to the  MiOMTS (Supplementary Figure  SF4). Green grassy aroma of unripe fruits is due to the C6 volatiles formed during the lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) pathways. In the present study a single contig encoding the  hydroperoxide lyase and six contigs encoding  13-lipoxygenase were detected. Involvement of  9-lipoxygenase ( Mi9LOX) and epoxide  hydrolase 2 ( MiEH2) in the biogenesis of lactones from Alphonso mango was confirmed in our recent study 15. One more transcript encoding  9-lipoxygenase similar to that of the characterized  Mi9LOX (Supplementary Figure  SF5) and three contigs coding for  epoxide hydrolase 2 grouping with the  MiEH2 (Supplementary Figure  SF6) were additionally detected in the present study. Three more novel contigs coding for  epoxide hydrolase were also detected but neither grouped with the other  EH1or  EH2 from different plant species (Supplementary Figure  SF6). We further analyzed the differential expression of all these flavor related genes in terms of transcript abundance in flower and fruit developing and ripening stages (Supplementary Figure  SF7). Among these the contigs encoding various TPS were abundant in flower and during early developing stages. Interestingly, many contigs encoding EH (contigs 8280, 3904, 3901, 14123 and 8281), LOX (contigs 18105, 12748, 12747 and 12385) and EO (contigs 8026, 5618, 15594, 14137 and 13600) were found to be ripening specific and might be playing crucial role in generating unique aroma volatiles during Alphonso fruit ripening. Glycosidases and cell wall degrading enzymes from Alphonso mango Glycosidases are involved in a variety of functions such as hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates (storage and structural) to mono-saccharides, removal of sugars from various glycans including glycosidically bound aroma volatiles, which serve as storage pool for the aroma compounds. In the present study, many glycosidases acting on various sugars i.e. glucose, galactose, mannose, fructose, xylose, fucose and rhamnose, were detected. Among these, class glucosidase with the highest number of contigs (51 contigs) was observed to contain 28 and 21contigs coding for glucan β-glucosidase and general β-glucosidase, respectively. Two contigs coding for α-glucosidases were identified of which one coded for glucan α-glucosidase and the other for general α-glucosidase. Among these, at 30 DAP stage contig_7442 and contig_7857 were found to be down-regulated (>3-fold) compared to those in flower stage. Contig_16888 was down-regulated whereas contig_17138 was up-regulated at 10 DAH than those at 5 DAH. At 15 DAH contig_9072 was down-regulated (1.5-fold) compared to that at 10 DAH. Among the galactosidase class, nine contigs encoding α-galactosidase and 21 contigs encoding β-galactosidase were detected. Two of these were down-regulated (contig_1095 and contig_1096) at 30 DAP compared to those in flower. Contig_3844 was down regulated in 90 DAP pulp compared to 60 DAP. Transition from 90 DAP to 5 DAH reflected in to up-regulation of contig_3844 (2.72-fold) whereas, contig_1525 coding for α-galactosidase was down-regulated in 10 DAH compared to that at 5 DAH. In the mannosidase class, five α-mannosidase and eight endo-β-mannosidase coding contigs were identified out of which two encoding for endo-beta-mannosidase (contig_15554 and contig_15558) were down-regulated at 10 DAH compared to 5 DAH, rest didn’t show differential regulation. Among two α-xylosidase and five β-xylosidase from Alphonso mango only contig_1633 showed differential regulation which was up-regulated at 60 DAP compared to 30 DAP and was further down-regulated in both the 90 DAP tissues. Two transcripts coding for the acid beta-fructofuranosidase (contig_12501 and contig_12502) were detected but did not show any differential regulation in various tissues analyzed. Also, seven contigs coding for the alpha-l-fucosidase were identified from Alphonso mango but did not show differential regulation. Degradation of plant cell wall components, namely cellulose, hemi-cellulose and pectin by cellulases and glucanases in ripening fruits is responsible for the fruit softness. Cellulases encoding five contigs were identified among which one coded for acidic cellulase and found to be abundant during flower and early fruit developing stages. Total 18 contigs encoding glucanase were detected of which contig_4148 was up-regulated in flower compared to 30 DAP, whereas, four transcripts (contig_9268, contig_19283, contig_9267 and contig_17145) were down-regulated (>2-fold) at 10 DAH compared to 5 DAH stage. Pectin is another component of fruit cell wall and is degraded by a set of enzymes  viz. pectate lyase (PL), pectin esterase (PE), polygalacturonase (PG) and rhamnogalacturonate lyase. In the present study 18 PL, 24 PG and 10 PE coding transcripts were detected. However, only few were differentially expressed, for example, only PL contig_7696 was down-regulated in 30 DAP fruit compared to flower and PL contig_9578 was up-regulated in 10 DAH fruit than 5 DAH fruit. PG non-catalytic subunit jp650 coding contig_9895 was down-regulated in 5 DAH pulp than in 90 DAP pulp, whereas PG contig_3471 was down regulated and PG contig_1614 was up-regulated in 10 DAH compared to 5 DAH stage. Likewise, PE contig_7997 was down-regulated and contig_9162 was up-regulated at 30 DAP stage compared to flower. Similarly, eight transcripts encoding rhamnogalacturonate lyase were detected of which two (contig_7745 and contig_7746) were distinct to the ripening stages (Supplementary Table  ST2). Transcriptome analysis identified novel enzyme inhibitors from Alphonso mango We identified various classes of enzyme inhibitors (Supplementary Table  ST3) such as α- amylase inhibitor (2 contigs), inhibitor of proliferation pds5, apoptosis inhibitor (2 contigs), bax inhibitor (4 contigs), lipid transfer protein inhibitor (6 contigs), various kinase inhibitors (16 contigs), cysteine proteinases inhibitor (4 contigs), inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (3 contigs), serine protease inhibitor, kunitz family trypsin and protease inhibitor, guanosine nucleotide diphosphate dissociation inhibitor, nf-kappa-b inhibitor (2 contigs), pectinesterase inhibitor (12 contigs), polygalacturonase inhibitor, proteasome inhibitor, protein transport inhibitor (4 contigs), protein phosphatase inhibitor and rho gdp-dissociation protein inhibitor (4 contigs). Along with these, contigs coding for protein reversion-to-ethylene sensitivity (3 contigs), cell wall and vascular inhibitor of beta-fructosidase (2 contigs) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor were also identified from Alphonso transcriptome. These inhibitors showed differential regulation during fruit development and ripening (Supplementary Figure  SF8). Most of the inhibitors were found to be expressing throughout all the stages except for the group 4 (coding for bax inhibitor), which were abundant only during fruit ripening stages of Alphonso mango and probably played important role in ripening physiology of Alphonso mango. Transcriptome validation through qRT PCR Results of the transcriptomic analysis were validated by qRT PCR of 38 representative genes from various metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate metabolism (cellulose synthase: CS, chitinase: CTN, and pectate lyase: PL), fatty acid metabolism (omega 3 fatty acyl desaturase: O3FAD, omega 6 fatty acyl desaturase: O6FAD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate acyl transferase: G3PAT, alcohol dehydrogenase: ADH and long chain fatty acyl CoA ligase: LCFACL), terpene metabolism (mono-terpene synthases: MTPS, sesqui-terpene synthases: STPS and di-terpene synthases: DTPS) and proteins such as ethylene responsive factors: ERF and disease resistance proteins: DRP. Various transcript variants of these genes were selected wherever available to confirm the accuracy of assembly. qRT PCR analysis revealed similar differential expression pattern for almost all the transcripts through all the eight stages with correlation coefficient  R ranging between 0.8 and 0.99. Few transcripts showed variation in the fold change of RNAseq and qRT PCR data at few stages but still had good correlation ( R ≥ 0.7) (Figs  5– 9 and Supplementary Table  ST5). Transcript variants confirmed the accurate assembly and showed differential expression of these variants from each other through various tissues analyzed (Figs  5– 9). ","Alphonso is known as the ""King of mangos"" due to its unique flavor, attractive color, low fiber pulp and long shelf life. We analyzed the transcriptome of Alphonso mango through Illumina sequencing from seven stages of fruit development and ripening as well as flower. Total transcriptome data from these stages ranged between 65 and 143 Mb. Importantly, 20,755 unique transcripts were annotated and 4,611 were assigned enzyme commission numbers, which encoded 142 biological pathways. These included ethylene and flavor related secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, as well as those involved in metabolism of starch, sucrose, amino acids and fatty acids. Differential regulation (p-value ≤ 0.05) of thousands of transcripts was evident in various stages of fruit development and ripening. Novel transcripts for biosynthesis of mono-terpenes, sesqui-terpenes, di-terpenes, lactones and furanones involved in flavor formation were identified. Large number of transcripts encoding cell wall modifying enzymes was found to be steady in their expression, while few were differentially regulated through these stages. Novel 79 transcripts of inhibitors of cell wall modifying enzymes were simultaneously detected throughout Alphonso fruit development and ripening, suggesting controlled activity of these enzymes involved in fruit softening.",NaN,"['DAP', 'DAP pulp', 'Alphonso mango', 'DAH', 'contig', 'transcripts', 'Supplementary Table', 'contigs', 'Alphonso', 'Supplementary Figure']","[76,043, 74,330, macromolecular complex, BPs, oxidoreductase, hydrolase, isomerase, hydrolases, 30DAP, alpha-amylase, subtilisin inhibitor-like, contig_6593, carbonic anhydrase, contig_5377, chitinase (, contig_4907, contig_4949, homeodomain-like protein, cytochrome p450, contig_4083, heat shock cognate 70 , contig_5948, inositol-3-phosphate synthase, n-acetyltransferase, contig_1261, cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, protein reversion-to-ethylene, contig_9164, ethylene receptor 2, contig_6147, contig_6337, beta-xylosyltransferase (, contig_4150, cellulose synthase, subunits, laccases, beta-xylosyltransferase, beta-d-xylosidase, cellulose synthase, galacturonosyl transferase, homeobox, sbh1, gdsl esterase lipase, udp-rhamnose:rhamnosyl transferase, pectinesterase inhibitor, calcium-transporting ATPase, isoflavone reductase, methyltransferase, beta-galactosidase, protein phosphatase, peroxidase, sucrose synthase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Prominently, phospholipase-A LCAT3, IAA9, abscisate β-glucosyltransferase, membrane-associated kinase, aspartic proteinase nepenthesin, UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, peroxidase, sugar transporter sweet1-like, phospholipase-D, phosphate transporter, glk2, annexin d2-like, glucuronosyltransferase (, protein-1b, ribosomal, auxin, NIN-like, rhamnogalacturonate lyase, lectin receptor kinase, gag, methionine Υ-lyase, b3 domain-containing val3, ap2 ERF domain-containing, down-represented GOs, UDP-glycosyltransferase, HSP, GOs, glycolipid, UDP-glycosyltransferase, hydrolase, oxidoreductase, isoflavone reductase, hydrolases, methyltransferase, beta-carotene hydroxylase, contig_5406, anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase, pectate lyase, pectin esterase, cellulase, isoflavone reductase, contig_5337, beta-carotene hydroxylase, contig_5406, pectin, contigs_9578, 10DAH, sesqui-terpenes 2, synthase1, synthase2, beta ocimine synthase1, beta ocimine synthase2, synthase1, synthase2, germacreneD synthase1, germacreneD synthase2, alpha farnesene synthase, ent-kaurene synthase, E)-geranillinalool synthase, TPS-b, TPS-e, oxidoreductase (, oxidoreductase, lipoxygenase, hydroperoxide lyase, Mi9LOX, epoxide  hydrolase 2, MiEH2, epoxide hydrolase 2, hydrolase, EH, LOX, class glucosidase, 21contigs, glucan β-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, α-glucosidases, glucan α-glucosidase, α-glucosidase, contig_7442, contig_7857, contig_17138, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, contig_1095, contig_1096, Contig_3844, contig_3844, α-galactosidase, mannosidase, α-mannosidase, endo-β-mannosidase, endo-beta-mannosidase (, contig_15554, contig_15558, n’t, α-xylosidase, β-xylosidase, contig_1633, beta-fructofuranosidase, contig_12501, contig_12502, alpha-l-fucosidase, pectin, cellulases, glucanases, cellulase, glucanase, contig_4148, contig_9268, contig_19283, contig_9267, contig_17145, Pectin, PL, pectin esterase, PE, polygalacturonase (, rhamnogalacturonate lyase, PL, PE, PL contig_7696, PL contig_9578, contig_9895, PG contig_3471, PG contig_1614, PE contig_7997, contig_9162, rhamnogalacturonate lyase, contig_7745, contig_7746, α- amylase, bax, cysteine proteinases, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (3, serine protease, protease inhibitor, nf-kappa-b inhibitor (2, pectinesterase inhibitor (12 contigs, polygalacturonase, rho gdp-dissociation, vascular inhibitor of, beta-fructosidase (2, bax, chitinase, pectate lyase, PL, O3FAD, O6FAD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate acyl, alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH, RNAseq]","['(TPS)', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-e', 'TPS-f', 'TPS', 'MTPS,', 'STPS', 'DTPS)']",['C.'],['Citrus'],terpene synthase

Of those, 148 volatiles were detected including one acid, 12 alcohols, 20 aldehydes, 14 esters, one furan, three aromatic hydrocarbons, 16 ketones, one phenol, 27 sesquiterpenes, 15 monoterpenes, and 38 unknown volatiles (Table  1, Additional files  1 and  2). Compared to ‘Murcott’, ‘Fortune’ produced a similar number of volatiles, but with lower concentration. The total relative content of volatiles in ‘Murcott’ was about 13 times as much as in ‘Fortune’ for both harvests in 2013, which was partly due to limonene. The ‘Murcott’ fruits contained about 20 times the amount limonene of ‘Fortune’. The most abundant volatiles identified in ‘Fortune’ included limonene (77.77%), valencene (2.63%), ethyl acetate (2.01%) and myrcene (1.53%); while ‘Murcott’ contained limonene (79.14%), hexanal (6.59%), myrcene (1.91%), heptanal (1.25%), and geranyl acetone (1.25%) in H1–13.  The average number of volatiles detected in F 1 hybrids was 63.7, and ranged from 28 to 111 (Table  1). The average relative content of volatiles detected in F 1 hybrids was 14.4, and ranged from 0.24 to 133.24. Three volatiles were present in all F 1 hybrids, including linalool, myrcene and limonene; and another 18 volatiles were detected in 90–99% of all F 1 hybrids (Additional file  1). On the other hand, 19 compounds were detected in less than 10% of all hybrids. Among the 148 detected volatiles, 64 volatile compounds were detected specifically in F 1 hybrids but were not present in either of the parents. The total content of volatiles and number of volatiles in F 1 progeny showed continual variation, although some of their distributions were generally skewed and/or significantly deviated from normality ( p = 0.05) based on the Shapiro-Wilk test [ 26] (Fig.  1, Additional file  3). For instance, the total content displayed a distribution significantly deviated from normality in H1–12, so did the number of volatiles in H1–12, H1–13 and H2–13. Transgressive segregations were found in both directions where decanal, perillaldehyde, ethyl acetate, octyl acetate, decyl acetate, p-menth-1-en-9-ol acetate, α-pinene, myrcene, limonene and terpinolene exhibited the most significant transgressions (Table  1, Additional file  2).  A total of 20 volatile compounds were reported with odor activities in the F 1 individual FoMu-081 [ 14]. In the present study (Table  1, Additional file  2), (E)-2-decenal described as minty/piney, 1-octen-3-one described as mushroom and β-ionone described as floral, were found in ‘Murcott’, but not in ‘Fortune’ in 2013. Four aroma active compounds were detected only in F 1 hybrids in 2013, including (E)-carveol described as minty, dodecanal described as green, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate described as fruity and nootkatone described as spicy/woody. Two aroma active compounds were present in all F 1 hybrids in 2013, including linalool described as floral and myrcene described as metallic. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to analyze the differences in volatile composition in ‘Fortune’ x ‘Murcott’ within each harvest, and the results from H1-13 were shown here as a representative (Fig.  2). The first and second principal components (PC1 and PC2) represented 35.8 and 7.37% of the total variance. The parents were relatively well separated from each other, but not differentiated from most of their F 1 progeny, indicating that ‘Fortune’ and ‘Murcott’ exhibited relatively different volatile compositions. F 1 individuals formed a distribution trend from top left, with more of the compounds like hexanal (44, volatile code as shown in Additional file  2), methacrolein (15), pentanal (30), 3-heptanone (61), 1-penten-3-one (28), heptanal (65), and to the bottom right, with more of the volatiles like α-terpineol (165), β-phellandrene (98), α-phellandrene (93), p-cymene (95). Some hybrids on the top right contained much more volatiles compared to others, like F 1 individuals FoMu-115, FoMu-020, FoMu-091 and FoMu-076 with 111, 109, 101 and 108 volatiles respectively. Principal component, PC1, separated the individual hybrids primarily based on the relative content of α-humulene (267), δ-cadinene (288), (E)-cadina-1,4-diene (293), caryophyllene (253), α-muurolene (283), myrcene (81) and α-pinene (70), while α-phellandrene (93), p-cymene (95), β-phellandrene (98), α-colocalene (317), α-calacorene (296), α-cadinene (294), α-terpineol (165) and neointermedeol (335) were important for the separation of mandarin hybrids across PC2.  Correlation analysis of volatiles in ‘Fortune’ x ‘Murcott’ The pair-wise correlation coefficient for each volatile against every other compound was calculated in order to identify co-regulated compounds. Pearson correlation was performed for F 1 progeny juice samples in H1–13. Of the 11,476 pairs analyzed, 5885 resulted in significant correlations ( p < 0.05) (data not shown). Of these 5885 pairs, most of them (5724) exhibited positive correlation coefficients. The strongest positive correlations were found between α-muurolene with δ-cadinene ( r = 0.999) and (E)-cadina-1,4-diene ( r = 0.998). Strong positive ( r > 0.5) correlations were also found between (E)-2-octenal with (E)-2-nonenal ( r = 0.997) and heptanal ( r = 0.996), between δ-cadinene and (E)-cadina-1,4-diene ( r = 0.996), between nonyl acetate with octyl acetate ( r = 0.995) and decyl acetate ( r = 0.994). The strongest negative correlations were observed between 3-heptanone with linalool ( r = −0.26), and limonene ( r = −0.25) with dihydrocarvone ( r = −0.24). The 148 volatile compounds were categorized into 12 groups based on their chemical structure including acid, alcohol, aldehyde, ester, ether, furan, aromatic hydrocarbon, ketone, phenol, sesquiterpene, monoterpene and unknown [ 13]. The pair-wise correlation coefficient for each chemical group against every other group was calculated for juice samples from hybrids (Additional file  4). Strong positive correlations were observed for most of the major groups over four harvests, except for the ketone group which showed poor or no correlations. The ketone group was correlated with alcohols ( r = 0.49 and 0.56) in 2013, but showed no strong correlations with any other groups. The pair-wise correlation coefficient for each chemical group against every fruit characteristic was also calculated for hybrids (Additional file  5), and few strong correlations (|r| > 0.5) were observed. In 2013, total volatile content positively correlated with the traits TA and juice color space value  L, but negatively correlated with fruit diameter, fruit weight, juice percentage, SSC/TA ratio, flavedo and juice color space value  a and  a/ b ratio. Significant ( p < 0.05) positive correlations were found between TA with alcohols, aldehydes, esters and monoterpenes over two harvests in 2013. Juice color space value  a was negatively correlated with monoterpenes over four harvests, and juice color space value  b displayed relatively strong correlations with alcohols, aldehydes, esters and monoterpene in H1–13. The pair-wise correlation coefficient for color characteristic against every carotenoid-derived volatile including 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, β-cyclocitral, isophorone, neryl acetate, geranyl acetone and β–ionone, was calculated for hybrids (Additional file  6). Only a few stable significant correlations were found. Flavedo and juice color space value  a and  a/ b ratio displayed stable significant negative correlations with β-cyclocitral and neryl acetate, and a positive correlation with geranyl acetone over two or more harvests. Cluster validation using correlation analysis HCA (hierarchical cluster analysis) based on pairwise correlation coefficients were run individually for four harvests, and four distinct groups of volatiles were formed in H1–13 (Additional file  7). Cluster A included 26 volatiles, of which the majority were aldehydes, ketones and unknown compounds. Cluster B contained two sub-clusters B1 and B2 with 24 and 27 volatiles respectively. The B1 sub-cluster consisted of mainly aldehydes, esters, monoterpenes and unknown compounds, and the B2 comprised mainly alcohols, sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes. Cluster C included two sub-clusters C1 and C2 with 18 and 12 volatile compounds respectively. The C1 sub-cluster contained mainly sesquiterpenes, and the C2 comprised mainly sesquiterpenes and unknown compounds. Cluster D included two sub-clusters D1 and D2 with 20 and 23 volatiles respectively. The D1 consisted of mainly sesquiterpenes and unknown compounds, and the D2 contained mainly aldehydes, esters and ketones. Genetic mapping of QTLs controlling aroma compounds in ‘Fortune’ X ‘Murcott’ Some volatiles displayed qualitative variations, which suggested single locus inheritance. Pentanal, valencene and α-selinene were detected in juice samples from one parental line and the segregation pattern in the progeny matched a 1:1 ratio (α =0.05, χ 2 test), while (E)-2-octenal, acetone and (D)-carvone were present in both parents and the segregation pattern matched a 3:1 ratio (Additional file  2). In addition, 12 volatile compounds were absent in parental lines and the segregation pattern matched a 3:1 ratio. All QTLs for volatile compounds were identified using Log 10 transformed data. A total of 244 significant associations were found between molecular markers and 94 volatiles (Fig.  3 and Additional file  8). QTLs for each volatile located in the same chromosomal regions from different harvest seasons were considered to be the same, hence the 244 associations then were summarized into 206 QTLs, with 25 (12.14%) being repeatable (Table  2). Within the 25 repeatable QTLs, two, two, five, nine and five were detected for alcohols, aldehydes, esters, sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes, respectively. Out of the 206 QTLs, 41 QTLs were identified for 17 aroma active compounds. The number of QTLs ranged from zero on linkage groups FOR3.1, FOR7.2, FOR9.1, FOR9.3, MUR3.2, MUR3.3 and MUR7.1 to 47 on FOR1.1. The average R 2, explaining phenotypic variance, for all volatiles was 21.9%, and ranged from 14.49% for nonanoic acid to 59.82% for valencene in H1–13 with the highest LOD value of 17.22.  QTLs were grouped into four and three main clusters in the FOR and MUR maps, respectively. The first cluster on the FOR map was located on FOR1.1, where QTLs were identified for 47 volatiles including six alcohols, six aldehydes, five esters, one phenol, 11 sesquiterpenes, 10 monoterpenes and eight unknown compounds. Out of the 47 volatiles, nine volatiles were aroma active compounds, including linalool, heptanal, (E)-2-heptenal, decanal, dodecanal, myrcene, β-phellandrene, γ-terpinene and terpinolene. The second and third clusters were both located on FOR3.3. The second cluster was made up of nine QTLs identified for one alcohol, one ketone and seven sesquiterpenes. The R 2 was 59.82% for valencene in H1–13. Within the confidence intervals of the cluster, no candidate genes were found related to terpenoid regulation, even though the gene encoding valencene synthase (TPS1) was located on the Clementine genome scaffold 3. The third cluster of QTLs was identified for one acid, one alcohol, one ester, one ketone, two sesquiterpenes, eight monoterpenes and one unknown compound. The fourth cluster was located on FOR6.3, included QTLs for one alcohol, one aldehyde, one ester, one sesquiterpene and eight monoterpenes. Five of the eight monoterpenes were aroma active compounds including linalool, myrcene, terpinolene, β-phellandrene and γ-terpinene. The first cluster on the MUR map was located on MUR1.2, and contained QTLs for 24 volatiles including one acid, two alcohols, three esters, three ketones, six sesquiterpenes and nine monoterpenes. The second cluster was located on MUR2, consisted of QTLs for 22 volatiles including one alcohol, one aldehyde, five esters, five sesquiterpenes, nine monoterpenes and one unknown compound. Four of them were aroma active compounds including myrcene, β-phellandrene, γ-terpinene and dodecanal. Within the confidence intervals of the QTL cluster on MUR2, 572 annotated genes were listed. After screening, four of these genes,  GPS1,  TPS3,  TPS4 and  TPS14, encoding geranyl diphosphate synthase 1, terpene synthase 3, terpene synthase 4 and terpene synthase 14 respectively, were probably related to terpenoid regulation based on their biological function as studied in model plant species such as  Arabidopsis (Additional file  9). The third cluster was located on MUR4.1, where QTLs were identified for two esters, one aromatic hydrocarbon and one unknown compound. Repeatable and overlapped QTLs were also detected elsewhere for biologically related compounds in FOR and MUR maps. Overlapped QTLs were identified for (D)-carvone and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one on FOR2.1, (E)-dihydro carvone and (D)-carvone on FOR2.2, nonyl acetate and p-menth-1-en-9-ol acetate on FOR5.2, and α-copaene and δ-cadinene on FOR6.2. Repeatable QTLs were overlapped for δ-cadinene and calamenene on MUR6.1, and ethanol and ethyl acetate on FOR7.1. Eight QTLs on MUR9 were overlapped for one alcohol, three aldehydes, one ketone and three unknown compounds, and three of them were aroma active compounds including (E)-carveol, (E)-2-nonenal and (E)-2-decenal."," Background Flavor is an important attribute of mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco), but flavor improvement via conventional breeding is very challenging largely due to the complexity of the flavor components and traits. Many aroma associated volatiles of citrus fruit have been identified, which are directly related to flavor, but knowledge of genetic linkages and relevant genes for these volatiles, along with applicable markers potentially for expeditious and economical marker-assisted selection (MAS), is very limited. The objective of this project was to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with these volatile traits. Result Aroma volatiles were investigated in two mandarin parents ('Fortune' and 'Murcott') and their 116 F 1  progeny using gas chromatography mass spectrometry in 2012 and 2013. A total of 148 volatiles were detected, including one acid, 12 alcohols, 20 aldehydes, 14 esters, one furan, three aromatic hydrocarbons, 16 ketones, one phenol, 27 sesquiterpenes, 15 monoterpenes, and 38 unknowns. A total of 206 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified for 94 volatile compounds using genotyping data generated from a 1536-SNP Illumina GoldenGate assay. In detail, 25 of the QTLs were consistent over more than two harvest times. Forty-one QTLs were identified for 17 aroma active compounds that included 18 sesquiterpenes and were mapped onto four genomic regions. Fifty QTLs were for 14 monoterpenes and mapped onto five genomic regions. Candidate genes for some QTLs were also identified. A QTL interval for monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes on linkage group 2 contained four genes: geranyl diphosphate synthase 1, terpene synthase 3, terpene synthase 4, and terpene synthase 14. Conclusions Some fruit aroma QTLs were identified and the candidate genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway were found within the QTL intervals. These QTLs could lead to an efficient and feasible MAS approach to mandarin flavor improvement.","['Breeding', 'Citrus', 'QTL', 'Molecular marker', 'Aroma Volatile']","['Additional file', 'volatiles', 'compounds', 'volatile compounds', 'Additional', 'Murcott’', 'fortune’', 'QTLs', 'Volatile', 'unknown compounds']","[‘, ’, ‘Fortune, ’, H1–12, H2–12, H1–13, H2–13, ‘Fortune, ’, ‘Fortune, ’, ‘Fortune, ’, geranyl acetone, 90–99, p , H1–12, H1–12, H1–13, H2–13, p-menth-1-en-9-ol acetate, α-pinene, FoMu-081 [ 14, minty/piney, β-ionone, (E)-carveol, spicy/woody, ‘Fortune’, H1-13, PC2, ‘Fortune, ’, α-terpineol (165), FoMu-115, FoMu-020, FoMu-091, FoMu-076 with, α-pinene (70, α-terpineol (165), neointermedeol (335), PC2, p , δ-cadinene ( r , (E)-cadina-1,4-diene ( r , (E)-2-nonenal ( r , δ-cadinene, (E)-cadina-1,4-diene ( r , |r| , p , β-cyclocitral, β–ionone, β-cyclocitral, HCA, B2 with 24, B1, C1, C2 with 18, C1, C2, D2, D1, D2, ‘Fortune, ’ X ‘, α-selinene, α, χ 2, (D)-carvone, Log, FOR3.1, FOR7.2, FOR9.1, FOR9.3, MUR3.2, MUR3.3, MUR7.1, FOR3.3, TPS1, FOR6.3, β-phellandrene, MUR1.2, MUR2, MUR2, geranyl diphosphate synthase 1, terpene synthase 3, terpene synthase 4, terpene synthase 14, MUR4.1, (D)-carvone, (D)-carvone, p-menth-1-en-9-ol acetate, FOR6.2, MUR6.1, MUR9, (E)-carveol, (E)-2-nonenal]","['(TPS1)', 'TPS3,', 'TPS4', 'TPS14,']",[],[],terpene synthase
52,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5573811\eupmc_result.json,PMC5573811,"Results Sweet orange sesquiterpene emission profile Volatile profile in sweet orange leaves, flowers, and fruits at various phenological stages was investigated by static headspace sampling, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Separated volatile analysis for peel and pulp tissues from mature fruit were performed. In total, 99 volatile compounds, including 36 (plus 6 acetate/formate derivates) monoterpenes, were identified. In all samples, analyzed volatile emission was dominated by this class of terpenes, which constituted between 13 and more than 90% of the total emission (Supplementary Table  2). In general, β-terpinene, β-ocimene, and D-limonene were major compounds in all tissues, although it is interesting to note the high percentage of linalool in the volatile profile of sweet orange flowers. Despite their quantitative low contribution to total volatile emission from sweet orange tissues (<18%, Supplementary Table  2), sesquiterpene profile was qualitatively rich (Figure  1). Overall, up to 25 sesquiterpenes were identified in total. Small amounts of β-caryophyllene were detected in all samples, while α-copaene, β-elemene, α-humulene, and α-selinene were emitted by all tissues except young leaves. Beside this, each tissue showed a characteristic sesquiterpene emission profile. Major sesquiterpenes emitted by adult leaves were β-elemene and β-caryophyllene, while flowers emitted nerolidol, absent from most tissues analyzed. In fruit tissues, valencene emission contributed greatly to total emitted volatiles, in much more extent in peel than in pulp. Identification of the  TPS gene family in the sweet orange genome To identify all sweet orange genes with homology to  TPSs, the recently released sweet orange genome sequence (CAP 1) was screened using previously annotated  Citrus TPSs and relevant keywords as queries. This search identified a total of 95 loci and 111 predicted transcripts, 96 of them exhibiting significant similarities with known  TPSs (Supplementary Table  3). Most of the predicted peptides presented domains described in pFAM 5 and CCD 13 resources as TPS-characteristics, such as PF01397, and PF03936, described as TPS N-terminal and C-terminal domains, respectively. Besides, PLN02279 (ent-kaur-16-ene synthase), PLN02150 (TPS/cyclase), and PLN02592 (ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase) were identified. Putative  TPS genes were located on 6 of the 9 citrus chromosomes, being a significant proportion (78.84%) of them located in chromosomes II, III, IV, and V (Figure  2), while in chromosome VIII there was just one putative  TPS gene and none in chromosomes I, VI, and IX. Of the complete set of 95  CsTPS loci identified in this study, 61 (63.54%) were organized in 19 distinct clusters (distance between genes lower to 67 knt), covering from 2 to 6  CsTPS genes or pseudogenes, while 24 of them (named as orange1.1t) were not assigned to specific positions of the genome. 16  TPS loci arranged in five nearby clusters located in a region of 617 knt in chromosome IV, while isolated  TPS genes were identified in chromosomes II, IV, V, and VIII. In chromosomes II, IV, and V,  TPS genes were almost equally distributed in both DNA strands while in chromosome III all but one gene were located in the positive strand, and in chromosome VII all the genes were in the negative strand. Encoded protein predictions and homology analysis revealed that just 55 of the genes (70 predicted transcripts) appear to have uncompromised ORFs, encoding proteins longer than 400 amino acids and presenting significant homology to known non-citrus TPS enzymes (Supplementary Table  3). Remaining genes encoded polypeptides shorter than 400 amino acids and are likely to be pseudogenes or partial genes. Protein Cs3g21590 presented only 41% query coverage (from amino acid 1–531) to an annotated protein product from  Vitis and to other genes annotated as  SesquiTPS, while from amino acid 569 it presented high homology to 60S ribosomal genes. When NCBI citrus-annotated sequences were considered in homology analysis, Cs3g21590 presented 100% identity to a predicted SesquiTPS (XP_006473872) identified in the same genome annotation project that finally resulted in the CAP database. Consequently, annotated Cs3g21590 was replaced by a corrected version (Cs3g21590c) for subsequent analysis. Attending to their intron/exon number, as proposed by Trapp and Croteau ( 2001),  TPSs were classified into three classes: I (12–14 introns), II (9 introns), or III (6 introns) (Figure  3). Four genes, namely  Cs2g06470, Cs5g15530, Cs5g31210, and  orange1.1t03278, with 12, 13, 15, and 14 predicted exons, respectively, were classified as class I, which comprises mainly diterpene synthases from both angio- and gymnosperms. Remaining genes were annotated as class III, coding for TPS-a (SesquiTPS), TPS-b (cyclic monoterpene and hemiterpene synthases) and TPS-g (acyclic MonoTPS). From these, 12 were found to be partial genes in which some part of the gene is missed, probably by deletion or incomplete duplication, while other three genes presented duplications of the 3'-end. For example, gene  Cs3g16210 had automatically predicted nine introns, a characteristic feature of class II-TPS, which is gymnosperm specific. Detailed analysis of the sequence revealed two insertions of 800 and 356 nt, corresponding to duplications from more than half of intron 3 to almost the end of exon 5, and from intron 5 to the beginning of intron 6, respectively, after exon 7. Other genes, despite suffering insertions (i.e.,  orange1.1t04360, which harbors a small insertion in exon 3), coded for putative full length TPSs (Figure  3). In total, 40 of the genes were predicted to be full-length. Manual analysis of the architecture of  CsTPSs revealed a high conserved gene structure, with exons/introns (7/6) from class III TPSs corresponding to exons/introns 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of class I TPSs (data not shown). Number, size, placement and position of exons and introns and splice sites of all these genes have been also analyzed. The size of the exons, although to a lesser extent the first one, was quite preserved, with median lengths from 44 to 125 amino acids (Figure  4A), while intron length was highly variable, from 16 to 2,335 nucleotides, most of them being between 81 and 400 nucleotides (Figure  4C). However, conservation of intron phase was evident in all them, though with some (1–4) exceptions in all introns but 6 (Figure  4B). To further characterize  CsTPSs, introns splicing sites context was analyzed and conserved trinucleotides R/GT and YAG/ were detected at 5′ and 3′ ends of the introns, respectively (Figure  4D). Protein conserved motifs and phylogenetic analysis Overall amino acid identity among predicted citrus TPS was 42.10%, although it varied widely, from 16.92% (Cs3g07850 and Cs5g15530) to 99.81% (Cs4g12120.1 and Cs4g12120.2) (Supplementary Table  4) similarity decreasing toward the carboxyl terminus of the proteins (Supplementary Figure  1). Protein length also differed extensively, from 729–851 amino acids of class I TPS to the minimum size of class III TPS (410 amino acids for Cs4g11320, Supplementary Table  3), being the medium size for this last class of 556 amino acids. Amino acidic sequence of putative full-length class III CsTPS was further analyzed (Supplementary Table  5). The size of the predicted protein sequences ranged from 410 to 629 amino acids, with theoretical molecular weights between 47.15 and 72.51 KDa and pIs between 4.86 and 7.63. Chloroplast transit peptides were predicted for 15 of the proteins, envisaging their probable MonoTPS activity, while the rest of CsTPSs are probably targeted to the cytosol and thus are most likely SesquiTPSs. Although all predicted full-length class III CsTPSs contained characteristic TPS motifs to a greater or lesser extent, just 39 of them (corresponding to 37 genes) contained all the motifs required for activity. At the N-terminal position, RRX8W motif essential for monoterpene synthase cyclization (Bohlmann et al.,  1998; Trapp and Croteau,  2001) was completely conserved in 25 of the predicted peptides, while variations affecting the second arginine were found in 18 sequences. This motif was completely absent in nine of the predicted peptides. At the C-terminus, a fully conserved RDR motif was found in most sequences, with variations R(E/S)(Q/S) in seven of them. The aspartate rich motif involved in bivalent metal ion cofactor binding varied between CsTPSs, occurring mostly as DDIYD. Only three predicted peptides lacked this motif. NSE/DTE signature was found in all selected full-length TPSs, with the general consensus sequence (D/N)D(V/M/L/I)X(S/T)XXXE. One predicted protein (orange1.1t02008) lacked the first aspartate, while two other lacked the terminal E (Cs2g22150 and Cs7g18530). Variations at intermediate positions were found in six of the putative peptides. Interestingly, the position of all these characteristic motifs was conserved along exon structure (Figure  3, Supplementary Table  5). To explore the evolutionary relationship between the citrus TPS family, putative full length functional CsTPSs identified in the CAP database, and all citrus TPSs functionally characterized up to date were used to construct a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree (Figure  5). This analysis separated CsTPSs in two clades, one with four members and the other with the remaining sequences. The first one included TPS-c, -e, and -f subfamilies, with one or two members each. Members of these subfamilies belong to class I TPS, as envisaged from their intron number, and their larger size due to the presence of an N-terminal plant diterpene synthase conserved signature, which includes SAYDTAW and QXXDGSWG motifs (Supplementary Figure  1). Identified citrus class I TPS did not contain RRX8W, RDR, or NSE/DTE motifs. TPSc members (Cs5g15530 and Cs5g31210) did not harbored DDXXD, but DXDD. These characteristics, together with the ancestral position of this clade, suggest that CsTPSc members are most probably copalyl diphosphate synthases, in good agreement with homology analysis (Supplementary Table  3). Orange1.1t03278 and Cs2g06470 contained DDXXD signature. The first one, which constitutes by itself clade TPS-e, resembled ent-kaurene synthase from other species while Cs2g06470, only representative of clade TPS-f, presented high homology to geranyl linalool synthases annotated in the NCBI public database. The second clade divided in two clusters, the larger one including TPS-b/g and TPS-a1 subfamilies. Identity within TPS-a1 group ranged from 28.17 (between Cs4g11320 and orange1.1t02448/orange1.1t03307) to 98.72% (between Cs5g12880 and Cs5g12900). This group contains putative SesquiTPSs and, consequently, all but one did not have a predicted transit peptide. Previously, functionally characterized citrus SesquiTPSs, such as β-farnesene synthase (Q94JS8), valencene synthase (AAQ04608), δ-elemene synthase (BAP74389), germacrene-A synthase (CuSesquiTPS1), and nerolidol/linalool synthase (BAP75561), also claded in this group. Members of Q94JS8 subcluster (Cs4g11320, orange1.1t03302.1, Cs4g12480 and Cs4g12220) maintain the DXDD motif, absent from the rest of predicted full length TPSs from class III (Supplementary Table  5). In this subfamily, arginine rich motifs presented R(P/R)X(A/S)X(F/Y)HP(S/T/N)(I/L)W and R(D/N)R consensus sequences and were found in almost all members. The first motif was absent in Cs4g12220 and Cs2g24110.1, while Cs4g11320 and orange1.1t03302 lacked RDR signature (Supplementary Table  5). Aspartate rich motifs DD(I/T)(Y/F)D and (D/N)D(I/M/V)X(S/T/G)(H/Y)(K/E)(F/V)E were found as conserved sequences in CsTPS-a, and they were present in all predicted full length proteins but Cs4g11320 and orange1.1t03302, which also lacked DDXXD. TPS-b subfamily, related to angiosperm MonoTPSs, had 19  C. sinensis predicted peptides, many of them harboring plastid targeting signals (Figure  5). Minimum identity within this group was 36.67%, between Cs2g22100 and Cs3g07880, while highest was 98.68%, between Cs3g04360 and Cs3g04190.  Citrus D-limonene (BAD27256, BAD27257, BAF73932, AAM53944, and AAM53946), geraniol (BAM29049), β-ocimene (BAD91046), γ-terpinene (AAM53943, BAD27258, and BAD27259), 1,8-cineole (BAD91045), β-pinene (AAM53945 and BAD27260) and sabinene (BAF73933) synthases reported in the literature, also claded in this group. Most (73%) predicted CsTPSb harbored all characteristic TPS motifs, presented as R(R/Q)SA(N/D)YXP(S/T/N)IW, R(D/N)(R/S), DD(I/V)YD, and (D/N)DL(G/A)TSSDE. Although the corresponding proteins from  C. sinensis have not been functionally characterized yet, in basis of current phylogenetic analysis, and their high identity (>95% from RRX8W onwards) it could be inferred that  Cs7g18530, and  Cs3g07850 encode sweet orange β-pinene and γ-terpinene synthases. In addition, if we compare their amino acid sequence between RDR and NSE/DTE signatures, which mostly corresponds to the catalytic pocket (Kampranis et al.,  2007), the identity between these CsTPSs, and citrus characterized β-pinene and γ-terpinene synthases raises to 99%. Similarly, D-limonene synthase activity can be envisaged for Cs3g04170, and Cs3g04360, grouped with enzymes with this activity from  C. sinensis, C. limon, and  C. unshiu, and highly identical to them (>94% from RRX8W and >99% between conserved motifs). A second cluster of D-limonene synthases including a protein from  C. unshiu and another putative D-limonene synthase from sweet orange (Cs3g04340) was also found. Closely related to TPS-b family, a TPS-g cluster, corresponding to predicted acyclic MonoTPS, was found. It included five members, three of them having a predicted transit peptide to chloroplasts. All members of this cluster completely lacked RRX8W signature and poorly conserved RDR motif, being the most common version R(D/E)Q. By the other hand, DDIFD, and DDLGSAKDE were found to be absolutely conserved in all CsTPS-g, except in Cs2g22180, which presented DDLGTAREE. Cs2g22180 presented low identity (38.50% in average) with remaining sequences of the group, which showed an overall identity of 78.16%. Previously characterized citrus linalool synthases also clustered in this group (BAP75559 and BAP75560), closely related to some of the identified CsTPSs. CsSesquiTPS gene isolation and expression analysis In order to gain knowledge about CsTPSs, an expression analysis of putative full-length  CsTPSs was performed using CAP RNA-seq data (Figure  6A). Resulting heatmap showed differential mRNA expression between genes. Eight genes showed low expression levels while other 22 were found to be expressed in all analyzed tissues (leaf, flower, and fruit). Four, one, and three genes showed tissue-specific expression in leaf, flower, or fruit, respectively. Most identified full length putative  CsTPS genes belong to the TPS-a subfamily, from which, to our knowledge, just four proteins have been functionally characterized up to date. Conversely, numerous peptides with MonoTPS activity, almost covering every subclade from the phylogenetic tree (Figure  5) have been reported. Then, gene expression of seven putative  CsSesquiTPS in different sweet orange tissues, such as peel, pulp, leaves, and flowers, was further examined. For  Cs5g23510, a unique sequence of 1,680 nt ( CsSesquiTPS1, Acc. N°  MF280919), encoding a protein of 559 amino acids (MW 64.54 kDa; pI 5.89) was obtained. This protein was 99.82% identical to that predicted in the CAP database, with just one amino acid change (M479I). Transcripts corresponding to this gene were observed in all tissues analyzed decreasing their accumulation in pulp as fruit matured (Figure  6B). For  Cs4g12120, a unique sequence of 1,689 nt was obtained ( CsSesquiTPS2, Acc. N°  MF280920). It encoded a 562 amino acid protein (MW 65.09 kDa; pI 5.79) identical to that annotated in the CAP database as Cs4g12120.2. Accumulation of this mRNA increased in orange peel along maturation, while in pulp it was only detected at the immature green stage. Expression of this gene was not detected in leaves at any developmental stage analyzed, while in flowers besides the mRNAs observed in fruit tissues, an additional transcript of about 1,400 nucleotides longer was also detected. The shorter predicted mRNA (Cs4g12120.1, 1,551 nt) was not detected at any of the tissues analyzed (Figure  6C). Orange1.1t03302 cDNA clones corresponded to a unique ORF of 1,683 nt ( CsSesquiTPS3, Acc N° MF280921) for a predicted protein of 560 amino acids (MW 64.25; pI 5.43), 74 more than that predicted in the CAP database, and contained all characteristic TPS motifs (Supplementary Figure  2A). This longer transcript was detected in the peel of orange fruit until degreening and in pulp of immature green fruits. In flowers and young leaves, mRNAs of the same size were detected, while in adult leaves only a much longer transcript (about 5,000 nt) was distinguished (Figure  6D). For  Cs4g12350, a 1,668 nt unique sequence ( CsSesquiTPS4, Acc. N°  MF280922), coding for a polypeptide of 555 amino acids (MW 64.37; pI 5.32) identical to that predicted in the CAP database, was obtained. This transcript was observed in peel, independently of fruit developmental/maturation stage, and in the pulp of immature green fruits. It was also detected in flowers and in all leaf tissues analyzed (Figure  6E). Shorter mRNAs were observed in peel from full colored fruits and in pulp from mature green and breaker fruits. For  Cs4g12400 gene, two cDNA clones of 1,668 nt (Acc. N°  MF280923 and  MF280924 for clones  CsSesquiTPS5a and  b, respectively) were obtained, both coding proteins of 555 amino acids, highly identical between them (95.86%) and to that predicted by the CAP database (96.04–99.82% for clones a and b, respectively). Predicted protein (Cs4g12400) and CsSesquiTPS5a had only one difference, a conservative amino acid substitution at the N-terminus (K15Q, Supplementary Figure  2B). On the other hand, CsSesquiTPS5b presented 22 amino acid substitutions (13 of them conservative, Supplementary Figure  2B) when compared with CsSesquiTPS5a. Transcripts corresponding to Cs4g12400 were detected in all tissues analyzed (Figure  6F). Three different cDNA clones were retrieved for  orange1.1t004360, two of them ( CsSesquiTPS6a Acc. N°  MF280925, and  CsSesquiTPS6b Acc. N°  MF280926) encoding proteins identical to those predicted from transcripts orange1.1t004360.1, and orange1.1t004360.2, with 574, and 567 amino acids, respectively. The third isolated sequence ( CsSesquiTPS6c, Acc. N°  MF280927) coded for a polypeptide 99.6% identical to orange1.1t004360.2, with two non-conservative substitutions (Asp for Gly) at positions 105, and 319. Transcription of this gene was detected in flower, leaves, and fruit tissues at certain developmental stages (Figure  6G). All cDNA clones corresponding to  Cs4g11980 showed an equal sequence of 1,701 nt ( CsSesquiTPS7, Acc. N°  MF280928), 99.29% identical to the ORF predicted in the CAP database. From the 12 nucleotide changes detected between both sequences, just six amino acid variations were found among them (Supplementary Figure  2C), showing 98.92% identity at amino acid level. Expression of this gene was detected in peel and pulp of immature green fruits, in leaves and flowers (Figure  6H). Functional characterization of the putative SesquiTPSs in  E. coli Functional characterization was carried out by expression of recombinant proteins in  E. coli, and  in vitro enzyme assays using FPP as substrate. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that sufficient soluble protein was formed for all constructs (data not shown). Volatile terpenes produced by the different recombinant proteins were analyzed by GC-MS. Analysis of the sesquiterpene products generated by CsSesquiTPS1 showed the presence of a 62:38% mixture of ( Z)-β-cubebene and α-copaene (Figure  7A). The major sesquiterpene product of CsSesquiTPS2 was tentatively identified as β-cadinene (59.19 ± 4.63% of total), followed by α-copaene (25.84 ± 2.76% of total) along with two minor products, α-cubebene and γ-cadinene (9.96 ± 1.11 and 4.98 ± 1.76% of total, respectively, Figure  7B). Enzyme coded by  CsSesquiTPS3 converted FPP to β-farnesene as the major product (74.74 ± 1.94% of total) with lesser amounts of β-sesquiphellandrene, zingiberene, and β-maaliene (16.07 ± 1.36, 4.78 ± 1.40, and 3.91 ± 1.10% of total, respectively, Figure  7C). More than half of CsSesquiTPS4 sesquiterpene production corresponded to β-elemene. In addition, between 6.22 and 12.68% of β-caryophyllene (6.22 ± 0.50%), α-humulene (12.68 ± 0.60%), and α-, β- and γ-selinene (9.82 ± 8.16, 9.84 ± 7.92, and 7.81 ± 4.70%, respectively) were detected (Figure  7D). Both  CsSesquiTPS5 clones (a and b) catalyzed the formation of multiple products from FPP, being all them bicyclic, except traces of the tricyclic sesquiterpene longifolene (Figures  7E,F). In both cases, the three major products (at least 20% each) were allo-aromadendrene (23.55 ± 12.43 and 25.67 ± 10.05% of total, for clones a and b, respectively), ledene (23.88 ± 0.80 and 20.43 ± 5.60% of total, for clones a and b, respectively) and β-cadinene (25.52 ± 6.79 and 31.58 ± 16.22% of total, for clones a and b, respectively). Trace to small amounts of α-cubebene, α-copaene, γ-gurjunene, (+/−)-cadinene, longifolene, α-muurolene, and 4,15-selinadiene were also found. In the case of  CsSesquiTPS6 clones, each showed different activities when FPP was used as substrate (Figures  7G–I). CsSesquiTPS6a produced exclusively β-caryophyllene, while CsSesquiTPS6b rendered higher amounts of β-caryophyllene (73.51 ± 0.26% of total) together with α-humulene (23.14 ± 0.30% of total). Clone CsSesquiTPS6c did not produce any sesquiterpene. As CsSesquiTPS6b, CsSesquiTPS7 produced β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, and in similar proportions (about 75:25%, respectively, Figure  7J). Protein modeling The different proteins encoded by  CsSesquiTPS5, CsSesquiTPS6 and  CsSesquiTPS7 were 3D modeled based on the crystal structure of the δ-cadinene synthase from cotton (Gennadios et al.,  2009, Protein Data Bank code  3G4D_(A). All predicted structural models show high quality (coverage >94%, sequence similarity >0.44, high GMQE and QMEAN scores), and fitted well with the crystallographic model, displaying the two TPS characteristic domains: the functional C-terminal domain consisting of 14 α-helices forming a central cavity and the amino terminal domain formed by two 10 antiparallel α-helices (Figure  8). The aspartate-rich motifs DDXXD (located on Helix α-13) and NSE/DTE motif (located helix α-20) both involved in binding a trio of divalent magnesium ions, co-orientated to the catalytic pocket. Most of the non-equivalent amino acid substitutions identified between CsSesquiTPS5a and b were located in α-helices without causing significant alterations of the predicted structure (i.e., E134A, L243H, Y369C). Some others, such as S129P and R191C, were found on the outer surface of the protein, in contact with the solvent, and neither expected to induce alterations in its conformation. The change Q458H was found near to the active site. The light steric effect that this substitution could have may be somehow compensated by the Q482A change, which in the tertiary structure faces with the previous one, thus not altering size or conformation of the catalytic cavity. In the cleft, D309, and 313, N453, and Q387 were found to interact with the Mg 2+ cluster. A representative model of CsSesquiTPS5 proteins is shown in Figure  8A. Despite their differences at sequence level, CsSesquiTPS7, and CsSesquiTPS6b both produced β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, and in similar proportions (Figure  7). By modeling and comparing their structures, we found that most amino acid changes between both proteins were solvent exposed and were not expected to induce important changes in the protein structure (Figure  8B). Just A256E and I260R (counted on CsSesquiTPS6b sequence), both located on an α-helix, were found to disturb somewhat the facing N-terminal loop, in which E41D, and T44P substitutions could compensate the structural differences. Consequently, the predicted N-terminal end varies slightly between both proteins, but the predicted catalytic pocket remained almost identical. Contrary, on CsSesquiTPS6c, the D319G change prevents the interaction of this residue with one of the Mg 2+ atoms (Figure  8C). On the other hand, in comparison to CsSesquiTPS6b, insertion of seven amino acids in the loop between α-helix 14 and 15 of CsSesquiTPS6a would allow establishment of new hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with faced helixes α-15 and α-16, the last harboring the E404 residue involved in interactions with the Mg 2+ cluster (Figure  8D). Besides, the loop may also stabilize the α-helix 14 itself, providing extra rigidity to the preceding α-helix-13, which includes the DDXXD signature. Altogether, these effects may result in higher rigidity and stability of the C-terminal domain of the structure. Modelling also predicts small deviations of helixes α-17, α-20, and α-21, the second one including D471, also involved in binding the bivalent metal ion cofactor.","Citrus aroma and flavor, chief traits of fruit quality, are derived from their high content in essential oils of most plant tissues, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. Accumulated in secretory cavities, most components of these oils are volatile terpenes. They contribute to defense against herbivores and pathogens, and perhaps also protect tissues against abiotic stress. In spite of their importance, our understanding of the physiological, biochemical, and genetic regulation of citrus terpene volatiles is still limited. The availability of the sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis  L. Osbeck) genome sequence allowed us to characterize for the first time the terpene synthase (TPS) family in a citrus type.  CsTPS  is one of the largest angiosperm TPS families characterized so far, formed by 95 loci from which just 55 encode for putative functional TPSs. All TPS angiosperm families, TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, TPS-e/f, and TPS-g were represented in the sweet orange genome, with 28, 18, 2, 2, and 5 putative full length genes each. Additionally, sweet orange β-farnesene synthase, ( Z )-β-cubebene/α-copaene synthase, two β-caryophyllene synthases, and three multiproduct enzymes yielding β-cadinene/α-copaene, β-elemene, and β-cadinene/ledene/allo-aromandendrene as major products were identified, and functionally characterized via  in vivo  recombinant  Escherichia coli  assays.","['Sesquiterpene', 'Citrus', 'Orange', 'Volatile', 'Monoterpene', 'Defense', 'Β-caryophyllene']","['Figure', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Supplementary Table', 'predicted', 'TPS', 'amino acids', 'Supplementary', 'genes', 'amino', 'TPS genes']","[β-terpinene, β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene, CAP 1, CCD 13 resources, TPS-characteristics, PF03936, TPS N-terminal, PLN02279, PLN02150, TPS/cyclase, PLN02592, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, IX, V, Cs3g21590, 60S ribosomal, Cs3g21590, CAP, Cs3g21590, 12–14, Cs5g15530, Cs5g31210, class I, class III, TPS-g (acyclic MonoTPS, class III TPSs, class I TPSs, R/GT, 3′, Cs3g07850, Cs5g15530, Cs4g12120.1, Cs4g12120.2, 729–851 amino acids, class I, class III TPS, Cs4g11320, class III CsTPS, KDa, MonoTPS, CsTPSs, SesquiTPSs, class III CsTPSs, metal ion cofactor, CsTPSs, DDIYD, Cs2g22150, Cs7g18530, CsTPSs, CAP, CsTPSs, class I, SAYDTAW, QXXDGSWG, Cs5g31210, CsTPSc, Cs2g06470, ent-kaurene synthase, Cs2g06470, TPS-b/g, TPS-a1, Cs4g11320, orange1.1t02448/orange1.1t03307, Cs5g12880, Cs5g12900, SesquiTPSs, SesquiTPSs, β-farnesene synthase, δ-elemene synthase (, germacrene-A synthase, CuSesquiTPS1, nerolidol/linalool synthase, BAP75561, Q94JS8 subcluster, Cs4g11320, orange1.1t03302.1, Cs4g12480, Cs4g12220, class III, R(D/N)R, Cs4g12220, Cs2g24110.1, Cs4g11320, orange1.1t03302, DD(I/T)(Y/F)D, CsTPS-a, Cs4g11320, orange1.1t03302, MonoTPSs, Cs2g22100, Cs3g07880, Cs3g04360, Cs3g04190, BAD27256, BAD27257, BAF73932, AAM53944, AAM53946, BAM29049, AAM53943, BAD27258, BAD27259, β-pinene (AAM53945, BAD27260, CsTPSb, R(R/Q)SA(N/D)YXP(S/T/N)IW, R(D/N)(R/S, DD(I/V)YD, CsTPSs, Cs3g04170, Cs3g04360, MonoTPS, R(D/E)Q., DDIFD, DDLGSAKDE, CsTPS-g, Cs2g22180, DDLGTAREE, Cs2g22180, BAP75559, BAP75560, CsTPSs, CsSesquiTPS, CsTPSs, CAP RNA-seq, MonoTPS, CsSesquiTPS1, CAP, CsSesquiTPS2, Acc., CAP, Cs4g12120.2, Cs4g12120.1, CsSesquiTPS3, Acc N°, CAP, CsSesquiTPS4, CAP, CAP database (, b, Cs4g12400, CsSesquiTPS5a, CsSesquiTPS5b, CsSesquiTPS5a, Cs4g12400, orange1.1t004360.1, orange1.1t004360.2, CsSesquiTPS6c, orange1.1t004360.2, CsSesquiTPS7, CAP, SesquiTPSs, CsSesquiTPS1, CsSesquiTPS2, ±, ±, β-maaliene (16.07 ±, ±, ±, CsSesquiTPS4, β-caryophyllene (6.22 ±, α-, β-, ±, ±, ±, ±, b, ±, ±, b, ±, b, CsSesquiTPS6b, β-caryophyllene (73.51 ±, Clone CsSesquiTPS6c, CsSesquiTPS6b, CsSesquiTPS7, β-caryophyllene, GMQE, CsSesquiTPS5a, b, α-helices, E134A, L243H, Y369C, S129P, R191C, Q458H, Q482A, N453, Mg 2, CsSesquiTPS5, CsSesquiTPS7, CsSesquiTPS6b, I260R, CsSesquiTPS6b, α-helix, N-terminal, E41D, N-terminal, CsSesquiTPS6c, Mg 2, CsSesquiTPS6b, α-helix 14, CsSesquiTPS6a, α-15, α-16, Mg 2, α-helix, α-helix-13, α-20, α-21]","['TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS-characteristics,', 'TPS', '(TPS/cyclase),', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'SesquiTPS,', 'SesquiTPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS-a', '(SesquiTPS),', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'MonoTPS).', 'II-TPS,', 'TPSs', 'CsTPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'CsTPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CsTPS', 'MonoTPS', 'CsTPSs', 'SesquiTPSs.', 'CsTPSs', 'TPS', 'CsTPSs,', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'CsTPSs', 'TPSs', 'CsTPSs', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS,', 'TPS', 'TPSc', 'CsTPSc', 'TPS-e,', 'TPS-f,', 'TPS-b/g', 'TPS-a1', 'TPS-a1', 'SesquiTPSs', 'SesquiTPSs,', '(CuSesquiTPS1),', 'TPSs', 'CsTPS-a,', 'TPS-b', 'MonoTPSs,', 'CsTPSb', 'TPS', 'CsTPSs,', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'MonoTPS,', 'CsTPS-g,', 'CsTPSs.', 'CsSesquiTPS', 'CsTPSs,', 'CsTPSs', 'CsTPS', 'TPS-a', 'MonoTPS', 'CsSesquiTPS', 'CsSesquiTPS1,', 'CsSesquiTPS2,', 'CsSesquiTPS3,', 'TPS', 'CsSesquiTPS4,', 'CsSesquiTPS5a', 'CsSesquiTPS5a', 'CsSesquiTPS5b', 'CsSesquiTPS5a.', 'CsSesquiTPS6a', 'CsSesquiTPS6b', 'CsSesquiTPS6c,', 'CsSesquiTPS7,', 'SesquiTPSs', 'CsSesquiTPS1', 'CsSesquiTPS2', 'CsSesquiTPS3', 'CsSesquiTPS4', 'CsSesquiTPS5', 'CsSesquiTPS6', 'CsSesquiTPS6a', 'CsSesquiTPS6b', 'CsSesquiTPS6c', 'CsSesquiTPS6b,', 'CsSesquiTPS7', 'CsSesquiTPS5,', 'CsSesquiTPS6', 'CsSesquiTPS7', 'TPS', 'CsSesquiTPS5a', 'CsSesquiTPS5', 'CsSesquiTPS7,', 'CsSesquiTPS6b', 'CsSesquiTPS6b', 'CsSesquiTPS6c,', 'CsSesquiTPS6b,', 'CsSesquiTPS6a']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']","['Citrus', 'Citrus']",terpene synthase
53,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5583216\eupmc_result.json,PMC5583216,"Results Infection and symptoms Ten doubly-inoculated trees became positive for both mild CTV-B2 and severe CTV-B6 based on RT-PCR after 2–4 months (Figure  1). Symptoms developed 5–6 months after inoculation. Trees infected with CTV-B2/CTV-B6 were much smaller and stunted than the healthy controls, with leaf chlorosis, vein corking, and vein curling (Figure  2) increasing as time passed. Symptoms of the co-inoculated plants 12 months after co-inoculation were indistinguishable from those produced by plants infected with CTV-B6 alone. In the plants co-inoculated with CTV-B2 and CTV-B6, the p23 transcript of CTV-B6 was found 300 times more frequently than the CTV-B2 homolog. Sequences homologous to p23 were not found in the mock-inoculated controls, nor when other libraries that contained only CTV-B2 or CTV-B6 were searched for the heterologous p23 sequence. Overview of RNA-seq 38 to 47 million raw reads were obtained from each inoculated tree with approximate 61% (average of three replicates) of these reads successfully aligned to the  C. sinensis reference genome (Xu et al.,  2013; Figure  S1). Compared with mock-inoculated healthy trees, a total of 767 transcripts were differentially expressed: 411 were induced and 356 were repressed (Padj ≤ 0.1; Figure  S2). DETs were found to be enriched for different biological processes (level 2) with Panther based on orthologs of  Arabidopsis thaliana. The distribution of functional categories for up- and down-regulated genes was similar: metabolic processes, cellular processes, localization, biological regulation, and response to stimulus (Figure  3). The set of down-regulated genes had relatively more genes related to cellular component organization/biogenesis but less for localization (Figure  3). In an overview of metabolic and biotic stress pathways, genes related to light reactions, oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP), tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), tetrapyrrole synthesis, nucleotide metabolism, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism were mostly repressed (Figure  4), whereas the genes associated with cell wall synthesis, secondary and hormone metabolism, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, and signaling were mostly induced (Figure  5). A full list of differentially expressed transcripts is shown in more detail (Table  S2). The expression levels of selected DETs ranged from −2 to 8 (log 2 FC). Similar expression patterns were obtained for all evaluated transcripts by both RNA-seq and RT-qPCR techniques. The dissociation pattern and single peak obtained after RT-qPCR verified the specificity of RT-qPCR primers (Figure  S3). A high Spearman's rho value (0.82) indicated good correlation of gene expression between the RNA-seq and RT-qPCR results and confirmed the reliability and accuracy of the RNA-seq data in our study (Figure  6). Photosynthesis, nucleic acid, and iron metabolism The expression of several photosynthesis-related genes was down-regulated in response to CTV-B2/CTV-B6. These genes included  LHCA4 (light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex I subunit A4),  PPL1 (PsbP-like protein 1), thylakoid lumenal 20 kDa protein,  PSAD-1 (photosystem I subunit D-1), photosystem II reaction center  PsbP family protein, and  PTAC14 (plastid transcriptionally active14; Table  1). Genes in the tetrapyrrole synthesis pathway were also repressed, including  GSA2 (glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2, 1-aminomutase 2),  HEMC (hydroxymethylbilane synthase),  HEME2 (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase), and  HEMF1 (coproporphyrinogen oxidase; Table  1). Genes encoding enzymes for nucleotide metabolism  PYR4 (pyrimidine 4),  NDPK2 (nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2), and  RNR1 (ribonucleotide reductase 1) were repressed. Genes related to DNA synthesis were also down-regulated, as were some genes that encode DNA repair proteins  MCM2 (DNA replication licensing factor),  MCM3, FAS1 (fasciata 1),  RPA70B (rpa70-kda subunit B),  PRL (prolifera), and genes for several histones, including  H3, H4, and  HTA7 (Table  1). Alteration of ribosomal composition A large group of genes encoding ribosomal proteins were repressed, including components of the 30S, 40S, 50S, and 60S subunits, indicating an extensive reprogramming of ribosomal synthesis (Table  2). Ribosomal proteins (RPs) play roles in metabolism, growth and cell division, but also function in developmental processes as regulatory components (Byrne,  2009). Cell wall barriers were enhanced The expression of a majority of genes for cell wall metabolism was up-regulated: Genes encoding  CESA9 (cellulose synthase A9) and  PRP4 (cell wall proline-rich protein 4), as well as  XTH28 (xyloglucan endotransglycosylase) and  XTH30 were all up-regulated and the expression level of  EXLB3 (expansin-like B3 precursor) was up-regulated ~7 fold (Table  3). Transportation system Transcription of genes related to transport and metal binding were largely up-regulated. These included transporters for nucleotides, sugars, amino acids, sulfate, phosphate, peptides, and oligopeptides and ABC transporters, such as,  AAP6 and  AAP7 (amino acid trans membrane transporter),  AST56 and  AST68 (sulfate transporter),  NRT1.1 (nitrate transporter),  ZIP1, ZIP5, and  ZIP11 (zinc ion trans membrane transporter; Table  3). Transcripts encoding phloem protein PP2-B13 were somewhat down-regulated in response to co-infection with CTV-B2/CTV-B6, but were strongly down-regulated by CTV-B2 alone, whereas transcripts for PP2-B15 were slightly up-regulated by single infection with CTV-B6 (Fu et al.,  2016). Up-regulation of hormone and secondary metabolism and signaling associated defense responses Genes involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites and hormone metabolism were induced, such as,  TPS21 (terpene synthase 21),  CER3 (ceriferum 3),  TT4 (transparent testa 4),  AFB5 (auxin F-Box protein 5),  GA5 (gibberellin 20-oxidase),  EIN4 (ethylene insensitive 4), and  ERS1 (ethylene response sensor 1). Genes for biotic stress associated proteins  RLP21 (Receptor Like Protein 21),  CHIB1 (acidic endochitinase) and  EDS1 (enhanced disease susceptibility 1), and disease resistance proteins in the CC-NBS-LRR class were also induced (Table  3). Genes for receptor kinases, calcium and light related signaling were mostly induced, such as,  RLP1 (receptor like protein 1),  RLP6, and  RLP15, CSE101 (callus expression of rbcs 101),  IQD23 (IQ-domain 23) binding calmodulin, and  FRS5 (FAR1-related sequence 5) binding zinc ions (Table  3).","Citrus tristeza is one of the most destructive citrus diseases and is caused by the phloem-restricted Closterovirus,  Citrus tristeza virus . Mild strain CTV-B2 does not cause obvious symptoms on indicators whereas severe strain CTV-B6 causes symptoms, including stem pitting, cupping, yellowing, and stiffening of leaves, and vein corking. Our laboratory has previously characterized changes in transcription in sweet orange separately infected with CTV-B2 and CTV-B6. In the present study, transcriptome analysis of  Citrus sinensis  in response to double infection by CTV-B2 and CTV-B6 was carried out. Four hundred and eleven transcripts were up-regulated and 356 transcripts were down-regulated prior to the onset of symptoms. Repressed genes were overwhelmingly associated with photosynthesis, and carbon and nucleic acid metabolism. Expression of genes related to the glycolytic, oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP), tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) pathways, tetrapyrrole synthesis, redox homeostasis, nucleotide metabolism, protein synthesis and post translational protein modification and folding, and cell organization were all reduced. Ribosomal composition was also greatly altered in response to infection by CTV-B2/CTV-B6. Genes that were induced were related to cell wall structure, secondary and hormone metabolism, responses to biotic stress, regulation of transcription, signaling, and secondary metabolism. Transport systems dedicated to metal ions were especially disturbed and ZIPs (Zinc Transporter Precursors) showed different expression patterns in response to co-infection by CTV-B2/CTV-B6 and single infection by CTV-B2. Host plants experienced root decline that may have contributed to Zn, Fe, and other nutrient deficiencies. Though defense responses, such as, strengthening of the cell wall, alteration of hormone metabolism, secondary metabolites, and signaling pathways, were activated, these defense responses did not suppress the spread of the pathogens and the development of symptoms. The mild strain CTV-B2 did not provide a useful level of cross-protection to citrus against the severe strain CTV-B6.","['Citrus sinensis', 'Transcriptome', 'Closterovirus', 'defense response', 'Host–pathogen Interaction']","['Figure', 'genes', 'Ten doubly-inoculated', 'Table', 'symptoms Ten', 'genes related', 'metabolism', 'protein', 'expression', 'Genes encoding']","[CTV-B2, CTV-B6, 2–4, CTV-B2/CTV-B6, CTV-B6, CTV-B2, CTV-B6, p23, CTV-B6, CTV-B2 homolog, p23, CTV-B6, p23, RNA-seq, ≤, −2, RNA-seq, rho, CTV-B2/CTV-B6, light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex I subunit A4, PsbP-like protein 1, photosystem I subunit D-1, photosystem II, active14, glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2, 1-aminomutase 2, hydroxymethylbilane synthase, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, coproporphyrinogen oxidase, ribonucleotide reductase 1, rpa70-kda subunit B, histones, H4, ribosomal, 50S, 60S subunits, RPs, cellulose synthase A9, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, expansin-like B3, ABC transporters, sulfate transporter, nitrate transporter, ZIP5, PP2-B13, CTV-B2/CTV-B6, CTV-B2, PP2-B15, CTV-B6, Fu et, terpene synthase 21, auxin F-Box, gibberellin 20-oxidase, Receptor Like Protein 21, acidic endochitinase, CC-NBS-LRR, receptor like protein 1, CSE101, IQ-domain 23, calmodulin, FAR1-related sequence]",['TPS21'],['C.'],[],terpene synthase

No byproducts were observed when analyzed by GC-MS ( Figure   1). To investigate the suitability of both enzymes for monoterpenoid production in engineered  E. coli strains, bLinS and bCinS were inserted in an  E. coli “plug-and-play” monoterpenoid production platform, which consists of two gene modules. 3 The first module (pMVA) contains a hybrid mevalonate (MVA) pathway under regulation of IPTG-inducible promoters, 53 and the second (plasmid series pGPPSmTC/S,  Table S1) comprises a refactored, N-terminally truncated geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) gene from  Abies grandis (AgtrGPPS2) followed by an mTC/S gene (in this case bLinS or bCinS, respectively) under control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Strains containing both the pMVA and pGPPS-bLinS or pGPPS-bCinS plasmids, respectively, were grown in a two-phase shake flask system using glucose as the feedstock and  n-nonane as an organic phase to facilitate product capture. Products accumulated in the organic phase were identified and quantified by GC-MS analysis. Product profiles and titers obtained with bLinS and bCinS were compared with previously obtained profiles using mTC/S enzymes obtained from plants ( Figure   1), i.e. LinS from  Artemisia annua (RLinS_Aa) and CinS from  Salvia fruticosa (CinS_Sf),  Arabidopsis thaliana (CinS_At), and  Citrus unshiu (CinS_Cu). 3 Both bacterial enzymes outperformed the plant enzymes: bLinS produced about 300-fold more linalool than RLinS_Aa (363.3 ± 57.9 versus 1.3 mg L org–1). With bCinS, 1,8-cineole was produced in considerably purer form compared to that produced using the plant enzymes. Strains containing bCinS produced 116.8 ± 36.4 mg L org–1 (96% pure); this compares to 118.2 mg L org–1 (67% pure) for CinS_Sf, 46.6 mg L org–1 (42% pure) for CinS_At, and 18.2 (63% pure) for CinS_Cu for the strains containing the corresponding plant CinS enzymes. As well as GPP formation catalyzed by the heterologous GPPS, the engineered  E. coli strains also produce the sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) from native host encoded enzymes. 54 Strains containing bLinS were able to convert FPP to nerolidol (159.1 ± 7.3 mg L org–1), indicating that bLinS acts as both a monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase. We demonstrated that bLinS makes  R-(−)-linalool and  trans-nerolidol with GPP and FPP, respectively ( Figure S5a–f). In contrast, no sesquiterpene products were detected with  E. coli strains containing bCinS indicating it is restricted to the production of monoterpene products. With each of the strains, geraniol and farnesol (and their derivatives) were detected in organic overlays of cultures alongside the expected terpenoids. An unidentified endogenous  E. coli pathway has previously been shown to convert both GPP and FPP into geraniol and farnesol respectively, 3 which are subsequently converted into oxidative byproducts by endogenous dehydrogenation and isomerization reactions. 55 In particular,  E. coli PhoA phosphatase was implicated in converting GPP to geraniol 56 and two integral membrane phosphatases (PgpB and YbjG) were shown to convert FPP to farnesol. 57 The reported product profiles and yields suggest that bacterial monoterpene synthases are better suited compared to the corresponding plant enzymes for monoterpenoid production using engineered  E. coli strains. Armed with this information we set out to determine the structures of bLinS and bCinS, in both ligand-free and complexed with fluorinated substrate analogues, with the objective of informing on mechanism, and guiding future engineering/exploitation in biocatalysis and metabolic engineering programmes. Structure of the bCinS FNPP Complex Crystals of bCinS were obtained when cocrystallized with 2-fluoro neryl pyrophosphate (FNPP), a fluorinated GPP isomer. Unfortunately, bCinS crystallized poorly when not bound to a substrate analogue. This suggests a conformational change occurs between an open ( apo)-form and a closed (substrate-inhibitor bound) complex similar to that seen with other terpene cyclases. 45,  58 Previous studies have indicated that some terpene cyclases/synthases can also accept neryl pyrophosphate (NPP) as substrate. 16 In the case of bCinS, incubation with NPP also leads to 1,8 cineole ( Figure   1). As observed with other terpene synthases, fluorination of the substrate blocks the key ionization step, blocking diphosphate release and formation of the geranyl/neryl cation. 28 The bCinS-FNPP structure was determined to 1.63 Å and reveals the enzyme is a dimer of a typical class I terpenoid α-helical domain, with the active sites oriented in an antiparallel fashion ( Figure   2a). Analysis of the bCinS dimer revealed a total buried surface area of 4114 Å 2, indicating the oligomeric state is biologically relevant (using PISA 59). Both monomers are similar in structure (rmsd of 0.25 Å over 315 Cα atoms), with residues that constitute one of the loops close to the active site disordered. The bound FNPP is clearly defined in the electron density of both active sites, with no significant differences in conformation between both monomers ( Figure   2b). The pyrophosphate moiety of FNPP makes extensive interactions with residues in the active site, in addition to coordination by two Mg 2+ ions and interactions with several water molecules. While one Mg 2+ is bound by the conserved NSE motif (Mg 2+ B), the other is bound by the aspartate rich motif (Mg 2+ A). No clear density could be observed that corresponds to the location of the third metal ion (Mg 2+ C). EPR Reveals Binding of 3 Mn 2+ Ions to bCinS To ascertain whether bCinS binds to two or three Mg 2+ ions, we employed EPR spectroscopy by titrating bCinS purified in the absence of MgCl 2 with Mn 2+. The Mn 2+ ion serves as a valuable probe of the Mg 2+ ion binding sites. 60−  62 This substitution allowed application of cw-EPR spectroscopy to investigate the number of potential metal binding sites in bCinS. Comparison of the EPR spectra of the aqueous MnCl 2 and bCinS with and without the inhibitor FGPP indicates that the spectrum of the 1:1 bCinS-FGPP:Mn 2+ sample contains a highly resolved multiplet structure ( Figure   3a; red spectrum). This multiplet structure is the 55Mn hyperfine coupling which is due to the interaction of electron spin (S = 5/2) of the Mn 2+ ion with the nuclear spin (I = 5/2) of  55 Mn nucleus. It is a characteristic signature of binding of FGPP to Mn 2+ ion, which is centered at  g ∼ 2.0. This multiplet feature increases in intensity only until the ratio of Mn 2+ ion concentration relative to bCinS-FGPP reaches 3. However, where the relative concentration of Mn 2+ ion is greater than 3, the EPR spectra show overall increase in intensity due to the contribution from free/unbound Mn 2+ ion. The EPR spectrum of the 1:6 bCinS-FGPP:Mn 2+ sample ( Figure   3a; magenta spectrum) can be simulated ( Figure   3a; cyan spectrum) by 1:1 addition of the EPR spectra of 1:3 bCinS-FGPP:Mn 2+ sample with ( Figure   3a; blue spectrum) the 1:3 bCinS:Mn 2+ ( Figure   3a; black spectrum). This indicates that there are 3 potential metal binding sites available in bCinS. Detailed analysis and assignment of the various transitions in the EPR spectra (Figures S6a,b and S7a,b) are provided in the  Supporting Information. Structure of the bCinS-FGPP Complex and bCinS Mechanism Soaking of the bCinS-FNPP crystals with FGPP led to the partial exchange of the inhibitor in both monomers (structure determined to 1.51 Å resolution). Besides the obvious reorientation of the carbon skeleton, the presence of FGPP does not lead to active site reconfiguration. However, the soaking protocol used has led to clear electron density of a partially occupied third Mg 2+ ion (Mg 2+ C;  Figure   4). This in turn is accompanied by a modest change in conformation of the E155 region ( Figure   4a), bringing the E155 side chain into close contact with water molecules ligating Mg 2+ C. Given the partial occupancy of the inhibitors and of the E155/Mg 2+ C, it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the nature of the ligand bound in the active site and the binding of Mg 2+ C. However, as both GPP and NPP act as substrates for bCinS, presumably both requiring binding of three Mg 2+ ions, it seems plausible the soaking procedure used is responsible for the observed changes in the E155 region and the associated Mg 2+ C binding. On the basis of the bCinS-FNPP and bCinsS-FGPP/FNPP structures, a mechanism for the bacterial 1,8-cineole synthesis can be proposed, by analogy to observations made with plant monoterpene synthases 18 ( Figure   5). Unlike FGPP, the carbon chain conformation of FNPP (and by extension the NPP substrate) is compatible with cyclization of the initial carbocation (in this case linalyl) derived from substrate ionization to form the ( R)-terpinyl cation. Indeed, the FNPP C1 and C6 atoms are placed at a distance of ∼3.6 Å. In contrast, steric constraints require the FGPP carbon skeleton to undergo an isomerization step following substrate ionization and geranyl carbocation formation prior to cyclization. For other monoterpene cyclase enzymes, this has been proposed to occur via transient formation of linalyldiphosphate and concomitant change from the transoid to cisoid configuration. 14,  15 A second substrate ionization step then generates the linalyl carbocation species, which can proceed to the cyclization step. The fact that both GPP and NPP result in the same product suggests the exact configuration of the respective linalyl carbocation species (GPP versus NPP derived) and resulting terpinyl carbocation are similar, resembling the carbon chain configuration of the FNPP inhibitor. However, recent solution studies using labeled GPP have suggested bCinS proceeds via the ( S)-terpinyl cation, in contrast to the ( R)-terpinyl configuration proposed on the basis of the bCinS-FNPP crystal structure. 63 Following formation of the terpinyl carbocation, conversion via the final cyclization step to the 1,8-cineol product is proposed to occur via a  syn addition. 63 With the exception of a single water molecule, coordinated by Trp58 and Asn305, the hydrophobic binding pocket is devoid of solvent. This water molecule is placed at a distance of ∼3.6 Å to the C6 of FNPP ( Figure   2c), and thus appears the most likely candidate for nucleophilic attack on the terpinyl cation. MD simulations show that this water molecule remains at an average distance of 3.84 (±0.45 run1, (±0.53 run2) Å from C7 of GPP throughout the 100 ns simulation ( Figure   6). The water molecule interacts with Asn305, but no longer interacts with Trp58.  Figure   6A–C show the different positions of the hydrocarbon tail of GPP and NPP in the representative structure from the dominant cluster for the 100 ns simulations. The hydrocarbon tail of NPP occupies the position adopted by the side chain of Phe77 in the simulations of bCinS with GPP. There are more water molecules near to C7 of NPP and the shortest distance is not with a single water molecule throughout the entire simulation, as was observed for GPP. However, simulations with NPP show that the average position of the water molecule is more distant than in the bCinS/GPP system with an average C7–WAT O distance of 4.26 ± 0.59 Å run1 and 4.42 ± 0.59 Å in run2 ( Figure   6d,e). Formation of the neutral α-terpineol through deprotonation is avoided by the lack of any suitable acid–base group in close proximity of this water molecule. Production of the bicyclic 1,8-cineole from the protonated α-terpineol species is proposed to occur via intramolecular proton transfer to C2, followed by C2–O bond formation leading to formation of the second cycle. Considering the relative position of the water molecule and the C2 atom in the FNPP structure, this scenario will require some conformational changes to occur. This is distinct from the proposed mechanism for the plant 1,8 cineole synthase, for which a  syn addition of water is proposed, requiring no significant conformational changes prior the ensuing heterocyclization step. 64 Structures of  Apo-bLinS and bLinS-FGPP Complex The bLinS could be crystallized in both the  apo form (2.4 Å) as well as in complex with the substrate analogue FGPP (1.82 Å,  Table   1). The bLinS structure reveals a dimer in the asymmetric unit, but the monomer interface is distinct to that observed for the bCinS enzyme ( Figure   7a). The individual bLinS monomers overlay with rmsd of 0.83 Å for 293 Cα atoms, with a small shift in position of the N-terminal region encompassing the first two alpha helices (residues 1–62) located furthest away from the dimer interface. Co-crystallization with FGPP leads to crystals with similar packing. Unexpectedly, clear electron density corresponding to FGPP is only present in monomer A ( Figure   7b). In contrast, electron density occupying the active site of monomer B is weak, and only a single phosphate ion could be modeled that might be associated with a disordered binding of the FGPP diphosphate moiety ( Figure   7c). The FGPP is bound to the bLinS active site of chain A in an extended conformation compared to the FGPP/FNPP configuration observed in the bCinS structures ( Figure   7d). Only one Mg 2+ ion coordinating the pyrophosphate moiety could be unambiguously modeled. This Mg 2+ ion sits on the concave side of the PP i moiety and hydrogen bonds with Asp80 of the aspartate-rich motif in helix D. The direct interactions between the diphosphate moiety of FGPP and bLinS are limited to a polar interaction with Lys225. The hydrophobic moiety of FGPP is located in a predominantly hydrophobic pocket at the core of the bLinS structure, with a polar interaction observed between Asn218 of the Mg 2+ B binding NSE motif and the FGPP fluorine atom. The lack of Mg 2+ binding to the NSE motif, and the unusual position of the diphosphate moiety, suggests the FGPP is bound in a noncatalytic mode. We again used EPR to establish bLinS binds to three Mn 2+ ions (and by extension three Mg 2+) in solution, similar to other terpene synthases ( Figure   3b). While the electron density in the active site of bLinS monomer B corresponds to a disordered species, the position of the single phosphate that is visible is more akin to what can be expected for the catalytic binding mode when superimposing bLinS on the bCinS ligand complex structures ( Figure   7e). The phosphate in the bLinS monomer B establishes a network of polar contacts with the C-terminal region (R308, Y309) that is disordered in the  apo-bLinS structure. It is furthermore positioned adjacent to the NSE motif, although a Mg 2+ B ion could not be unambiguously located in this area. The ordering of the C-terminal region is incompatible with crystal packing for bLinS monomer A, possibly contributing to the noncatalytic conformation observed for the bound FGPP in the corresponding active site. A comparison with the  apo-bLinS structure reveals the overall conformation for both monomers is similar, with the notable exception of the C-terminal region. However, class I terpenoid synthase structures have been found to alternate between an “open” state (i.e.,  apo) and a “closed” (i.e., ligand) bound state 58. 65 This calls into question whether the  apo-bLinS structure is reflective of the open state, or whether the bLinS-FGPP complex corresponds to the closed state. The fact neither of the monomers in the bLinS-FGPP complex binds to the required three metal ions strongly suggests both  apo bLinS and the bLinS-FGPP structures are in the open state, possibly stabilized by crystal packing contacts. MD simulations suggest that, unlike other terpene synthases, neither bLinS nor bCinS undergo major conformational changes to between “open” and “closed” states, ( Figures S8a–c and S9a–c). Although bLinS-FGPP is likely to correspond to the open state, the carbon chain of the bound FGPP (in monomer A) occupies a similar region as observed in the bCinS-FGPP/FNPP complexes ( Figure   7e). This likely indicates the position of the active site hydrophobic pocket in bLinS, and might even reflect the corresponding conformation of carbon chain of the bound FGPP in the closed state. As linalool is an acyclic monoterpene product, the bLinS catalytic mechanism does not require a cyclization process. Instead, the geranyl cation attacks a nearby water molecule leading to linalool following deprotonation ( Figure   8a). In the bLinS-FNPP structure, several water molecules are located within a distance of ∼4.5 Å from the FGPP ( Figure   7d), and representing likely candidates for this process in case the FGPP carbon chain conformation is reflective of the catalytically relevant species. In contrast to the closed nature of the bCinS structure, the bLinS is relatively open, and we cannot rule out further closure might occur upon substrate binding in solution. Keeping this caveat in mind, the most likely candidate for the water attack is the molecule that is coordinated by Asp79 and Arg172 and is at a distance of 3.6 Å from C3 of FGPP. The position of the water molecule with respect to FGPP suggests production of  R-(−)-linalool, which matches with the biochemical characterization. MD simulations show that the closest water molecule to C3 of GPP remains at an average distance of 3.29 (±0.21) Å in run1 and 3.93 (±0.52) Å in run2 ( Figure   8c). MD simulations of bLinS in complex with FPP ( Figure S9), the precursor to sesquiterpenes, shows that the active site is sufficiently large to accommodate a sesquiterpene, explaining the fact bLinS also accepts FPP as a substrate. 23 Bacterial mTC/S Are Structurally Similar to Sesquiterpene Synthases The bLinS and bCinS are single domain (α) enzymes, whereas the plant mTC(S) typically contain two domains (α and β). This makes them structurally more similar to the sesquiterpene synthases ( Figure   9a), which are also usually composed of only a single class I terpenoid fold domain. 10 It is notable that genome mining for bacterial terpene synthase-like genes followed by heterologous expression revealed the majority of these enzymes made sesquiterpenes as products. 20 So far, bLinS and bCinS are the only characterized bacterial mTC(S) that accept GPP as substrate and thus lead to monoterpene formation. The bCinS-FNPP complex is specifically compared to the structures of plant limonene synthases 15,  16 and bornyl diphosphate synthase 14 for which complexes with the substrate analogues are available. When comparing the corresponding C-terminal catalytic domains with the bCinS complexes, it is clear that the orientation of GPP/NPP analogue in bCinS is such that the beta phosphate occupies the location comparable to the alpha phosphate binding site in the plant enzymes and  vice versa, and resembles the orientation observed in sesquiterpene synthase complex. For the functionally analogous plant 1,8-cineole synthase (Sf-CinS1), only the apoenzyme structure is available. Furthermore, superimposition of the bCinS and Sf-CinS1 reveals distinct active site architectures. In Sf-CinS1, Asn338, which coordinates a water molecule, was found to be crucial for the synthesis of 1,8-cineole. 18 Mutation of Asn338 to Ile resulted in the formation of sabinene as the major product but no α-terpineol and 1,8-cineole, establishing the role of Asn338 in water capture. In bCinS, as mentioned before, residues Trp58 and Asn305 coordinate the water molecule proposed to be involved in the water attack. Though Asn305 in bCinS resides in a different helix and region of the active site compared to Asn338 in Sf-CinS1, Asn305 might play a similar role to that proposed for the plant enzyme ( Figure S10). Analysis using DALI 66 and PDBefold 67 servers showed many sesquiterpene synthases including pentalenene synthase (PDB 1 ps1), 32 germacradienol synthase (PDB 5i1u), 68 hedycaryol synthase (PDB 4mc3), 69 geosmin synthase (PDB 5dz2), 70 epi-isozizaene synthase (PDB 4ltv), 65 selinadiene synthase (40kz), 58 and aristolochene synthase (PDB 4kwd) 51 are very similar to bLinS and bCinS structures ( Table S2). Two sesquiterpene synthase structures have been reported in complex with substrate analogues:  Aspergillus terreus aristocholene synthase (ATAS) with farnesyl thiolodiphosphate (FSPP; PDB 4KUX) and selinadiene synthase (SdS) with dihydrofarnesyl diphosphate (DHFPP; PDB 4OKZ). A comparison of these structures with bLinS and bCinS might allow pinpointing of those active site differences that play a role in determining substrate specificity (C 10 versus C 15). Since the Mg 2+ and pyrophosphate binding regions are highly conserved, most variations in the active site architecture are restricted to hydrophobic cavity surrounding the substrate carbon chain. In bCinS, two phenylalanines (Phe 77 and Phe 179) constrict the substrate-binding site when compared to the ATAS-FSPP and SdS-DHFPP structures, and they would clash with a putative FPP substrate ( Figure   9b). Phe179 resides in the kink region of the helix G1/2 of bCinS, and is replaced by Gly174 in ATAS and Ala183 in SdS. The bCinS Phe77 resides in helix D and is homologous to Leu80 in ATAS/Leu78 in SdS, with the latter both adopting a conformation that is pointing away from the active site. This suggests bCinS evolved from a sesquiterpene synthase by restricting active site volume. Interestingly, bLinS contains nonaromatic residues at positions equivalent to bCinS Phe77 and Phe179 (Thr75 and Cys177 in bLinS), and thus resembles ATAS and SdS ( Figure   9c). This provides a rationale for the fact bLinS can accept both GPP and FPP as substrates but bCinS can only convert GPP. 22,  23","Terpenoids form the largest and stereochemically most diverse class of natural products, and there is considerable interest in producing these by biocatalysis with whole cells or purified enzymes, and by metabolic engineering. The monoterpenes are an important class of terpenes and are industrially important as flavors and fragrances. We report here structures for the recently discovered  Streptomyces clavuligerus  monoterpene synthases linalool synthase (bLinS) and 1,8-cineole synthase (bCinS), and we show that these are active biocatalysts for monoterpene production using biocatalysis and metabolic engineering platforms. In metabolically engineered monoterpene-producing  E. coli  strains, use of bLinS leads to 300-fold higher linalool production compared with the corresponding plant monoterpene synthase. With bCinS, 1,8-cineole is produced with 96% purity compared to 67% from plant species. Structures of bLinS and bCinS, and their complexes with fluorinated substrate analogues, show that these bacterial monoterpene synthases are similar to previously characterized sesquiterpene synthases. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that these monoterpene synthases do not undergo large-scale conformational changes during the reaction cycle, making them attractive targets for structured-based protein engineering to expand the catalytic scope of these enzymes toward alternative monoterpene scaffolds. Comparison of the bLinS and bCinS structures indicates how their active sites steer reactive carbocation intermediates to the desired acyclic linalool (bLinS) or bicyclic 1,8-cineole (bCinS) products.

We explore here formation of early Michaelis complexes of the (+)-limonene synthase [(+)-LS] from Citrus sinensis using monofluorinated substrate analogues 2-fluoro-GPP (FGPP) and 2-fluoroneryl diphosphate (FNPP). Both are competitive inhibitors for (+)-LS with K I  values of 2.4 ± 0.5 and 39.5 ± 5.2 μM, respectively. The K I  values are similar to the K M  for the respective nonfluorinated substrates, indicating that fluorine does not significantly perturb binding of the ligand to the enzyme. FGPP and FNPP are also substrates, but with dramatically reduced rates (k cat  values of 0.00054 ± 0.00005 and 0.00024 ± 0.00002 s -1 , respectively). These data are consistent with a stepwise mechanism for (+)-LS involving ionization of the allylic GPP substrate to generate a resonance-stabilized carbenium ion in the rate-limiting step. Crystals of apo-(+)-LS were soaked with FGPP and FNPP to obtain X-ray structures at 2.4 and 2.2 Å resolution, respectively. The fluorinated analogues are found anchored in the active site through extensive interactions involving the diphosphate, three metal ions, and three active-site Asp residues. Electron density for the carbon chains extends deep into a hydrophobic pocket, while the enzyme remains mostly in the open conformation observed for the apoprotein. While FNPP was found in multiple conformations, FGPP, importantly, was in a single, relatively well-defined, left-handed screw conformation, consistent with predictions for the mechanism of stereoselectivity in the monoterpene synthases.",NaN,[],[],[],[],[],NaN
56,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5684173\eupmc_result.json,PMC5684173,"Results Identification, semi-quantitation and genome-wide association of volatiles in leaves and roots The isolation and separation of VOCs from the two plant organs, leaves and roots, were done by headspace SPME-GC. A full multi-compound quantitation using the SPME technique is impossible in complex organic matrices like homogenates of carrot leaves and roots (Schieberle and Molyneux,  2012) and in addition not essential for the aim of this research. Therefore, the data are given as semi-quantitative, relative concentrations (peak areas in counts). The information for phenotyping is contained in the data differences or standardized values for the individual compounds. Table  1 lists the 31 VOCs which were measured either in roots or leaves, or which were identified in both organs. The phenotypic variability of terpene contents among the 85 carrot accessions is shown in Figure  1. The quantitation of the identified terpene volatiles in each carrot accession is presented in Supplementary Table  4. These VOCs belong to the chemical classes of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and several different terpene-derivatives such as terpene alcohols. In leaves 26 out of these 31 VOCs were identified, while only 20 VOCs were identified in roots. Altogether 15 VOCs were identified and semi-quantified in both organs, but also large qualitative differences were found (11 compounds are unique for leaves and also 5 compounds for roots). The quantitative range of the VOC variation in the carrot collection is tremendous. The mean quantitative level of the data (relative concentrations) differs between leaves and roots as a result of the different sample preparations protocols used (mean value 2,542.79 vs. 6,232.39, Supplementary Table  4). The most abundant compounds in the chromatograms are β-myrcene, β-caryophyllene and germacrene D in leaves and terpinolene, β-caryophyllene and bornyl acetate in roots. Noticeable are the differences between the samples with the maximum and minimum total level of volatiles which are the samples 07 (Purple Haze) and 47 (Nana W 561) (5,930.51 vs. 951.10) in leaves and 55 (Purple Stem Selection) and 50 (Stratova) (28,712.74 vs. 982.35) in roots (Supplementary Table  4). These are factors of 6.2 for leaves and 29.2 for roots, respectively. Supplementary Table  5 shows the results of a correlation analysis of 15 VOCs which are identified in both organs. Five of the compounds (sabinene, β-caryophyllene, ocimene, a-pinene and terpinen-4-ol) show correlations which are significant at a level of  p < 0.05. This is in accordance with earlier results for sabinene and β-caryophyllene (Ulrich et al.,  2015), the substances with the highest correlation between leaves and roots. Genotyping of the 85 genotypes and data pre-processing resulted in a dataset of 281,394 bi-allelic SNP markers. In total, 112,731 markers were excluded from further analyses, due to minor allele frequency < 5% (106,581 markers) or heterozygosity > 90% (6,150 markers). The remaining 168,663 polymorphic and high-quality markers were used to calculate kinship matrix. Based on these data GWAS was implemented. Compressed mixed linear model approach in GAPIT (Lipka et al.,  2012; R Core Team,  2014) with K-matrix as correction for relatedness was conducted and resulted in the identification of 25 and 9 marker trait associations (MTAs) significantly (LOD ≥ 5.91) associated with 11 and 6 VOCs in roots and leaves, respectively (Supplementary Table  6). These significantly associated MTAs were assigned to 21 and 9 QTL regions, respectively (Table  2). The QTL regions are distributed over the whole genome, whereby the majority of QTLs for VOCs were detected on chromosome 7, 8, and 9 in roots and on chromosome 7 in leaves (Table  2). The number of significantly associated markers per QTL region ranged between 1 and 3 (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  6). Most QTLs were detected for the monoterpene compounds ocimene, sabinene, β-pinene, borneol and bornyl acetate.  QTL_r_SABI_4.1 and  QTL_r_TERPol_4, QTL_r_BORNAc_5.1 and QTL_r_BORN_5.1 or QTL_r_BORNAc_5.2 and QTL_r_BORN_5.2 are located in the same chromosomal region, respectively (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  6). The volatile compounds borneol (BORN) and bornyl acetate (BORNAc) showed significantly associated MTAs for both roots and leaves; however detected QTL regions are not identical. For all other VOCs significantly associated MTAs were only detected either for roots or leaves. The TPS gene family in  D. carota Bioinformatic searches of the assembled carrot whole genome sequence (Iorizzo et al.,  2016) with the homology-based gene prediction program GeMoMa (Keilwagen et al.,  2016) and subsequent manual curation and evaluation of transcript predictions identified a total number of 65 TPS candidate gene models in carrot (Table  3, Supplementary Material  1). These 65 TPS gene models do not contain obvious pseudo-genes, since all start with correct start codon, have no frame-shift or internal stop codon, and end with a stop codon. Based on the transcript intron evidence (tie) obtained from GeMoMa using RNA-seq data, the predictions were split in 49 conservative genes with tie ≥ 0.8 and 16 putative genes with tie < 0.8. Comparing the predictions with the annotation (Iorizzo et al.,  2016), only 32 have a partial overlap with some annotated transcripts, while 33 do not overlap with any annotation (Table  3). Only 3 out of these 32 overlapping predictions are identical with the annotated transcript ( DcTPS01, DcTPS02, DcTPS29). The remaining 29 predictions show diverse deviations compared to the annotation—often with additional exons. This might be a reason why these transcripts have not been identified as TPS before. Utilizing RNA-seq data (Iorizzo et al.,  2016), we determined the expression profile of these 65 TPS candidate gene models (Supplementary Table  2) and found diverse patterns of expression within the 20 RNA-seq samples (Supplementary Figure  1). For instance,  DcTPS28 shows stable expression over all 20 samples, whereas  DcTPS03, DcTPS21, and  DcTPS37 show mainly specific expression for stressed whole storage root, opened whole flowers, and germinating seed at the beginning of germination.  DcTPS11 appears to be the gene with the strongest expression of all carrot TPS candidates. Only two genes ( DcTPS51 and  DcTPS64) didn't show any transcriptional activity in all 20 transcriptomes. The 65 TPS candidate genes comprise the previously published sesquiterpene synthase gene  DcTPS1 ( DcTPS01), the monoterpene synthase gene  DcTPS2 ( DcTPS02) and four additional full-length EST contigs (Yahyaa et al.,  2015). The four ESTs have been preliminary named by their contig number (Yahyaa et al.,  2015), however, we propose the gene names  DcTPS03, DcTPS05, DcTPS06, DcTPS07 (Table  3). Based on their sequence similarity to representative TPS from other plant species, the 65 candidate  DcTPS sequences represent six of the eight plant TPS subfamilies (Table  3, Supplementary Table  7). Phylogenetic analysis of the carrot TPS genes indicates that 22 belong to the TPS-a subfamily which contains predominantly sesquiterpene synthases (Figure  2). A total of 32 genes were found to belong to the TPS-b subfamily of angiosperm monoterpene synthases, and five genes were identified representing the TPS-g subfamily. Another three genes are assigned to subgroup TPS-c, two genes are in TPS-e, and a single TPS gene ( DcTPS29) was assigned to subfamily TPS-f. The only subgroups with no representative carrot genes were, as expected, the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily and TPS-h, which is specific to  S. moellendorffii. The (sub-)classification of DcTPS genes was supported by their alignment with TPS genes identified and characterized in the  Eucalyptus grandis genome (Külheim et al.,  2015) and, concerning the TPSs of subfamilies TPS-c, TPS-e and TPS-f, also with selected TPS genes from  A. thaliana and  Populus trichocarpa used also by Külheim et al. ( 2015) for phylogenetic analyses (Supplementary Figure  2). The prediction as TPS candidate gene required a TPS open reading frame (ORF) to be of the expected size and that it displays typical structural characteristics such as the intron-exon structure (i.e., generally seven exons for genes of subfamilies TPS-a, TPS-b and TPS-g) and the presence of conserved C-terminal domains such as the Mg 2+ -binding DDXXD and the NSE/DTE motifs. As shown in Supplementary Table  7, most putative sesquiterpene synthases (TPS-a) have a length of about 540–560 amino acids. More than 20 out of 32 putative monoterpene synthases of subfamily TPS-b are longer than 580 amino acids. This was expected because these proteins are most likely targeted to the plastids due to the presence of a N-terminal transit peptide. All but six of the  Daucus TPS genes of the subfamilies TPS-a, TPS-b and TPS-g contain seven coding exons (Supplementary Table  7), whereas for the remaining genes 8 exons were predicted. The six genes of the subfamilies TPS-c, TPS-e and TPS-f are characterized by longer sequences and consist of 12–15 exons. Almost all carrot TPS candidate genes showed the sequence motifs characteristic of TPSs, notably the double arginine motif RRX 8W which is present in most members of subfamilies TPS-a and TPS-b but completely missing in the remaining subfamilies (Supplementary Table  7, Supplementary Figure  3). This motif is known to be involved in producing cyclic monoterpenes and is absent in TPSs that produce acyclic products (Chen et al.,  2011). Especially the TPS-g subfamily contains synthases for acyclic monoterpenes known to be involved in floral scent (Dudareva et al.,  2003). The three TPS-c genes did also not show the two highly conserved C-terminal motifs (DDXXD, NSE/DTE). However, these motifs appeared to be present in all other TPS subfamilies, with a single exception ( DcTPS64). The majority of carrot TPS genes, i.e., the members of subfamilies TPS-a, TPs-b and TPS-g may function as enzymes involved in volatile terpene production. NCBI BlastP searches showed that members of subfamilies TPS-c ( DcTPS25, DcTPS57, DcTPS59) and TPS-e ( DcTPS28, DcTPS56) have a predicted putative function as ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase or ent-kaurene synthase and are probably involved in biosynthesis of plant hormone (gibberellin) precursors. The putative function of the single TPS-f gene  DcTPS29 was predicted as a nerolidol-geranyl linalool synthase. When the candidate gene  DcTPS16 was compared with known TPSs of the  Eucalyptus grandis genome, we found an assignment to the subfamily TPS-b2 (Supplementary Figure  2). TPS-b2 was reported to contain putative isoprene/ocimene synthases (Külheim et al.,  2015). The predicted function of  DcTPS16 as a putative isoprene synthase was also indicated by a NCBI BlastP search (data not shown). As demonstrated by Sharkey et al. ( 2012) isoprene synthase genes form a monophyletic clade of acyclic TPSs in the TPS-b subfamily. The chromosomal positions of the carrot TPS genes were identified for 64 out of the 65 genes on the nine assembled carrot chromosome sequences (Table  3, Figure  3). Only a single gene ( DcTPS16) was not linked to the nine carrot chromosomes based on the carrot whole genome sequence. Large differences were found for the number of genes per chromosome. Chromosome 3 comprises 14 TPS genes, whereas chromosome 6 contains a single TPS gene ( DcTPS01). A majority of the TPS genes were found to co-locate on the same chromosomal genomic region. The largest clusters of TPS sequences were found on chromosome 4 (five genes spanning around 100 kb) and chromosome 9 (six genes spanning about 200 kb, see Table  3, Figure  3). In addition, on chromosome 1 six genes occurred in the region around 45 Mbp. Together with a TPS cluster of 4 genes, on chromosome 3 a total number of 10 TPS genes were located at the end of the assembled pseudomolecule. The large cluster on chromosome 9 contains 6 TPS genes ( DcTPS36, DcTPS35, DcTPS63, DcTPS64, DcTPS07, and  DcTPS34) all encoding putative sesquiterpene synthases (TPS-a subfamily). The second-largest cluster on chromosome 4 (with the 5 genes  DcTPS26, DcTPS04, DcTPS54, DcTPS55, and  DcTPS27) contains only mono-TPS genes, and the cluster on chromosome 3 ( DcTPS51, DcTPS05, DcTPS12, DcTPS18) contains also 4 TPS-b genes. The similarity of the sequences of clustered genes is also reflected by their positions in the phylogenetic tree (Figure  2) and suggests the occurrence of multiple gene duplications. Candidate gene analysis Chromosomal start and end positions of the QTL intervals were utilized to compare the QTL regions detected via GWAS in the first subsection with the chromosomal position of TPS candidate genes described in the previous subsection. In total, only 4 out of 30 QTL regions comprise TPS candidate genes. In roots, 6 TPS candidate genes are located in 3 QTL regions, whereas 1 TPS candidate gene is located in 1 QTL region in leaves (Table  4). The number of TPS candidate genes per QTL regions varies between 1 and 5.  QTL_r_SABI_4.1 and  QTL_r_TERPol_4 are located in the same chromosomal region and therefore associated with the same TPS candidate gene cluster ( DcTPS04, DcTPS26, DcTPS27, DcTPS54, and  DcTPS55) on chromosome 4. The example of sabinene (SABI) illustrates that it was possible to identify QTL regions which are associated with TPS candidate genes ( QTL_r_SABI_4.1) as well as QTL regions which carry no TPS candidate genes ( QTL_r_SABI_4.2, QTL_r_SABI_7) (Figure  4). Hence, Dcarota v2.0 gene annotation (Iorizzo et al.,  2016) and the homology-based reannotation (cf. Methods, Supplementary Material  1) were scanned for all genes located within the QTL regions (Supplementary Table  8). Based on this analysis each QTL region comprises at least 9 genes. Focusing on the cytochrome P450 gene family, which is known to modify terpenes, the genes located within the QTL regions were filtered yielding between 0 and 13 cytochrome P450 genes per QTL region (Supplementary Table  8). In total, 14 (Dcarota v2.0 gene annotation) or 13 (homology-based reannotation) out of 30 QTL regions comprise TPS or cytochrome P450 candidate genes, respectively. To verify predicted gene models and to examine the putative roles of carrot TPS genes in terpene volatile production, we investigated the expression patterns in leaves and roots of three differently colored cultivars. For this approach, specific PCR primers were developed based on the CDS of seven TPS gene models which have been associated by GWAS to QTL regions (Table  4) and for 5 additionally selected TPS candidate genes representing subfamilies TPS-a ( DcTPS11, DcTPS38), TPS-b ( DcTPS05, DcTPS12) and TPS-g ( DcTPS60). As reference genes for semiquantitative RT-PCR, β -actin and  elongation factor 1α ( EF1α) were used. The totally 12 DcTPS genes were amplified by RT-PCR and studied for differential expression (Supplementary Figure  4). Sequencing of the PCR main products (with the expected fragment size) confirmed the amplification of the right TPS gene (not shown).  DcTPS04, DcTPS05, and  DcTPS11 seemed to be strongly transcribed in all tested samples. This is in accordance with the expression data, where especially  DcTPS04 and  DcTPS11 showed strong expression in most RNA-seq samples (see Supplementary Table  2). For some genes, such as for instance  DcTPS03 or  DcTPS38 we found some indications, that root tissues have a stronger transcriptional activity than leaves. Interestingly,  DcTPS03 has shown a strong expression in a single transcriptome only (stressed root, Supplementary Table  2) suggesting that this gene might be involved in inducible responses such as resistance to abiotic or biotic stress, but might be stronger expressed due to the general stress induced by the harvest process. TPS genes that were exclusively expressed in leaves or roots were not found. Differences among the cultivars were also less expressed although roots of cv. Blanche showed slightly stronger expression in some genes ( DcTPS27, DcTPS38). In some cases no transcriptional activity was observed, even after repetition, in a single sample, as for instance for the genes  DcTPS54 (Rotin, leaves) or  DcTPS55 (Rotin, roots).","Terpenes are an important group of secondary metabolites in carrots influencing taste and flavor, and some of them might also play a role as bioactive substances with an impact on human physiology and health. Understanding the genetic and molecular basis of terpene synthases (TPS) involved in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids will provide insights for improving breeding strategies aimed at quality traits and for developing specific carrot chemotypes possibly useful for pharmaceutical applications. Hence, a combination of terpene metabolite profiling, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), and genome-wide association study (GWAS) was used in this work to get insights into the genetic control of terpene biosynthesis in carrots and to identify several TPS candidate genes that might be involved in the production of specific monoterpenes. In a panel of 85 carrot cultivars and accessions, metabolite profiling was used to identify 31 terpenoid volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in carrot leaves and roots, and a GBS approach was used to provide dense genome-wide marker coverage (>168,000 SNPs). Based on this data, a total of 30 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) was identified for 15 terpenoid volatiles. Most QTLs were detected for the monoterpene compounds ocimene, sabinene, β-pinene, borneol and bornyl acetate. We identified four genomic regions on three different carrot chromosomes by GWAS which are both associated with high significance (LOD ≥ 5.91) to distinct monoterpenes and to TPS candidate genes, which have been identified by homology-based gene prediction utilizing RNA-seq data. In total, 65 TPS candidate gene models in carrot were identified and assigned to known plant TPS subfamilies with the exception of TPS-d and TPS-h. TPS-b was identified as largest subfamily with 32 TPS candidate genes.","['Daucus carota', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'GC-MS', 'Monoterpenes', 'Genome-wide Association Study (Gwas)', 'Genotyping-by-sequencing (Gbs)', 'Homology-based Gene Prediction', 'Terpene Synthase (Tps) Gene']","['Supplementary Table', 'TPS genes', 'TPS', 'TPS candidate', 'Table', 'genes', 'QTL regions', 'TPS gene', 'QTL', 'Supplementary']","[terpene-derivatives, 2,542.79, 6,232.39, β-caryophyllene, 982.35, β-caryophyllene (Ulrich et al., 281,394, 168,663, 9, ≥, QTL_r_BORNAc_5.1, QTL_r_BORN_5.1, QTL_r_BORNAc_5.2, QTL_r_BORN_5.2, BORNAc, GeMoMa, GeMoMa, RNA-seq, ≥, DcTPS01, DcTPS02, DcTPS29, RNA-seq, DcTPS21, DcTPS51, DcTPS01, DcTPS02, Yahyaa, ESTs, Yahyaa, DcTPS05, DcTPS06, DcTPS07 (, TPS-e, TPS-h, DcTPS, Külheim, TPS-e, TPS-f, Külheim, Mg 2+ -binding DDXXD, 540–560 amino acids, TPS-e, 12–15, TPS-b, TPs-b, TPS-g, DcTPS57, TPS-e (, DcTPS28, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, ent-kaurene synthase, gibberellin), nerolidol-geranyl linalool, TPS-b2, TPS-b2, Külheim, chromosome 9, DcTPS35, DcTPS63, DcTPS64, DcTPS07, DcTPS04, DcTPS54, DcTPS55, DcTPS05, DcTPS12, DcTPS18, DcTPS04, DcTPS26, DcTPS27, DcTPS54, QTL_r_SABI_4.2, Dcarota v2.0, cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450, DcTPS11, DcTPS38, TPS-b ( DcTPS05, DcTPS12, DcTPS60, β -actin, factor 1α, DcTPS05, RNA-seq]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS01,', 'DcTPS02,', 'DcTPS29).', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS28', 'DcTPS03,', 'DcTPS21,', 'DcTPS37', 'DcTPS11', 'TPS', 'DcTPS51', 'DcTPS64)', 'TPS', 'DcTPS1', 'DcTPS01),', 'DcTPS2', 'DcTPS02)', 'DcTPS03,', 'DcTPS05,', 'DcTPS06,', 'DcTPS07', 'TPS', 'DcTPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS-e,', 'TPS', 'DcTPS29)', 'TPS-f.', 'TPS-d', 'TPS-h,', 'DcTPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS-e', 'TPS-f,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g)', '(TPS-a)', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS-e', 'TPS-f', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPSs', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-c', 'TPS', 'DcTPS64).', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-c', 'DcTPS25,', 'DcTPS57,', 'DcTPS59)', 'TPS-e', 'DcTPS28,', 'DcTPS56)', 'TPS-f', 'DcTPS29', 'DcTPS16', 'TPSs', 'TPS-b2', 'TPS-b2', 'DcTPS16', 'TPSs', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'DcTPS16)', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS01).', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS36,', 'DcTPS35,', 'DcTPS63,', 'DcTPS64,', 'DcTPS07,', 'DcTPS34)', '(TPS-a', 'DcTPS26,', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS54,', 'DcTPS55,', 'DcTPS27)', 'mono-TPS', 'DcTPS51,', 'DcTPS05,', 'DcTPS12,', 'DcTPS18)', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS26,', 'DcTPS27,', 'DcTPS54,', 'DcTPS55)', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'DcTPS11,', 'DcTPS38),', 'TPS-b', 'DcTPS05,', 'DcTPS12)', 'TPS-g', 'DcTPS60).', 'DcTPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS05,', 'DcTPS11', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS11', 'DcTPS03', 'DcTPS38', 'DcTPS03', 'TPS', 'DcTPS27,', 'DcTPS38).', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55']",['SPME-GC.'],[],terpene synthase

We then analyzed the volatile composition of the essential oils from 13 previously published  Vitex species, as well as the four  Vitex species studied here, three of them endemic to Brazil ( V. capitata, V. gardneriana and  V. rufescens) via a clustering algorithm ( Figure   2). The 17 species comparison showed strong similarities in the production of some monoterpenes, but varied by their production of larger terpenes, especially those with gem-dimethylcyclopropyl subunits on seven-member ring compounds. The 14 ISSR primers generated a total of 90 fragments, 100% of which were polymorphic. The primer with the highest number of fragments was 857 (eleven), while the lowest were 845 and 888 (two). The values of PIC and MI are parameters that allow for estimation of the power of discrimination of the molecular marker by a primer; in our results, the primers 842 and 818 were the most informative ( Table   1). We observed only fragments to  V. capitata for primer 823. Genotypes were clustered by UPGMA using the Jaccard coefficient (JC), estimated from the binary data ( Figure   3). The similarity mean was 0.21 JC (0.08 – 0.45 JC). We observed a clear separation of two groups, with  V. gardneriana being the most isolated of the four species. In our study, ISSR fingerprints clearly distinguished all of the tested species, with cluster results similar to those performed for the chemical compounds ( Figure   2). In the biotoxicity assays, the essential oil extracted from  V. gardneriana was highly toxic to  A. guerreronis (LC 50 0.8577 mg/mL; CI 0.67-1.15;  x  2 = 3.17, df = 2, P = 0.20). In contrast, it was not possible to estimate the LC 50 from  V. capitata, V. megapotamica and  V. rufescens essential oils, as increasing concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.8, 2.0, and 2.3 mg/mL) of these oils did not kill adults of  A. guerreronis over a period of 24 h. As a way of toxicity comparison, the acaricide abamectin, sprayed at its label rate, inflicted 100% mortality to  A. guerreronis.","The Vitex genus (Lamiaceae) produces a plethora of metabolites that include ecdysteroids and terpenoids, some of which have demonstrated insect repellent properties. The volatile composition of several members of this genus has not been chemically defined, as many taxa are endemic to remote ecosystems. In this study, leaves were collected from the northeast of Brazil from Vitex capitata, V. megapotamica, V. gardneriana, and V. rufescens plants and examined for their chemical profile via GC-MS/FID of essential oil extracts. The analyses showed a diversity of terpenoids. Of particular note were seven-member ring sesquiterpenes which were present in great abundance; a dendrogram showed clades separating by the production of bicyclogermacrene, aromadendrane and 5,10-cycloaromadendrane sesquiterpenoids for the four species. Comparison of volatile metabolite profiles to 13 other Vitex species showed strong similarities in the production of some monoterpenes, but varied by their production of larger terpenes, especially those with gem-dimethylcyclopropyl subunits on seven-member ring compounds. From this work, we suggest that the sesquiterpene skeleton with seven member rings is a good chemosystematic biomarker candidate for the Vitex genus. Separation using this biomarker was then validated using Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat profiling. Lastly, experiments examining the toxicity of these four oils against the coconut mite Aceria guerreronis showed that only the oil of V. gardneriana had strong acaricidal activity, with an LC50 of 0.85 mg/mL, thus demonstrating its potential for use as a natural pesticide.","['Chemodiversity', 'Vitex Capitata', 'Vitex Megapotamica', 'Vitex Gardneriana', 'Vitex Rufescens']","['FID analysis', 'Vitex species', 'Figure', 'essential oils', 'species', 'FID', 'oils collected', 'seven-member ring', 'Results GC-MS', 'capitata']","[5,1-cycloaromadendrane sesquiterpenoids, gem-dimethylcyclopropyl subunits, UPGMA, LC]",[],[],[],NaN
58,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5701163\eupmc_result.json,PMC5701163,"Results Ozone effects on chemical parameters Changes in chemical parameters of Moscato bianco grapes were found at different stages of postharvest dehydration in ozone-enriched atmosphere (OZ)  versus air (AR) (Table  1). A significant effect of ozone treatment was observed on glucose, fructose and glycerol when berries were dehydrated until reaching 10 and 20% of weight loss (P10 and P20, respectively), increasing their contents in relation to air-treated grapes. However, the contents of glucose, fructose and glycerol were significantly lower for ozone-treated grapes at a dehydration of 30% (P30). As dehydration progressed, the contents of glucose and fructose increased for both air and ozone treatments. With the exception of P20, the air-treated samples also showed an increasing accumulation of glycerol, reaching the maximum content at P30. However, the trend was not evident for ozone-treated grapes, for which glycerol decreased at P15 and P30.  Regarding acids, titratable acidity decreased significantly in grape berries dehydrated in ozone enriched atmosphere at P10 but increased in those dehydrated at P15 when compared with air atmosphere. These differences are directly related with the content of malic acid. Tartaric acid showed an increased content in ozone-treated grapes  versus air at P10. However, a significant decrease was observed in the content of citric acid when grapes were dehydrated at P15 and P30 in the presence of ozone. During dehydration, the trend depended on each acid, tartaric acid contents decreased in grapes dehydrated under air and ozone-enriched atmosphere but citric acid increased reaching the maximum content at P30. No evident trend was observed for malic acid. Ozone effects on total VOCs The changes in total contents of volatile compounds, terpenes, alcohols and aldehydes for Moscato bianco grapes at different levels of dehydration in ozone enriched atmosphere  versus air (control) are shown in Fig.  1. At P20 and P30, a significantly higher content of total volatile compounds was observed in ozone-treated samples. This increase at P30 was due to the higher contents of terpenes, alcohols, and aldehydes, whereas the berries dehydrated at P20 in ozone enriched atmosphere were significantly richer only in alcohols. It is important to take into account that the alcohols and aldehydes were more abundant in ozone-treated berries from the first stages of the postharvest dehydration process, but this trend was not observed for terpenes until P20. In fact, total alcohols exhibited a significantly higher content at P5 in ozone enriched atmosphere in relation to control samples.  The free and bound fractions of VOCs showed different behavior when ozone was applied during dehydration of Moscato bianco grapes, as detailed below. Free volatile compounds Table  2 shows the content of free volatile compounds found in Moscato bianco grapes at different stages of dehydration in ozone enriched atmosphere  versus air. A total of 33 volatile compounds were identified and quantified (18 terpenes, 9 alcohols, and 6 aldehydes).  Total free terpenes showed a decreasing trend during dehydration for both treatments (air and ozone), although the minimum content was found at P15. However, total free alcohols and aldehydes showed an opposite behavior because they increased at the end of the dehydration process reaching the maximum contents at P30 for air- and ozone-treated grapes. Higher contents of total free alcohols and aldehydes were observed in grapes dehydrated under ozone-enriched atmosphere from P20 than in fresh grapes. Therefore, the ozone treatment appears to accelerate this increasing trend. A significant effect of ozone treatment was observed for total free terpenes, alcohols and aldehydes at P30, increasing their contents with respect to untreated samples (air treatment). Terpenes showed significant differences at lower dehydration of grapes (P5) where the ozone treatment (P5-OZ) caused a decrease of total content of free terpenes  versus air treatment (P5-AR). In the early stages of dehydration (P10), ozone also caused a significant decrease of total content of free alcohols, but it induced an increased content at P20 and P30  versus air. The most abundant free volatile compounds were C 6-aldehydes, in particular hexanal and ( E)-2-hexenal, in all stages of dehydration in ozone and air atmosphere. These compounds only showed significant differences among the two treatments at P30. At which time increased contents of free hexanal and ( E)-2-hexenal were found in ozone-treated samples. Hexanol and ( Z)-3-hexen-1-ol were the predominant free C 6-alcohols. Their contents were negatively influenced by the ozone treatment at the beginning of dehydration (P5 for hexanol, P10 for ( Z)-3-hexen-1-ol), but they increased significantly at the last stages of dehydration (P30 for hexanol, P20 and P30 for ( Z)-3-hexen-1-ol) as occurred for aldehydes. Other free alcohols, ( E)-3-hexen-1-ol, benzyl alcohol and octanol, increased their contents at P20 in ozone enriched atmosphere, and also octanol at P30. Among free terpenes, linalool, geraniol and nerol were the most abundant compounds in Moscato bianco grapes at all levels of dehydration in both ozone and air treatments. Although the berries dehydrated in ozone enriched atmosphere at P5 showed significantly lower contents for most of free terpenes detected (15 from 18), the trend began to change at P20. Ozone induced a higher accumulation of specific compounds (9 from 18)  versus air at P20 or P30. Moreover, ozone-treated berries showed an increased content of linalool at the end of dehydration (P30) in relation to untreated berries and the same behavior was observed for geraniol and nerol from 20% of weight loss (P20 and P30). Glycosylated volatile compounds Table  3 shows the glycosidically-bound volatile composition of Moscato bianco grapes at different stages of dehydration in ozone enriched atmosphere  versus air. A total of 32 compounds were quantified, which were grouped in 18 terpenes, 10 alcohols, and 4 aldehydes.  In contrast to total free compounds, an increasing trend of total bound terpenes was observed during dehydration for air- and ozone-treated grapes and the maximum contents were found at P30. Total bound alcohols and aldehydes also increased during dehydration. Significant differences were found in total content of glycosylated terpenes in grapes dehydrated at P30 in ozone  versus air. However, the differences in total content of glycosylated alcohols and aldehydes were observed at P5. In either case, ozone promoted the increase of glycosylated volatile compounds. The predominant glycosylated volatile compounds were terpenes, in particular linalool, geraniol and nerol, at all levels of dehydration in both ozone and air treatments. Berries dehydrated at P5 in ozone enriched atmosphere showed a significant decrease of the contents of a few non-major glycosylated terpenes quantified (5 from 18) in relation to air. Glycosylated linalool and geraniol were significantly affected by the ozone treatment at P30, increasing their contents  versus control samples. Ozone influenced positively nerol by increasing its content at P20 and P30, but the differences were not significant when compared with untreated berries. The ozone presence also induced a significant increase of the content of other bound terpenes (( Z)-ocimene, β-phellandrene, and D-limonene) at P30. It is important to take into account that the ozone treatment makes it possible to exceed the content found in fresh grapes (PO) for all glycosylated terpene detected, with the exception of geranial. Among glycosylated alcohols, hexanol was the most abundant volatile compound. Most of alcohols (8 from 10, including hexanol) were found in significantly higher contents at P5 in ozone enriched atmosphere. Octanol showed an increased content in ozone-treated berries through the dehydration process. Regarding aldehydes, hexanal was the major glycosylated compound and exhibited a significant increase of its content at the early (P5) and the last (P30) stages of dehydration in ozone enriched atmosphere  versus air. Similar behavior was showed by benzaldehyde only at the beginning of the postharvest dehydration process (P5). Differentiation of postharvest ozone-treated grapes according to terpene composition Given the importance of terpenes in the Moscato bianco cultivar, Principal Components Analyses (PCAs) were performed on terpene composition to better visualize the differentiation of grape berries dehydrated in ozone enriched atmosphere from those dehydrated in air (Fig.  2). PCAs were conducted on free and glycosylated terpenes with significantly different contents among samples.  Figure  2a corresponds to the PCA conducted on free terpenes. The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) accounted for 84.46% of the total variance (70.22% and 14.24%, respectively). The P15-OZ and P15-AR samples were not represented in the plot because no significant differences were found in free terpene composition. Three well-defined groups can be differentiated. The first group is formed by the more dehydrated samples in ozone enriched atmosphere (P20-OZ and P30-OZ), which are sited in the positive side of both PC1 and PC2. The second group includes only the less dehydrated berries in air (P5-AR, positive side of PC1 and negative side of PC2), and the third group encompasses the more dehydrated samples in air and those less dehydrated in ozone (negative side of PC1 and PC2). All terpenes were highly correlated with PC1, with the exception of nerol and geraniol that contributed mainly to PC2. Figure  2b shows the PCA conducted on glycosylated terpenes. The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) accounted for 78.54% of the total variance (56.50% and 22.04%, respectively). The samples were clustered into three groups corresponding to different treatments. More dehydrated grape samples in ozone enriched atmosphere (P30-OZ) are associated with the highest positive values of PC1 and PC2. They are well differentiated from the corresponding control (P30-AR), which is sited in the highest positive values of PC1 but the highest negative values of PC2. The third group, formed by the other samples, is located in the intermediate and highest negative values of PC1. The PC1 was associated with the contents of  trans-rose oxide,  cis-rose oxide,  trans-furan linalool oxide, linalool, neral,  trans-piran linalool oxide, citronellol and geranial whereas the PC2 was strongly correlated with D-limonene, β-phellandrene and ( Z)-ocimene. Therefore, the grape berries dehydrated at P30 in ozone enriched atmosphere (P30-OZ) were well differentiated and characterized by high contents of free and glycosylated terpenes, with the exception of glycosylated geraniol with low representation in the two components. Monoterpene biosynthetic pathway Since the ozone treatment induced a significant increase of total monoterpenes content in the last stages of postharvest dehydration (Fig.  1), the transcription levels of some key genes involved in MEP pathway, critical for monoterpenes biosynthesis in grape berries, were analyzed. The first gene of the pathway, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase ( VvDXS) 35, showed a progressive increase of transcription up to P15 in both the conditions (air and ozone), followed by a strong reduction at P20 and P30 (Fig.  3). However, the levels of  VvDXS remained significantly higher at P20 in the presence of ozone (Fig.  3). Similarly, the following genes of MEP pathway, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase ( VvDXR) and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-( E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate reductase ( VvHDR) 7, showed an increase of transcription in the early phases of dehydration, but with a different trend in the two conditions (Fig.  3). In air, for both  VvDXR and  VvHDR genes we observed higher transcription at P10, followed by a decrease in the last stages of dehydration. However, in the presence of ozone, the transcription levels increased at P5 and remained constant in the following dehydration stages. In this way, the expression of  VvDXR and  VvHDR was significantly higher at P20-OZ in comparison to P20-AR (Fig.  3). The geranyl pyrophosphate synthase ( VvGPPS), a MEP mid-pathway gene that produces geranyl pyrophosphate as substrate of monoterpenes synthases in the late pathway, showed general increased transcription when dehydration started, and in particular at P15 and P20 the ozone induced a significantly higher activation of this gene (Fig.  3).  The expression changes of these four genes during dehydration support the accumulation of total terpenes reported above (Fig.  1). In particular, the precocious transcription activation in the early phases of dehydration in air suggests the increase of terpene contents at P5-AR and P10-AR, although not always significant (Figs  1 and  3, Tables  1 and  2). Similarly, the general up-regulation of these genes at P15-OZ and P20-OZ likely determined the increment of terpenes in the presence of ozone at the end of the dehydration process (Figs  1 and  3, Tables  1 and  2). In addition, five genes involved in the late MEP pathway in the production of specific monoterpenes were analyzed, allowing a correlation between transcripts and metabolites. A linalool/nerolidol synthase ( VvLYN) 7 showed a significant transcription increase at P5-AR and a higher activation at the end of postharvest dehydration, in particular at P20-OZ. The total content of free and glycosylated linalool reflects the transcription levels of  VvLYN (Fig.  3). The total contents of geraniol (free and glycosylated forms) and the transcription of a geraniol synthase ( VvGERAN) 36 agreed at the last stages of the dehydration process; higher contents at P20-OZ and P30-OZ were associated with higher transcriptional levels of  VvGERAN between P15-OZ and P30-OZ (Fig.  3). Unlike other terpenes, the total contents of α-terpineol generally decreased during dehydration in both ozone and air atmosphere, reaching higher levels at P5-AR. The α-terpineol synthase ( VvTERP) 7 showed a transcription increase in the early phases of dehydration (P5-P15) in particular in air conditions, followed by a progressive decline at higher levels of water loss (Fig.  3). The phellandrene synthase ( VvPHELL) 36 had a high peak of expression at P15-OZ and a higher accumulation of the metabolite at P30-OZ (Fig.  3). For the ocimene synthase ( VvOCIM) 36, we observed a low correspondence with the metabolite: after a precocious induction in particular for ozone-treated berries at P5-OZ, the transcription decreased as dehydration progressed whereas the ocimene isomers showed an increased accumulation not only at P5-AR and P5-OZ but also at P30-OZ (Fig.  3). Lipoxygenase–hydroperoxide lyase (LOX–HPL) pathway In addition to monoterpenes, the ozone treatment induced an increased total content of C 6 compounds, in particular aldehydes at the last stages of dehydration (Fig.  1). The transcription levels of some important genes involved in the ROS metabolism and the LOX–HPL pathway were analyzed. Taking into account that the over-production of ROS in response to ozone has been reported in green tissues 23, and that the ROS accumulation, among other reactions, acts as a signal for PUFAs formation 37, we verified if the ozone also affects the ROS metabolism in dehydrated grape berries. Two germin-like transcripts ( VvGER1 and  VvGER3) involved in the production of H 2O 2 and activated in response to pathogens were strongly overexpressed at P20 and P30 in the presence of ozone when compared with air (Fig.  4). In addition, scavenging genes, such as catalase ( VvCAT1) and ascorbate peroxidase ( VvAPX2), involved in the detoxification of H 2O 2, and glutathione S-transferase ( VvGST2) involved in the oxidative stress prevention were significantly up-regulated in the presence of ozone, in particular  VvAPX2 and  VvGST2 at P15 and P20 (Fig.  4). These data confirmed the previous observation in photosynthetic tissues 23 and suggest an over-accumulation of ROS during the dehydration process, in particular in the presence of ozone.  Two fatty acid desaturase 2 genes ( VvFAD2-1 and  VvFAD2-2) involved in PUFAs synthesis 38 exhibited a different expression pattern in the two experimental conditions (air and ozone). The  VvFAD2-1 did not show significant differences of expression between ozone- and air-treated berries. Although the expression of  VvFAD2-2 increased during dehydration in both the conditions (Fig.  5), the ozone induced an overexpression of this gene at P5, P15 and P20 in agreement with the increase of total aldehyde contents at the end of dehydration (Figs  1 and  5).  In the following step of the pathway, the PUFAs are oxygenated by LOXs producing 13-carbon and 9-carbon hydroperoxide precursors of several oxylipins (C 6 and C 9 compounds, and also jasmonic acid). Two 13- LOXs ( VvLOXA and  VvLOXO) and one 9- LOX ( VvLOXC) genes, previously identified in grapevine 11, were analyzed. The  VvLOXA showed a general down regulation during dehydration and does not seem to be influenced by stresses (dehydration and ozone) or to be strongly correlated with the production of C 6 compounds in grape berries (Fig.  5). Conversely, both  VvLOXO and  VvLOXC were strongly activated during the dehydration process and in particular in the presence of ozone at P10, P15, and P20 (Fig.  5). In the following step of aldehydes production catalyzed by hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), we observed a high expression of  VvHPL1 at P10-OZ and in particular of  VvHPL2 at P10-OZ and P20-OZ (Fig.  5), which agreed with the higher accumulation of aldehydes (Fig.  1). The  VvADH1 and  VvADH2, involved in the conversion of aldehydes to alcohols, showed a transcription modulation quite similar to  VvHPL. In particular, a peak of expression was observed for  VvADH2 at P5-OZ and P10-OZ (Fig.  5). The PUFA hydroperoxides are also precursors of jasmonic acid (JA). We analyzed the expression of 12-oxophytodienoate reductase ( VvOPR), which is one of the most important genes involved in JA biosynthesis. The ozone treatment during the dehydration process induced a strong expression of this gene in particular at P10-OZ and P20-OZ (Fig.  5). This suggests that the berries even in post-harvest conditions react to stresses likely activating JA-mediated defense responses.","Ozone, a powerful oxidative stressor, has been recently used in wine industry as sanitizing agent to reduce spoilage microflora on grapes. In this study, we evaluated ozone-induced metabolic and molecular responses during postharvest grape dehydration. Ozone increased the contents of total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which have a great impact on the organoleptic properties of grapes and wines. Among terpenes, responsible for floral and fruity aroma, linalool, geraniol and nerol were the major aromatic markers of Moscato bianco grapes. They were significantly affected by the long-term ozone treatment, increasing their concentration in the last phases of dehydration (>20% weight loss). At molecular level, our results demonstrated that both postharvest dehydration and ozone exposure induce the biosynthesis of monoterpenes via methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway and of aldehydes from lipoxygenase-hydroperoxide lyase (LOX-HPL) pathway. Therefore, transcriptional changes occurred and promoted the over-production of many important volatile compounds for the quality of white grapes.",NaN,"['Ozone', 'dehydration', 'Fig.', 'ozone enriched', 'contents', 'air', 'content', 'ozone treatment', 'total', 'terpenes']","[AR, P10, P20, P30, P20, P30, P15, P30, P15, P30, P30, P20, P30, P30, P20, P20, P30, P20, P30, P20, P30  , C 6-aldehydes, E)-2-hexenal, P30, E)-2-hexenal, Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, P10, Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, P30, P20, P30, Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, P20, P30, P5, P20, P20, P30, P30, P20, P30, P30, P30, P5, non-major, P30, P20, P30, P30, P30, PC2, P15-OZ, P15-AR, P20-OZ, P30-OZ, PC2, P5-AR, PC2, PC2, PC2, PC2, PC2, PC2, PC2, β-phellandrene, P30, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, P15, P20, P30 (, P20, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-, E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate reductase, P10, P20-OZ, P20-AR, geranyl pyrophosphate synthase, P15, P20, P5-AR, P10-AR, P15-OZ, P20-OZ, P5-AR, P20-OZ, VvGERAN, P20-OZ, P30-OZ, P15-OZ, P30-OZ (Fig.  3, α-terpineol, P5-AR, α-terpineol synthase, VvTERP) 7, P5-P15, P15-OZ, P5-OZ, P5-AR, P5-OZ, Lipoxygenase–hydroperoxide, LOX–HPL, LOX–HPL, green tissues 23, VvGER1, P20, P30, catalase (, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, VvGST2, P15, P20 (Fig.  4, VvFAD2-1, P5, P15, P20, LOXs, C 6, C 9, LOXs, VvLOXA, 9- LOX, P10, P15, P20 (Fig.  , hydroperoxide lyase, P10-OZ, P10-OZ, P20-OZ (, P5-OZ, P10-OZ (, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, P10-OZ, P20-OZ (]",[],[],[],NaN
59,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5726760\eupmc_result.json,PMC5726760,"Results and discussion Identification of differentially expressed genes Around 44 million clean reads were obtained from infected and control plants and mapped to  Citrus sinensis genome [ 27], with approximately 62% success for  C.  hystrix, and 77%-78% for  C.  sinensis libraries ( S2 Table). Dramatic differences between the transcriptome profiles of  C.  hystrix and  C.  sinensis were observed in response to  CLas infection. Overall, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was greater in susceptible sweet orange than in tolerant kaffir lime when compared to their respective healthy control. Among these DEGs, 179 genes were up-regulated and 73 were down-regulated in  C.  hystrix, while 254 genes were up-regulated and 350 were down-regulated in  C.  sinensis ( Fig 1). Due to the differences in genetic background between the two citrus cultivars, the DEG number of infected/healthy  C.  hystrix in relation to infected/healthy  C.  sinensis was much greater than the number of the two infected cultivars in relation to their mock-inoculated healthy controls ( Fig 1). Gene ontology classification of DEGs The DEGs were enriched into different function categories through Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis ( Fig 2). Significantly enriched GO terms were extracted using TopGO [ 28]. For DEGs in HLB tolerant  C.  hystrix, the most significantly enriched GO terms in biological process were related to ‘threonine metabolic process’ (GO:0006566), ‘negative regulation of peptidase activity’ (GO:0010466), ‘regulation of proteolysis’ (GO:0045861), and ‘regulation of peptidase activity’ (GO:0052547). The most significant GO terms in molecular function included ‘terpene synthase activity’ (GO: 0010333), and ‘carbon-oxygen lyase activity, acting on phosphates’ (GO:0016838). No GO term in cellular component was enriched in DEGs in  C.  hystrix ( S2 Table). For DEGs in susceptible  C.  sinensis, only two GO terms in biological process, ‘reactive oxygen species metabolic process’ (GO: 0072593) and ‘cellular protein complex assembly’ (GO: 0043623) were enriched. The most significant GO terms in molecular function were related to ‘transferase activity’ (GO: 0016758), ‘cellulose synthase activity’ (GO: 0016759), and ‘glucuronosyltransferase activity’ (GO: 0015020). Only three GO terms in cellular component were enriched in DEGs in  C.  sinensis and the most significant one was ‘external encapsulating structure’ (GO: 0030312) ( S3 Table). DEGs within two infected cultivars were mainly enriched in nine biological process GO terms, including ‘drug transport’ (GO: 0015893), ‘response to drug’ (GO: 0042493) and ‘response to chemical’ (GO:0042221). Besides, nine molecular function GO terms were enriched, such as ‘catalytic activity’ (GO: 0003824), ‘oxidoreductase activity’ (GO: 0016491), ‘transferase activity’ (GO: 0016758, GO: 0016757), whereas only one cellular component GO term, ‘intrinsic component of membrane’ (GO: 0031224), was enriched in DEGs in the two cultivars in response to  CLas ( S4 Table). Gene pathway enrichment analysis of  CLas-modulated host pathways PageMan analysis showed that only three pathways significantly enriched were associated with the DEGs identified in  C.  hystrix ( Fig 3). Pathways related to major carbohydrates (CHO) metabolism was up-regulated, while pathways related to posttranslational modification and LRR XII receptor kinases were down-regulated in tolerant citrus plants. Instead, much more pathways were significantly enriched in  C.  sinensis ( Fig 3). The up-regulated pathways were starch synthesis, cell wall degradation, stress biotic, regulation of transcription, receptor kinases signaling, and metal transport in susceptible citrus plants. The down-regulated pathways included cellulose synthesis, hemicellulose synthesis, invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor family protein, GDSL motif lipase, and aspartate protease mediated protein degradation. MapMan software was applied to display and analyze the functional classes those were significantly different in  CLas-affected  C.  hystrix and  C.  sinensis. The results showed that DEGs were mainly involved in diverse cellular functions including carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, secondary metabolism, hormone metabolism, PR proteins and oxidation/reduction processes (Figs  4 and  5,  S5 Table). Carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis process Cytopathology in different stage of HLB infection revealed swelling of the middle lamella between cell walls surrounding sieve elements in non-symptomatic citrus new flushes at the early infection stage and then necrosis of sieve elements and companion cells and phloem plugging by the callose-like material and excessive starch at the later infection stage [ 29– 31]. It suggests that the disturbance of starch metabolism and the inhibition of the transport of photosynthate may contribute to HLB development in citrus hosts. Microarray or RNA-seq analysis also proved that carbohydrate metabolic process was significantly changed and photosynthesis was repressed in HLB-affected citrus [ 15,  17,  18,  30,  32]. From these studies, the key starch synthesis genes were generally up-regulated and the starch degrading genes were down-regulated in affected susceptible citrus. Recently, proteomic analysis suggested no clear correlation was observed from starch pathway regulation between moderately tolerant cultivar ‘Volkameriana’ and susceptible navel orange [ 33]. In this study, several genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were regulated in the early stage of infection with  CLas ( Fig 4,  S5 Table). The starch synthesis was induced while the starch degradation was depressed in  C.  sinensis. Two glycogen synthase (starch synthase,  glgA) geneswere significantly up-regulated, whereas beta-amylase ( BAM) gene was down-regulated in  C.  sinensis ( Fig 4,  S5 Table). However, the expression levels of these genes were not significantly changed in  CLas-affected  C.  hystrix. Instead, one gene encoding alpha-amylase ( AAM), associated with starch degradation, was slightly up-regulated in  C.  hystrix ( Fig 4,  S5 Table). Genes encoding light-harvesting complex II chlorophyll a/b binding protein 1, Photosystem II psbP domain-containing protein 1 and photosystem I subunit O, which involved in light action of photosynthesis, were all down-regulated in  C.  sinensis ( Fig 4,  S5 Table). The three genes were not significantly changed in  C.  hystrix, suggesting the photosynthesis process may not be depressed in tolerant  C.  hystrix. Taken together these findings showed that the repression of key proteins involved in photosynthetic light reactions and up-regulation of starch-related pathways in  C.  sinensis was in agreement with previous studies. Notably, no significant change in starch synthesis and photosynthesis process may play important roles in tolerance of  C.  hystrix. Anatomical evidences from different infection stage of kaffir limeare required to prove the transcriptome data. Genes involved in cell wall and cell organization The plant cell wall is comparable to an exoskeleton surrounding the plant cell and providing both structural support and protection from biotic as well as abiotic stresses [ 34]. It is well established that the plant susceptibility to pathogens depends on the cell wall composition and structure, which determines its recalcitrance to degradation by cell wall modifying enzymes (CWMEs) produced by pathogens [ 35]. Plant cell walls are composed of layers of cellulose microfibers embedded in a matrix of pectin and hemicellulose, plus some structural proteins [ 36– 38]. There were 44 and 13 genes found related to cell wall metabolism among the DEGs in HLB-susceptible and tolerant cultivars, respectively ( Fig 5,  S5 Table). Overall, most genes involved in cellulose synthesis, cell wall proteins and cell wall modification were depressed in diseased  C.  sinensis. For instance, several genes encoding expansin, which are related to cell wall breakdown, including EXLA1, EXPA5 and EXLB1, were down-regulated in  C.  sinensis, and EXLA1 was also down-regulated in  C.  hystrix. Expansin related genes were reported to exhibit high expressions in susceptible ‘Marsh’ grapefruit [ 19]. Down-regulation of these genes in both  C.  hystrix and  C.  sinensis indicates a host defense response to  CLas infection. A group of genes encoding xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase proteins (XTH22, XTH23), associated with cell wall degradation, were slightly up-expressed in  CLas-affected  C.  sinensis, whereas no significant difference was observed in  CLas-affected  C.  hystrix. Furthermore, DEGs involved in cellulose synthesis, such as cellulose synthase A (CESA), cellulose synthase-like protein A2 (CSLA2), cellulose synthase-like protein A9 (CSLA9) and cellulose synthase-like protein C5 (CSLC5) were all down-regulated in  CLas-affected  C.  sinensis, while CSLA2 and CSLA9 were up-regulated in  CLas-affected  C.  hystrix. Thus, kaffir lime responded to  CLas by activating enzymes that would work together to strengthen the cell wall, which may contribute to the reinforcement of physical barriers to restrict the invasion of  CLas. Secondary metabolism Secondary metabolism plays important roles in plant defenses. Previous studies revealed that most genes involved in secondary metabolites, including terpenoid, flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways, were highly induced in  CLas-affected leaves [ 15,  17,  19,  39], whereas most of these genes were down-regulated in roots following HLB infection [ 16]. Here, most DEGs involved in secondary metabolism pathway were activated in  C.  hystrix, but were suppressed in  C.  sinensis. These DEGs were categorized into the biological processes of terpene biosynthesis, flavonoids biosynthesis and phenylpropanoids biosynthesis ( Fig 5,  S5 Table). Terpenoids are a structurally diverse group of natural products, which function as plant antioxidants, insect attractants or repellents [ 40,  41]. Flavonoids are anti-fungi substances and antioxidants [ 42]. Phenylpropanoids serve as structural polymers including lignins, provide protection from pests and UV light and attract pollinators as pigments [ 43]. Two genes encoding germacrene D synthase-like (GDSL) were up-regulated in both two cultivars in response to  CLas infection. Two genes encoding gamma-terpinene synthase (TPS2) were only up-regulated in HLB tolerant citrus trees. The expression level of one gene encoding (R)-limonene synthase 1 was increased in  C.  hystrix, while the other two genes related to this enzyme were suppressed in  C.  sinensis. GDSL, TPS2 and (R)-limonene synthase were involved in terpene biosynthesis. One gene encoding 2-oxoglutarate and Fe (II)-dependent (2OG-Fe (II)) oxygenases, which is associated with flavonoids biosynthesis, was strongly up-regulated in  C.  hystrix, whereas it was down-regulated in  C.  sinensis. Genes involved in phenylpropanoids biosynthesis such as isoflavone reductase (IRL) and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1 (CCR), were induced in  C.  hystrix, while phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and 4-coumarate—CoA ligase 1 (4CL1), which also play an important role in phenylpropanoids biosynthesis, were suppressed in  C.  sinensis. The tolerant cultivars contain relatively higher specific volatile compounds such as monoterpenes and aldehydes than susceptible cultivars [ 44]. It should be noted that Kaffir lime leaves contain various classes of phytochemical substances including terpenoids and polyphenolic which are known for their antimicrobial activities [ 7,  8]. The up-regulation of genes involved in secondary metabolism pathways, and high phytochemical substances containing in kaffir lime leaves may contribute to its tolerance to  CLas. Hormone metabolism Phytohormones play critical roles in helping the plants to adapt to adverse environmental conditions. The elaborate hormone signaling networks and their ability of crosstalk make them ideal candidates for mediating defense responses [ 45]. There were 35 hormone signaling genes in identified DEGs ( Fig 5,  S5 Table). Auxin was found to promote the expression of expansins in plants [ 46– 48], which contribute to breakage of plant cell walls. Of the seven auxin-related genes, three genes related to crocetin glucosyltransferase were up-regulated in  C.  hystrix, two auxin-responsive proteins, SAUR72 and IAA1, were down-regulated in  C. sinensis. SAUR was proved to act as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis in rice and may promote resistance to pathogens [ 49]. Transcription analysis showed that three SAUR-like genes were up-expressed in HLB tolerant ‘Jackson’ grapefruit, which may also contribute to the down expression of expansin [ 19]. A gene encoding the senescence-related gene (SRG1), involved in ethylene metabolism, was highly induced in response to  CLas in  C.  hystrix. The expression of ethylene-responsive transcription factor ERF07 was up-regulated in both cultivars, while ERF107 was down-regulated. Ethylene-responsive transcription factor and EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 were only up-regulated in  C.  sinensis. Notably, five genes involved in salicylic acid metabolism were suppressed in  C.  sinensis but not in  C.  hystrix. JA levels in response to pathogen infection clearly highlight its involvement in plant defense responses. The key enzyme involved in jasmonate synthesis, lipoxygenase 2 (LOX2) [ 50], were up-regulated in both cultivars. JA-responsive gene expression for defense response is mainly mediated by a transcription factor JASMONATE INSENSITIVE 1/MYC2 (JIN1/MYC2) [ 51]. Up-regulation of transcription factor MYC2 was only observed in  C.  hystrix. These results showed that JA signal transduction may be activated by infection with  CLas, especially in  C.  hystrix. Pathogenesis-related (PR) genes The pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins of plants are a group of host-encoded, inducible proteins whose synthesis is often associated with certain forms of resistance to pathogens and stresses [ 52]. Previous studies showed that most genes related to PR-proteins were induced by  CLas infection, including receptor-like protein kinase, TIR-NBS-LRR (Toll interleukin-1 receptor nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat) class and NB-ARC (nucleotide binding-adaptor shared by APAF-1, certain R gene products and CED4) domain proteins, and Kunitz family trypsin and protease inhibitor protein [ 11,  18,  32,  39]. In this work, more genes related to PR genes were induced in  C.  sinensis than in  C.  hystrix ( Fig 5,  S5 Table). Several genes related to kinases involved in biotic stress, including LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase GSO1, LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase ERL2, LRR receptor-like protein kinase At1g35710, and receptor-like protein 12, were slightly up-expressed in  C.  sinensis. A gene encoding leucine-rich repeat receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase (At2g24130) was up-regulated more than 8-fold in  C.  hystrix, but showed no significant difference in  C.  sinensis. Notably, two genes encoding miraculin, a Kunitz family trypsin and protease inhibitor protein which are associated with plant defenses, were only up-regulated in  C.  hystrix ( S5 Table). In addition, some genes related to disease resistance proteins, such as RPS4 and RPM1, exhibited higher expression level in  C.  hystrix. RPS4 and RPM1 act as R genes to participate in the effector-triggered immunity (ETI) process, which play an important role in plant defense response [ 53,  54]. Oxidation/Reduction processes 14 genes involved in oxidation/reduction processes were differentially regulated between the HLB-susceptible and tolerant cultivars. It should be noted that most of them were up-regulated in tolerant  C.  hystrix and down-regulated in  C.  sinensis. Up-regulation of several glutaredoxin genes such as GRXC6, GRXC9 and GRXS9, were only identified in  C.  hystrix. These proteins have activity of glutathione-disulfide bond oxidordeuctase, which can reduce the amount of micromolecular disulfide and proteins. A gene encoding thioredoxin M3, a thiol-disulfide bond oxidordeuctase which required for maintaining permeability of plant meristem and regulation of callose deposition in  Arabidopsis, was inhibited in  C.  sinensis. Besides, a group of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) genes were differentially expressed in both cultivars. Of them, Cu/Zn-SOD and POD4 were up-regulated in  C.  hystrix, whereas they were down-regulated in  C.  sinensis ( S5 Table). Proteins involved in oxidation/reduction processes, including peroxidases and glutathione-S-transferases, are usually associated with the prevention of oxidative stress, which are induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Proteomic studies revealed that a higher activation of glutathione-S-transferases, which include several isozymes that help detoxify xenobiotic compounds, was observed in tolerant cultivar ‘Volkameriana’ [ 33]. Therefore, activation of peroxidases, Cu/Zn-SOD and POD4, may also enhance the tolerance of  C.  hystrix to  CLas. RT-qPCR validation To validate the accuracy of the RNA-seq data, 16 genes classified in different function groups were tested by RT-qPCR. The expression profiles of 15 genes were consistent with the RNA-seq data, demonstrating the reliability of RNA-seq analysis. The RT-qPCR result of LHCb, encoding light-harvesting complex II chlorophyll a/b binding protein 1, did not agree with those obtained from the RNA-seq in  C.  hystrix. In addition, several genes showed no difference in RNA-seq data, but differentially expressed by RT-qPCR analysis. For example, glgA and XTH23 showed lower expression levels, PAL and RGA3 showed higher expression levels in  CLas-infected  C.  hystrix based on qRT-PCR analysis ( Fig 6).","Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), a highly devastating citrus disease, is associated with 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiacitus' (CLas), a member of phloem-inhabiting α-proteobacteria. HLB can affect all cultivated citrus and no cure is currently available. Previous studies showed that Kaffir lime (Citrus hystrix), primarily grown in South Asia and Southeast Asia, was tolerant to HLB but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study, gene expression profiling experiments were performed on HLB-tolerant C. hystrix and HLB-susceptible C. sinensis three months after inoculation with CLas using RNA-seq data. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the two citrus cultivars were mainly involved in diverse cellular functions including carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, secondary metabolism, hormone metabolism and oxidation/reduction processes. Notably, starch synthesis and photosynthesis process were not disturbed in CLas-infected C. hystrix. Most of the DEGs involved in cell wall metabolism and secondary metabolism were up-regulated in C. hystrix. In addition, the activation of peroxidases, Cu/Zn-SOD and POD4, may also enhance the tolerance of C. hystrix to CLas. This study provides an insight into the host response of HLB-tolerant citrus cultivar to CLas. C. hystrix is potentially useful for HLB-tolerant/resistant citrus breeding in the future.",NaN,"['genes', 'hystrix', 'sinensis', 'Table', 'genes involved', 'Fig', 'cell wall', 'DEGs', 'Gene', 'genes related']","[HLB, ‘threonine, ’, ‘, ’, GO:0010466, ‘, ’, GO:0045861, ‘, ‘terpene, ’, ‘carbon-oxygen, ’, ‘reactive, ’, ’, 0043623, ‘transferase, ’, ‘cellulose, ’, ‘glucuronosyltransferase, ’, ‘, ’, ‘, ’, ‘, ’, ‘, ’, ‘, ’, ‘oxidoreductase, ’, ‘transferase, ’, ‘, LRR XII receptor kinases, receptor kinases, invertase/pectin methylesterase, lipase, aspartate protease, PR, HLB, RNA-seq, glycogen synthase, beta-amylase, alpha-amylase, light-harvesting complex II chlorophyll a/b, Photosystem II psbP domain-containing protein 1, photosystem I subunit O, CWMEs, pectin, HLB-susceptible, EXLA1, EXPA5, EXLB1, EXLA1, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase proteins, XTH22, XTH23, cellulose synthase A, CESA, cellulose synthase-like, CSLA2, cellulose synthase-like, CSLA9, cellulose synthase-like, CSLC5, CSLA2, CSLA9, HLB, HLB, (R)-limonene synthase 1, (R)-limonene synthase, Fe (II)-dependent, 2OG-Fe (II)) oxygenases, isoflavone reductase, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, 4-coumarate—CoA ligase 1, 4CL1, Auxin, expansins, auxin-related, crocetin glucosyltransferase, SAUR72, IAA1, SAUR, auxin, SAUR-like, HLB, expansin [ 19, SRG1, ERF07, ERF107, F-box protein 1, lipoxygenase 2, LOX2, 1/MYC2, JIN1/MYC2, MYC2, JA signal, host-encoded, receptor-like protein kinase, TIR-NBS-LRR, Toll interleukin-1 receptor, APAF-1, CED4, Kunitz, protease inhibitor protein [, PR, LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein, GSO1, LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase, ERL2, LRR receptor-like protein kinase At1g35710, receptor-like protein 12, leucine-rich repeat receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase, At2g24130, miraculin, protease inhibitor protein, S5, RPS4, RPM1, RPM1, R, HLB-susceptible, glutaredoxin, GRXC6, GRXC9, GRXS9, oxidordeuctase, thioredoxin M3, oxidordeuctase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase (, Cu/Zn-SOD, S5, peroxidases, glutathione-S-transferases, glutathione-S-transferases, peroxidases, Cu/Zn-SOD, RNA-seq, LHCb, light-harvesting complex II chlorophyll a/b, XTH23, RGA3]","['(TPS2)', 'TPS2']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']",['Citrus'],terpene synthase
60,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5761147\eupmc_result.json,PMC5761147,"Results Annotated terpenome data The curated terpenome data was compiled as described in methods, involving retrieval of sequences from the NCBI Protein Database via keyword specific search for prenyl transferases (PTs) as well as all TPS functional classes (mono-, di- and sesqui-TPSs) as well as the sequence homology based gene-family classes, namely TPSa to TPSg [ 19]. The function-based (FB dataset) consisted of 401 representatives sequences, including 154 monoterpene synthases, 71 diterpene synthases and 176 sesquiterpene synthases, as shown in Table  1. These sequences represent diverse taxonomic classes of green plants, including land plants, which further include seed plants, with the exception of chlorophytes. For prenyl transferases, a total of 301 PT sequences were compiled as shown in the last column of Table  1, and this data was called the PT dataset. Mosses have not been reported to have any prenyl transferases at all. Additional file  1: Table 1 provides a detailed list of accession IDs for each sequence used in the FB and PT datasets. The gene-family based GB dataset was also compiled as described in methods and Table  2 shows the 326 sequences retrieved for this dataset. A detailed list of accession IDs for each sequence, along with species and sub-class information has been provided in Additional file  2: Table 2. As can be seen in Table  2, this dataset contains 113 TPSa, 49 TPSb, 35 TPSc, 48 TPSd, 50 TPSe_f and 31 TPSg sequences, mainly present in seed plants. No TPS has been annotated to date in chlorophytes. Lower plants like ferns and mosses also have very few PTs or TPSs. Similarly, genomes of ancient land plants like the magnoliales also appear to lack PTs or TPSs as per their current annotations. As expected, only gymnosperm sequences are present in the TPSd subfamily, known to be specific to this clade. In all, the FB, GB and the PT datasets consist of 116, 74 and 112 species respectively, the majority being monocots or dicots.  Profile hidden Markov models and predictive accuracy Profile HMMs were built for the prenyl transferase family and all 12 classes of TPS subfamilies, as described in methods. For TPSs, analysis was divided into two parts, function based analysis and gene family based analysis. In function-based analysis the input sequence is classified into a monoterpene, diterpene or sesquiterpene synthase using the six profile HMMs specific to function based (FB) dataset. In gene family based (GB) analysis, the test sequence is assigned to one of the six gene families described earlier from TPSa to g, with HMMs being generated from the GB dataset. In order to test the predictive accuracy of the program, benchmarking was done as described in methods, and this revealed a sensitivity of 100% in all cases, albeit with a relatively low accuracy range of 51–61%. This indicates that although each individual sub-family search profile is able to successfully identify true positives, the twelve HMMs also have a tendency towards false positives, i.e. acquisition of TPS sequences from other sub-families. The high rate of false positives severely affects sub-family annotation towards prediction of substrate specificity and may be ascribed to the strong homology between various TPS sub-classes, both at sequence and structural levels. Table  3 provides a sense of this overlap through an inter-family sequence and structural fold comparison. The various TPS sub-family representatives used for structural superimposition included the 1,8-cineole synthase from  Salvia fruticosa for Monoterpene synthases (PDBID 25JC), the Taxadiene synthase from Pacific yew for Di-TPSs (PDB ID 3P5P) and the 5-epi aristolochene synthase from  Nicotiana tabacum (PDBID 3M00) representing sesqui-TPSs. As a result, correct annotation and classification of newly identified TPSs becomes a significant challenge in view of conservation between the different TPS superfamilies. In order to overcome this challenge posed by high false positives without losing out the perfect sensitivity achieved by each sub-family profile, we developed a pipeline wherein all twelve profile HMMs would be allowed to scan a new sequence in parallel. We then based the final sub-family assignment on the premise that high sensitivity of the true sub-family profile would overshadow the false positive scores of the remaining eleven non-self HMMs. In this manner, even though a given test sequence may be identified by multiple sub-family HMMs, the highest scoring hit would still remain the true sub-family profile. In order to test the veracity of our selection premise, all 12 HMMs were combined into a pipeline for scanning the test set dataset, followed by sorting based on highest score obtained by each sub-family profile. As expected, benchmarking of the program in this manner significantly enhanced the accuracy of the search algorithm as can be seen in Table  4. This table shows the results of predictive performance of HMMs calculated using the statistical concepts of sensitivity and accuracy as discussed in methodology section, before and after the parallel-scan strategy. As can be seen from Table  4, the final accuracy of the search algorithm increases to 100% for a majority of sub-families, with the exception of dicot-specific profiles for Mono- and Sesqui-TPSs, both of which show accuracy above 85%.  Encouraged by the superior predictive power of the search algorithm, we proceeded to assess its performance in context with other online web resources. To our knowledge, there is no search tool specific to any category of phytochemicals, but we expected the global annotation databases, (such as Pfam, PANTHER and Interpro) to be able to identify terpene synthase family, and therefore adequate for a comparative performance test. However, we found that none of the currently existing programs could classify TPSs either based on their function i.e. into monoterpene, diterpene or sesquiterpene synthases, nor on the basis of gene family (TPSa-TPSe/f). The Terzyme hidden markov models, in contrast, achieve taxon-based distinction between identified TPSs. One reason for the failure of general annotation databases may be that available programs like Pfam identify TPSs by detecting either the N-terminal domain naming them as Terpene_synth (PF01397) or the metal binding domain designating it as Terpene_synth_C (PF03936) or both. Similarly PANTHER detects N-terminal domain designating it as PTHR31376, other Terpenoid synthase as PTHR31225, PTHR11439 or PTHR31739. Interpro also detects Terpenoid synthase, N terminal domain as IPR001906 and C-terminal metal binding domain as Terpene_synth_C (IPR005630). Hence, from a predictive viewpoint, it can be inferred that our search algorithm performs better than existing programs for TPS gene family identification in the plant kingdom. Novel terpenome identification Encouraged by this superior accuracy of prediction, we automated the TPS and PT search pipeline to design and develop the Terzyme interactive online server, available freely without any login requirement at  www.nipgr.res.in/terzyme.html. Figure  1 shows the query submission protocol of Terzyme. It has been configured to accept multiple fasta sequences to search for TPSs, and does not require download on local machines for processing. The Terzyme HMM pipeline was used to search for novel TPS and PT gene family members in the entire PSG dataset (containing 1,573,395 protein sequences from 42 plant genomes, as described in Methods), and the resulting identifications have been incorporated into the online web resource for browsing, download and further exploration. Figure  2 shows a few screenshots of the Terzyme prediction server including the browse-able terpenome database. In all, Terzyme identified a total of 3312 unique TPS sequences and 873 unique prenyl transferases. Some of the TPS sequences, as expected, were predicted by both function-based and gene-family based HMMs. These 3312 TPSs and 873 PTs are available for browsing, both by species name and taxonomic class, through the ‘Plant Genome Predictions’ menu of Terzyme website, as shown in panels B of Fig.  2. For each TPS, users can view or download the corresponding sequence in FASTA format, its alignment with the respective sub-family profile HMM, as well as the predicted secondary structure.  A total of 2040 TPSs were identified by the functional class based profile HMMs and these included 613 monoterpene synthases, 468 diterpene synthases and 959 sesquiterpene synthases. Similarly, 2987 TPSs were identified by gene family based profile HMMs which included 1797 TPSa, 432 TPSb, 218 TPSc, 81 TPSd, 270 TPSe_f and 189 TPSg gene family sequences. A complete list of these identifications along with sub-family assignment for each species, including PTs is provided in Tables  5,  6 and  7 respectively. Interestingly, our data shows identification of putative TPSs in three chlorophyte genomes even though none of the profile HMMs were trained on these species. A manual inspection of each sequence shows them to have sufficient length and presence of the requisite TPS motifs. From a functional point of view, all chlorophyte TPSs appear to be Diterpene synthases, the ancient TPS containing family, known previously to consist of both gymnosperm and angiosperm members. A detailed analysis of some of these DiTPSs indicated them to be closely related to Cycloartenol synthase and some were found to contain Squalene cyclase (SQCY) found in class II TPSs. Among bryophytes,  Physcomitrella patens shows only one known bifunctional TPSs with both CPS/KS activity has been reported till date [ 24]. The present analysis reveals the additional presence of at least nine bifunctional TPSs, and we have identified 15 prenyl transferases in the moss genome, suggesting a reasonably large terpenome family with more than 30 members, majority of these being previously unreported diterpene synthases. The gene family profiles assign most of these sequences to the TPSa and TPSc subfamilies. As anticipated, 64 of the 72 putative TPSs identified in the gymnosperm genome ( Picea abies) were assigned to TPSd subfamily, supporting the existing view that gymnosperm TPSs belong to a distinct clade [ 19]. Tables  5 and  6 also depict five gymnosperm TPS sequences representing the most ancient TPSc gene family, with mono/bifunctional CPSs, although we did not observe any bias of representation in case of functional class assignment; all three classes namely monoTPS, diTPS and sesqui-TPS are roughly equally present in this gymnosperm. It may be noted that Terzyme enables a distinction between Class II Copalyl diphosphate synthases (CPS) and the Class-I Kaurene synthases (KSL) also. Under the Plant Genome Predictions Tab, apart from the Diterpene TPS classification, for each genome, Terzyme shows the exact number of matches found for TPSc and TPSe_f classes, both of which represent largely, the CPS and KSL respectively. We believe this is a very useful feature that enables users to breakdown Di-TPS data for detecting better-resolved functional annotations. In general monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases outnumber the diterpene synthases in all seed plant domains. This may be due to the general mono functional activity of the former compared to bifunctional activity of latter enzymes. Terpenes are known to play significant roles defence responses against herbivores by emissions of several volatile blends, and volatile emissions are mainly composed of monoterpenes and sesquiterpene lactones owing to their low molecular weights (C 10 and C 15 respectively). It may also be noted that the identified TPS gene family size increases from lower plants (chlorophytes, bryophytes and pteridophytes) to land plants, suggesting expansion of the family during course of evolution. An average of 30–50 TPS sequences were identified across higher plants, with the maximum number of sequences detected in  Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), along with commercial fruit bearing dicot species like apple, grape and papaya. The Eucalyptus genome also contains over one hundred TPS sequences and it would be interesting to study these TPSs further and characterize their roles in the respective genomes. Present knowledge of completely characterized TPSs is limited to only few plant species and their classification based on functional roles or gene family is still an emerging field. Our data on the other hand opens up a huge repertoire of putative TPSs candidates throughout the plant kingdom, together with their functional, and gene family based classification. For example, the tomato terpenome was recently characterized with about 40 TPS [ 15], whereas our analysis reveals at least 60–100 TPSs in the  S. lycopersicum genome along with more than 20 PTs. In addition, Diterpene TPS classification has been performed based on class I (Aspartate rich motif (DDXXD/E) or Non-aspartate rich consensus motif of ( N, D)D(L,I,V)X( S, T)XXX E also called as ‘NSE/DTE’ motif and class II (DXDD) signature motifs present in the respective sequences. In house perl script were used to scan all the DiTPS annotations to assess the presence of these signature motifs for Class I and Class II TPSs. Accordingly, TERZYME classifies DiTPSs into the following four classes: (1) Class I DiTPS—If either Aspartate rich motif (DDXXD/E) or Non-aspartate rich consensus motif of ( N, D)D(L,I,V)X( S, T)XXX E, (2) Class II Diterpene synthases—If DXDD motif was present, (3) bifunctional—If both Class I and Class II motifs are present and (4) Noncanonical : If none are present. Details can be seen in Table  8. The presence of these sub-classes in available plants can also be assessed on the Terzyme database under the Plant Genomes Predictions tab. These examples reflect how a rigorous scientific pursuit can lead to new annotations and gene discovery for previously unknown, and even well-known families of conserved sequences.  Gene ontology analysis for the newly identified TPS genes was carried out in order to further validate our predictions for the plant kingdom, as well as to improve the resolution of functional role prediction, in terms of molecular function or subcellular localization. As described in methods, a total of 2040 TPSs were subjected to ontological analysis and as anticipated, the novel TPSs were found to be enriched in biological process terms like ‘response to stress’, ‘lipid metabolic pathway’ and ‘secondary metabolic process’. More than 900 TPSs were found to be enriched for primary metabolism, although this class of genes is mostly known for secondary/ specialized metabolism. An assessment of these TPSs revealed that they belong to the mono/bifunctional CPS of TPSc and highly divergent TPSe_f gene families. Among molecular function categories, highest enrichment was found for terpene synthase activity, catalytic activity and magnesium ion binding activity, as expected, but in few cases, the GO terms were able to resolve the exact catalytic function for a given TPSs, as in case of hydrolases (37 cases), transferases (65 cases) or protein binding activities. In eight cases, nucleic acid binding was found to be an enriched term and we looked at these cases in more detail in order to understand how TPSs may bind to DNA/RNA to carry out their function. It was interesting to note that nucleic acid binding term was found mainly in case of sesquiterpene synthases in response towards oxidative stress. It may be noted that some TPS genes have previously been known to show single-stranded DNA endo-deoxyribonuclease activity or DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity, and take part in double strand break repair via homologues recombination. Thus, the present eight cases may form part of purine or pyrimidine nucleobase metabolic process. In the sub-cellular compartmentalization category, a majority of mono- and di-TPSs were found to be localized in plastids, as expected, since these are synthesized by the methyl erythritol (MEP) pathway, which is plastidial in nature. In contrast, the sesquiterpene synthases were predominantly found to be located in cytoplasm, the site of occurrence of the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway that is known to synthesize sesquiterpene and triterpenes. 134 cases did not follow the expected localization trend, wherein a sesqui-TPS was localized to the plastid and, conversely a mono- or di-TPS was predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm, supporting the notion of crosstalk that has been previously hypothesized between MVA and MEP pathways [ 7]. In summary, the GO analysis further supports Terzyme predictions and the huge repertoire of new TPSs thus identified provides an opportunity for further functional characterization. Further analyses, as presented in the next section were performed to shed light on the roles and identities of these new TPSs. Analysis of the plant terpenome The newly identified TPS sequences were subjected to clustering, genome wide mapping and KEGG pathway analysis for understanding their evolution and also for assignment of substrate specificity, as described in Methods. Following GO assignment, the sequences with GO annotations were subjected to EC (Enzyme code) mapping and novel TPSs were mapped onto KEGG pathways, in order to assign putative catalytic roles. In this manner, 539 TPSs were assigned to specific enzymatic categories as shown in Table  9. These included 140 monoterpene synthases, 311 diterpene synthases and 88 sesquiterpene synthases. As can be seen from this table, ent-kaurene synthases were found in the highest number, followed by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases, both DiTPSs. One each of bornyl-diphosphate synthase, levopimaradiene synthase and germacrene A synthase were predicted, these three representing one each of a MonoTPS, DiTPS and SesquiTPS respectively. Detailed information on accession IDs and substrate preferences for each of these 539 putative TPS sequences is provided in Additional file  3: Table 3. The IGMAP tool [ 25] was used for clustering the TPSs mapped to 19 plant genomes. Figure  3 depicts the genome-wide terpenome maps for selected monocots and a unicellular green alga, while Fig.  4 depicts the corresponding maps for selected dicotyledonous species. TPSs in both taxa can be observed in clusters often as large as 15 genes, with a tendency to be located towards the centromeres, as in case of rice and Arabidopsis, or towards the edges of the chromosomes, as in sorghum, maize, Brachypodium and most dicots. In  Zea mays, TPS clusters map both towards center and towards the end of chromosomes. Statistical tests reinforced the trend observed in the map images, viz., a significant number of sequences representing TPS genes are located in clusters within the genomes analyzed, based on an unranked independent samples  T-test at the 99% confidence level ( P value = 5.52E−08). Clustering data is presented in Table  10, it shows positive correlation bewteen TPS gene family size and the corresponding number of gene clusters. ","Background:Terpenoid hydrocarbons represent the largest and most ancient group of phytochemicals, such that the entire chemical library of a plant is often referred to as its 'terpenome'. Besides having numerous pharmacological properties, terpenes contribute to the scent of the rose, the flavors of cinnamon and the yellow of sunflowers. Rapidly increasing -omics datasets provide an unprecedented opportunity for terpenome detection, paving the way for automated web resources dedicated to phytochemical predictions in genomic data. Results:We have developed Terzyme, a predictive algorithm for identification, classification and assignment of broad substrate unit to terpene synthase (TPS) and prenyl transferase (PT) enzymes, known to generate the enormous structural and functional diversity of terpenoid compounds across the plant kingdom. Terzyme uses sequence information, plant taxonomy and machine learning methods for predicting TPSs and PTs in genome and proteome datasets. We demonstrate a significant enrichment of the currently identified terpenome by running Terzyme on more than 40 plants. Conclusions:Terzyme is the result of a rigorous analysis of evolutionary relationships between hundreds of characterized sequences of TPSs and PTs with known specificities, followed by analysis of genome-wide gene distribution patterns, ontology based clustering and optimization of various parameters for building accurate profile Hidden Markov Models. The predictive webserver and database is freely available at http://nipgr.res.in/terzyme.html and would serve as a useful tool for deciphering the species-specific phytochemical potential of plant genomes.","['Pathway Mapping', 'Phytochemicals', 'Terpene Synthase (Tps)', 'Hidden Markov Models (Hmm)', 'Terpenome', 'Go Clustering', 'Prenyl Transferase (Pt)']","['TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS sequences', 'gene family', 'sequences', 'synthases', 'Table', 'diterpene synthases', 'TPS gene', 'TPS genes']","[prenyl transferases, sesqui-TPSs, TPSa, prenyl transferases, prenyl transferases, TPSa, TPSb, TPSd, TPSe_f, PTs, PTs, TPSs, TPSd, HMMs, prenyl transferase, HMMs, TPSa, HMMs, HMMs, PDBID 25JC, Di-TPSs (PDB ID 3P5P, PDBID 3M00, sesqui-TPSs, HMMs, HMMs, HMMs, parallel-scan, Sesqui-TPSs, PANTHER, Terzyme, TPSs, Terpene_synth, Terpene_synth_C, PTHR31376, Terpenoid synthase, PTHR31225, PTHR11439, PTHR31739, Terpenoid synthase, N terminal domain, C-terminal metal binding domain, Terpene_synth_C (, Terzyme, Terzyme, Terzyme, 1,573,395, Terzyme, browse-able terpenome, Terzyme, prenyl transferases, ‘, ’, Terzyme, HMMs, HMMs, TPSa, TPSb, TPSd, PTs, HMMs, DiTPSs, Cycloartenol synthase, SQCY, class II TPSs, CPS/KS, prenyl transferases, TPSa, TPSd, mono/bifunctional CPSs, Terzyme, Class II Copalyl diphosphate, CPS, Class-I, Terzyme, TPSe_f, CPS, C, 30–50, class I, V)X, T)XXX E, ‘NSE/DTE, class II, Class I, Class II TPSs, TERZYME, DiTPSs, Class I DiTPS—, Aspartate rich motif (DDXXD/E, Non-aspartate, V)X, T)XXX E, Class II, Class I, Class II, Terzyme, ‘, ’, ’, ‘, ’, mono/bifunctional CPS, TPSe_f, hydrolases (37 cases, single-stranded DNA, sesqui-TPS, Terzyme, DiTPSs, bornyl-diphosphate synthase, germacrene A synthase, MonoTPS, DiTPS, SesquiTPS, IGMAP]","['TPS', 'sesqui-TPSs)', 'TPSa', 'TPSg', 'TPSa,', 'TPSb,', 'TPSc,', 'TPSd,', 'TPSe_f', 'TPSg', 'TPS', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPSd', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPSa', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'Di-TPSs', 'sesqui-TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'Sesqui-TPSs,', 'TPSs', '(TPSa-TPSe/f).', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS,', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSa,', 'TPSb,', 'TPSc,', 'TPSd,', 'TPSe_f', 'TPSg', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'DiTPSs', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPSs,', 'TPSa', 'TPSc', 'TPSs', 'TPSd', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSc', 'monoTPS,', 'diTPS', 'sesqui-TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSc', 'TPSe_f', 'Di-TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'DiTPS', 'TPSs.', 'DiTPSs', 'DiTPS—If', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSc', 'TPSe_f', 'TPSs,', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'di-TPSs', 'sesqui-TPS', 'di-TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs.', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'DiTPSs.', 'MonoTPS,', 'DiTPS', 'SesquiTPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS']",[],[],terpene synthase
61,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5770638\eupmc_result.json,PMC5770638,"Results Isolation of Antimicrobial Producing Bacteria and Bacteria Identification In total, 342 isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity against  S. meliloti and  Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which are closely related to Las ( Duan et al., 2009). Six isolates were observed to produce a growth inhibition zone, indicating antibacterial production, and were selected for further analysis ( Figures   1A,B). Identification of the antibiotic-producing bacteria was performed by amplifying the 16s rRNA gene. All amplicons obtained were 1350 bp or longer and were analyzed using the prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene sequence database EzTaxon ( Kim et al., 2012). The closest type strain reported with the highest score was collected for further phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Table  1). In total, 12 sequences were recorded and the resulting alignment was used to construct a phylogenetic tree ( Figure   1C). Four of the six strains belong to the proteobacteria phylum, the most abundant phylum in the citrus microbiome ( Zhang et al., 2017), with  Burkholderia metallica strain A53 and  Burkholderia territorii strain A63 within the β-proteobacteria class, whereas  Pseudomonas granadensis strain 100 and  Pseudomonas geniculata strain 95 within the γ-proteobacteria class. Additionally, two gram-positive bacteria were identified:  Rhodococcus jialingiae strain 108 and  Bacillus pumilus strain 104 belonging to the Actinobacteria and Firmicutes phyla, respectively. These six selected strains were further characterized for other beneficial features such as siderophore production and phosphate solubilization (Supplementary Table  2). Notably,  Burkholderia metallica strain A53 was able to solubilize phosphate and  P. granadensis strain 100 was positive for siderophore production. Antimicrobial Activity against Phytophthora spp. and Citrus Pathogenic Fungi It has been reported that Las infection in the root could make fibrous roots predisposed to  P. nicotianae secondary infections ( Graham et al., 2013). HLB may have more severe effect on fibrous root health when  P. nicotianae is present ( Wang et al., 2017b). Although the mechanisms behind this interaction are yet to be fully understood, one possible reason is that there is a higher attraction of  P. nicotianae zoospores to Las infected roots ( Wang et al., 2017b). In the competitive and complex root system, rhizospheric bacteria capable of inhibiting zoospores germination or hyphae growth may provide the plant with a competitive advantage to protect itself against  P. nicotianae infection. Therefore, it is interesting to understand the antimicrobial activity for all six strains against  P. nicotianae and  P. palmivora, which cause root rot (both species) and foot rot ( P. nicotianae only). We also evaluated their antifungal activity against three citrus pathogenic fungi,  Alternaria alternata,  Colletotrichum acutatum, and  Phyllosticta citricarpa, which belong to the phylum Ascomycote and affect aerial tissues of the tree. In dual culture antagonist assays, we observed that  Bacillus pumilus strain 104 significantly inhibited the growth of  P. nicotianae and  P. palmivora ( Figure   2), whereas  Burkholderia spp. strains A53 and A63 only slightly inhibited their growth. Both  Burkholderia metallica strain A53 and  Burkholderia territorii strain A63 exhibited strong  in vitro antifungal activity against  A. alternata and  C. acutatum. Consistently, both strains were able to inhibit fungal growth of  Phyllosticta citricarpa and  C. acutatum in an overlay assay (Supplementary Figures  1A,B). Interestingly,  Bacillus pumilus strain 104 and both  Burkholderia spp. strains were able to inhibit  Phytophthora nicotianae growth in overlay assays with zoospores suggesting that they may inhibit spore germination (Supplementary Figure  1C). Similar results were observed with  Bacillus pumilus strain 104, which completely inhibited fungal growth when challenged against  P. citricarpa in the overlay assay (Supplementary Figure  1B). Dual culture compartmentalized petri dishes were used to explore the possible antimicrobial activity by volatiles.  Bacillus pumilus strain 104,  R. jialingiae strain 108, and  P. geniculata strain 95 were able to significantly reduce mycelial growth of  Phytophthora nicotianae in compartmentalized cultures ( Figure   3). General Features of the Genomes The draft genomes of the four bacterial strains were obtained by using Illumina HiSeq2000 technology and  de novo assembly. General information for the four draft genome sequences is summarized in  Table   1. The mean coverage was 319× for  Bacillus pumilus in 33 contigs. The GC content for  Bacillus pumilus was 41.9% and the total genome size 3.7 Mb. RAST annotation identified 3894 features in this genome. The mean coverage was 411× for  P. geniculata in 294 contigs.  P. geniculata draft genome has a GC content of 65.8% and a genome size of 5.1 Mb.  Burkholderia territorii (8.9 Mb) and  Burkholderia metallica (8.2 Mb) draft genomes have a mean coverage of 105× and 112×, respectively. RAST annotation identified 8366, 7722, and 4615 features in  Burkholderia territorii,  Burkholderia metallica, and  P. geniculata draft genomes, respectively. Genes Responsible for Beneficial Traits The PATRIC database was used to search for genes typically involved in beneficial traits for the four strains. Namely, genes reported to be involved in phosphate solubilization, siderophore production and iron acquisition, VOC production, osmoprotection and osmotic tolerance, phytohormone production, antagonism, and nutrient competition were searched within the four genomes ( Figures   4,  5 and Supplementary Figure  2). Phosphate Solubilization and Iron Acquisition Burkholderia metallica strain A53 was capable of phosphate solubilization (Supplementary Table  2). In the genomic content, it harbors a phospholipase C that may account for the  in vitro phosphate solubilization activity ( Figure   4). Genes involved in siderophore production and iron acquisition are presented in  Figure   5. Even though  P. geniculata strain 95 does not produce siderophore in CAS media, it harbors more than 50 genes coding for TonB-dependent receptors (TBDR). TBDR are specialized receptors that transport siderophore-iron complexes in the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria ( Cornelis, 2013). The presence of these receptors allows bacteria to sequester iron complexes produced from other organisms ( Hartney et al., 2013). The overrepresentation of this feature in the genomic sequence has also been described in other relevant beneficial rhizobacteria from  Pseudomonas and  Stenotrophomonas genera ( Berg et al., 2013;  Cornelis, 2013). Osmoprotection and Osmotic Tolerance Many beneficial rhizospheric bacteria produce osmolytes that do not interfere with cellular functions, are highly soluble and can serve as osmoprotectors in drought stress conditions ( Berg et al., 2013). Key players in this protection are trehalose and glucosylglycerol and some of the genes known to be involved in their biosynthesis are listed in Supplementary Figure  2. Alpha, alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase, and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase are two enzymes important for the synthesis of trehalose, and both genes are present in  P. geniculata strain 95 and the two  Burkholderia strains A53 and A63. Phytohormone Production 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACC deaminase) is known to regulate plant development by reducing levels of the plant hormone ethylene ( Glick, 2005). ACC deaminase was found in the genomes of  B. metallica strain A53 and  B. territorii strain A63 ( Figure   4). ACC deaminase is widely present in the  Burkholderia genus ( Onofre-Lemus et al., 2009). The promoting activity of some plant growth-promoting bacteria is due to their ability to produce indole acetic acid (IAA), a phytohormone important for plant growth. The six antimicrobial-producing strains selected in this study were neither able to produce IAA nor to promote seed germination of tomato, corn, or soybean (data not shown). IAA production in bacteria involves at least three different pathways. Two of the best-characterized pathways use tryptophan as substrate: the indole-3-acetamide (IAM) pathway and the indole-3-pyruvate pathway. Additionally, there is a tryptophan-independent pathway. Consistent with our experimental data, the four sequenced bacteria lack most genes for IAA synthesis. However, indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase and indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase were found in the two  Burkholderia strains and in  P. geniculata strain 95. The former gene is found in Archaea. The latter gene has been associated with IAA biosynthesis by the tryptophan-independent pathway in  Arabidopsis thaliana ( Ouyang et al., 2000;  Devi et al., 2015). Antagonism and Nutrient Competition Apart from the production of metabolites and phytohormones, an important role of the beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere is the competition for nutrients, and their role in organic matter decomposition ( Kamilova et al., 2005). Some enzymes such as cellulases, proteases, and glucanases are important for carbon cycling as well as antagonism of fungal pathogens ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 2014). Therefore, the presence of glucanases, cellulases, and pectinases was investigated in the four genomes. Endo-1,4-beta-xylanase Z precursor, cellulase, and degenerated pectate lyase were found in the two  Burkholderia strains. Similarly, 1,3-1,4-beta- D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase, cellulase, pectate lyase, xylanase, and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase A precursor were identified in  Bacillus pumilus strain 104 ( Figure   4). Apart from their role in competition for nutrients, some of these enzymes may have a role in antagonizing fungal or oomycete pathogens because they can degrade cell walls. For instance, the presence of cellulase gene in  Bacillus pumilus strain 104,  Burkholderia metallica strain A53, and  Burkholderia territorii strain A63 could potentially explain the antagonistic activity against  P. nicotianae in vitro that was not seen for  P. geniculata strain 95 ( Figure   2). Enzymes Involved in VOC Production In vitro antagonism assay results suggest that  Bacillus pumilus strain 104,  P. geniculata strain 95, and  R. jialingiae strain 108 produce VOCs that inhibit  Phytophthora mycelium growth.  Bacillus is known to produce acetoin and 2,3-butanediol as byproducts of incomplete oxidation of pyruvate and α-acetolactate ( Effmert et al., 2012). The genomic sequence of  B. pumilus strain 104 harbors the gene for 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.4) that catalyses the production of 2,3-butanediol from 2-acetoin and the reverse reaction as well. This enzyme is also present in  Burkholderia metallica strain A53 and  Burkholderia territorii strain A63. Additionally, the gene that encodes the acetolactate synthase small subunit (EC 2.2.1.6) is present in all four strains.  Bacillus pumilus strain 104 is the only one of the four strains that contains the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.5) important for the synthesis of 2-acetoin from acetolactate (Supplementary Figure  3). Some rhizospheric bacteria taxonomically related to  P. geniculata strain 95 are able to produce VOCs. Namely, it has been reported that some  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains isolated from soil, where tobacco was grown, were able to produce benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, and phenol as part of their active VOCs ( Gu et al., 2007;  Zou et al., 2007). These compounds were found to have both nematicidal as well as fungicidal activities. In  P. geniculata strain 95 a putative benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.28) was identified which catalyzes the production of methyl benzoate. Methyl benzoate is an active volatile that has been reported in other bacteria such as  Streptomyces spp. and  Stigmatella spp. ( Schulz and Dickschat, 2007). Antimicrobial Biosynthesis Gene Clusters A genome mining approach using AntiSMASH (version 3.0) tool was used to identify putative antibiotic biosynthesis gene clusters that could potentially explain the observed antimicrobial activity. The software predicted 10 clusters for  B. pumilus strain 104, 9 for  P. geniculata strain 95, and 15 clusters for each of the  Burkholderia sp. strains (Supplementary Table  4). Bacillus pumilus strain 104 contains two clusters of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes and one NRPS-PK hybrid gene cluster. One NRPS cluster identified had 95% gene similarity to the lychensyn biosynthetic gene cluster from  B. pumilus strain 7P and is highly conserved within  Bacillus. In addition, AntiSMASH software predicted a possible chemical structure for the identified lipopeptide (LP) (Supplementary Figure  4). Another NRPS cluster shares 53% gene similarity with the bacillibactin biosynthetic gene cluster. The NRPS-PK hybrid gene cluster has 85% gene similarity with the bacilysin biosynthetic gene cluster, a metabolite that has strong antibacterial effect against  Erwinia amylovora and  Xanthomonas oryzae, two phytopathogenic γ-proteobacteria ( Chen et al., 2009;  Wu et al., 2015). We also identified microcin, bacteriocin, and terpene gene clusters. A total of nine gene clusters responsible for antimicrobial production were identified in the genome of  P. geniculata strain 95. Among them, two clusters encode lantipeptides, one for lassopeptide, two for arylpolyene, two for bacteriocin, one for microcin, and one for NRPS. One lantipeptide gene cluster includes a lanthionine synthase C family gene and two leader/core peptide genes. This gene cluster also contains two regulatory genes: a sensor histidine kinase gene and a LuxR family DNA-binding response regulator gene downstream of the biosynthetic genes. For the second lantibiotic cluster no structure genes was identified. Lantibiotics are peptidic antimicrobial compounds produced in the ribosomes that undergo numerous post-transcriptional modifications. Lantibiotics were known to be produced by many gram-positive bacteria but lately they have been associated with other groups ( Knerr and van der Donk, 2012). The lantibiotics predicted in  P. geniculata strain 95 belongs to the class II of lantibiotics, produced by LanM-like proteins. LanM-like proteins are bifunctional proteins that assess the maturation of the leader peptide and the cyclation activity. According to  in silico studies now it is known that  lanM-like genes are wide spread in bacteria ( Knerr and van der Donk, 2012). In each  Burkholderia strain, 15 clusters were identified to encode NRPSs, bacteriocin, PKS, terpene, phenazine, arylpolyene, phosphonate, etoin, and Hserlactone. Notably, both strains harbor the complete pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis cluster. Pyrrolnitrin is a well-characterized compound produced by many  Pseudomonas and  Burkholderia strains with strong antifungal and antibacterial activity ( Hwang et al., 2002).","The microbiome associated with crop plants has a strong impact on their health and productivity.  Candidatus  Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), the bacterial pathogen responsible for Huanglongbing (HLB) disease, lives inside the phloem of citrus plants including the root system. It has been suggested that Las negatively affects citrus microbiome. On the other hand, members of citrus microbiome also influence the interaction between Las and citrus. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of multiple putative beneficial bacteria from healthy citrus rhizosphere. Firstly, six bacterial strains showing antibacterial activity against two bacteria closely related to Las:  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  and  Sinorhizobium meliloti  were selected. Among them,  Burkholderia metallica  strain A53 and  Burkholderia territorii  strain A63 are within the β-proteobacteria class, whereas  Pseudomonas granadensis  strain 100 and  Pseudomonas geniculata  strain 95 are within the γ-proteobacteria class. Additionally, two gram-positive bacteria  Rhodococcus jialingiae  strain 108 and  Bacillus pumilus  strain 104 were also identified. Secondly, antimicrobial activity against three fungal pathogens:  Alternaria alternata ,  Colletotrichum acutatum ,  Phyllosticta citricarpa , and two oomycetes:  Phytophthora nicotianae  and  Phytophthora palmivora.  Four bacterial strains  Burkholderia territorii  A63,  Burkholderia metallica  A53,  Pseudomonas geniculata  95, and  Bacillus pumilus  104 were shown to have antagonistic activity against the citrus root pathogen  Phytophthora nicotianae  based on dual culture antagonist assays and compartmentalized petri dish assays. The four selected bacteria were sequenced. Genes involved in phosphate solubilization, siderophore production and iron acquisition, volatile organic compound production, osmoprotection and osmotic tolerance, phytohormone production, antagonism, and nutrient competition were predicted and discussed related to the beneficial traits.","['Citrus', 'Antimicrobial', 'Antifungal compounds', 'Microbiome', 'Plant Growth-promoting Bacteria (Pgpb)', 'Hlb']","['Supplementary Figure', 'strain', 'Burkholderia', 'Bacillus pumilus', 'pumilus strain', 'geniculata strain', 'Burkholderia metallica', 'Figure', 'Burkholderia strains', 'gene']","[prokaryotic 16S, territorii, A63, γ-proteobacteria, jialingiae, 2017b, 2017b, Ascomycote, territorii, A63, jialingiae, ×, RAST, territorii, PATRIC, phospholipase C, TonB-dependent receptors, Alpha, alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase, A63, 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase, ACC deaminase, territorii, A63, Onofre-Lemus, indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, cellulases, glucanases, glucanases, cellulases, Endo-1,4-beta-xylanase Z, cellulase, pectate lyase, cellulase, pectate lyase, xylanase, endo-1,4-beta-xylanase A, cellulase, territorii, A63, jialingiae, α-acetolactate ( Effmert et, 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, territorii, A63, acetolactate synthase small subunit, alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase, acetolactate (Supplementary Figure, benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, AntiSMASH, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, lychensyn, AntiSMASH, microcin, bacteriocin, bacteriocin, microcin, leader/core peptide, class II, lantibiotics, LanM-like, NRPSs, bacteriocin, etoin, Hserlactone]",[],"['C.', 'C.']",['Citrus'],NaN

We studied the chemical profile, within-flower spatial distribution (sepals, petals, pistils with stamina and pedicels), diurnal emission kinetics and effects of exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) application on the emission of floral volatiles by dynamic headspace collection and identification using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). We observed more abundant floral emissions from flowers compared with leaves. Sepals were the main emitters of floral volatiles among the flower parts studied. The emissions of lipoxygenase compounds (LOX) and monoterpenoids, but not sesquiterpene emissions, displayed a diurnal variation driven by light. Response to exogenous MeJA treatment of flowers consisted of a rapid stress response and a longer-term acclimation response. The initial response was associated with enhanced emissions of fatty acid derivatives, monoterpenoids, and sesquiterpenoids without variation of the composition of individual compounds. The longer-term response was associated with enhanced monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid emissions with profound changes in the emission spectrum. According to correlated patterns of terpenoid emission changes upon stress, highlighted by a hierarchical cluster analysis, candidate terpenoid synthases responsible for observed diversity and complexity of released terpenoid blends were postulated. We conclude that flower volatile emissions differ quantitatively and qualitatively from leaf emissions, and overall contribute importantly to O. basilicum flavor, especially under stress conditions.","['Biosynthesis', 'Terpenoids', 'Floral Volatiles', 'Emission Dynamics', 'Methyl Jasmonate Treatments']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN
63,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5792587\eupmc_result.json,PMC5792587,"Results Meta-analysis of transcriptome data We determined the list of the up- and down-regulated genes and we compared these lists in order to identify common and different regulated genes between the 7 studied research works dealing with biotic stress responses. We have normalized the data using the same log Fold change and p-values (log2 FC > 1 or log2 FC < −1; p-value < 0.05)(Supplementary Table  1).Venn diagrams showed the numbers of specific and commonly regulated genes between the three types of biotic stresses in Malus (Supplementary Figure  1). We found that 16 genes were commonly regulated in responses to fungal pathogens, virus (Apple Stem Grooving Virus) and bacteria (Erwinia amylovora). Gene ontology analysis Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was conducted to explore other possible functions of the differentially expressed genes in different biotic stress conditions. Pie charts showing the distribution of upregulated and downregulated GO-terms in biological processes for each of the three types of biotic stresses were generated (Fig.  1). It is clear that Apple Stem Grooving Virus (ASGV) upregulated a higher percentage of GO-terms related to transcription regulation, response to chitin and phosphorylation. Percentage of upregulated GO-terms related to ethylene and jasmonic acid defense responses were higher in response to Erwinia amylovora (E. amylovora) than to fungal pathogens. Oxidation- reduction pathways were strongly repressed in response to fungal pathogens. In the enrichment analysis, strong differences were observed between the three types of stresses in relation to repressed GO-terms. While fungal pathogens inhibited hormone-related genes, photosynthesis, responses to abiotic stresses, E. amylovora reduced responses to xyloglucan metabolic process, actin, cellular responses to gravity and lipid transport. Virus infection specifically repressed jasmonic acid-related GO terms, response to bacterium and fungal pathogens. Gene set enrichment analysis Gene enrichment analysis was carried out using pageman 9 to identify any relation between the expression and function of differentially expressed genes in different biotic stress conditions (Fig.  2). As expected, E. amylovora and fungal pathogens repressed photosynthesis-related genes such as those involved in photosystem II. Adenylpyrophosphatase (ATPase), photorespiration, calvin cycle and major CHO metabolism were significantly inhibited by fungal pathogens while genes encoding electron carriers were repressed by E. amylovora. Cell wall genes were downregulated in all the three datasets. Fungal pathogens upregulated several gene set categories involved in both primary and secondary metabolism including amino acids (glutamate, aromatic ones), flavonoids and isoprenoid mevalonate pathway. PR-proteins and other stress related proteins were upregulated by fungal pathogens. Relating to hormones, brassinosteroids were induced by fungal pathogens while E. amylovora enhanced ethylene gene set category. Jasmonate was repressed by fungal and viral infections. Most of the transcription factors were induced by fungal pathogens such as AP2-EREBP, WRKYs and ARRs. Ubiquitine-mediated degradation was mainly upregulated by fungal pathogens. Different gene transport-related categories were repressed by different types of pathogens: transporters in envelope membrane by fungal pathogens while metal transporters were downregulated by E. amylovora. Overall, the gene set enrichment analysis identified additional responses due to various biotic stresses in Malus. Metabolism overview We used Mapman 10 web-tool to visualize the metabolome changes in Malus X domestica due to biotic stress by using the transcriptomic data of the 7 datasets. Metabolism overview clearly showed the high number of downregulated genes by fungal pathogens involved in light reactions, photorespiration, calvin cycle, photorespiration and tetrapyrrole pathways (Fig.  3, Supplementary Table  8). There were several genes commonly related between at least two of the three types of pathogens such as those genes related to phosynthesis: cholorophyll binding (LHB1B1, LHCB2.2), photorespiration-related genes (FC1, GUN4), large and small subunits of Rubisco Protein (RBCL, RBCS), rubisco activase. Several genes were induced by fungal pathogens involved in TCA cycle, detoxifying mechanisms (ascorbate and glutathione), gluconeogenesis, starch and fermentation, lipid metabolism. On contrast, E.amylovora and viruses repressed genes involved in cell wall modifications. Although three genes were commonly regulated by more than one stress, E. amylovora seems to induce specific expression changes in sugar alcohol metabolism. As far the secondary metabolism concerns, an induction of genes involved in phenylpropanoids and phenolics were mostly induced by fungal pathogens. Ten genes involved in terpene pathways were commonly regulated. Degradation of nucleotides were mostly enhanced by fungal pathogens. In contrast, Mapman 10 displays large gene expression datasets from different studies in a single metabolic pathway diagram, which help us to easily identify the key genes and its details in different functional categories (Fig.  3). Hormone-related pathways It is very important to study the plant hormonal responses because the signaling pathways of different hormones regulate biotic stress responses antagonistically. We observed that several genes involved in auxin(IAA), benzyl-adenine (BA), ethylene, jasmonate, saliciylic acid (SA) were commonly affected in all types of pathogens. Fungal pathogens upregulated ethylene, benzyl-adenine, salicylic acid while mainly repressed jasmonate-related genes. Erwinia amylovora upregulated ethylene and gibberellin-related (GA) genes while viruses affected some key genes involved in ethylene and auxins. The results suggest that the hormone-related pathways and consequently their crosstalk was profoundly affected by all Malus pathogens (Fig.  4, Supplementary Table  8). Detoxifying pathways and secondary metabolism It is very important to study the underlying detoxification factors and signaling mechanism behind plant defense against biotic stress tolerance. We found that the genes encoding Cytochrome P450 were commonly affected by all three types of pathogens (Supplementary Figure  2, Supplementary Table  8). Fungal pathogens induced UDP Glycosyltransferases, Phosphatases, Nitrilases, Glutathione-S-transferases. In addition to UDP-Glycosyltransferases, viruses mainly enhanced the expressions of Oxidases and Glutathione-S-transferases. Alcohol dehydrogenases, Nitrilases, O-Methyltransferases and Peroxidases genes were upregulated by Erwinia amylovora. Two genes encoding GDSL-lipases were commonly regulated by all the three types of pathogens. Clear differences in pattern regulation were observed for fungal pathogens in relation to secondary metabolism gene categories (Fig.  5, Supplementary Table  8). While Phenlypropanoids, Shikimate pathway, Dihydroflavonols, MVA pathway, Simple phenols were mostly induced, Non-MVA pathway, Carotenoids were repressed. On the other hand, Erwinia amylovora mostly upregulated the genes in Chalcones metabolism and MVA pathway. Overall, we observed that the biotic stress influenced the secondary metabolites in Malus X domestica, since these are the compounds which are important for the plant to interact with the environment for adaptation and defense. Transcription factors and defense stress-related genes We used Mapman 10 software to understand the influence of biotic stress in metabolism, hormone regulation, large enzyme families, secondary metabolism and transcription factors. As far as it concerns, transcription factors were drastically affected by the three types of stresses (Fig.  6, Supplementary Table  8). RAP2.3, ERF110, CRF4, four RAP2.4, six AP2 domain-containing transcription factor family proteins, two CEJ1 and one unknown protein in AP2-EREBP were upregulated by fungal pathogens. GRAS factors (SCL1, SCL3, RGA1, SCL13), MADS box (AGL8, AGL24, AGL20, AGL42), C2H2 (MGP, STZ,SEU,STOP1), Psudo ARR (PRR7, PRR5, PRR1) were enhanced by fungal necrotrophic pathogens. Viruses specifically induced some key genes encoding two AP2-EREBPs (AP2, TEM1), two C2H2(RHL41, zinc ion binding), two HB (GL2, BLH3), two trihelix factors (GT2, trihelix DNA-binding protein). Erwinia amylovora upregulated specifically MYB factors (MYB42, MYB15, MYB14, AtMYB111, DNA binding, AtMYB74, MYB33, MYB62) and JUMONJI (cyclin-like F box, jmjC). The complete gene information of the transcription factors were given in Supplementary Table  8. As expected WRKYs were mostly induced by all 3 kind of biotic attacks (Supplementary Table  2). WRKY11, WRKY32, WRKY33, WRKY35, WRKY40, WRKY6, WRKY65, WRKY69, WRKY70, WRKY72, WRKY75 and TTG2 were induced by at least one of the 5 fungal pathogens. WRKY53, WRKY70 and WRKY35 were enhanced by ASGV. WRKY75, WRKY33 were specifically induced by E. amylovora. Other genes involved in biotic stress responses were drastically affected by all the three types of stresses. One gene involved in respiratory burst was commonly regulated (Supplementary Figure  3, Supplementary Table  8). Four signaling MLO-like genes were upregulated by fungal pathogens while one was induced by E. amylovora and one was commonly regulated between stresses. In general it is clear that pathogenesis-related proteins were more induced by fungal pathogens than viruses and E. amylovora. Fungi-driven upregulated genes belonged to TIR-NBS-LRR, ATP binding, CC-NBS-LRR, ADR1-L1, RPP1. Four PR-related genes were induced only by E. amylovora while only one disease resistance gene was commonly regulated. Our results demonstrated that most of the transcription factors and defense stress-related genes were influenced by all types of biotic stresses and also identified the crucial genes response to each type of biotic stress conditions. Commonly regulated genes among biotic stresses It is very important to find the genes which are regulated unique to each type of biotic stress and also commonly regulated by all types of biotic stresses. We found that a total of 322 genes were commonly affected by at least 2 of the 3 types of biotic stresses (Supplementary Table  3, Fig.  3, Supplementary Table  8). These genes represent common responses to stresses and might be helpful to characterize general stress responses in Malus. A great number of these genes were linked with the repression of photosynthesis. Eight genes involved in minor CHO metabolism were affected. Terpenes were affected by all three stresses such as acetyl-coa thiolase2, hydroxyl methylglutaryl coa reductase 1 (HMG1), farnesyl diphosphate synthase1, lyase – magnesium ion binding, beta-amyrin. Also MVA pathway was affected by the three stresses as shown by the differential expression of HMG1, MK, FPS1, ACAT2, Acetyl-CoA (Fig.  3, Supplementary Table  8). Four WRKYs were commonly regulated by at least 2 of 3 types of pathogens: WRKY40, WRKY75, WRKY33, WRKY35 and WRKY70 (Supplementary Table  2). This is a very significant information to identify the targets for genetic modification to improve plant resistance to multiple biotic stresses. Inferred protein-protein interaction network analysis To understand the degree of conservation in the protein-protein interaction in Malus X domestica in different biotic stress conditions, we visualized the network of the 100 top highly interactive proteins for each of the three types of biotic stresses. The list of top 20 highly interactive proteins of each groups were given in Supplementary Table  4. Arabidopsis orthologs of the Malus pathogen-regulated genes were determined and the protein-protein interactions were determined basing a combined file of inferred and validated interactions 11 (Supplementary Table  5). The network was visualized using STRING 12 software (Version 10.0). A highly dense core of 22–23 highly interactive proteins was observed on the top of the network of fungal pathogens (Fig.  7a). Some well-known proteins players in biotic stress responses were noticed such as WRKY40, WRKY18 and WRKY6. These proteins were connected with MPK3 and MPK4. Relating to ASGV infection, MYC2, GRX480, JAZ1, PCL1, RHL41, WRKY53 were hub proteins of this network. Of them only MYC2 was also present in other biotic stresses (E. amylovora). Four HSPs were significantly regulated by virus infections and strictly connected each other (Fig.  7b). A small network composed of four interactive proteins such as RPL2.1, RPL2.2, ATCG00790.1 and AT1G47670 in ASGV was overlapping with fungal pathogen network. NPR1 was present in the virus-affected Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network together with the well-known interactive protein GRX480. E. amylovora affected a network connected with five highly interactive genes such as MYC2, WRKY40, WRKY33, BCB, SYP121 and AT5G46630 (Fig.  7c). Some key highly interactive ubiquitin proteins were observed in the network such as UBQ10. Sixteen E. amylovora proteins regulated at transcriptional level were commonly present also in at least one of the other stresses. The protein-protein interaction network analysis helped to minimize the complexity in understanding physical interaction between proteins due to different biotic stresses.","RNA-Seq analysis is a strong tool to gain insight into the molecular responses to biotic stresses in plants. The objective of this work is to identify specific and common molecular responses between different transcriptomic data related to fungi, virus and bacteria attacks in Malus x domestica. We analyzed seven transcriptomic datasets in Malus x domestica divided in responses to fungal pathogens, virus (Apple Stem Grooving Virus) and bacteria (Erwinia amylovora). Data were dissected using an integrated approach of pathway- and gene- set enrichment analysis, Mapman visualization tool, gene ontology analysis and inferred protein-protein interaction network. Our meta-analysis revealed that the bacterial infection enhanced specifically genes involved in sugar alcohol metabolism. Brassinosteroids were upregulated by fungal pathogens while ethylene was highly affected by Erwinia amylovora. Gibberellins and jasmonates were strongly repressed by fungal and viral infections. The protein-protein interaction network highlighted the role of WRKYs in responses to the studied pathogens. In summary, our meta-analysis provides a better understanding of the Malus X domestica transcriptome responses to different biotic stress conditions; we anticipate that these insights will assist in the development of genetic resistance and acute therapeutic strategies. This work would be an example for next meta-analysis works aiming at identifying specific common molecular features linked with biotic stress responses in other specialty crops.",NaN,"['Supplementary Table', 'fungal pathogens', 'genes', 'pathogens', 'fungal', 'Supplementary', 'Table', 'biotic stress', 'biotic', 'biotic stresses']","[log2 FC , log2 FC , chitin, Oxidation-, hormone-related, actin, pageman 9, photosystem II, ATPase, glutamate, AP2-EREBP, WRKYs, ARRs, Ubiquitine-mediated, metal transporters, Malus X domestica, LHCB2.2, photorespiration-related, Rubisco Protein, RBCL, RBCS, rubisco activase, E.amylovora, auxin(IAA, benzyl-adenine, saliciylic acid, benzyl-adenine, jasmonate-related, Cytochrome P450, Phosphatases, Glutathione-S-transferases, UDP-Glycosyltransferases, Glutathione-S-transferases, Alcohol dehydrogenases, Peroxidases, Phenlypropanoids, Dihydroflavonols, Non-MVA, Carotenoids, Malus X domestica, ERF110, CRF4, RAP2.4, AP2, AP2-EREBP, SCL1, RGA1, SCL13, AGL24, AGL20, AGL42, MGP, SEU, STOP1, Psudo, PRR7, PRR5, PRR1, AP2-EREBPs, AP2, TEM1, GL2, GT2, MYB, MYB42, MYB15, AtMYB111, AtMYB74, MYB33, JUMONJI (cyclin-like F, jmjC, WRKYs, WRKY11, WRKY32, WRKY33, WRKY35, WRKY40, WRKY6, WRKY65, WRKY69, WRKY70, WRKY72, WRKY75, TTG2, WRKY70, WRKY35, WRKY75, WRKY33, MLO-like, TIR-NBS-LRR, CC-NBS-LRR, ADR1-L1, RPP1, acetyl-coa thiolase2, HMG1, farnesyl diphosphate synthase1, lyase – magnesium, HMG1, MK, FPS1, ACAT2, WRKYs, WRKY40, WRKY75, WRKY33, WRKY35, WRKY70, Malus X domestica, STRING, WRKY40, WRKY18, WRKY6, MPK3, MPK4, MYC2, GRX480, JAZ1, PCL1, RHL41, MYC2, HSPs, RPL2.1, RPL2.2, ATCG00790.1, AT1G47670, NPR1, GRX480, MYC2, WRKY40, WRKY33, SYP121, AT5G46630 (Fig.  7c, ubiquitin, UBQ10]",[],[],[],NaN
64,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5802726\eupmc_result.json,PMC5802726,"Results and discussion Isolation of highly purified elaioplasts from kumquat peel with density gradient centrifugations Kumquat, a major citrus cultivar in southern China, bears the smallest fruits in the  Citrus genus. Ripened fruits can be eaten as a whole (Fig.  1a), and elaioplasts with several plastoglobules were frequently found in the outer peel (Fig.  1b). In this study, we initially isolated elaioplasts from the outer peel of kumquat. The recovered pellet containing elaioplasts was separated into four fractions on a discontinuous gradient comprising 0.75, 0.92, 1.20, 1.50 M sucrose (Fig.  2a). The elaioplasts pooled from band 1 were characterized by abundant colorless plastids with several sphere substructures clustering together, and their sizes ranged from 1 to 4 μm as measured under light microscopy and TEM (Fig.  2b, c). Analysis of the other bands indicated they were contaminated by either cell debris with few elaioplasts, or chloroplasts (Supplementary Figure  S1). The purity of the elaioplast-enriched protein fractions was monitored by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against marker proteins for the plastid stroma (RbcL), cytosol (UDPase), vacuole (V-ATPase), and mitochondrion (VDAC1), as well as chloroplast (Lhca1 and Lhca4). As shown in Fig.  3, proteins extracted from the purified elaioplast fraction readily reacted with the antibody of RbcL. By contrast, no reaction could be detected with the cytosolic UGPase, mitochondrial VDAC1, or vacuolar V-ATPase. Additionally, no reaction was detected with antibodies to PSI type I chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (Lhca1 and Lhca4) involved in photosynthesis within the chloroplasts. Reactions with these antibodies were observed in the total proteins extracted from the kumquat peel which contained both chloroplasts and elaioplasts. The above results suggest that the isolated elaioplasts used for the subsequent proteome analysis were of high purity without contamination by mitochondria, cytosol, vacuole, and chloroplasts. An inventory of proteins in elaioplasts by functional classification and subcellular localization We conducted a comprehensive proteomic analysis to characterize the proteins found in elaioplasts. A total of 1239 proteins with at least two detected peptides in two bio-replicates, were identified from purified elaioplasts. The raw data obtained from the elaioplast proteins were refined by searches against five plastid databanks (Plprot, AT-CHLORO, SUBA, PPDB, and Uniprot) and by three targeting predictors (WoLF PSORT, Predotar, and Target P). Based on the chosen criteria for plastid-localized proteins (Materials and Methods), an inventory of 655 putative plastid proteins was constructed, accounting for 52% of all identified proteins (Supplementary Table  S1). Among them, 562 proteins (accounting for 85.8% of these identified proteins) were predicted to be plastid targeted by at least one predictor program. WoLF PSORT, Target P, and Predotar predicted plastid-localization of 76.0% (498 proteins), 38.2% (250 proteins), and 31.9% (209 proteins) of the 655 identified proteins, respectively. Two hundred and twenty-nine proteins (35.0%) were predicted to be plastid targeted by at least two predictors, suggesting that these proteins are highly likely to be plastid localized. As shown in Supplementary Table  S1 and in Fig.  4, the 655 putative elaioplast proteins were categorized into 32 functional classes according to MapMan bins. Major metabolic functions in the citrus elaioplast proteome The identification of proteome profiles allows an overview of proteins involved in various metabolic pathways 8,  24–  28. As shown in Fig.  4, the major metabolic pathways in citrus elaioplasts are protein metabolism and process, transport, secondary metabolism, lipid metabolism, redox and stress, amino acid metabolism, photosynthesis, DNA and RNA, and miscellaneous. Elaioplasts are a type of heterotrophic plastid, wherein all the metabolic precursors are either generated via oxidative metabolism or actively imported from the cytosol to sustain anabolic reactions 29. The proteins of the Calvin cycle are involved in providing intermediates for glycolysis, and proteins of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) serve as a major source of reducing power for various metabolic pathways. As expected, we identified several proteins involved in the Calvin cycle within elaioplasts, such as fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and transketolase. Furthermore, proteins participated in oxidative metabolism were well presented, including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconolactonase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Of note, transketolase and transaldolase (key enzymes of the non-oxidative part of OPPP), which are reported to feed the processes of anabolism or glycolysis 30, were also identified in the present study. Glycolysis also occurs in plastids to generate ATP and pyruvate in plants 31. Several glycolysis enzymes including aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, and pyruvate kinase were observed. Consistent with previous findings in non-photosynthetic plastids, a substantial number of proteins responsible for the generation of ATP and reducing power were observed 8, indicating their high conservation among different plastid types. Taken together, the observation of many proteins involved in essential biosynthetic activities suggests an active metabolism in elaioplasts to produce reducing power and energy, as well as the supply of precursors for the biosynthesis of metabolites. Several proteins involved in photosynthesis were found in elaioplasts although the presence of chloroplasts was not observed using light microscopy and there was no signal obtained by immunoblotting using two photosynthesis-related antibodies (Fig.  3a). This suggests that these proteins serve roles in processes other than photosynthesis in elaioplasts. It is no surprise to find photosynthetic proteins in elaioplasts, since similar observations have been made in other types of non-photosynthetic plastids, such as chromoplasts 6,  10 and amyloplasts 26. FA are known to be synthesized in plastids 28. We detected several enzymes for the synthesis of FA as well as glycolipids and phospholipids in elaioplasts, such as acetyl E1 beta pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, E2-dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, E3-dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase 1, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 7/8/9, and plastidial ketoacyl-ACP reductase (Supplementary Table  S1). The accumulated FA could be converted into phosphatidic acid and/or imported into plastids via the trigalactosyldiacylglycerol (TDG) complex transporter, which is targeted to the plastid envelope membrane 32. As expected, several key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and homeostasis were detected in elaioplasts, such as TDG2, phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase 1, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol synthase, as well as 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, phospholipase Dα1, and cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase. These results indicate that the elaioplasts have the ability to synthesize FAs and polar lipids that might relate to the formation of new membranes during elaioplast development 33. This finding is also in agreement with a recent metabolic analysis in isolated tomato fruit chromoplasts using radiolabeled precursors 34, which suggests a highly conservative mechanism for lipid biosynthesis and homeostasis in both chromoplasts and elaioplasts. It has been well documented that lipoxygenases (LOX), which are associated with generation of polyunsaturated FA hydroperoxides, could contribute to the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) 35 and FA-derived flavor compounds 36. In the present study, several enzymes involved in the LOX pathway (such as LOX1, LOX2, and LOX6) and JA metabolism (allene oxide cyclase 4) were detected. Therefore, it is possible that the presence of lipoxygenases in citrus elaioplasts and chromoplasts 10 may play a key role in generating odor or flavor through production of LOX-derived volatiles in the outer peel and flesh of a fruit, respectively. A similar role for lipoxygenases in chromoplasts of tomato has been proposed 6. Elaioplasts are also important sites for amino acids synthesis. A large number of proteins responsible for amino acid metabolism were identified in elaioplasts, such as threonine synthase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, argininosuccinate synthase, cystathionine beta-lyase, 3-dehydroquinate synthase, isopropylmalate isomerase, isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, and ketol-acid reductoisomerase (Supplementary Table  S1). Consistently, proteins of amino acid metabolism were also extensively found in non-photosynthetic plastids 8,  10,  26. Taken together, our data suggest that these proteins involved in the biosynthesis of several types of amino acids, including aromatic amino acids have important functions in the active synthesis of amino acids within the elaioplasts. Active redox system is a key regulator for plant development and fruit senescence and has a wide range of functions in gene expression, enzyme activities, and protein import in plastids 37. In the elaioplast proteome, proteins involved in redox & stress constituted one of the top five functional classes. Several essential components in maintaining homeostasis of cell redox were found in the elaioplast proteome. These include the proteins involved in ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle and antioxidant system of plastids, such as glutathione peroxidases, peroxiredoxins (PRXs), superoxide dismutases (SODs), and thioredoxin. Additionally, several key enzymes involved in second active oxygen species scavenging system were identified in elaioplasts, including the AsA-GSH cycle catalyzed by ascorbate peroxidases (APXs), as well as the AsA-dependent generation systems catalyzed by (momo)dehydroascorbate reductase 38. Like in photosynthetic chloroplasts, APXs encountered in elaioplasts may indicate the presence of the AsA-dependent system involves the reduction of H 2O 2 using AsA as reductant 39. The activation of plastid SOD expression was detected to be dependent on a copper chaperone for SOD 40. Thus, as expected, Fe-SOD and Mn-SOD were detected and their overexpression induced an enhancement of plant tolerance in response to environmental stresses 41,  42. The presence of a large number of enzymes involved in oxidative stress response indicates a functionally active redox system in citrus elaioplasts and suggests the roles of these proteins in ROS metabolism, allowing the plastid to adapt to various environmental signals and processes during elaioplast development as fruit maturation proceeds. Protein synthesis, degradation, and translocation regulate the biogenesis of plastids. In this study, proteins associated with import, ribosome assembly and proteases account for 16.9% of the total plastid proteins (Fig.  4). (1) Import of nuclear-encoded precursor proteins into plastids is mediated by translocon complexes at the outer and inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts (TOC/TIC complexes) 43, which is important for the biogenesis of either chloroplasts 44 or chromoplasts 1. However, the import machinery remains unclear in elaioplasts. In this study, numerous translocons including TOC33/75/159 and TIC62/55/40/22/110 in the protein import machinery were identified in elaioplast proteome (Supplementary Table  S1). Among the TOC complex members, TOC75, which is deeply embedded within outer membrane of plastid, plays a major role to form protein translocation channel 43. TIC110, the major translocon component for protein translocation, plays a critical role in protein import into plastids 45. The extensive identification of TOC/TIC complex likely plays an important role in elaioplast biogenesis on basis of protein import machinery. (2) Thirty ribosomal proteins of translation machinery were identified in citrus elaioplasts. These proteins are represented by plastid-encoded 30S and 50S subunit, together with nucleus-encoded 40S and 60S subunit. These findings suggest the presence of translation machinery in elaioplast biogenesis. (3) Maintaining a balance between protein synthesis, import, turnover, and processing is an important factor determining plastid fate and maintaining their homeostasis 1,  46. As expected, we identified numerous caseinolytic peptidase (Clp) proteases in the study (Supplementary Table  S1), which have been well reported to form a chaperone complex to drive protein import, processing, and recycle plastid components. The knock-out of most members of Arabidopsis Clp proteases resulted in variegated/pale-green leaf phenotype, indicating their crucial roles in chloroplast development 47. Elaioplast proteome also consists of several membrane-bound ATP-dependent metalloproteases (FtsH2, FtsH4, FtsH5, FtsH9, and FtsHi4), which have been described as critical for plastid development 48. The extensive presence of Clp protease family in elaioplasts might contribute to elaioplast biogenesis by processing and/or cleavage of transit peptides of proteins in the plastids. Abundant proteins in citrus elaioplasts The protein abundance for all proteins detected in kumquat elaioplasts was determined based on intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ). The 30 most abundant proteins of kumquat elaioplasts are listed in Table  1. Among them, we identified four enzymes involving in secondary metabolism. Three enzymes (i.e. DXS, HDS, and GGPS) belong to the 2-C-methyl- d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, which provides precursors to synthesize monoterpenes within plastids. The fourth (orange1.1t03905) was a putative terpene synthase, which might be responsible for the accumulation of  d-limonene (accounting for up to 90% among monoterpene compounds) in outer peel of citrus 49,  50. The importance of DXS in regulating MEP substrate flux in kiwifruit and grape has previously been reported 51,  52 and the identification of MEP pathway proteins and TPS genes in citrus elaioplasts indicates the key role that elaioplasts play in basic metabolism. Eight proteins involved in transport or electron transport categories, such as ADP, ATP carrier protein, ATP-binding cassette transporter, ATPase, as well as ATP synthase beta/epsilon chain were also detected in kumquat elaioplasts. ATPase acts as an essential regulator of membrane trafficking, which couples free energy generated from ATP hydrolysis to transport of substances across the membranes of many organelles 53. ATP synthases are involved in energy production and proton transport. The identification of these proteins at high abundance suggests they may play an important role in active energy production and transport during elaioplast development. The presence of an active ATP generation system that is also necessary for the formation of membranes in plastids 54. Elevated energy production has also be observed in other heterotrophic plastids, such as chromoplasts 6 and proplastids 55. The citrus elaioplast proteome compared with citrus chromoplast proteome To determine whether the ultrastructure was different between elaioplasts and chromoplasts, we purified chromoplasts from citrus flesh for comparison with elaioplasts. TEM analysis showed that the size of elaioplasts was 2.15 ± 0.70 μm in diameter, which was significantly smaller than that of chromoplast (2.59 ± 0.60 μm) (Fig.  5a; Supplementary Figure  S2). The number of plastoglobules (5.86 ± 2.65) per elaioplast was approximately half that per chromoplast (11.59 ± 6.94) (Fig.  5b). However, the size of plastoglobules within elaioplasts was 0.48 ± 0.25 μm in diameter, which was about threefold greater than the diameter of plastoglobules within a chromoplast (0.14 ± 0.06 μm) (Fig.  5c). Taken together, the above results suggest that there are differences in ultrastructure between elaioplasts and chromoplasts. Given the structural differences between elaioplasts and chromoplasts, it was not surprising that differences in protein distribution patterns on SDS-PAGE gels were also observed (Fig.  3b). We further explored these differences by comparing the elaioplast proteome with that of chromoplast at the mass spectrometric level (Supplementary Figure  S3). Distinct proteome profiles for the biosynthesis and accumulation of different secondary metabolites was observed between elaioplasts and chromoplasts. A total of 42 and 40 core enzymes involved in secondary metabolism were identified in elaioplasts and chromoplasts, respectively (Supplementary Table  S2). The MEP pathway provides substrates to synthesize terpenes, tocopherols, and carotenoids (Fig.  6). In this study, an entire set of enzymes responsible for the MEP pathway were found in both elaioplasts and chromoplasts, including DXS, DXR, CMK, MCT, MDS, HDS, and HDR. Terpenoids are specifically accumulated in elaioplasts. We found seven proteins involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, such as myrcene synthase, 1,8-cineole synthase, germacrene synthase, and limonene synthase which accounted for more than 16.7% of total proteins involved in secondary metabolism (Supplementary Table  S3). By contrast, only limonene synthase (accounting for 2.5%) was identified in chromoplasts. With regard to carotenoid metabolism, ten enzymes (accounting for 25%) involved in carotenoid synthesis were identified in the chromopasts, including the rate limiting enzyme phytoene synthase, ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS), phytoene desaturase, lycopene β-cyclase, carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO), and β-carotene hydroxylase. By contrast, only CRTISO and ZDS were identified in elaioplasts. The synthesis of volatile apocarotenoids enhances dramatically during plastid development 56,  57. Consistently, CCD1 was detected in elaioplasts and chromoplasts. The extensive formation of plastoglobules within chromoplasts of citrus flesh is the most representative feature during chromoplast biogenesis 9, which is confirmed by the present study (Fig.  5b). Thirty plastoglobule-localized proteins have been established in Arabidopsis 58, and in our previous chromoplast proteome analysis we identified citrus homologs for 24 of these 30 proteins 9. In this study, we identified five additional plastoglobule-localized proteins (Supplementary Table  S4). However, it remains unclear whether plastoglobules within elaioplasts have a protein composition similar to that in chromoplasts. In elaioplasts, we only identified eight proteins that are predicted to be plastoglobule-localized using the same method. They include fibrillin 1 (FBN1), FBN7, tocopherol cyclase, flavin reductase-related 1/2, PLAT/LH2-1, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase. The FBN family is required for the development of leaf and fruit, and is involved in regulation of the extension of plastoglobules 58. In pepper, it is reported to be important for the formation of carotenoid-lipoprotein sequestration substructures and contributes to elevated levels of carotenoid accumulation 59. Fibrillin and its homologs were identified at high abundance in elaioplasts (Table  1), suggesting a possible role in the formation of plastoglobules. Since lipid-rich colorless elaioplasts likely have specialized but unknown functions 60, they might possess a unique plastoglobule proteome. Therefore, the further determination of plastoglobule proteomes of this colorless, non-photosynthetic plastid is necessary and meaningful.","Elaioplasts of citrus peel are colorless plastids which accumulate significant amounts of terpenes. However, other functions of elaioplasts have not been fully characterized to date. Here, a LC-MS/MS shotgun technology was applied to identify the proteins from elaioplasts that were highly purified from young fruit peel of kumquat. A total of 655 putative plastid proteins were identified from elaioplasts according to sequence homology in silico and manual curation. Based on functional classification via Mapman, ~50% of the identified proteins fall into six categories, including protein metabolism, transport, and lipid metabolism. Of note, elaioplasts contained ATP synthase and ADP, ATP carrier proteins at high abundance, indicating important roles for ATP generation and transport in elaioplast biogenesis. Additionally, a comparison of proteins between citrus chromoplast and elaioplast proteomes suggest a high level of functional conservation. However, some distinctive protein profiles were also observed in both types of plastids notably for isoprene biosynthesis in elaioplasts, and carotenoid metabolism in chromoplasts. In conclusion, this comprehensive proteomic study provides new insights into the major metabolic pathways and unique characteristics of elaioplasts and chromoplasts in citrus fruit.",NaN,"['elaioplasts', 'proteins', 'Supplementary Table', 'proteins involved', 'Fig.', 'citrus elaioplasts', 'elaioplast proteome', 'involved', 'protein', 'plastid']","[elaioplast-enriched, antibodies against marker proteins, RbcL, UDPase, V-ATPase, VDAC1, Lhca1, Lhca4, RbcL., vacuolar V-ATPase, PSI type I chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins, Lhca1, Lhca4, Plprot, AT-CHLORO, SUBA, PPDB, twenty-nine proteins (35.0%, Elaioplasts, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, transketolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconolactonase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, transketolase, transaldolase (, aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, glycolipids, E2-dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, E3-dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase 1, plastidial ketoacyl-ACP reductase, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol (, TDG), TDG2, phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase 1, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, phospholipase Dα1, cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase, polar lipids, lipoxygenases (, LOX, LOX, LOX1, LOX2, LOX6, Elaioplasts, aspartate aminotransferase, argininosuccinate synthase, cystathionine beta-lyase, 3-dehydroquinate synthase, isopropylmalate isomerase, isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, ketol-acid reductoisomerase, glutathione peroxidases, peroxiredoxins, PRXs, superoxide dismutases, SODs, thioredoxin, ascorbate peroxidases, APXs, AsA-dependent, (momo)dehydroascorbate reductase, APXs, plastid SOD, Fe-SOD, Mn-SOD, nuclear-encoded precursor proteins, chloroplasts 44, TOC33/75/159, TIC62/55/40/22/110, TOC complex, TOC75, plastid, TIC110, plastid-encoded 30S, nucleus-encoded 40S, 60S, caseinolytic peptidase, membrane-bound ATP-dependent metalloproteases, FtsH2, FtsH4, FtsH5, FtsH9, FtsHi4, Clp protease, iBAQ, 2-C-methyl- d-erythritol 4-phosphate, ATP-binding cassette, ATPase, ATP synthase, beta/epsilon, ATPase, MCT, chromopasts, enzyme phytoene synthase, ζ-carotene desaturase, ZDS, carotenoid isomerase, CRTISO, β-carotene hydroxylase, CRTISO, ZDS, fibrillin 1, FBN1, FBN7, flavin reductase-related 1/2, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, carotenoid-lipoprotein, Fibrillin, plastoglobule, plastoglobule]",['TPS'],[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
65,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5853461\eupmc_result.json,PMC5853461,"Results Recombinant CitTPS16 protein catalyzes  in vitro formation of  E-geraniol To characterize genes that are associated with formation of  E-geraniol, members of the  TPS family were cloned and expressed in  E. coli. Enzymatic activity assay showed that multiple volatile terpenoids were produced from 10 recombinant sweet orange TPS proteins ( Table 1). One member of the TPS family, CitTPS16 ( Supplementary Fig. S1), was able to catalyze  in vitro formation of  E-geraniol using GPP as substrate ( Fig. 1), and had no activity toward FPP. The most abundant transcripts of  CitTPS16 were detected in fruit tissue when compared with flower, leaf, and callus of sweet orange ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/cgi-bin/orange/gene/Cs7g17670.1). CitTPS16 encodes a 292 amino acid protein, belonging to the TPS-b subfamily based on phylogenetic analysis ( Fig. 2). Members of the Arabidopsis TPS-b subfamily function as monoterpene synthases  in planta, using GPP as substrate in the presence of divalent Mg 2+ cations ( Aubourg   et al., 2002 ). CitTPS16 is clustered with plant TPSs that are associated with  E-geraniol formation, including rough lemon RlemTPS3 and rose CrGES, sharing 63% and 55% similarity at the amino acid level, respectively. Transient overexpression of  CitTPS16 in sweet orange increased production of  E-geraniol A rapid and efficient transient overexpression assay was chosen to examine the function of  CitTPS16 in vivo, due to the difficulty of stable transformation systems in perennial fruit. Efficient transient expression systems have been used in orange ( Yin   et al., 2016 ) and persimmon ( Min   et al., 2012 ). To understand further the role of  CitTPS16 in biosynthesis of  E-geraniol, homologous transient overexpression was carried out in both fruits and leaves of Newhall sweet orange. The  E-geraniol content of the peels and leaves infiltrated with  CitTPS16 was 6.85 μg g –1 and 111.32 μg g –1, respectively, representing a significant ( P<0.05) increase compared with peel (4.42 μg g –1) and leaves (78.50 μg g –1) infiltrated with empty vector. These results indicated that introducing  CitTPS16 in Newhall sweet orange accelerated  E-geraniol biosynthesis ( Fig. 3). Expression profile of  CitERF71 correlated with  CitTPS16 in sweet orange fruit AP2/ERFs have been reported to be involved in production of volatile terpenoids in plants ( Yu   et al., 2012 ;  Li   et al., 2015 ;  Shen   et al., 2016 ). To investigate regulation of  CitTPS16 expression and  E-geraniol formation, changes in transcript levels of  CitERF genes were analyzed in different varieties and during fruit development. The highest content of  E-geraniol was detected in Newhall sweet orange fruit, while hybrid Huyou and mandarin Ponkan fruit exhibited low levels ( Fig. 4). Correspondingly, the most abundant transcript levels of  CitTPS16 were observed in Newhall ( Fig. 4). The transcription factor gene  CitERF71 also exhibited the highest transcript levels in Newhall sweet orange, similar to that of  CitTPS16. To test further the correlation between  CitTPS16 and  CitERF71, transcript levels of these two genes were analyzed during Newhall sweet orange ripening. As shown in  Fig. 5A and  B, expression of  CitTPS16 and  CitERF71 increased from 60 DAFB, peaked at ~105 DAFB, and then decreased in ripe fruit at 195 DAFB. Regression analysis showed that transcript levels of  CitTPS16 was positively correlated with that of  CitERF71 ( R2=0.624,  P<0.05). These results suggested that  CitERF71 was a good candidate for having a role in regulating expression of  CitTPS16 in Newhall sweet orange fruit. Our previous study revealed 126 members of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family in Newhall sweet orange ( C. sinensis Osbeck) ( Xie   et al., 2014 ). Phylogenetic analysis showed that CitERF71 belongs to the ERF IX a subfamily, clustering with Arabidopsis AtERF1, 2, and 13,  Catharanthus roseus CrORCA3, and  Nicotiana tabacum NtERF189 ( Supplementary Fig. S3). Transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolites was observed by homologs of  CitERF71, such as involvement of  CrORCA3 in regulating the pathway of jasmonate-inducible terpenoid ( van der Fits and Memelink, 2000). These results prompted us to study a possible role for CitERF71 in transcriptional regulation of  CitTPS16 in sweet orange. Promoter activation of  CitTPS16 by CitERF71 To test if CitERF71 could regulate expression of  CitTPS16, a dual-luciferase assay was performed. As expected, a  trans-activation effect was observed for CitERF71 on  CitTPS16 expression ( Fig. 5C). In order to confirm further the specific activation effect of ERF71 on the  CitTPS16 promoter (base pairs –2473 to +1), the activities of 48 CitERFs with the cloned  CitTPS16 promoter were analyzed ( Supplementary Fig. S2). The strongest induction was observed for activation of  CitTPS16 by CitERF71, with ~25-fold induction. A Y1H verified that CitERF71 could directly bind to the  CitTPS16 promoter ( Fig. 5D). These results indicated that CitERF71 could interact with and activate the  E-geraniol biosynthetic gene  CitTPS16. Roles of the motif in CitERF71 and  CitTPS16 promoter interaction To study the roles of different motifs in the promoter of  CitTPS16, four deletions were produced ( Fig. 6A). A major effect of the deletions on  CitTPS16 promoter activity was observed, where the activity was reduced to 36.85% and 9.85% for P1 (base pairs –1185 to 0) and P2 (base pairs –832 to 0), respectively. Additionally, the P2 deletion (containing base pairs –832 to 0) and P3 deletion (containing base pairs –419 to 0) significantly reduced transcription factor and promoter interaction, but did exhibit a low level of expression. There are two hypothetical GCC-box-like motifs [GCC-like-box1, ACCCGCC (base pairs –1499 to–1493); GCC-like-box2, GGCGGG [base pairs –948 to –943)] 5' of the region contained in P2 and none in the P3 or P4 promoter region; some unknown motif within the P3 promoter fragment must be responsible for the low but significant activity observed in P3 ( Fig. 6B). In vitro binding of CitERF71 to the GCC-box-like sequence in the  CitTPS16 promoter To confirm the binding results, we conducted an EMSA using the CitERF71 recombinant protein together with two 59 bp promoter fragments of  CitTPS16 containing the GCC-like-boxes. GCC-like-box1 and 2 of the  CitTPS16 promoter were both recognized by CitERF71. However, the binding activity disappeared when the GCC-like-box1 core ACCCGCC was changed to AAAAGCC (mGCC-like-box1), and the GCC-like-box2 core GGCGGG was changed to GGCAAA (mGCC-like-box2), respectively ( Fig. 6C). These results demonstrated the specificity of binding CitERF71 to the GCC-like-boxes of the  CitTPS16 promoter  in vitro ( Fig. 6D).","The unique flavor of Citrus fruit depends on complex combinations of soluble sugars, organic acids, and volatile compounds. The monoterpene E-geraniol is an important volatile, contributing to flavor in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck). Moreover, antifungal activity of E-geraniol has also been observed. However, the terpene synthase (TPS) responsible for its synthesis has not been identified in sweet orange. Terpene synthase 16 (CitTPS16) was shown to catalyze synthesis of E-geraniol in vitro, and transient overexpression of CitTPS16 in fruits and leaves of Newhall sweet orange resulted in E-geraniol accumulation in vivo. Having identified the responsible enzyme, we next examined transcriptional regulation of CitTPS16 in the fruit. Among cloned members of the AP2/ERF transcription factor gene family, CitERF71 showed a similar expression pattern to CitTPS16. Moreover, CitERF71 was able to activate the CitTPS16 promoter based on results from transient dual-luciferase assays and yeast one-hybrid assays. EMSAs showed that CitERF71 directly binds to ACCCGCC and GGCGGG motifs in the CitTPS16 promoter. These results indicate an important role for CitERF71 in transcriptional regulation of CitTP16 and, therefore, in controlling production of E-geraniol in Citrus fruit.","['Transcription factor', 'Fruit', 'Ripening', 'Volatile', 'Terpene synthase', 'Ap2/erf']","['sweet orange', 'Newhall sweet', 'Fig.', 'E-geraniol', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'orange', 'sweet', 'Newhall', 'Promoter', 'E-geraniol formation']","[CitTPS16 ( Supplementary Fig. S1, http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/cgi-bin/orange/gene/Cs7g17670.1, Mg 2, Yin   , Min   , –1, μg g, –1, P<0.05, μg g –1, –1, R2=0.624, AP2/ERF, CitERF71, ERF IX, 2, jasmonate-inducible terpenoid, CitERF71, CitERF71, CitERF71, dual-luciferase, CitERF71, ERF71, CitERFs, CitERF71, CitERF71, CitERF71, CitERF71, –1185, P3, –419, GCC-like-box1, ACCCGCC, –1499 to–1493, GCC-like-box2, GGCGGG, –948, P3, P4, P3, P3 ( Fig. 6B, CitERF71, CitERF71, GCC-like-box1, CitERF71, GCC-like-box1, ACCCGCC, AAAAGCC (mGCC-like-box1, GCC-like-box2, GGCGGG, GGCAAA, CitERF71]","['CitTPS16', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-b', 'CitTPS16', 'TPSs', 'RlemTPS3', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16.', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16,', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16.', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16,', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16']",['C.'],[],terpene synthase
66,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5876372\eupmc_result.json,PMC5876372,"Results Changes of volatile compound emissions during flower developmental and circadian processes Volatile compounds emitted from flowers at four flowering stages were sampled by headspace collection and detected by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). More than 900 compounds were detected at every stage, respectively. By filtering that accounting for less than 0.01% of the total amount, about 65 compounds were obtained for each flowering stage, respectively. To find changes during flowering process, volatile profiles of the four stages were combined to compare (Supplementary Table  S2). By combining the four profiles, a total of 101 volatile compounds were obtained, of which 21 were identified as flower scent compounds of  Lilium ‘Siberia’ according to descriptions for flower scent 37,  62,  63, including cis-β-ocimene, linalool, methyl benzoate, cis-3-hexenyl tiglate, cis-3-hexenyl isovalerate, isoeugenol, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, ethyl benzoate, cis-3-hexenyl benzoate, α-farnesene, β-pinene, (+)-α-pinene, etc. Of the 21 compounds, 19 were found at FF stage, while the EF, SF and LF stages had only 6, 12 and 12, respectively. Moreover, most of the 21 flower scent compounds (18) had the highest emission rate at FF stage, while 3 got their peaks at EF stage, including cis-3-hexenyl acetate (Fig.  2; Supplementary Table  S2). These results revealed that the biosynthesis of floral volatiles is controlled developmentally in  Lilium ‘Siberia’. Previous studies have shown rhythmic patterns of scent emission in the flowers of lily ‘Siberia’ 37,  64. Flowers at FF stage were used to detect variation in flower volatile compound emission rates at all four circadian time points. Similar to the analysis during development,  cis-β-ocimene, linalool, and methyl benzoate had the highest the emission rates among all compounds at all four circadian time points. The other nine compounds described above were also detected, in addition to three other compounds: eugenol, benzyl salicylate, and benzyl benzoate. Unlike the pattern seen during flower development, floral volatile compound emission rates varied across time of day (Fig.  3, Supplementary Table  S3). However, within the 15 major components in lily floral scents, 8 of items have highest emission rates at 16:00 (including linalool, which represent ~12% of total amount of volatiles of lily, the largest compounds of lily volatiles), 4 for 22:00, 2 for 4:00 and 1 for 10:00. These results supported the previous finding that the generation of floral volatiles occurred in a circadian rhythm in  Lilium ‘Siberia’ 37,  64. Sequencing,  de novo assembly, and gene annotation in RNA-seq of ‘Siberia’ flowers Lily flower tissues from four flower developmental stages, including 12 samples, were first analyzed using RNA-seq, resulting in more than ten thousand DEGs. Since scent-related compound emission rates vary by time of day (Fig.  3) 37, flower tissues from four time points during the day, including 4 samples, were also analyzed using RNA-seq to allow a 2-D analysis (Fig.  4). Complete sequencing of 16 samples achieved a total of 1.6 billion 150 bp raw reads. After a stringent quality filtering process, 1.6 billion clean reads remained, resulting in 234.38 Gb of clean data with a Q30 percentage (an error probability lower than 0.1%) ranging from 94.98 to 97.58% (Table  1). For the 2-D analysis, all clean reads required assembly. After assembly, transcripts with equal or more than 10 counts were filtered and finally a total of 118,665 unigenes were obtained, of which N50 was 1,038 bp and the average length was 825 bp. All the unigenes were selected for functional annotation by searching against six public databases (NR, Pfam, KOG, Swiss-prot, KO and GO). A totalof 61,284 (51.64%) were successfully annotated based on similarity to sequences in at least one database (Table  2). Approximately 56,851 unigenes (47.91%) were annotated using sequences from the NR database. With respect to species, 14.05% of sequences had top hits to sequences from  Elaeis guineensis, followed by  Phoenix dactylifera (11.72%),  Brassica napus (7.14%), and  Brassica oleracea (5.58%) (Fig.  5). A total of 50,256 unigenes (42.35%) were annotated using the KOG databases and grouped into 26 potential functional classifications (Supplementary Figure  S1). In addition, 38,202 unigenes (32.19%) were classified into 57 GO functional terms among three main categories: biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF; Supplementary Figure  S2). A total of 13,481 unigenes (11.36%) were mapped to 129 KEGG pathways (Supplementary Table  S4), among which several pathways were enriched, including gluconeogenesis (ko00010), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (ko00020), pentose phosphate pathway (ko00030), fatty acid biosynthesis (ko00061), synthesis and fatty acid degradation (ko00071), and ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis (ko00130). Identification of DEGs and TFs associated with flower scent production DEGs between libraries were determined by pairwise comparisons: EF vs. SF, SF vs. FF, FF vs. LF, 04:00 vs. 10:00, 10:00 vs. 16:00, 16:00 vs. 22:00, and 22:00 vs. 04:00). A total of 13,860 DEGs were obtained for the flower developmental process (Fig.  6A). From EF to SF, 1,961 DEGs were up-regulated, which corresponded to the beginning of flower scent biosynthesis (except for  cis−3-hexenyl acetate; Fig.  2). From SF to FF, 1,418 DEGs were up-regulated, while from FF to LF, 4,851 DEGs were down-regulated (Fig.  6B), which corresponded to the increase and decrease of flower volatiles, respectively (Fig.  2). After accounting for overlapping DEGs across the three comparisons, a union atlas of 6,329 DEGs was obtained that represented candidate genes (Fig.  6C). During the circadian process, a total of 7,099 DEGs were identified (Fig.  6D,E). Because floral volatile compound emission rates varied by time of day (Fig.  3), all of the DEGs were selected to be candidates. An atlas with 3,426 DEGs common to both flowering development and circadian rhythm was obtained, representing a large reduction compared to either of the two processes alone (Fig.  6F). GO enrichment analysis was used to classify the potential functions enriched among these DEGs. In the BP category, oxidation-reduction (GO:0055114), lignin biosynthesis (GO:0009809), coumarin biosynthesis (GO:0009805), and cytoplasmic translation (GO:0002181) were among the top function terms. In the CC category, the function terms included cytosol (GO:0005829), plasmodesma (GO:0009506), and plasma membrane (GO:0005886), while the structural constituent of ribosomes (GO:0003735), protein binding (GO:0005515), and transcription factor activity (GO:0003700) were among the top terms of the MF category (Supplementary Figure  S3). The expressions of six unigenes in the development process and eight unigenes in the circadian process were verified using qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR results showed a positive correlation between qRT-PCR and RNA-seq results (Fig.  7, Supplementary Figure  S4), indicating good reproducibility of the RNA-seq data in this study. Notably, 24,379 TFs were found to be expressed in ‘Siberia’ flowers. During flower development, there were 2,302 differentially-expressed TFs, 1,270 of which overlapped the 2,955 differentially-expressed TFs identified from the circadian rhythmic analysis (Fig.  8A). The 1,270 differentially-expressed TFs in the combined atlas were classified into 55 families, of which the bHLH family (129 members) accounted for the largest portion, followed by the ERF (99), NAC (95), MYB-related (89), C2H2 (57), MYB (46), and bZIP (46) families (Fig.  8B). Analysis of putative genes related to biosynthesis of flower scent compounds To detail the biosynthesis of flower scent, the genes were filtered for those believed to be involved in the putative flower scent biosynthesis pathway for  Lilium ‘Siberia’, which was determined from previous research 63,  65. For terpenoids, eight unigenes encoding enzymes involved in the MEP pathway were identified in present transcriptome, including one each of 1-deoxy-Dxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) gene, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (MCT) gene, 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (CMK) gene, two 2-C-methyl-Derythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MDS) genes, and two 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase (HDR) genes. Six unigenes were identified for encoding enzymes involved in the MVA pathway, including two acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT) genes, one hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS) gene, two hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) genes and one mevalonate kinase (MK) gene (Supplementary Figure  S5, Supplementary Table  S5). Expressions of major unigenes above presented a concomitant change with flower scent during the flower development, while it was complex during the circadian process. After formation of IPP and DMAPP by the above enzymes, GPP and FPP were generated by GPP synthase (GPPS) and FPP synthase (FPPS), the precursors of mono- and sesqui-terpenes, respectively 66. One GPPS unigene and two FPPS unigenes were identified from the current assembly transcriptome. GPPS unigene had a similar expression trend with the emission of terpenes, while FPPS unigenes did not, which was consistent with foundings in  Hedychium coronarium65. An array of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are generated through the action of TPSs, which directly determine product specificity 67. Nineteen TPS unigenes were identified in the current transcriptome (Supplementary Figure  S5, Supplementary Table  S5), including unigenes for monoterpens linalool_synthase (LIS), (E)-beta-ocimene synthase, myrcene synthase, and sesquiterpenes (3 S,6E)-nerolidol synthase (NES). The majority of TPS unigenes presented expression changes correlated to terpenoids biosynthesis during flower development and circadian rhythm process. The first committed step in benzenoid biosynthesis was catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL), which deaminated phenylalanine to cinnamic acid 68. Seven PAL unigenes existed in the current transcriptome and the expressions were consistent with benzenoid emission during flower development but nearly constant during the circadian process. The formation of benzenoids from cinnamic acid proceeds via β-oxidative pathway and non β-oxidative pathway 18. The β-oxidative pathway in petunia flowers needed four reactions catalyzed by three enzymes, including cinnamate:CoA ligase/acylactivating enzyme (CNL/AAE), cinnamoyl-CoA hydratasedehydrogenase (CHD) and 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase (KAT) 69–  72. Only two KATs were found in present transcriptome, of which expressions escalated slightly following flower development (Supplementary Figure  S6). To non-β-oxidative pathway, NAD-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (BALD) accounted for the oxidation of benzaldehyde into benzoic acid 73. Three BALD homologs were identified, but the expressions did not show correlation with the emission of benzenoids. For the final step for benzenoid biosynthesis, twenty-two S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase (SAM-Mtases) unigenes were identified in the transcriptome (Supplementary Figure  S6, Supplementary Table  S5), several of which could be identified as that for benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BAMT), benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferases (BSMT), salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (SAMT), etc. Most of the SAM-Mtases unigenes presented expression trends correlated with benzenoid biosynthesis during flower development. In biosynthesis pathway of volatile fatty acid derivatives, four LOX unigenes were identified from the transcriptome (Supplementary Table  S5). Expressions of LOX unigenes had the highest level at the EF stages and decreased following the flower development (Supplementary Figure  S7). Similar pattern could be found to hydroperoxide lyase unigene, which was responsible for converting 9- and 13-hydroperoxy intermediates into volatile C6 and C9 aldehydes. Fourteen unigenes were identified from the transcriptome for alcohol dehydrogenases, which could convert the C6 and C9 aldehydes to volatile alcohols 25. Moreover, one unigene for stearoyl-acyl carrier protein 9-desaturase was identified (Supplementary Table  S5), which could desaturate fatty acids into produce 18:1Δ9 ( ω-9) fatty acid intermediate, from which 9-alkenes could be derived 74. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of DEGs We used WGCNA to further filter the DEGs by correlating them with emission level changes of floral volatile compounds. A total of 26,049 genes, including all the DEGs, were clustered into 43 modules by WGCNA. All genes with GO annotations in the modules are listed in Supplementary Table  S6. A correlation map between modules and flower scent compounds was generated (Supplementary Figure  S8), from which the top three modules were selected for each compound. By this method, we identified 12 modules related to the top 15 floral volatiles of  Lilium ‘Siberia’ (Table  3). Four modules were correlated with both monoterpene and sesquiterpenes, including brown, pale-turquoise, saddle-brown and dark-orange. In phenylpropanoids, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate as well as (iso)eugenol and eugenol all correlated with pale-turquoise and brown modules, while benzyl salicylate and benzyl benzoate shared the same modules of yellow, dark-orange, and brown. As fatty acid derivatives,  cis−3-hexenyl tiglate and  cis−3-hexenyl isovalerate both correlated with dark-turquoise, plum1, and dark-orange modules. As expected,  cis−3-hexenyl benzoate shared the same modules with the phenylpropanoid methyl benzoate. By this analysis, DEGs were further correlated to flower scent compounds through modules. Identification of putative genes regulating biosynthesis of flower scent compounds In order to narrow the range of candidate genes, we then searched the 3,434 DEGs common to flower development and circadian rhythm data sets against every WGCNA module. A total of 1,210 DEGs partitioned into the 12 modules selected above. Blue (241) contained the largest number of DEGs, followed by dark-orange (176), dark-turquoise (170), brown (138), yellow (136), light-steel-blue1 (75), pink (66), dark-grey (54), pale-turquoise (44), plum1 (38), green-yellow (38), and saddle-brown (34). We then generated heat maps of gene expression for each module (Supplementary Figure  S9). For cis-3-hexenyl acetate, which showed an emission pattern different from the other 14 compounds, DEGs were obtained individually from the two processes and then categorized into the related modules: dark-grey (84), pink (84), and green-yellow (70). All DEGs with annotations are listed in Supplementary Table  S7. We also screened the 1,273 differentially-expressed TFs that overlapped between development and circadian processes against the 12 modules. A total of 419 TFs partitioned into modules, including 74 TFs in the dark-turquoise module. The remaining TFs were distributed as follows: blue (70), yellow (39), brown (37), light-steel-blue1 (34), dark-orange (32), pink (32), dark-grey (26), pale-turquoise (21), saddle-brown (20), plum1 (17) and green-yellow (17). For  cis−3-hexenyl acetate, 43, 40 and 30 TFs partitioned into pink, dark-grey and green-yellow modules, respectively. All the TFs with annotations are listed in Supplementary Table  S7. Four common modules were associated with monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes based on the WGCNA results. A key gene in the last step for linalool biosynthesis,  linalool synthase (LIS 75), was found in the brown module (Fig.  9) together with an  alcohol acetyl transferase ( AAT) unigene (DN245787_c1_g3_i2) involved in monoterpene alcohol biosynthesis 76,  77 and the  (3 S, 6E)-nerolidol synthase unigene (DN251718_c0_g2_i1) involved in both nerolidol and linalool biosynthesis 78, which further confirmed the involvement of this module in terpenoid biosynthesis. From this module, we could find other candidate unigenes, such those encoding auxin-responsive protein (DN244632_c1_g2_i1), acyl transferase (DN226095_c0_g2_i1), gibberellin-regulated proteins (DN228276_c0_g1_i1, DN232815_c0_g1_i1), gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase (DN247305_c0_g1_i2, DN250921_c0_g2_i3), and adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) transporter (DN253634_c1_g2_i1). Thirty-seven TFs were involved in brown module, of which three belonged to the MYB family and five belonged to the bHLH family. Phenylpropanoids were related to seven modules in the WGCNA results. In the pale-turquoise module, unigenes encoding several known phenylpropanoid-related enzymes, including benzyl alcohol O-benzoyltransferase (BEBT, DN240712_c1_g4_i1), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (DN236463_c1_g1_i1), anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase (DN244249_c0_g1_i2), and 4-coumarate–CoA ligase (DN248980_c2_g11_i1) were found, verifying role of this module in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Unigenes encoding other phenylpropanoid-related enzymes were found in the saddle-brown module, including for SAM-Mtases (DN87519_c0_g2_i1), phosphoenolpyruvate translocator in the shikimate pathway (DN248494_c1_g3_i1), arogenate dehydratase (DN252205_c0_g1_i1, DN252205_c0_g3_i1), together with an ABC transporter (DN235235_c0_g1_i1), and an ethylene-responsive transcription factor (DN242444_c0_g1_i1). Forty-one TF genes were involved in the two modules, including two encoding MYB TFs. A total of eight modules were associated with fatty acid derivatives based on the WGCNA results. In the green-yellow module, two unigenes involved in the LOX pathway were found: one encoding lipoxygenase (DN253294_c0_g7_i5) and one encoding fatty acid hydroxylase (DN247380_c2_g3_i2). Seventeen TF genes were identified in this module, including two MYBs, three bHLHs, and two B3s. In the dark-turquoise module, nine unigenes related to fatty acid derivatives were found, including three for acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] desaturase (DN248341_c1_g1_i1, DN219892_c0_g3_i1, DN253694_c7_g2_i1), one for a fatty acid transporter (DN233787_c1_g2_i2), one for both fatty acyl-CoA reductase and aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD; DN240253_c0_g2_i2), three for fatty-acyl-CoA synthase (DN248980_c2_g14_i1, DN248980_c2_g16_i1, DN248980_c2_g1_i1) and one for 2-alkenal reductase (DN252291_c1_g5_i1). In addition, four unigenes for auxin-responsive proteins (DN242854_c1_g2_i1, DN242854_c1_g3_i1, DN250599_c1_g1_i3, DN252722_c0_g9_i1) were also included. This module contained 73 TF genes, including nine MYBs, 15 bHLHs, five B3s, and six C2H2s. By combining results of 2-D and WGCNA analyses, we decreased the candidate number and several genes (TFs) were identified for the three classes of flower scent compounds, respectively.","Lily is a popular flower around the world not only because of its elegant appearance, but also due to its appealing scent. Little is known about the regulation of the volatile compound biosynthesis in lily flower scent. Here, we conducted an approach combining two-dimensional analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to explore candidate genes regulating flower scent production. In the approach, changes of flower volatile emissions and corresponding gene expression profiles at four flower developmental stages and four circadian times were both captured by GC-MS and RNA-seq methods. By overlapping differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) that responded to flower scent changes in flower development and circadian rhythm, 3,426 DEGs were initially identified to be candidates for flower scent production, of which 1,270 were predicted as transcriptional factors (TFs). The DEGs were further correlated to individual flower volatiles by WGCNA. Finally, 37, 41 and 90 genes were identified as candidate TFs likely regulating terpenoids, phenylpropanoids and fatty acid derivatives productions, respectively. Moreover, by WGCNA several genes related to auxin, gibberellins and ABC transporter were revealed to be responsible for flower scent production. Thus, this strategy provides an important foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanisms involved in floral scent production.",NaN,"['Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Supplementary', 'flower scent', 'Fig.', 'flower', 'unigenes', 'Table', 'flower development', 'compounds']","[’, SF, LF, ’, ’, ’, ‘, RNA-seq, RNA-seq, 234.38 , 118,665, KOG, Swiss-prot, 56,851 unigenes, 50,256, 38,202, SF, SF, LF, SF, SF, LF, GO:0009809, GO:0009805, GO:0002181, GO:0009506, GO:0003735, RNA-seq, ‘, MYB, bZIP (46, ’, MCT, 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase, 2-C-methyl-Derythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase, AACT, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, HMGS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, mevalonate kinase, DMAPP, GPP synthase, GPPS, FPP synthase, FPPS, sesqui-terpenes, GPPS, FPPS, GPPS, FPPS, phenylalanine ammonialyase, β-oxidative, CoA ligase/acylactivating enzyme, CNL/AAE, cinnamoyl-CoA hydratasedehydrogenase, KATs, NAD-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, BSMT, SAMT, SAM-Mtases, LOX, LOX, hydroperoxide lyase, 9-, C9 aldehydes, alcohol dehydrogenases, C9 aldehydes, stearoyl-acyl, 9-desaturase, 18:1Δ9, 9-alkenes, 26,049, pale-turquoise, saddle-brown, (iso)eugenol, pale-turquoise, plum1, pale-turquoise (44, plum1, green-yellow (38, green-yellow (70, pale-turquoise (21, saddle-brown, plum1 (17), green-yellow (17), AAT, DN245787_c1_g3_i2, 6E)-nerolidol synthase, DN251718_c0_g2_i1, DN244632_c1_g2_i1, DN226095_c0_g2_i1, gibberellin-regulated proteins, DN228276_c0_g1_i1, DN232815_c0_g1_i1, gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase, DN247305_c0_g1_i2, DN250921_c0_g2_i3, adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) transporter (DN253634_c1_g2_i1, MYB, pale-turquoise, BEBT, DN240712_c1_g4_i1, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, DN236463_c1_g1_i1, anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase, DN244249_c0_g1_i2, 4-coumarate–CoA ligase, DN248980_c2_g11_i1, phenylpropanoid-related enzymes, saddle-brown, DN87519_c0_g2_i1, phosphoenolpyruvate translocator, DN248494_c1_g3_i1, arogenate dehydratase, DN252205_c0_g1_i1, DN252205_c0_g3_i1, DN235235_c0_g1_i1, DN242444_c0_g1_i1, MYB, LOX, lipoxygenase (, DN253294_c0_g7_i5, bHLHs, B3s, acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] desaturase, DN248341_c1_g1_i1, DN219892_c0_g3_i1, DN253694_c7_g2_i1, fatty acyl-CoA reductase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, NAD, DN240253_c0_g2_i2, DN248980_c2_g14_i1, DN248980_c2_g16_i1, DN248980_c2_g1_i1, 2-alkenal reductase, DN252291_c1_g5_i1, DN242854_c1_g2_i1, DN242854_c1_g3_i1, DN250599_c1_g1_i3, DN252722_c0_g9_i1, TF, bHLHs, B3s, C2H2s]","['TPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPS']",[],[],NaN

68,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5996158\eupmc_result.json,PMC5996158,"Results Isolation of a Dual Repeat in the  GDPS Upstream Promoter Previously, two individual 1-kb fragments of  GDPS promoters were isolated from the scentless  P. aphrodite, namely  PaGDPSpA and  PaGDPSpB (Chuang et al., unpublished). Compared to the  GDPS promoter from the scented  P. bellina ( PbGDPSp), two  GDPS promoters identified from  P. aphrodite,  PaGDPSpA and  PaGDPSpB contained an 11-bp deletion and a 75-bp deletion, respectively ( Figure   1).  PaGDPSpB also had two 14-bp insertions in addition to numerous nucleotide substitutions. By performing the luciferase promoter assays  in planta,  PaGDPSpA showed the similar promoter activity as  PbGDPSp either in scented or scentless flowers, while  PaGDPSpB revealed very low promoter activity even in the scented  P. bellina floral tissues. These results indicated that the lack of the 75-bp region in the  PaGDPSpB is detrimental for its activity (Chuang et al., unpublished). Further sequence analysis of the  PbGDPS promoter showed that a second 75-bp repeat is present downstream from the original 75-bp repeat and formed a dual repeat consisted of the two 75-bp units. The first and second 75-bp units were then denoted as ‘R1’, and ‘R2’, respectively, located from -859 to -710 nt upstream from the ATG ( Figure   1). The  PaGDPSpB lacked the entire R1 unit, and  PaGDPSpA harbored a 11-bp deletion in the center of R1, which was defined as R1-b subunit ( Figure   1). The region (25-bp) prior to the R1-b was denoted as R1-a, and those (39-bp) behind was R1-c, and the corresponding divisions in R2 were denoted as R2-a, R2-b and R2-c ( Figure   1). The dual repeat structure was schematically represented in  Figure   1, and the sequence of the dual repeat is in Supplementary Figure  2. The difference between the  GDPS promoters of the scent  P. bellina and the scentless  P. aphrodite resided in the dual repeat, and this is well correlated with the monoterpene phenotype. Concomitance of the Integrity of the Dual Repeat With the Monoterpene Production According to the promoter analysis results of  PaGDPS and  PbGDPS from scented and scentless  Phalaenopsis orchids, we hypothesized that the dual repeat is associated with the monoterpene production. To confirm this, another 10 frequently used breeding parents of  Phalaenopsis orchids (Supplementary Figure  1) were recruited and assessed for the correlation analysis between the dual repeat and the monoterpene production. We first examined the floral scent profile (Supplementary Table  3) and found that four orchids emitted monoterpenoids, including  P. Meidarland Bellina Age,  P. bellina,  P. I-Hsin Venus, and  P. lueddemanniana. In contrast, the major VOCs of  P. javanica and  P. amboinensis were sesquiterpenoids and benzenoids, and that of  P. mannii was phenylpropanoids and fatty acid derivatives (Supplementary Table  3).  P. schilleriana emitted trace amounts of benzenoids.  P. aphrodite,  P. cornu-cervi,  P. equestris ‘RO-5’, and  P. equestris ‘WY-7’ were considered as “scentless” since no scent compounds were detected (Supplementary Table  3). For brief, the relative amounts of monoterpenoids emitted from these  Phalaenopsis orchids were symbolized in  Figure   2A. The presence of the  GDPS gene and its promoter sequence in the 12  Phalaenopsis orchids were then analyzed ( Figure   3). Intriguingly, the  GDPS gene was present in all of these orchids regardless of being scent or scentless phenotype ( Figure   3). It is plausible that the defects are resided in the promoter region ( GDPSp,  Figure   3). We then amplified the dual repeat on  GDPSp and a polymorphism of the dual repeat fragment length was detected among the 12  Phalaenopsis orchids ( Figure   3). The four scented orchids with monoterpene production contain the complete dual repeat ( Figure   3, the black arrowheads). In contrast, the amplified dual repeat fragments of the other orchids were reduced to various extents with various deletions in the dual repeat region. These 12 fragments were cloned and sequenced. Deletions in the dual repeats were detected between nucleotides 11 and 110, which appear to cause defects in  GDPS promoter activities in the orchids without monoterpene production ( Figures   2A,B). Strikingly, most defects occurred in the R1 region ( Figure   2B). We then examined the expression levels of  GDPS for 12  Phalaenopsis orchids ( Figure   2C). The four orchids emitting monoterpenoids especially both  P. Meidarland Bellina Age and  P. bellina showed higher  GDPS expression levels than the others ( Figure   2C). Taken together, we concluded that the integrity of the dual repeat in the  GDPS promoter is strongly correlated with its elevated expression and thus the monoterpene production. The Dual Repeat Is Crucial for  GDPS Promoter Activity To investigate the role of the dual repeat in the promoter activity of  GDPS, the ∼2-kb promoter fragment (denoted  PbGp-2010) upstream from the start site of  PbGDPS was isolated and subjected to serial deletions. The activity of  PbGp-2010 and the nine truncated promoter fragments were evaluated in  P. I-Hsin Venus flowers via particle bombardment for dual luciferase assays. It was legitimate that we should examine  PbGDPS promoter activity in the original species  P. bellina. However, the supply of  P. bellina flowers fell short of demand for experiments as  P. bellina commonly produces only one flower per 20 days. Instead,  P. I-Hsin Venus, the offspring of  P. bellina emitting similar scents, was micropropagated to large quantities with the identical genetic background and would help to reduce variation. The highest luciferase activity was observed for  PbGp-859, which showed approximately threefold increase as compared to that  PbGp-784, and fivefold increase as compared to that of  PbGp-710 ( Figure   4A). Thus, the  cis-element responsible for high promoter activity was between nucleotide (nt) -859 and nt -710 (150-bp), in which the dual repeat located. Further dissection of  PbGp-710 to generate  PbGp-584,  PbGp-410,  PbGp-354,  PbGp-297, and  PbGp-216 showed that no extra enhancers were present at the downstream of the dual repeat ( Figure   4A). Compared with  PbGp-859, the promoter activity of  PbGp-2010 and P bGp-1076 was much decreased ( Figure   4A), suggesting the presence of repressor elements at the upstream region of  PbGp-859. These results verified that the dual repeat plays a crucial role for  PbGDPS promoter activity. To further define the  cis-element in the 150-bp dual repeat region for transcriptional regulation, a more detailed analysis was performed based on the subunit division, namely R1a, R1b, R1c, R2a, R2b, and R2c. These subunits were serial deleted to generate a series of truncated promoter constructs. The luciferase activities were reduced further with gradual deletions of the subunit, indicating the essential nature of the complete dual repeat for full promoter activity of  PbGDPS ( Figure   4B). Yeast One-Hybrid Screening of the Transcription Factor Bound Onto the Dual Repeat To identify the candidate upstream  trans-activators, Y1H screening was performed using  P. bellina floral cDNA as preys. However, the dual repeat bait produced extensive background growth of yeast, and it could not be eliminated even under the addition of inhibitor 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). Alternatively, Y1H screening against prey library composed of approximately 1,350 TFs of  Arabidopsis thaliana was performed ( Mitsuda et al., 2010). The dual repeat was amplified from  P. bellina genomic DNA and fused to a minimal promoter of  HISTIDINE SYNTHASE3 (Supplementary Figure  3A). In this approach, the leaky expression of the reporter gene could be overcome by the addition of 4 mM 3-AT (Supplementary Figure  3B). Total four positive TFs were obtained from this screening ( Table   1) and three of them encoded bZIP family proteins including AtbZIP18, AtbZIP29, and AtbZIP30. The other one candidate AtAGL81, a MADS-box TF, failed to be isolated from  P. bellina floral transcriptome. The three bZIP TFs belong to the group I of bZIP family composed of a conserved bZIP domain for DNA binding and a leucine zipper motif for dimerization ( Jakoby et al., 2002). The  P. bellina floral transcriptomic data (Chuang et al., unpublished) showed nine proteins belong to group I, and can be divided into three subgroups (i, ii, and iii) according to their phylogenetic relationship with the  Arabidopsis ones ( Figure   5A). We selected subgroup i including AtbZIP18 for further analysis since AtbZIP29 and AtbZIP30 (subgroup ii) were repeatedly isolated in other unrelated screenings and therefore considered as sticky factors in the Y1H system. No PbbZIPs were classified into subgroup iii ( Figure   5A). Multiple alignments showed that five PbbZIPs namely PbbZIP4, PbbZIP10, PbbZIP26, PbbZIP29, and PbbZIP32 in the subgroup i shared 83–86% identity with AtbZIP18 in the basic region ( Figure   5B). Previously, we found that the promoter activity of  GDPS was much higher in the scented  P. bellina than in the scentless  P. aphrodite. In addition,  PaGDPSpA was a functional promoter since it showed similar promoter activity as  PbGDPSp in the scented  P. bellina flower tissues (Chuang et al., unpublished). Both results indicated that the down-regulation of the corresponding upstream activators of  GDPS was responsible for the extremely low  GDPS expression in  P. aphrodite ( Figure   5C). The possibility of the five bZIPs regulating  GDPS was evaluated by comparing their gene expression between  P. bellina and  P. aphrodite ( Figure   5C). Among them,  bZIP4,  bZIP26,  bZIP29, and  bZIP32 showed higher expression in  P. bellina than in  P. aphrodite. However, both  bZIP29 and  bZIP32 also expressed in floral bud of  P. aphrodite but still  GDPS did not express ( Figure   5C), suggesting that both  bZIP29 and  bZIP32 did not transactivate  PaGDPSpA promoter. Both PbbZIP29 and PbbZIP32 thus were excluded for further analysis. PbbZIP4 Was Able to Distinguish the Promoter Containing the Dual Repeat Previously, we have shown that PbbZIP4 was able to transactivate  PbGDPS promoter (Chuang et al., unpublished). Here, to further examine the transactivating ability of PbbZIP4 and PbbZIP26 on various  GDPS promoters, dual luciferase assay was performed in the floral tissues of the scentless  P. aphrodite. In the presence of PbbZIP4, it enhanced the promoter activities of both  PbGDPSp and  PaGDPSpA, but revealed no effects on  PaGDPSpB ( Figure   6). This was consistent with the previous results, in which the activities of both  PbGDPSp and  PaGDPSpA were higher than  PaGDPSpB in the scented  P. bellina floral tissues (Chuang et al., unpublished). In contrast, PbbZIP26 did not transactivate  PbGDPSp,  PaGDPSpA, or  PaGDPSpB ( Figure   6). These results indicated that PbbZIP4 was able to distinguish the  GDPS promoter containing the full dual repeat ( PbGDPSp), or near full-dual-repeat ( PaGDPSpA), from the solely one repeat unit ( PaGDPSpB). The Close Association Between the  Trans-Factor and the  Cis-Element for Monoterpene Phenotype The  cis-element and  trans-factor for  GDPS promoter were both identified in the scented  P. bellina. To investigate how these two factors affected the monoterpene phenotype among the 12  Phalaenopsis orchids, we examined the expression levels of  bZIP4 ( Figure   2D) to establish its correlation with the presence of the dual repeat on  GDPS promoter ( Figure   2B) and  GDPS expression levels ( Figure   2C) for monoterpene production ( Figure   2A). Interestingly,  bZIP4 expressed to various extents among these orchids ( Figure   2D). Strikingly, only the orchid plants concomitantly harbored  bZIP4 expression and the dual repeat on  GDPS promoter exhibited high  GDPS expression, and thus produced monoterpenes, including  P. Meidarland Bellina Age,  P. bellina,  P. lueddemanniana, and  P. I-Hsin Venus ( Figure   2). However, orchid species with similar or even higher  bZIP4 expression levels but without the dual repeat showed low  GDPS expression, and thus did not emit monoterpenes, including  P. javanica,  P. amboinensis,  P. mannii, and  P. cornu-cervi ( Figure   2). In contrast, another four species with extremely low expression levels of  bZIP4, together with their incomplete dual repeat, contributed to their scentless phenotype, including  P. schilleriana,  P. aphrodite,  P. equestris ‘RO-5’, and  P. equestris ‘WY-7’ ( Figure   2). Collectively, these results indicated that not only the dual repeat in  GDPS promoter but also the TFs are crucial for monoterpene production in  Phalaenopsis orchids. Transient Ectopic Expression of  PbbZIP4 in the Scentless  P. aphrodite So far, the stable genetic transformation for  Phalaenopsis orchids is with low efficiency. In addition,  Phalaenopsis orchids have a long-life cycle with the regeneration time is about 2–3 years, especially if we want to examine the floral phenotype. Instead, the transient ectopic expression system in floral tissues has been successfully established for the study of three MYB TFs regulating the pigmentation patterning in  Phalaenopsis orchids ( Hsu et al., 2015). Thus, to confirm the role of PbbZIP4  in planta, we performed a transient assay by infiltrating the Agrobacterium into the flower tissues of the scentless  P. aphrodite. We analyzed the volatile terpenes emitted from  PbbZIP4-expressing  P. aphrodite flowers and detected a 10-fold induction of α-terpineol (a monoterpenoid) as compared to the  GUS control ( Figures   7A,B). Furthermore, the raise in the levels of monoterpenes in the infiltrated tissues was indeed resulted from the large increase of  PbbZIP4 transcripts ( Figure   7C). Therefore, we concluded that PbbZIP4 was involved in the scent production in  Phalaenopsis orchids."," Phalaenopsis bellina  is a scented orchid emitting large amount of monoterpenes. GERANYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (PbGDPS) is the key enzyme for monoterpene biosynthesis, and shows concomitant expression with the emission of monoterpenes during flower development in  P. bellina . Here, we identified a dual repeat  cis -element in the  GDPS  promoter that is critical for monoterpene biosynthesis in  Phalaenopsis  orchids. A strong correlation between the dual repeat and the monoterpene production was revealed by examination of the  GDPS  promoter fragments over 12  Phalaenopsis  species. Serial-deletion of the 2-kb  GDPS  promoter fragments demonstrated that the integrity of the dual repeat was crucial for its promoter activities. By screening the  Arabidopsis  transcription factors (TFs) cDNA library using yeast one-hybrid assay, AtbZIP18, a member of group I of bZIP TFs, was identified to be able to bind the dual repeat. We then identified  PbbZIP4  in the transcriptome of  P. bellina , showing 83% identity in the DNA binding region with that of AtbZIP18, and the expression level of  PbbZIP4  was higher in the scented orchids. In addition, PbbZIP4 transactivated the  GDPS  promoter fragment containing the dual repeat in dual luciferase assay. Furthermore, transient ectopic expression of  PbbZIP4  induced a 10-fold production of monoterpenoids in the scentless orchid. In conclusion, these results indicate that the dual repeat is a real TF-bound  cis -element significant for  GDPS  gene expression, and thus subsequent monoterpene biosynthesis in the scented  Phalaenopsis  orchids.","['Promoter', 'Cis-element', 'Transcription factor', 'Phalaenopsis', 'Orchid', 'Monoterpene', 'Floral Scent', 'Yeast-one Hybrid Screening']","['Dual Repeat', 'Figure', 'GDPS promoter', 'GDPS', 'Dual', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Repeat', 'Phalaenopsis orchids', 'Promoter', 'promoter activity']","[PbGDPSp, luciferase, ‘R1’, ‘R2, ’, R1-b subunit, R1-b, R1-a, R1-c, R2-a, R2-b, bellina, Meidarland Bellina, bellina, lueddemanniana, cornu-cervi, “scentless”, GDPSp, Meidarland Bellina, bellina, ∼2-kb, luciferase, luciferase, bGp-1076, R1c, luciferase, Y1H, Y1H, bellina, SYNTHASE3, bZIP, AtbZIP18, AtbZIP29, AtbZIP30, AtAGL81, bZIP, bZIP, AtbZIP18, AtbZIP29, AtbZIP30, sticky factors, PbbZIPs, PbbZIPs, PbbZIP4, PbbZIP10, PbbZIP29, PbbZIP32, 83–86, AtbZIP18, bZIPs, bellina, PbbZIP29, PbbZIP32, PbbZIP4, PbbZIP4, PbbZIP4, PbbZIP26, luciferase, PbbZIP4, PbbZIP4, PbGDPSp, PaGDPSpA, PaGDPSpB, bellina, Meidarland Bellina, bellina, lueddemanniana, cornu-cervi, schilleriana, 2–3, MYB TFs, α-terpineol, PbbZIP4]",[],[],[],NaN

Screening and Isolation of Sesquiterpene Synthase Gene from P. minus Two new candidates of sesquiterpene synthase genes,  PmSTPS1 (comp62410_co_seq6) and  PmSTPS2 (comp47018_c0_seq1), were successfully identified through the sequence analysis of  P. minus transcriptome [ 40]. The 1098 bp  PmSTPS1 transcript contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1047 bp, encoding 348 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 40.9 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6. 15 ( Figure S1). The ORF of  PmSTPS1 started from the nucleotide position at 25 and ended at position 1071. The deduced amino acid sequence of  PmSTPS1 (GenBank accession no. MG921605) showed no signal peptide. A ProtParam analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of  PmSTPS1 revealed 47 negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) and 52 positively charged residues (Arg and Lys), which represented the aliphatic index of this protein. This was a positive factor for the increased thermostability of the globular protein. The second sesquiterpene synthase transcript,  PmSTPS2 (GenBank accession No: MG921606), was 1974 bp long and had an ORF of 1695, which encoded a polypeptide of 564 amino acids ( Figure S2). The ORF of  PmSTPS2 started from the nucleotide position at 97 and ended at position 1798. The calculated molecular mass of the mature protein was approximately 65.96 kDa, with a predicted pI of 5.75. A ProtParam analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of  PmSTPS2 identified 83 negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) and 70 positively charged residues (Arg and Lys). Based on the BLASTx analysis, the predicted amino acid sequences of  PmSTPS1 ( Table 1) and  PmSTPS2 ( Table 2) had the closest hit to drimenol synthase from  Persicaria hydropiper, with a 96% and 46% identity, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of  PmSTPS2 was consistent with those of other sesquiterpene synthases encoding proteins of 550–580 amino acids, with molecular weights of 60–70 kDa. Conversely, the length of  PmSTPS1, with only 348 amino acids, was much shorter than that of the other sesquiterpene synthases. Therefore, only  PmSTPS2 met the range of other reported plant terpene synthases [ 21, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. The presence of the conserved domains in the  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 proteins was consistent with and similar to that of the other terpene synthase features. The terpene synthase family N-terminal domain (PF01397) and the synthase family C-terminal metal-binding domain (PF03936) contained highly conserved aspartate-rich motifs (DDxxD), which were essential for enzyme-substrate binding and catalytic function. The first aspartate-rich motif played a role in the determination of the chain length for the resulting prenyl pyrophosphate.  Based on the multiple sequence alignment of  PmSTPS1 ( Figure 1), several conserved motifs that were found in typical terpene synthases were identified, including the DDxxD (residue 100–104) and NSE/DTE (residue 245–253) motifs. The DDxxD and NSE/DTE motifs flanked the entrance of the active site. In addition to these motifs, there was a highly conserved arginine-rich RxR motif, which was involved in the complexing of the diphosphate group, after the ionisation of FPP [ 18, 39]. The RxR motif was located at 45 amino acids, upstream of the first DDxxD motif. For  PmSTPS2, the conserved arginine-rich (RxR) region at amino acid position 278–281 was conserved in all of the terpene synthases [ 19]. Moreover, the aspartate-rich motif of DDxxD, which might have been the Mg 2+ binding site, was located at position 314–318 of the amino acid sequence. Another metal binding motif, the NSE/DTE motif, was detected at amino acid position 461–467 ( Figure 1). The less conserved motif NSE/DTE, apparently evolved from a second motif that was conserved in prenyl transferase. In general, these motifs were located on the opposite sides of the active site [ 6, 7]. The metal binding residues appeared as NSE in most microbial and fungal cyclases and as DTE in most plant cyclases.  2.2. Phylogenetic Analysis of P. minus Sesquiterpene Synthase (PmSTPS) The  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 amino acid sequences were aligned and compared with other flowering plant terpene synthase sequences, using Clustal Omega ( Figure 2), and they showed a low sequence similarity (42.94%). The phylogenetic analysis showed a particularly close relationship between the  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 amino acid sequences. The  PmSTPS1 was clustered in the same clade with sesquiterpene synthase ( PmSTS) from  Persicaria minor and drimenol synthase from  Persicaria hydropiper. The results showed that the  PmSTPS1 from  P. minus was grouped into a single clade with a 43.04% identity, which suggested a monophyletic origin of the gene. Additionally,  PmSTPS2 was placed in the same clade with (+) delta-cadinene synthase from  Ricinus communis. Moreover,  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 were grouped together with the terpene synthases from the Santalum and  Vitis vinifera species. Multiple sequence alignments of  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 amino acid sequences, with sesquiterpenes from other plants species, showed a high sequence similarity (42–96%). 2.3. Expression of PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 in E. coli For the analysis of the protein expression, recombinant bacterial strains harbouring pQE2 in  E. coli M15 with  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 were compared with those harbouring the control empty pQE2 vector. The cells were harvested at different times (1, 3, and 5 h) post-induction. After sonication and centrifugation of the bacteria, soluble and insoluble crude fractions were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE analysis ( Figure S3) showed unclear corresponding protein bands at the expected size at different post-induction times, as well as in the control sample. However, Western Blotting ( Figure S4) confirmed the correct size of recombinant proteins. There was no band was observed in the control sample as expected. Correct protein sizes of 40.9 and 65.9 kDa were obtained for  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2, respectively. From these findings, the recombinant  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 proteins from  P. minus were successfully expressed in  E. coli, and the activities of these enzymes were further investigated via enzymatic assays. 2.4. Identification of PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 Assay Products A functional characterisation of the  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 genes was performed by an in vitro enzyme assay of the recombinant proteins. In this crude protein assay, the  E. coli strain harbouring empty pQE-2 vector was used as the control strain. A GC-MS analysis showed that  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 produced β-farnesene, α-farnesene, and farnesol as the final products. Additionally,  PmSTPS2 also produced nerolidol. For  PmSTPS1, the products formed were β-farnesene (14.49 min), α-farnesene (15.79 min), and farnesol (16.98 min). Additionally, the principle products from  PmSTPS2 enzyme were β-farnesene (14.49 min), α-farnesene (15.83 min), farnesol (16.84 min), and nerolidol (17.25 min). Based on the GC-MS analysis, both extracts from  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 showed multiple peaks for corresponding sesquiterpene products, compared with no peaks observed in the control sample, which did not exhibit any major products, although exogenous substrates were added ( Figure 3). These findings therefore demonstrated the successful production of sesquiterpenes in the recombinant  E. coli strains overexpressing  PmSPTS1 and  PmSTPS2 enzymes, respectively. All of the peaks were further confirmed by comparison with NIST and Wiley libraries, mass spectra, authentic sesquiterpene standards, and control ( Figure S5). Interestingly, although the sizes of  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 were different, the two enzymes were capable of producing similar sesquiterpene products, β-farnesene, α-farnesene, and farnesol ( Figure 3), but they did so at different levels.  PmSTPS1 successfully converted the precursor FPP to produce 9.50% β-farnesene as the main product, followed by 8.86% α-farnesene, and 5.08% farnesol.  PmSTPS2 showed synthesises nerolidol (48.33%) as a major product, followed by farnesol (15.30%), β-farnesene (5.07%), and α-farnesene (2.76%). Although the (E,E)-farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) substrate was added to the enzymatic assay, the control pQE-2 sample did not produce any significant products, indicating that endogenous metabolites did not affect the protein expression and analysis in this study."," Polygonum minus  (syn.  Persicaria minor ) is a herbal plant that is well known for producing sesquiterpenes, which contribute to its flavour and fragrance. This study describes the cloning and functional characterisation of  Pm STPS1 and  Pm STPS2, two sesquiterpene synthase genes that were identified from  P. minus  transcriptome data mining. The full-length sequences of the  Pm STPS1 and  Pm STPS2 genes were expressed in the  E. coli  pQE-2 expression vector. The sizes of  Pm STPS1 and  Pm STPS2 were 1098 bp and 1967 bp, respectively, with open reading frames (ORF) of 1047 and 1695 bp and encoding polypeptides of 348 and 564 amino acids, respectively. The proteins consist of three conserved motifs, namely, Asp-rich substrate binding (DDxxD), metal binding residues (NSE/DTE), and cytoplasmic ER retention (RxR), as well as the terpene synthase family N-terminal domain and C-terminal metal-binding domain. From the in vitro enzyme assays, using the farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) substrate, the  Pm STPS1 enzyme produced multiple acyclic sesquiterpenes of β-farnesene, α-farnesene, and farnesol, while the  Pm STPS2 enzyme produced an additional nerolidol as a final product. The results confirmed the roles of  Pm STPS1 and  Pm STPS2 in the biosynthesis pathway of  P. minus , to produce aromatic sesquiterpenes.","['Farnesol', 'Nerolidol', 'Polygonum Minus', 'Sesquiterpene Synthase']","['amino acid', 'amino', 'acid sequence', 'Sesquiterpene Synthase', 'Figure', 'Synthase', 'acid', 'sequence', 'Sesquiterpene', 'analysis']","[comp62410_co_seq6, comp47018_c0_seq1, MG921605, Arg, MG921606, Arg, 550–580 amino, enzyme-substrate, 278–281, Mg 2, prenyl transferase, NSE, PmSTPS1, PmSTPS2, pQE2, pQE2, PmSTPS1, PmSTPS2 Assay, pQE-2, Wiley, E)-farnesyl pyrophosphate, pQE-2]","['PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1,', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2,', '(PmSTPS)', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2,', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1,', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2']",[],[],terpene synthase

Worldwide, more and more attention is deserved to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which establish symbioses with the roots of most land plants and facilitate plant nutrient uptake, by means of a large network of extraradical hyphae spreading from colonized roots to the surrounding soil and functioning as a supplementary absorbing system. AMF protect plants from biotic and abiotic stresses and are able to modulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (phytochemicals), such as polyphenols, anthocyanins, phytoestrogens and carotenoids, that play a fundamental role in promoting human health. An increasing number of studies focused on the use of AMF symbionts for the production of functional food, with enhanced nutritional and nutraceutical value. Yet, while several plant species were investigated, only few AMF were utilized, thus limiting the full exploitation of their wide physiological and genetic diversity. Here, we will focus on AMF effects on the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites with health-promoting activity, and on the criteria for a finely tuned, targeted selection of the best performing symbionts, to be utilized as sustainable biotechnological tools for the production of safe and healthy plant foods.","['Sustainable agriculture', 'Healthy Food', 'Nutraceutical Value', 'Amf Functional Diversity', 'Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbionts', 'Health-promoting Phytochemicals', 'Secondary Metabolism Gene Regulation']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN
71,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6104575\eupmc_result.json,PMC6104575,"Results Brevipalpus Mites Elicit a Significant Transcriptome Reprogramming on Infested Plants A time-course RNA-Seq experiment was set up to assess the global response of  A. thaliana plants along the course of infestation with non-viruliferous  B. yothersi mites. The transcriptome of infested plants was compared with that from non-infested ones (control) at 6 h after infestation (hai), 2 and 6 days after infestation (dai). Overall, 995 million paired-end reads were obtained by Illumina sequencing, with an average of 41.5 million per library and higher average number of reads in samples from the infested treatment ( Supplementary Table   S1 and  Figure   1A). Roughly 94% of the reads mapped against the  A. thaliana reference genome, with a 91% average of uniquely mapped reads ( Supplementary Table   S1 and  Figure   1B). Biological variability between samples was verified by principal component analysis (PCA) using the normalized count data ( Figure   1C). Infested and control samples grouped separately, suggesting a globally distinct expression profile, as expected. Even though a classification of the first principal components as treatment or time of infestation was not clear, the first component (PC1), which accounts for 52% of the variance, apparently separated the samples by the intensity of stimuli. Except for two out of four control samples at 6 dai, all control samples grouped together with those of mite-infested treatments from 6 hai, whose plants were stimulated by a short period of mite feeding. Samples from plants challenged by longer mite feeding period (2 and 6 dai) grouped separately. Hierarchical clustering of samples within each time point confirmed a clear separation between mite-infested and non-infested treatments over the course of the experiment ( Figure   1D). By using the negative binomial-based DESeq2 package and FDR correction of  p-values for multiple comparisons, 5005 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, α ≤ 0.05) were detected ( Supplementary Table   S2). Mite infestation deregulated 1755, 3069 and 2680 genes at 6 hai, 2 dai, and 6 dai, respectively ( Figure   1E). At the earliest stage of the interaction (6 hai), the majority of the DEGs was up-regulated. The number of down-regulated genes progressively increased during the interaction reaching its highest rating at 6 dai ( Figures   1E,F). Analysis performed here show an intense modulation of the plant transcriptome in response to  Brevipalpus mite infestation. To validate the RNA-Seq data, 10 genes were selected for Real Time RT-qPCR analysis. Expression of these genes was assessed in a new experiment with mite-infested and non-infested Arabidopsis plants at 6 hai, 2 dai, and 6 dai ( Supplementary Figure   S1). Altogether, expression profiles of selected genes obtained by RT-qPCR were consistent with those obtained by the RNA-Seq, supporting the results described in this work. Additionally, some of these genes had an expression profile similar to that revealed by a qPCR-driven analysis during a comparable experiment previously described ( Arena et al., 2016). The Plant Immune System Is Modulated by  Brevipalpus Mite Infestation Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed with all 5005 DEGs to identify the most relevant biological processes (BPs), molecular functions (MFs) and cellular components (CC) disturbed during  Brevipalpus mite-plant interaction. This study identified 264 BPs, 83 MFs and 78 CCs that were over-represented (hypergeometric test, α ≤ 0.001) in the list of DEGs ( Supplementary Table   S3). Enriched BPs were further visualized as a network using the app BinGO from Cytoscape, where color and size of the nodes identify  p-values and number of DEGs from each category, respectively ( Supplementary Figure   S2). The GO network revealed a striking deregulation of plant defensive responses. BP categories were clustered in two major groups comprising metabolism and response to stimuli. BP-metabolism was sub-clustered into two branches separately harboring the primary and secondary metabolisms. Secondary metabolism group was represented by processes related to the biosynthesis and metabolism of “flavonoids,” “glucosinolates,” “toxins,” and “camalexins,” which are known to exert anti-herbivory roles and be induced by SA or JA. Primary metabolism included categories associated to the metabolism of: (i) “aminoacids” and “proteins,” connected to processes involved in the control of gene expression (such as “protein modification,” “phosphorylation,” and “transcription”); (ii) “organic acid,” whose sub-categories included the “SA metabolism” and “JA biosynthesis and metabolism”; and (iii) “carbohydrates,” edged to several photosynthesis-associated categories and processes related to “cell wall modification” such as “callose deposition,” a well-known defense against herbivores ( Jander, 2014). Biological processes cluster centralized in “response to stimulus” was fully represented by processes associated with defense responses. Nodes from the cluster included response to “stress,” “abiotic,” and “biotic” stimulus (linked to “defense response” and to the subcategories of response to “wounding,” “insects,” and other pathogens). A large “response to hormone” branch displayed all main hormone-mediated pathways, including SA and JA, but also abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ET), auxins (IAA), cytokinins (CK) and gibberellins (GA). Other nodes included in the “response to stimuli” group were “response to chitin,” commonly triggered in plants colonized by chitin-rich organisms such as arthropods and fungi ( Libault et al., 2007), and “oxidative stress,” typically induced in plant-biotic interactions ( Arena et al., 2016;  Camejo et al., 2016). Several processes related to defense response were also present in “biological regulation” nodes, such as “regulation of hormone levels,” “defense response,” “immune response,” and, “JA pathway.” Specific and Common Transcriptomic Changes Occur at Different Time Points After  Brevipalpus Mite Infestation of Plants A comparison of the DEGs deregulated across the experiment revealed both common and specific changes at each time points ( Figure   2A). Few DEGs were common to all time points, whereas the highest percentage of them were found to be exclusively modulated at 2 or 6 dai suggesting intense reprogramming steps of plant transcriptome throughout the course of the  Brevipalpus mite infestation ( Figure   2A). Most of the BPs (84 terms) over-represented during mite infestation overlap at all time points ( Figure   2B and  Supplementary Table   S4). These processes included most of the general terms of plant response to stresses and hormones, indicating a continuous and lasting reprogramming of the plant immune system since the beginning of the interaction until at least 6 dai. Several categories were common between 6 hai and 2 dai (75 terms), and 2 dai and 6 dai (20 terms), but no biological process was shared between the first and the last evaluated time points ( Figure   2B). Even though processes related to plant defense responses were markedly enriched over the time course of the experiment, time point-specific ontologies were also identified. From all the over-represented BP categories, 49, 47, and 24 were uniquely identified at 6 hai, 2 dai, and 6 dai, respectively ( Figure   2B and  Supplementary Table   S4). Hormone biosynthesis (“salicylic acid biosynthetic process,” “oxylipin biosynthetic process”), early signaling (“activation of MAPK activity”), and structural defenses (“callose deposition,” “cell wall thickening,” and “lignin biosynthetic process”) were processes exclusively enriched at 6 hai ( Figure   2C). At 2 dai, unique categories were related to the metabolism of defense-related secondary metabolites (“indole glucosinolate metabolic process,” “pigment,” and “flavonoid biosynthetic and metabolic process”), photosynthesis and oxidative stress (“photosynthesis,” “carbon fixation,” “photosynthetic electron transport,” “response to light intensity,” “response to oxidative stress”) ( Figure   2C). Exclusive ontologies that came up with the late infestation state (6 dai) were detoxification processes (“cellular detoxification,” “cellular response to toxic substance”), and other associated to cell wall components and structure (“plant-type cell wall organization,” “cell wall loosening,” and “pectin,” “galacturonan,” “glucan,” “carbohydrate,” and “polysaccharide” metabolic process) ( Figure   2C). Brevipalpus Mite Infestation Induces Plant Defensive Responses and Represses the Plant Growth-Related Processes The vast majority of DEGs detected in more than one time point were strictly kept up- or down-regulated. Among the 5005 DEGs identified throughout the analysis, only 201 of them (4%) shift their expression patterns across the experiment ( Supplementary Table   S2). In agreement with this, results of the hierarchical clustering analysis revealed two major clusters of DEGs, which mainly encompassed 2762 and 2243 up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively ( Figure   3A). Gene ontology enrichment analysis separately performed with DEGs within each of the predefined clusters identified only 31 common categories between the up- and down-regulated groups ( Figure   3B and  Supplementary Table   S5). These categories represented higher GO levels and included general BPs such as “regulation of biological quality,” “response to stimulus,” “metabolic process,” “signal transduction,” among others. BPs such as “response to hormones” and “hormone-mediated signaling pathway” were also shared between the up- and down-regulated clusters but GO-terms identifying a particular hormonal pathway were always detected in just one of the two groups. The up-regulated cluster was enriched in 264 exclusive BPs ( Figure   3C and  Supplementary Table   S5). Network topology was similar to that obtained using all the DEGs ( Supplementary Figure   S2), with two major clusters centralized in metabolic processes and response to stimuli. GO terms within metabolic process cluster involved several BPs related to secondary metabolism, whilst response to stimuli cluster presented terms associated to stress and defense and hormonal pathways. Over-represented categories were massively typified by defensive responses. Besides broad immune system-related terms (e.g., “immune response”), other common categories displayed by the general network ( Supplementary Figure   S2) included responses to hormones, oxidative stress and the production of secondary metabolites, e.g., glucosinolates, flavonoids, and camalexin. Only SA, JA, ET, and ABA-mediated hormonal pathways were represented in the up-regulated cluster network. Induced GO network also included other over-represented processes that were unidentified in the general network ( Supplementary Figure   S2). Among these are included: “response to herbivore,” “response to virus,” “multi-organism process,” “modification of morphology/physiology of other organism,” “lignin biosynthetic and metabolic process,” “defense response by callose deposition,” and “phytoalexin biosynthetic and metabolic process.” The down-regulated cluster was enriched in 76 exclusive BPs, which were predominantly associated with the plant growth and development ( Figure   3D and  Supplementary Table   S5). Over-represented terms included broad categories, for instance “developmental process” and “regulation of growth,” and also those directly related to plant growth such as “cytokinetic process,” “cell cycle process,” “mitotic cytokinesis,” or indirectly related to growth such as “cell wall organization or biogenesis” and “cytoskeleton organization”. Among the enriched BPs there were also processes associated to morphogenesis and development of specific plant components such as “root morphogenesis,” “cuticle development,” and “cotyledon development.” The other major class of over-represented BPs uniquely detected in the down-regulated cluster comprised photosynthesis-related processes such as “photosynthesis,” “electron transport chain,” “carbon fixation,” “photosynthesis, dark and light reaction,” “light harvesting,” “photosynthetic electron transport,” and “chlorophyll biosynthetic process.” Finally, the only hormones represented in the down-regulated cluster network were the major growth regulators IAA, CK and brassinosteroids (BR). Co-expression of Genes Correlates With Classes of Transcription Factors (TFs) Involved in SA, JA and Developmental Processes Since transcriptional reprogramming is mainly controlled by TFs, the regulation of the expression dynamics of DEGs by specific classes of TFs was tested by two different approaches. First, over-represented TF families were searched based on up- and down-regulated DEGs that encode TFs ( Figure   4A and  Supplementary Table   S6). Within the cluster of up-regulated DEGs, 254 (9.2%) TFs from 30 different families were identified. From those, 16 over-represented families were detected (hypergeometric test, α ≤ 0.001). The largest and most significant of them were the WRKY (33 genes,  p-value = 2.47E-33) and the AP2/ERF (40 genes,  p-value = 8.46E-34), known to act as regulators of SA pathway and ERF-branch of the JA pathway, respectively. From the analysis using the cluster of down-regulated DEGs, 141 (6.3%) TFs belonging to 30 families were detected. Twenty-three of these families were also found in the cluster of up-regulated DEGs. TFs were evenly distributed among 18 over-represented families (hypergeometric test, α ≤ 0.001), with lower significance (higher  p-values). The largest and most significantly over-represented families were bHLH (22 genes,  p-value = 3.21E-25), which comprises the regulators of the MYC-branch of the JA pathway, and C3H family (17 genes,  p-value = 1.46E-17). Second, TF families that potentially regulate the expression of the DEGs were searched based on over-represented target genes within the DEGs ( Figure   4B and  Supplementary Table   S7). Enriched target genes and their corresponding TFs were identified by using a TF enrichment tool that takes advantage of previously identified  cis-regulatory elements and regulatory interactions from literature mining ( Jin et al., 2017). As a result, WRKY was the largest identified family with potential targets within the up-regulated DEGs. Twenty-one out of its 42 TF members were also induced during  Brevipalpus mite-plant interactions. Targets from WRKY TFs were exclusively enriched in the up-regulated cluster. The next largest families with targets within the induced DEGs were MYB, bZIP, and bHLH, with 29, 26, and 24 TFs, respectively. Targets for MYB, bZIP, and bHLH, however, were not exclusively enriched in the analysis of the cluster of up-regulated DEGs. These families represented by 34, 24, and 14 TFs, respectively, were also among the largest with potential targets within down-regulated DEGs. MYC2, the marker TF from the MYC-branch of the JA pathway, was one of the bHLH TF with targets exclusively enriched in the down-regulated cluster. Notably, the analysis of the down-regulated cluster also revealed the TCP family, which is typically involved in the control of plant development. This family involved 15 and 4 TFs that potentially regulate targets within the assortment of repressed and induced DEGs, respectively. Overall, the analysis of co-expressed genes with its corresponding TFs showed a correlation of up- and down-regulated genes with TFs that regulates SA, JA and developmental processes. The SA-related WRKY family was the largest one with target genes exclusively enriched in the up-regulated cluster and most of its TF members were also up-regulated. The analysis of enriched TFs settles the involvement of plant hormonal pathways and developmental processes in the plant response to  Brevipalpus mites, with highlight on the participation of the SA pathway solely on the up-regulated responses. Focus on Defense Pathways: SA- and JA-Mediated Responses Are Induced in  Brevipalpus Mite-Infested Plants Over-represented genes from GO-terms associated with SA and JA-dependent responses were thoroughly reviewed to confirm their induced status. Data from genes included in the categories “response to SA” and “SA metabolic process,” or “response to JA,” “regulation of JA-mediated pathway,” and “JA metabolic process” were processed by a Hierarchical cluster analysis. The SA-dependent pathway was represented by 103 DEGs ( Supplementary Table   S8). Eighty-one of these DEGs were up-regulated in at least one of the experimental time points. Some of these genes were induced at either early or late stages of the response, but they were not down-regulated in any of the other analyzed time points ( Figures   5A,B). Examples of these expression patterns are the genes coding for the signaling protein for SA activation  EDS1 ( enhanced disease susceptibility 5) and the SA-biosynthetic enzyme  ICS1 ( isochorismate synthase 1) that were up-regulated at the beginning of the interaction, whilst the SA-responsive proteins  PR1 ( pathogenesis-related protein 1) and  GLIP1 were induced at later time points. Moreover, the expression profile analysis of some DEGs revealed the quick regulation of some SA-responsive genes since the initial steps of the plant-mite interaction. For instances,  PR2/BGL2 ( pathogenesis-related protein 2/beta-1,3-glucanase 2) was up-regulated as soon as 6 hai and remained activated at least till 2 dai. Among the induced genes associated to the SA pathway there were also several signaling kinases such as the receptor-like kinase (RLK)  CRK9 ( cysteine-rich RLK 9), the  wall-associated kinases WAK1 and  WAKL10, and the  L-type lectin receptor kinase LCRK-S.2, LCRK-IV.1 and  LCRK-IX.2. Other up-regulated DEGs from this cluster were genes encoding the SA biosynthetic enzymes  ICS2 and  PAL1 ( Phenyl ammonia lyase 1), the transporter of SA from chloroplast to cytoplasm  EDS5 ( enhanced disease susceptibility 5), the regulator of SA responses  GRX480 ( glutaredoxin 480), the methyl-salicylate (MeSA) esterase proteins  MES7 and  MES9 ( methyl esterase 7 and  9), the defense protein  PR5, and several TFS from WRKY and MYB families. Another small cluster of SA-related genes comprised a group of 22 DEGs that were mainly down-regulated, particularly at the two latest time points of the experiment ( Figure   5A). This cluster was largely formed by TFs that are also responsive to JA. Repressed TFs included members of the ERF/AP2, MYB and GRAS/DELLA families. Other repressed genes beyond TFs were  UGT1 ( UDP-glucose transferase 1), involved in the callose formation, and the genes encoding the  GRP23 and  GRP5 proteins  (glycine-rich proteins 23 and 5), which are components of the plant cell wall. The JA-mediated pathway was composed by 137 DEGs that, similarly to what was observed in the SA-pathway analysis, were mainly up-regulated ( Supplementary Table   S8) ( Figures   6A,B). DEGs were subdivided in three clusters: two larger groups formed by 60 and 54 highly and mildly up-regulated genes, respectively, and a small one composed by 23 genes that were mostly down-regulated ( Figure   6A). Highly induced JA-related genes ( Supplementary Table   S8) at the beginning of the infestation code for proteins acting upstream on the JA pathway such as the DAMP receptor  PEPR2 ( PEP1 receptor 2) and the JA-biosynthetic and modifying enzymes  AOS ( allene oxide synthase) , AOC2 and  AOC3 ( allene oxide cyclase 2 and  3) , LOX2, LOX3, and  LOX4 ( lipoxygenase 2,  3, and  4),  OPCL1 ( OPC-8:0 CoA ligase 1) and  JMT ( JA carboxyl methyltransferase) ( Supplementary Table   S8). DEGs induced at the two first experimental time points also included terpene synthases ( TPS03,  TPS04, and  TPS10), several JAZ (  jasmonate-zim-domain) proteins ( JAZ1, JAZ2, JAZ5, JAZ7, JAZ8, JAZ9/TIFY7, and  JAZ10) and the TFs  MYC2 and  ERF1. Genes with high expression at later time points encode proteins directly involved in defense such as the marker responsive protein of the ERF-branch  PDF1.2 ( plant defensin 1.2), and proteins involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis such as  UF3GT ( UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase). Other highly up-regulated DEGs included MYB TFs, the DELLA protein  RGL3 that contributes to JA/ET-mediated defenses, the ERF-branch TFs  ERF2 and  ORA59 ( octadecanoid-responsive Arabidopsis AP2/ERF59), the responsive gene  THI2.1 ( thionin 2.1), and the JA oxidases  JOX1 and  JOX2 that down-regulate plant immunity by hydroxylation and inactivation of JA. Genes from the JA pathway that were mildly induced ( Supplementary Table   S8) at the first time points included those coding for the JA-biosynthetic enzymes  ACX1 ( acyl-CoA oxidase 1) and  AOC4, the TF  WRKY70 that acts on the SA-JA antagonism, the negative regulators of JA-responsive genes  NINJA ( novel interactor of JAZ) and  JAZ3, and the proteins  MYB34 and  SOT16 ( sulfotransferase 16) involved in the synthesis of glucosinolates. Later in the infestation, the group of mildly induced genes included those coding for the proteins  MYB75/PAP1 and  TT4 that act in the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanin, the  MYB51 and  FMOGS-OX7 proteins involved in the synthesis of glucosinolates, and the responsive marker genes of the MYC-branch  VSP1 and  VSP2 ( vegetative storage proteins 1 and  2), which directly act during the anti-herbivory defense. Two essential modulator genes of the JA signaling, i.e.,  RGLG3 (ring domain ligase 3) and the  MYC3 TF were induced at all the assessed time points although at low expression levels.  RGLG3 encodes for a RING-ubiquitin ligase acting upstream of JA-Ile recognition and MYC3 operates together with MYC2 coordinating the expression of responsive genes from the MYC-branch. The down-regulated JA cluster comprised DEGs that were mainly repressed at 2 and 6 dai ( Supplementary Table   S8). Some of them encode TF commonly acting in the SA-pathway such as members of the families: ERF ( RAP2.6 and  DREB26), MYB ( MYBS1,  MYB28,  MYB29, and  MYB16), and GRAS/DELLA ( RGL1 and  RGL2). Other repressed genes were those encoding the  BAT5 ( bile acid transporter 5) protein and the  MYB76 TF, both required for the biosynthesis of glucosinolates, the DAMP receptor  PEPR1, and the JA-repressed protein  AGP31 (arabinogalactan protein 31). SA and JA Levels Increase in Mite-Infested Plants Both SA and JA biosynthetic and responsive genes were induced in  Brevipalpus mite-infested plants. To confirm the consistency of the observed molecular data, the profiles of the SA and JA hormones were determined in Arabidopsis plants challenged with  Brevipalpus mites. SA ( Figure   5C) and JA ( Figure   6C) levels were 1.5- and 2.8-fold higher, respectively, on infested leaves when compared to the control ones (Student’s  t-test, α ≤ 0.05). Salicylic acid and JA levels were also verified in systemic leaves of mite-infested plants. No difference was observed between the levels of both hormones in systemic and non-infested control leaves, suggesting a local rather than a systemic response to  Brevipalpus mite infestation. Brevipalpus Mites Have a Decreased Performance on Plants Impaired in SA Responses Salicylic acid- and JA-mediated pathways were clearly induced upon  Brevipalpus mite infestation. To further explain the functional relevance of the plant hormonal pathways on the interaction, the performance of  B. yothersi mites was evaluated on Arabidopsis plants impaired in SA or JA-mediated response. Mite oviposition was assessed on mutants defective in SA biosynthesis ( salicylic acid induction deficient2, sid2) and signaling ( non-expressor of pathogenesis-related protein1, npr1), and JA signaling ( jasmonate resistant1, jar1 and  coronatine-insensitive1, coi1). Plants were infested with adult female mites and the number of laid eggs was counted after 6 days. The number of eggs per plant was 2.4- and 1.5-fold lower on SA-mutants  sid2 and  npr1, respectively, when compared to the mite’s performance in the infested wild-type  A. thaliana Col-0 plants used as control (Student’s  t-test, α ≤ 0.05) ( Figure   5D). No difference was observed between the number of eggs on the mutants affected in the JA pathway ( jar1 and  coi1) and the wild-type control (Student’s  t-test, α ≤ 0.05) ( Figure   6D). These results point to a role of SA-mediated response promoting the  Brevipalpus mite colonization.","False-spider mites of the genus  Brevipalpus  are highly polyphagous pests that attack hundreds of plant species of distinct families worldwide. Besides causing direct damage, these mites may also act as vectors of many plant viruses that threaten high-value ornamental plants like orchids and economically important crops such as citrus and coffee. To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind plant-mite interaction we used an RNA-Seq approach to assess the global response of  Arabidopsis thaliana  (Arabidopsis) plants along the course of the infestation with  Brevipalpus yothersi , the main vector species within the genus. Mite infestation triggered a drastic transcriptome reprogramming soon at the beginning of the interaction and throughout the time course, deregulating 1755, 3069 and 2680 genes at 6 hours after infestation (hai), 2 days after infestation (dai), and 6 dai, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a clear modulation of processes related to the plant immune system. Co-expressed genes correlated with specific classes of transcription factors regulating defense pathways and developmental processes. Up-regulation of defensive responses correlated with the down-regulation of growth-related processes, suggesting the triggering of the growth-defense crosstalk to optimize plant fitness. Biological processes (BPs) enriched at all time points were markedly related to defense against herbivores and other biotic stresses involving the defense hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Levels of both hormones were higher in plants challenged with mites than in the non-infested ones, supporting the simultaneous induction of genes from both pathways. To further clarify the functional relevance of the plant hormonal pathways on the interaction, we evaluated the mite performance on Arabidopsis mutants impaired in SA- or JA-mediated response. Mite oviposition was lower on mutants defective in SA biosynthesis ( sid2 ) and signaling ( npr1 ), showing a function for SA pathway in improving the mite reproduction, an unusual mechanism compared to closely-related spider mites. Here we provide the first report on the global and dynamic plant transcriptome triggered by  Brevipalpus  feeding, extending our knowledge on plant-mite interaction. Furthermore, our results suggest that  Brevipalpus  mites manipulate the plant defensive response to render the plant more susceptible to their colonization by inducing the SA-mediated pathway.","['Salicylic acid', 'Tetranychus', 'plant hormones', 'jasmonic acid', 'Rna-seq', 'Cross-talk', 'Plant–herbivore Interaction', 'Defense Pathways']","['Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Figure', 'Supplementary', 'genes', 'response', 'Brevipalpus mite', 'DEGs', 'Table', 'Mite infestation']","[mite-infested, mite-infested, DESeq2, α ≤, mite-infested, qPCR-driven, BPs, mite-plant, BPs, MFs, α ≤, BPs, BinGO, ” “, ” “, ”, “camalexins, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, ”, “SA, ”, “JA, ”, ”, “cell wall, ”, “callose, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “biotic”, “, ”, “, ”, “, SA, JA, abscisic acid, ABA, CK, GA, “, ”, “, chitin, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “, ” “, ”, “JA, ”, BPs, “salicylic acid, ”, “, MAPK, ”, ” “cell wall, ”, “lignin, ”, ”, “flavonoid, ”, “, ” “, ” “, ” “, ” “cellular, ”, “plant-type cell wall, ”, “pectin, ” “, ” “glucan, ” “carbohydrate, ”, “polysaccharide”, BPs, “, ” “, ” “, ”, BPs, “, ”, “hormone-mediated, ”, BPs, “immune, ”, SA, ABA-mediated, “, ” “, ”, “phytoalexin, ”, BPs, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “cell wall, ”, “cytoskeleton, ”, BPs, ”, “cotyledon, ”, BPs, “, ” “electron, ” “, ” “, ”, “chlorophyll, ”, CK, BR, SA, JA, α ≤, 2.47E-33, AP2/ERF (40, SA, α ≤, MYC-branch, WRKY, mite-plant, WRKY, MYB, bZIP, MYB, bZIP, MYC2, MYC-branch, SA, JA, SA-, Mite-Infested, SA, “, ”, “SA, ”, “, ” “, ”, “JA, ”, SA, isochorismate synthase 1, pathogenesis-related protein 1, plant-mite, pathogenesis-related protein 2/beta-1,3-glucanase 2, receptor-like kinase, cysteine-rich RLK 9, WAK1, L-type lectin receptor kinase LCRK-S.2, LCRK-IV.1, LCRK-IX.2, Phenyl ammonia lyase 1, SA, glutaredoxin 480, MeSA) esterase proteins, WRKY, MYB, ERF/AP2, MYB, GRAS/DELLA, UDP-glucose transferase 1, glycine-rich proteins 23, JA-related, DAMP receptor, PEP1 receptor 2, JA-biosynthetic, AOC2, LOX2, lipoxygenase 2, CoA ligase 1, TPS03, JAZ, JAZ1, JAZ2, JAZ5, JAZ7, JAZ8, JAZ9/TIFY7, MYB TFs, DELLA, octadecanoid-responsive Arabidopsis AP2/ERF59, JA-biosynthetic enzymes, acyl-CoA oxidase 1, TF  , JAZ, MYC-branch  VSP1, TF, RING-ubiquitin ligase acting upstream, MYC3, MYC2, MYC-branch, MYB, MYBS1, GRAS/DELLA ( RGL1, DAMP receptor, arabinogalactan protein 31, JA, Mite-Infested, SA, JA, mite-infested, SA, α ≤, JA, mite-infested, deficient2, non-expressor, pathogenesis-related protein1, JA, jasmonate resistant1, ’s, α ≤, α ≤]","['TPS03,', 'TPS04,', 'TPS10),']",[],[],terpene synthase
72,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6117411\eupmc_result.json,PMC6117411,"Results and Discussion Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Terpenoids in  R. tomentosa Leaves Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) technique was used to analyze volatile compound composition of the young and mature leaves in  R. tomentosa. We identified four monoterpenes ((+)-α-pinene, (−)-α-pinene, (+)-β-pinene and (−)-β-pinene) and two sesquiterpenes (β-caryophyllene and α-humulene) by virtue of authentic standards and GC–MS database ( Table   1 and  Supplementary Figure   S1). Among them, (+)-α-pinene and β-caryophyllene were most abundant in the leaves, representing 88.43 and 6.68% of total terpenoids in the young leaves, and 85.42 and 10.24% in the mature leaves. With the exception of β-caryophyllene, other compounds were more abundant in the young leaves than in the mature leaves. These results suggest that young leaves are more efficient in terpenoids biosynthesis. Plant terpenoids can be divided into inducible and constitutive compounds. Inducible terpenes (e.g., β-ocimene) are synthesized  de novo in response to herbivore damage ( Paré and Tumlinson, 1997), whereas constitutive terpenes (e.g., α-pinene and β-caryophyllene) are stored in subepidermal pigment glands, and are immediately released upon herbivore feeding and leaf damage ( Elzen et al., 1985;  McCall et al., 1994;  Röse et al., 1996;  Paré and Tumlinson, 1997). Usually, glandular trichomes are more abundant in the young leaves, thus explaining why the young leaves of  R. tomentosa possess more mono- and sesqui-terpenes. Illumina Sequencing,  de novo Assembly and Function Annotation In order to further understand the molecular mechanism of terpenoid biosynthesis in  R. tomentosa, a comprehensive transcriptome in  R. tomentosa leaves were performed, which generated a total of 202,153,314 clean reads (total length of 30,431,756,559; 30.4 Gb) after removing the adaptor sequences, ambiguous reads, and low-quality reads (Q20 < 20) ( Supplementary Table   S1). The Q20 (sequencing error rate < 1%) and GC percentages were 97.50 and 48.45%, 97.47 and 48.96%, 95.92 and 50.17%, respectively ( Supplementary Table   S1). The high-quality reads were deposited in the NCBI SRA database (accession number:  SRP132648). Considering unavailable reference genome for  R. tomentosa, Trinity (Trinityrnaseq_r20131110) were used to  de novo assemble all of the clean reads ( Grabherr et al., 2011). A total of 146,480 contigs ranging from 201 to 21,224 bp, with a mean length of 1,379 bp and an N50 length of 2,161 bp were assemble ( Supplementary Table   S1). Overall, these transcripts represented 83,175 unigenes with an average length of 888 bp and an N50 length of 1,702 bp, among which 53,334 coding DNA sequences (CDS) were detected ( Supplementary Table   S1). By searching against five public protein databases, a total of 53,742 unigenes (64.61%) were annotated. Among them, the unigenes matched to NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), SWISS-PROT, eukaryotic ortholog groups (KOG), kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) and gene ontology (GO) databases were 49,545 (59.57%), 42,547(51.15%), 35,016 (42.09%), 26,096 (31.37%) and 8,902 (10.7%), respectively ( Supplementary Table   S2). The KEGG pathway-based analysis could help in understanding the biological functions of genes. A total of 12,533 unigenes were annotated and assigned to 132 KEGG pathways. The category with the largest number of unigenes was metabolism, which included amino acid metabolism (1,991 unigenes, 16.41%), biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites (710, 5.85%), carbohydrate metabolism (3,683, 30,36%), energy metabolism (2,016, 16.62%), glycan biosynthesis and metabolism (229, 1.89%), lipid metabolism (1,225, 10.10%), metabolism of cofactors and vitamins (672, 5.54%), metabolism of other amino acids (618, 5.09%), metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides (439, 3.62%), and nucleotide metabolism (549, 4.53%) ( Supplementary Figure   S2A). With regards to terpenoid and polyketide metabolism, the most represented category was terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (168, 38.27%), followed by carotenoid biosynthesis (92, 20.96%); limonene and pinene degradation (42, 9.57%); diterpenoid biosynthesis (38, 8.66%); brassinosteroid biosynthesis (31, 7.06%); sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis (28, 6.38%); monoterpenoid biosynthesis (22, 5.01%); and zeatin biosynthesis (18, 4.10%) ( Supplementary Figure   S2B). Candidate Genes Encoding Enzymes Involved in Terpenoid Biosynthesis According to the GC–MS results, α/β-pinene, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene constitute the major active components in  R. tomentosa. Among them, (+)-α-pinene and β-caryophyllene were most abundant in the leaves ( Table   1). α-pinene, a monocyclic monoterpene, is an important raw material in the spice synthesis, while β-caryophyllene has antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticarcinogenic properties, enhanced skin penetration properties, and is also an approved food additive ( Cornwell and Barry, 1994;  Kubo et al., 1996;  Lourens et al., 2004;  Singh et al., 2006,  2014;  Huang et al., 2012). Therefore, biosynthesis pathway of α/β-pinene and β-caryophyllene were focused. The synthesis of IPP and its isomer DMAPP known as GPP and FPP precursors involves multistep enzyme catalytic reaction in the MVA and MEP pathways. Interestingly, 138 potential genes encoding these enzymes were identified by blasting the known protein database, including acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase (AACT); hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS); hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR); mevalonate kinase (MK); phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK); diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase (MPD); 1-deoxy- D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS); 1-deoxy- D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR); 2- C-methyl- D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (MCT); 4-diphosphocytidyl-2- C-methyl- D-erythritol kinase (CMK); 2- C-methyl- D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MCS); ( E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase (HDS); 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HDR); isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase (IPPI) ( Table   2,  Figure   1, and  Supplementary Table   S3). Finally, IPP and isomer DMAPP synthesize GPP and FPP by geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), respectively, which are then diverted to different mono- (e.g., α-pinene) and sesqui-terpenes (e.g., β-caryophyllene), respectively, after a single step enzymatic reaction mediated by TPS ( Keszei et al., 2010;  Koo et al., 2016;  Piechulla et al., 2016) ( Figure   1). Therefore, identifying the function of TPS enzymes in the last step are important for understanding the molecular mechanism of terpenoid synthesis in  R. tomentosa. A total of seven unigenes encoding TPS were identified from the RNA-seq data. The amino acid comparison showed 63–65% similarity and 41–42% identity among RtTPS1 to 4, while RtTPS4-7 have high similarity with 92% and similarity with 91%. Compared with other species, RtTPS1 and RtTPS2 are more homologous to PINS from  G. hirsutum and  Quercus ilex, whereas RtTPS3 to 7 shares high homology with CARS from  Cucumis sativus and  S. lycopersicum ( Supplementary Table   S4). Alignment of the amino acid sequences indicated that RtTPS1 to 7 contain highly conserved motifs along with other known TPSs ( Fischbach et al., 2001;  Lücker et al., 2002;  Mercke et al., 2004;  Schilmiller et al., 2010;  Huang et al., 2013;  Yang et al., 2013) ( Figure   2). An aspartate-rich motif DDxxD is crucial for substrate binding, while DDxxxxxxE functions in metal cofactor binding ( Köllner et al., 2004). Both are required for GPP and FPP ionization ( Rynkiewicz et al., 2001;  Degenhardt et al., 2009). It was reported that RxR motif located 35 amino acids upstream of DDxxD motif has been implicitly involved in the complexation of diphosphate group after substrate ionization, while RR(X)8W motif present in the N-terminal region might participate in the isomerization of the substrate and is characteristic of the majority of TPS-a and TPS-b subfamilies ( Starks et al., 1997;  Bohlmann et al., 1998;  Williams et al., 1998). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that RtTPS1-2 and RtTPS3-7 clustered closely with their orthologs from other plants, belonging to the TPS-b and TPS-a subfamily, respectively ( Figure   3). Enzyme Activity of RtTPS1-4 According to phylogenetic tree analysis, RtTPS1 and RtTPS2 are clustered in the branch of pinene synthase, while RtTPS3 to 7 are clustered in the branch of β-caryophyllene synthase ( Figure   3). Therefore,  RtTPS 1-4 were selected to perform enzyme activity  in vitro by heterologous expression and GC-MS detection. The results showed that RtTPS1-4 produce mainly (+)-α-pinene and (+)-β-pinene, as well as small amounts of (−)-α-pinene and (−)-β-pinene with GPP, while RtTPS1 and RtTPS3 are also active with FPP, producing β-caryophyllene, along with a smaller amount of α-humulene ( Figure   4). RtTPS 1-4 contain all the conserved domains of the TPS family, including the RR(P)X 8W, RXR, and DDXXD (X is any amino acid) motifs, and absolutely conserved arginine, cysteine and histidine residues in active-site ( Bohlmann et al., 1998). However, our results indicated that RtTPS1, RtTPS3-4 can catalyze the formation of α/β-pinene, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene ( Figure   4). The amino acid number of RtTPS1, RtTPS3-4 at upstream of conserved RRX8W motif is 38, 52, and 48, respectively, which result in an incomplete plastidial targeting sequence (62–64 aa) ( Figure   2).  Bohlmann et al. (1998) suggested that short N-terminal sequence may play a role in the isomerization step of the terpenoid cyclization reaction, thus producing multiple pinene isomers and enantiomers. In addition, differences in amino acids between loop and helix in domains may also lead to diverse products.  Phillips et al. (2003) reported that these differences could conceivably determine substrate folding, thereby providing a stereochemical switch. Domain swapping and directed mutagenesis in (−)-(4 S)-limonene synthase (LS) and (−)-(4 S)-limonene/(−)-(1 S, 5 S)-α-pinene synthase (LPS) from  Abies grandis suggested that amino acids in the predicted D through F helix regions are critical for product determination ( Katoh et al., 2004). The chiral analysis showed that RtTPS1-4 can produce more (+)-α-pinene and (+)-β-pinene than (−)-α-pinene and (−)-β-pinene, which may be related to the pH conditions of enzyme activity. TPSs preferentially form (+)-pinenes under acidic conditions, whereas (−)-pinenes is easily formed under alkaline conditions ( Phillips et al., 1999). A pinene synthase from  A. grandis that produces both (−)-α- and (−)-β-pinene in pH 7.5 assay buffer ( Bohlmann et al., 1997). In our experiments, the neutral conditions of pH 7 may contribute to (+)-/(−)-pinenes. The results of enzyme activity are consistent with those detected in volatile oil from leaves. Interestingly, RtTPS1 and RtTPS3 were also able to catalyze FPP to produce β-caryophyllene (65.71% for RtTPS1 and 93.05% for RtTPS3) and α-humulene (34.29% for RtTPS1 and 6.95% for RtTPS3) ( Figure   4B and  Supplementary Table   S7). In previous reports,  G. hirsutum TPS1 (GhTPS1) and OkBCS from  O. kilimandscharicum were also reported to produce mainly β-caryophyllene and smaller amounts of α-humulene ( Huang et al., 2013;  Jayaramaiah et al., 2016). Moreover, the ratio of two substances catalyzed by OkBCS is similar to our results ( Jayaramaiah et al., 2016). In addition, CsTPS4FN, CsTPS5FN and CsTPS9FN in  Cannabis sativa could also collectively catalyze GPP and FPP. Especially, CsTPS5FN was an unusual TPS-b member lacking a N-terminal plastidial targeting sequence, which was able to produce sesquiterpenes when incubated with FPP ( Booth et al., 2017). It is well known that monoterpenes are synthesized in plastids, while sesquiterpenes are synthesized in cytosol ( Jayaramaiah et al., 2016;  Ruan et al., 2016). TPS1 and TPS3 produced monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes simultaneously, but they did not have N-terminal plastid-targeting sequences ( Figures   2,  4). This requires the transport of IPP/DMAPP (GPP and FPP precursor) between plastid and cytosol, as occurs in hop trichomes and snapdragon flowers ( Dudareva et al., 2005;  Wang et al., 2008). Overall, diverse structure and extensive catalytic activities of RtTPS1-4 suggested divergent and convergent functions of  R. tomentosa TPSs in terpene biosynthesis. Expression Patterns of RtTPS1-7 To study the TPS gene expression in the young and mature leaves of  R. tomentosa, we measured the accumulation of  RtTPS 1-7 transcripts using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) ( Figure   5). The expression levels of  RtTPS3, RtTPS4 and  RtTPS7 had significantly expressed levels in the young leaves than in the mature leaves, while  RtTPS1 were more highly expressed in the mature leaves than in the young leaves, and  RtTPS2, RtTPS5 and  RtTPS6 showed similar expression in the two tissues. These results suggest that candidate TPS genes involved in pinene and caryophyllene were differentially regulated at transcriptional level. In terms of the four candidate genes encoding to RtTPS1-4, the expression levels of RtTPS3 and RtTPS4 in the young leaves were higher than that of RtTPS1 and RtTPS2, contributing probably to more pinene biosynthesis in the young leaves. Similarly, high expression level of RtTPS3 may also contribute to high biosynthesis of caryophyllene in the young leaves. However, the expression levels of these genes did not correlate well with the synthetic level in the old leaves, suggesting that other TPS transcripts which failed to identify in our study can lead to accumulation of pinene and caryophyllene in the old leaves, since transcriptome only represents a set of transcripts of a period.","Plant-derived terpenes are effective in treating chronic dysentery, rheumatism, hepatitis, and hyperlipemia. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of terpene biosynthesis in some terpene-abundant Chinese medicinal plants is of great importance. Abundant in mono- and sesqui-terpenes,  Rhodomyrtus tomentosa  (Ait.) Hassk, an evergreen shrub belonging to the family Myrtaceae, is widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, (+)-α-pinene and β-caryophyllene were detected to be the two major components in the leaves of  R. tomentosa , in which (+)-α-pinene is higher in the young leaves than in the mature leaves, whereas the distribution of β-caryophyllene is opposite. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of leaves identified 138 unigenes potentially involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. By integrating known biosynthetic pathways for terpenoids, 7 candidate genes encoding terpene synthase (RtTPS1-7) that potentially catalyze the last step in pinene and caryophyllene biosynthesis were further characterized. Sequence alignment analysis showed that RtTPS1, RtTPS3 and RtTPS4 do not contain typical N-terminal transit peptides (62-64aa), thus probably producing multiple isomers and enantiomers by terpenoid isomerization. Further enzyme activity  in vitro  confirmed that RtTPS1-4 mainly produce (+)-α-pinene and (+)-β-pinene, as well as small amounts of (-)-α-pinene and (-)-β-pinene with GPP, while RtTPS1 and RtTPS3 are also active with FPP, producing β-caryophyllene, along with a smaller amount of α-humulene. Our results deepen the understanding of molecular mechanisms of terpenes biosynthesis in Myrtaceae.","['Biosynthesis', 'Rhodomyrtus tomentosa', 'Terpenoids', 'Transcriptome', 'Terpene Synthases']","['Gas Chromatography', 'Supplementary Table', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Discussion Gas', 'young leaves', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Leaves', 'mature leaves', 'Leaves Gas', 'Figure']","[GC–MS, β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene, Paré, α-pinene, sesqui-terpenes, 30,431,756,559, Trinityrnaseq_r20131110, 146,480, 21,224, SWISS-PROT, 49,545, 35,016 (, 26,096, β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene has antimicrobial, Cornwell, β-caryophyllene, acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase, AACT, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, HMGS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, C-methyl- D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, MCT, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2- C-methyl- D-erythritol kinase, C-methyl- D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase, E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase, geranyl diphosphate synthase, GPPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, FPPS, α-pinene, sesqui-terpenes, TPS enzymes, 63–65, RtTPS4-7, RtTPS1, RtTPS2, TPSs, DDxxxxxxE, metal cofactor binding (, RR(X)8W, RtTPS1-2, RtTPS3-7, RtTPS1-4, RtTPS1, RtTPS2, RtTPS3, β-caryophyllene synthase, RtTPS1-4, RtTPS1, RtTPS3, β-caryophyllene, RXR, DDXXD (X, RtTPS3-4, RtTPS3-4, (−)-(4 S)-limonene synthase, (−)-(4 S)-limonene/(−)-(1 S, LPS, D, RtTPS1-4, (+)-pinenes, (−)-pinenes, (−)-α-, RtTPS1, RtTPS3, β-caryophyllene (65.71, hirsutum TPS1, GhTPS1, OkBCS, OkBCS, CsTPS4FN, CsTPS5FN, CsTPS9FN, CsTPS5FN, TPS1, TPS3, RtTPS1-4, RtTPS1-7, RtTPS4, RtTPS5, RtTPS1-4, RtTPS3, RtTPS4, RtTPS1, RtTPS2, RtTPS3]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS4-7', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS2', 'RtTPS3', 'RtTPS1', 'TPSs', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'RtTPS1-2', 'RtTPS3-7', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-a', 'RtTPS1-4', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS2', 'RtTPS3', 'RtTPS', 'RtTPS1-4', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS3', 'RtTPS', 'TPS', 'RtTPS1,', 'RtTPS3-4', 'RtTPS1,', 'RtTPS3-4', 'RtTPS1-4', 'TPSs', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS3', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS3)', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS3)', 'TPS1', '(GhTPS1)', 'CsTPS4FN,', 'CsTPS5FN', 'CsTPS9FN', 'CsTPS5FN', 'TPS-b', 'TPS1', 'TPS3', 'RtTPS1-4', 'TPSs', 'RtTPS1-7', 'TPS', 'RtTPS', 'RtTPS3,', 'RtTPS4', 'RtTPS7', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS2,', 'RtTPS5', 'RtTPS6', 'TPS', 'RtTPS1-4,', 'RtTPS3', 'RtTPS4', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS2,', 'RtTPS3', 'TPS']",[],[],NaN

Flower Developmental Stages and Major Volatile Compound Emissions Flowers of  J. sambac ‘Bifoliatum’ were divided into five developmental stages: (1) Bud stage where all petals were close together; (2) initial-flowering stage, i.e., outside petals started reflex outwardly; (3) flower opening stage in which all petals became reflex and were ready to fully open; (4) flower fully opening stage, all petals completely opened with half of the petals becoming droopy; and (5) initial senescence stage, i.e., petals start withering ( Figure 1). The GC-MS analysis showed that a total of 30 volatile organic compounds were emitted from flowers of  J. sambac ‘Bifoliatum’.  Table 1 presents 13 major compounds (higher chromatographic areas) emitted from living flowers at the five developmental stages. The concentrations were determined relative to the internal control of ethyl decanoate except for α-farnesene which was calculated based on standard curve. Compounds released from closed buds were low except for linalool, a monoterpene, which was 3.89 mg/kg FW (fresh weight). Linalool drastically increased to 41.86 mg/kg FW at stage 2, then dropped to about 22 mg/kg FW at stages 3 and 4, and further decreased to 8.38 mg/kg FW. On the other hand, α-farnesene, a sesquiterpene was detected at stage 2 and increased from 12.08 mg/kg FW to 53.86 mg/kg FW at stage 3, then decreased to 39.03 mg/kg FW at stage 4 and 20.71 at stage 5. Another compound, benzyl acetate exhibited the same emission pattern as α-farnesene but at much lower concentration than α-farnesene. The rest compounds had concentrations much lower than the previously mentioned ones. The 13 compounds identified from living flowers were also the major compounds emitted from excised flowers ( Table 2). Linalool emission was 15.76 mg/kg FW 2 h after excision, increased to 19.52 at 4 h, 22.03 at 8 h, and decreased to 12.66 mg/kg FW at 16 h after excision. The emission of α-farnesene increased from 1.45 mg/kg FW at 2 h after excision to 12.20 mg/kg FW at 4 h, 30.66 mg/kg FW at 8 h and sustained 30.71 mg/kg FW at 16 h after excision. Emitted benzyl acetate was low after excision to 2 h later, but its emission increased to 3.69 mg/kg FW at 4 h, 16.68 mg/kg FW at 8 h, and then decreased to 12.66 mg/kg FW at 16 h. Similar to the living flowers, other compounds in excised flowers were lower. 2.2. Analysis of Key Genes Related to α-Farnesene Biosynthesis Results from the analysis of both living flowers and excised flowers suggested that ( E, E)-α-farnesene was the predominant volatile compound emitted from  J. sambac ‘Bifoliatum’. The biosynthesis of α-farnesene occurs through an isoprenoid pathway, commonly known as Mevalonate pathway (MVP) [ 14]. The α-farnesene biosynthesis uses acetyl CoA as precursor; hydroxymethylglutaric acid (HMG), mevalonic acid, and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) are important intermediates [ 14, 15, 16]. As shown in  Figure 2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (HMGS, EC 2.3.3.10) catalyzed acetyl coenzyme A to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR, AIY26014.1) is a rate-limiting step in the pathway [ 17], and its activity was positively correlated with terpenoid biosynthesis [ 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS, AIY24422.1), another key enzyme of MVP for terpene metabolism in plants, catalyzes sequential condensation reactions of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) with two units of 3-isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) to form 15 carbon farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) [ 24]. Sesquiterpene synthases have been found to use the C15-diphosphate intermediate ( E, E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) [ 25]. Terpene synthase (TPS, EC 4.2.3.20) is responsible for the synthesis of the various terpene molecules from two isomeric 5-carbon precursor ‘building blocks’, leading to 5-carbon isoprene, 10-carbon monoterpenes, 15-carbon sesquiterpenes, and 20-carbon diterpenes, including α-farnesene. Thus, an attempt was made to isolate  HMGS,  HMGR,  FPPS, and  TPS from  J. sambac ‘Bifoliatum’. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for  HMGS,  HMGR,  FPPS, and  TPS were isolated from a cDNA library constructed using flowers of  J. sambac ‘Bifoliatum’. The flank sequences of ESTs were amplified by RACE (rapid-amplification of cDNA ends) PCR to obtain the full length cDNA. GenBank accession numbers for  JsHMGR and  JsFPPS are AIY26014.1 and AIY24422.1, respectively. The isolated full-length cDNA of  JsHMGS has 1808 bp and contains a 1389 bp open reading frame (ORF) ( Table S1). The deduced amino acid sequence of the  JsHMGS shares 70% to 85% similarity with  Zea mays L.,  Brassica rapa L.,  Malus domestica Mill.,  Gossypium raimondii L.,  Glycine max (L.) Merr.,  Nicotiana tabacum L., and  Solanum tuberosum L. ( Figure 3). Phylogenetic analysis showed that  JsHMGS was much closer to  HGMS from  Glycine max than other homologue genes. The full-length cDNA of  JsHMGR is 2274 bp long with 1785 bp ORF. The deduced amino acid sequence of the JsHMGR share 78% to 82% homolog with  Panax ginseng C.A.Mey.,  Litchi chinensis Sonn.,  Panax quinquefolius L.,  Coffea arabica L.,  Gentiana lutea L.,  Solanum tuberosum,  Nicotiana tabacum, and  Withania somnifera L. ( Figure 3). Phylogenetic analysis showed that JsHMGR was rather independent from the homologs in the other species but more closely related to those from  Nicotiana tabacum,  Withania somnifera,  Solanum tuberosum,  Coffea arabica, and  Gentiana lutea ( Figure 3). The cloned full-length cDNA of  JsFPPS is 1394 bp long and contains a 1050 bp ORF. The deduced amino acid sequence of the JsFPPS shares 85%–94% homolog with  Gentiana lutea,  Artemisia annua L.,  Hevea brasiliensis Mull. Arg.,  Bacopa monnieri (L.) Pennerll,  Mentha x  piperita L., and  Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge ( Figure 3).  JsFPPS is more closely associated with  Bacopa monnieri,  Mentha x  piperita, and  Salvia miltiorrhiza. The full-length cDNA of  JsTPS is 1884 bp long and contains a 1491 bp ORF ( Table S2). The deduced amino acid sequence of the  JsTPS shares 49%–75% homology with  Malus domestica,  Pyrus communis L.,  Olea europaea L.,  Lavandula angustifolia Mill.,  Mentha spicata L.,  Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton,  Zingiber offcinale Roscoe.  Citrus junos Siebold ex Tanaka, and  Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A. Gray ex. Hook. Phylogenetic analysis showed that  JsTPS was much closer to  TPS from  Olea europaea and also closer to  TPS from  Malus domestica and  Pyrus communis than from the other mentioned species ( Figure 3). 2.3. Relative Expression of Genes Related to α-Farnesene Biosynthesis The expression patterns of four genes involving α-farnesene biosynthesis at the five flower developmental stages are present in  Figure 4.  JsHMGS expression was low at the flower bud stage and drastically increased at stage 2 and then decreased from stages 3 to 5 ( Figure 4A). The expression of  JsHMGR was also low at the bud stage, gradually increased at stage 2, peaked at stage 4, and then decreased ( Figure 4B).  JsFPPS expression was higher at stage 2, peaked at stage 3, slightly reduced at stage 4, and dramatically reduced at stage 5 ( Figure 4C). The expression pattern of  JsTPS was similar to  JsHMGR, increased from stage 2 to 4 and decreased at stage 5 ( Figure 4D). The analysis of  JsHMGR and  JsTPS in excised flowers showed lower expressions after flowers were excised; however, their expressions sharply increased at 8 h after excision ( Figure 5). 2.4. Effects of Lovastatin on Gene Expression and Volatile Compound Emission Time-course expressions of  JsHMGS,  JsHMGR,  JsFPPS, and  JsTPS in flowers sprayed with lovastatin were compared to those without lovastatin treatment. The spraying signficantly reduced  JsHMGS expression 2 h after spraying ( Figure 6A) and also decreased  JsFPPS expression from 2 to 6 h after spraying ( Figure 6C). The most significant reduction happened in  JsHMGR and  JsTPS expression, and the suppression sustained from 2 to 6 h after lovastatin application ( Figure 6B,D). The suppression of α-farnesene biosynthesis related gene expression also resulted in significant reduction in biosynthesis of volatile compounds including α-farnesene, isoledene, caryophyllene, humulene, copaene, muurolene, and trans-farnesene ( Figure 7). The reductions in α-farnesene, isoledene, muurolene, and trans-farnesene were not just at 4 h but also 6 h after lovastatin application. In fact, the sweet fragance was diminished from flowers 2 h after lovastatin-application.","Fresh jasmine flowers have been used to make jasmine teas in China, but there has been no complete information about volatile organic compound emissions in relation to flower developmental stages and no science-based knowledge about which floral stage should be used for the infusion. This study monitored volatile organic compounds emitted from living flowers of  Jasminum sambac  (L.) Ait. 'Bifoliatum' at five developmental stages and also from excised flowers. Among the compounds identified, α-farnesene, linalool, and benzyl acetate were most abundant. Since α-farnesene is synthesized through the Mevalonate pathway, four genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and terpene synthase were isolated. Their expression patterns in living flowers at the five stages and in excised flowers coincided with the emission patterns of α-farnesene. Application of lovastatin, a HMGR inhibitor, significantly reduced the expression of the genes and greatly decreased the emission of α-farnesene. The sweet scent was diminished from lovastatin-treated flowers as well. These results indicate that α-farnesene is an important compound emitted from jasmine flowers, and its emission patterns suggest that flowers at the opening stage or flower buds 8 h after excision should be used for the infusion of tea leaves.","['Lovastatin', 'jasmine', 'Α-farnesene', 'Terpene Synthase (Tps)', '3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase (Hmgr)', '3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Synthase (Hmgs)', 'Jasminum Sambac (L.)

74,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6198442\eupmc_result.json,PMC6198442,"Results Identification and characterization of putative terpene synthase genes in C . puteana A Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis of fungal genomes with conserved terpene synthases sequences resulted in the identification of a large number of putative terpene synthases (TPSs). However, for the majority of TPS candidates, a biochemical and functional characterization remains to be established. In order to gain insight into their catalytic function, three putative TPSs (Copu1: XP_007772164.1; Copu2: XP_007771895.1; Copu3: XP_007765978.1) from  C. puteana were selected for cloning and functional characterization. The specific selection was made on the basis of characteristic conserved sequence motifs. Moreover, Copu1-3 showed closely related amino acid (AA) sequences (55–62% similarity). A comparison of the AA sequence of Copu1 and Copu2 with the public database showed < 50% similarity to other listed enzymes, covering all biological realms. By contrast, Copu3 showed 65% similarity to putative TPS sequences, which were not functionally characterized. The AA sequences of all three enzymes contained typical sequence motifs common to the TPS family, such as the highly conserved (N/D)D(L/I/V)x(S/T)xxxE (NSE) triad and the aspartate-rich D(D/E)xxD motif, coordinating a trinuclear Mg 2+ cluster, which is catalytically essential for the initial hydrolysis of the FPP-derived pyrophosphate group [ 22] (see Additional file  1). A highly conserved arginine residue, indicated as the pyrophosphate sensor, is located 46 positions upstream of the NSE triad. Additionally, the catalytically important RY-dimer, which is involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds to the substrate-derived pyrophosphate, is found 80 AA downstream of the NSE triad and close to the C-terminus [ 23– 25]. Heterologous expression of  C. puteana TPS genes resulted in the generation of diverse sesquiterpenes in  E. coli To study the product profile of Copu1-3, their predicted coding sequences were codon-optimized and synthesized for transfer into  E. coli expression vectors. For the heterologous expression, an adapted production system based on a single operon with a constitutive promoter was constructed. Reported bottleneck enzymes from  E. coli’s native non-mevalonate pathway (MEP) were selected for co-expression (DXS; WP_099145004.1 and idi; AAC32208.1) to increase the precursor supply and enhance the general isoprenoid production (Fig.  1). The resulting plasmids were transformed into  E. coli HMS174 (DE3) for recombinant gene expression and subsequent analysis of new, potential terpene compounds. In the first series of experiments, a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase ( Pantoea ananatis; crtE; ADD79325.1) was additionally integrated into the operon to study a potential function as diterpene synthases.  E. coli cultures co-expressing Copu2 or Copu3 with the MEP bottleneck enzymes for 48 h produced a mixture of exclusively 12 and 18 terpene products, respectively. A cultivation temperature of 30 °C and reduced shaking (90 rpm) ensured an adequate bacterial growth rate and the requirements for the production of potentially volatile compounds. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of the liquid extract revealed new product peaks in both cultures with typical mass fragmentation patterns at 161, 207, 222 m/z and 105, 161, 204 m/z (Fig.  2), illustrating the mass patterns for cyclic C 15 hydrocarbons with and without a single hydroxyl group. Copu3 appeared to be quite selective for the generation of one major STP alcohol (RT: 15.4 min; parent ion at 222 m/z). In contrast, Copu2 appeared to convert FPP into a smaller and slightly different set of cyclization products. The major product of Copu2 fermentations (RT: 14.3 min) was identified as an unhydroxylated STP compound (parent ion at 204 m/z). By contrast, no terpenoid products were detected in  E. coli cultures expressing Copu1. Neither the co-expression with a GGPP synthase to enable a possible formation of diterpenes nor the evaluation of different fermentation temperatures to avoid eventual evaporation of volatile compounds (e.g., monoterpenes) showed any product formation. Therefore, Copu1 was classified as a non-functional TPS sequence.  Terpene purification and structure elucidation A putative identification of the newly generated STPs was performed by comparing their detailed mass spectra to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Database. The comparison of the GC–MS metabolite profiles of  E. coli cultures expressing Copu2 revealed the putative tricyclic STP β-copaene (RT: 14.3 min; parent ion at 204 m/z; major daughter ions at 105, 161 m/z) as the major product. β-Copaene accounted for about 62% of the total STPs detected by GC-FID.  E. coli strains expressing Copu3 accumulated the putative tricyclic STP alcohol cubebol (RT: 15.4 min; parent ion at 222 m/z; major daughter ions at 105, 161, 207 m/z) as the major product, representing 75% of the total terpene fraction (Fig.  2). Other minor compounds from both cultures encompassed δ-cadinene, β-elemene, germacrene D and germacrene D-4-ol, whose GC–MS spectra were consistent with NIST database references. Notably, several minor STPs did not match any NIST reference spectra and could therefore not be assigned. In addition to GC–MS analyses, the main products of Copu2 and Copu3 were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Organic extraction allowed HPLC-based β-copaene and cubebol purification from 1-L fermentations. The HPLC separation of the Copu2 fermentation products allowed for the extraction of the main product but could not resolve several other STPs, which most likely represent a mixture of different product isoforms. However, another minor product was isolated from the Copu3 fermentation broth. A comparison of NMR spectra to reported references confirmed the presence of β-copaene [ 26,  27], cubebol [ 28] and δ-cadinene [ 29] as products of Copu2 and Copu3, respectively. Based on the NMR data, we designated Copu2 as a new β-copaene synthase. Conversely, Copu3 was designated as a new, highly selective cubebol synthase. Interestingly, a rearrangement of β-copaene to the better described α-isomer could be observed in this context. The complete conversion took place by storing the pure compound in chloroform for < 12 h (Fig.  3). α-Copaene has been shown to possess important biological properties, including anticarcinogenic as well as antioxidant activity in the field of neurodegenerative diseases [ 30,  31], or serves as an insect attractant [ 32]. Phylogenetic synthase evolution At present, the identification and characterization of terpene cyclases from the group of Basidiomycota is limited. Protein sequence-based phylogenetic analysis of the 29 genetically and biochemically characterized STPSs derived from Basidiomycota revealed four distinct clades (clade I–IV) (Fig.  4). The clustering by sequence conservation suggests that STPSs within one specific clade may catalyze the same or a related cyclization reaction. It also revealed that Copu2 and Copu3 clustered in clade I together with all other Basidiomycota-derived STPSs, generating either β-copaene or cubebol (ACTPS9, Cop4 and Stehi_128017). Additionally, most enzymes that generated cadinene isoforms clustered in clade I. For several candidate enzymes constituting this clade (Cop4, Omp4, Omp5a and 5b), a substrate cyclization mechanism has already been postulated, involving a 1,10-cyclization of (3R) nerolidyl diphosphate (NPP). The conversion of initial FPP involves the formation of a cis-germacradienyl cation, followed by a subsequent 1,6-cyclization. The final result is various STPs derived from a cadinyl cation (Fig.  5) [ 14,  33,  34]. By contrast, the clade II STPS mechanism involves a 1,10-cyclization of (2E,6E)-FPP to an E,E-germacradienyl cation (Omp1–3, Cop 1–3) [ 35], generating predominantly α-muurolene and germacrene A as well as different types of cadinol. Clade III STPSs share a 1,6-cyclization mechanism of (3R)-NPP or (3S)-NPP, leading to a bisabolyl cation [ 33,  36], forming mainly barbatene or α-cuprenene. Finally, clade IV STPSs share a common 1,11-cyclization mechanism of (2E,6E)-FPP [ 37]. Except for GME9210, all enzymes in this clade exclusively represent functionally characterized Δ6-protoilludene synthases.  In silico homology modeling [ 38] of Copu1-3 as well as Cop4 and structural alignments with the selinadiene cyclase (4OKM), a monomeric STPS from  Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, as a nearest neighbor reference structure were carried out (see Additional file  1). Interestingly, the sequence identity analyses strictly differentiates sequences from distinct organisms while the structural analysis (RMSD calculation) reveals a close structural relation between Copu3 and Cop4. Both enzymes produce δ-cadinene, β-copaene and cubebol. Technical scale, fed-batch production of β-copaene and cubebol To investigate the production performance of Copu2 and Copu3 in an optimized microbial system, fed-batch fermentation experiments were carried out in 1.3-L fermenters. This production scale provided for technically relevant amounts of β-copaene and cubebol.  E. coli HMS174 (DE3) strains co-expressing either Copu2 or Copu3 and the corresponding MEP bottleneck enzymes were cultured at 30 °C under controlled conditions (Fig.  6). The Copu2-expressing culture reached its stationary phase after 46 h with a final calculated OD 600 of 130, providing a final β-copaene titer of 215 mg/L. Based on these data, the specific β-copaene production and productivity were 4.4 mg/g dry cell weight (DCW) and 4.7 mg/L/h, respectively. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of any quantitative biotechnological production of β-copaene. In comparison, the Copu3-based fermentation generated a cubebol titer of 497 mg/L (calculated OD 600 of 182), and the specific cubebol production and productivity even reached 7.2 mg/g DCW and 11.2 mg/L/h, respectively. The reported titers in this study exceeded concentrations of alternative approaches obtained by equivalent fermentations based on a plant-derived cubebol synthase (titers of 10 mg/L cubebol) [ 48] by 50-fold. "," Background Terpenes are an important and extremely versatile class of secondary metabolites that are commercially used in the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics sectors. Genome mining of different fungal collections has revealed the genetic basis for a steadily increasing number of putative terpene synthases without any detailed knowledge about their biochemical properties. The analysis and research of this rich genetic source provides a precious basis for the advancing biotechnological production of an almost endless number of valuable natural metabolites. Results Three annotated terpene synthases from the little investigated Basidiomycota Coniophora puteana were studied in this work. For biochemical characterization, the heterologous expression in E. coli was conducted leading to the identification of two sesquiterpene synthases capable of the highly selective generation of β-copaene and cubebol. These compounds are commercially used as food and flavor additives. The new enzymes show the highest reported product selectivity for their main compounds and therefore represent the first exclusive synthases for β-copaene (62% product selectivity) and cubebol (75% product selectivity) generation. In combination with an optimized heterologous microbial production system, we obtained product titers of 215 mg/L β-copaene and 497 mg/L cubebol. Conclusion The reported product selectivity and our generated terpene titers exceed all published biotechnological data regarding the production of β-copaene and cubebol.

De Novo Transcript Assembly and Annotations To obtain the full-length transcripts of the  Papaver species  Papaver rhoeas and  Papaver nudicaule, we have sequenced 700 Mb from the PacBio sequencing. After filtering out the low-quality reads and adapter contamination according to the technologies that were used ( Table 1, section A), a total of 302 Mb high-quality long read sequences were assembled into 120,926 contigs with 3117 bases of N50 (called the representative transcriptome) ( Table 1, section A). Most of the sequence lengths were between 3000 and 3500 bp ( Figure 1A). This representative transcriptome contains 1185 (82.3%) benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) genes present in the reference transcriptome, and only 180 (12.5%) genes were missing from the representative transcriptome ( Table 1, section D).  The absence of these genes can be explained by various reasons, for example, the sequence coverage was not enough and those genes could only be expressed in a very low quantity [ 32]. Furthermore, the transdecoder has translated 85.2% of the transcripts into proteins, and, among those, 68.9% were complete ( Table 1, section C). The representative transcriptome was annotated with the Uniprot plant reference database, and 77.5% of the transcripts has obtained an annotation. Approximately 39% of the sequences had a sequence identity of 70 to 100% to the Uniprot plant reference database ( Figure 1B), meaning that most of the annotated transcripts could share reliable functional annotations from the reference sequences. Seventy-nine percent of the annotations was obtained from  Macleaya cordata ( Figure 1C), which is the only species in the  Papaveraceae family for which a draft genome sequence is available. Finally, in an effort to more precisely characterize the annotations, we found that 57.4% of the representative transcripts were assigned to a gene ontology term (GO) and only 11% of the representative transcripts were assigned to a KEGG enzyme ( Table 1, section B). 2.2. Differentially-Expressed Transcripts To assess the transcripts expression patterns concerning the plant developmental stages, three-time points, i.e., 30, 60, and 90 days leaves were sequenced. Three biological replicates were sequenced for each sample using the Illumina HiSeq paired-end assessment. Altogether, 128.8 GB of RNA-Seq data were obtained from 18 given samples. After filtering out low-quality reads and adapter contaminations, 76.8% (an individual summary is given in  Figure 2A) of the Illumina reads were mapped to the representative transcriptome, and differential expression was calculated while using transcripts per million (TPM). A total of 5421 transcripts showed differential expression patterns in at least one pair of given conditions (an individual summary is given in  Figure 2B; additionally, see  Supplementary File S1), and, among those, 137 transcripts were noted to have differential expression in both species ( Figure 2C). Furthermore, these transcripts were grouped into nine clusters, and four clusters were selected according to the desired expression patterns ( Figure 2D).  In cluster one, the expression of two transcription-responsible transcripts (PSIISO0021193: AP2-ERF domain and PPNISO0037702: NAC domain) depends highly on the growth stage. In cluster two, most of the differentially-expressed transcripts were involved in the transcription mechanism, and notably, in one cytochrome, they were responsible for brassinosteroid biosynthesis (PPRISO0050638). In cluster three, most grouped transcripts show the transcription factor functions. The transcripts that were responsible for the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid (PSIISO0046781) were also grouped in the third cluster. Finally, cluster nine contains the transcript responsible for peptidase-C1A and glycosyl-transferase. Furthermore, another 137 (from the total 5421 DGEs) transcripts showing differential expression are involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and most of these transcripts are involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics and phenylpropanoids ( Figure 2E; additionally, see  Supplementary File S1). 2.3. Secondary Metabolite Biosynthesis Transcript Profiles To understand the presence of secondary metabolite biosynthesis transcripts/genes in  Papaver species and in 51 other plant genomes (34 families; 12 monocots, 20 eudicots, and one moss), a comparative heat map was derived ( Figure 3).  Genomes were selected based upon three characteristics—flower colors, edible fruits, and general food/oil crops—along with the model plants. Among these genomes, 56 KEGG secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathway heat maps were derived from the ortholog analysis. The heat map includes 860 transcripts from the  Papaver representative transcriptome, which was grouped into 580 clusters and 161 single-copy genes. To understand the evolutionary relationship among the given genomes regarding the secondary metabolite biosynthesis, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed from a concatenation of 161 single-copy gene/transcripts that were extracted from the above clusters ( Figure 4). In the tree, the  Papaver genus was grouped with three genomes:  Macleaya cordata,  Aquilegia coerulea, and  Nelumbo nucifera. Among these genomes,  Macleaya cordata [ 33] and  Nelumbo nucifera [ 34] are rich in alkaloid contents and, recently, the  Aquilegia coerulea genome was studied due to its adaptive radiation within its subspecies [ 35]. Furthermore, 137 secondary metabolite biosynthesis transcripts that are differentially expressed during  Papaver plant developmental stages ( Figure 2E) showed the potential to be responsible for the concentration variation of secondary metabolites during the  Papaver plant developmental stages. Through this heat map, we have observed that the two pathways in  Papaver (biosynthesis of ansamycins (map01051), isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis (map00950)) have different gene coverage compared to the others. Other than the  Papaver transcriptome, this heat map facilitated more observations that were more specific to the genomes, i.e., biosynthesis of vancomycin group antibiotics (map01055) was more specific to  Ricinus communis and acridone alkaloid biosynthesis (map01058) was more specific to  Citrus unshiu. Furthermore, some maps are more specific to the higher clades of flowering plants, i.e., Acarbose and validamycin biosynthesis (map00525) was more specific to some monocots (five genomes) than eudicots, whereas only one genome in the eudicots ( Ricinus communis), as well as maps dioxin degradation (map00621) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation (map00624), were more specific to moss ( Physcometrella patens). 2.4. Biosynthesis of Isoquinoline Alkaloid (BIA)  In the heat map of the secondary metabolite biosynthesis transcripts, the BIA pathway (map0050) has shown a different coverage to other pathways in the  Papaver transcriptome and to the other representative genomes ( Figure 3). Naturally,  Papaver species are known to be rich in alkaloid drugs [ 7, 20, 21, 29], and, therefore, we have explored the BIA KEGG ortholog heat map ( Figure 5). Furthermore, to understand the expressions of metabolite and the transcripts with the reference of KEGG pathway, the corresponding transcripts and metabolites were mapped into the BIA pathway using Pathview v.3.7 [ 36] ( Figure 6) and their detailed metabolite quantification and relative differential expressions were plotted in the separate heat-maps by transforming the intensity values into  Z-score ( Figure 7). The comparative BIA heat map ( Figure 5) includes 69 transcripts for 30 KEGG orthologs (KO). Among those, 49 transcripts were differentially expressed during the plant growth ( Figure 2E). From the BIA co-occurrence heat map ( Figure 5), we observed that four KOs (( S)-norcoclaurine synthase (K13382), ( S)-scoulerine 9- O-methyltransferase (K13397), ( S)-(styopine/canadine/nandinine) synthase (K13395), and reticuline  N-methyltransferase (K21580)) are found in three genomes ( Macleaya cordata,  Aquilegia coerulea, and  Papaver spp.), two KOs (( S)-cheilanthifoline synthase (K21070) and methyltetrahydrotoberberine 14-monooxygenase (K21692)) are found in  Papaveraceae genomes ( Macleaya cordata and  Papaver), and three KOs (1,13-dihydroxy- N-methylcandine 13- O-acetyltransferase (K22095), salutaridine synthase (K13391), and  N-methylcanadine 1-hydroxylase (K20621)) are only found in the  Papaver transcriptome. Furthermore, some KOs are highly specific to single genomes, i.e., columbamine O-methyltransferase (K13398) is specific to  Aquilegia coerulea, monoamine oxidase (K00274) is specific to  Medicago truncatula, and aromatic- l-amino-acid (K01593) is specific to  Physcometrella patens. Along with this heat-map, 22 alkaloids that are available with the known standards were quantified with LC-QTOF-MS/MS ( Figure 7). In the metabolite quantitative analysis, we observed that  Papaver nudicaule has a higher quantity of these alkaloids than  Papaver rhoeas ( Figure 7A), and an individual differential content of metabolites was noted ( Figure 7B). In both species, the alkaloids from morphine to tetrahydropapaverine were highly accumulated in 90 days plant, and other metabolites have shown an opposite pattern in the  Papaver rhoeas and  Papaver nudicaule ( Figure 7B). Furthermore, these collective profiles were marked with the BIA KEGG pathway diagram for an easy interpretation ( Figure 6). The twelve transcripts that belong to BIA KOs were selected for the qRT-PCR to conform the similar expression patterns ( Figure 8). From the validation, results show the similar expression from both the experiments, and although the values from the heterogenic experiment and statistical methods. These results might facilitate a hypothesis-driven experimental design for the detailed characterization of various secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways and  Papaver spp. plant associated genetic developmental problems.  2.5. Cytochrome Transcripts  The cytochrome heat map includes 39 transcripts of 23 cytochrome super families ( Figure 9). Although 171 transcripts encoded for cytochrome domains, here, we have considered only the full-length transcripts. Further, to understand the cytochrome diversity, we have reconstructed a phylogenetic tree from 39 cytochromes ( Figure 10A) and the corresponding expression profiles were given in the heat map ( Figure 10B). Furthermore, seven cytochromes are not expressed in leaves, whereas they are expressed in seeds (thus, to prepare the representative transcriptome, we have included the seed transcriptome library). Moreover, we do not have the tissue-specific expression profile to claim that these cytochromes are specific to seeds. In our transcriptome, the cytochromes similar to families 71, 51, 86, 88, 716, 94, and 81, which play critical roles in species-specialized terpene biosynthesis in other plants, and the cytochrome families Cyp724, 734, 86, 90 and 94, which are involved in steroidal alkaloid and saponin biosynthesis in other plants, were also found in our transcriptome [ 37, 38, 39]. The Cyp719 cytochrome family was only present in alkaloid rich genomes, such as  Papaver spp.,  Aquilegia coerulea, and  Macleaya cordata. Furthermore, the two Cyp719 transcripts, along with seven other cytochromes, were only present in  Papaver spp. Finally, the Cyp716 was only present in five genomes and it was shown to be crucial for tri-terpenoid biosynthesis [ 40]. These cytochrome profiles could aid in the production of more detailed functional characterizations (i.e., which cytochromes are specific to  Papaver spp., also involved in BIA biosynthesis).","The  Papaver  spp. ( Papaver rhoeas  (Corn poppy) and  Papaver nudicaule  (Iceland poppy)) genera are ornamental and medicinal plants that are used for the isolation of alkaloid drugs. In this study, we generated 700 Mb of transcriptome sequences with the PacBio platform. They were assembled into 120,926 contigs, and 1185 (82.2%) of the benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) core genes were completely present in our assembled transcriptome. Furthermore, using 128 Gb of Illumina sequences, the transcript expression was assessed at three stages of  Papaver  plant development (30, 60, and 90 days), from which we identified 137 differentially expressed transcripts. Furthermore, three co-occurrence heat maps are generated from 51 different plant genomes along with the  Papaver  transcriptome, i.e., secondary metabolite biosynthesis, isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis (BIA) pathway, and cytochrome. Sixty-nine transcripts in the BIA pathway along with 22 different alkaloids (quantified with LC-QTOF-MS/MS) were mapped into the BIA KEGG map (map00950). Finally, we identified 39 full-length cytochrome transcripts and compared them with other genomes. Collectively, this transcriptome data, along with the expression and quantitative metabolite profiles, provides an initial recording of secondary metabolites and their expression related to  Papaver  plant development. Moreover, these profiles could help to further detail the functional characterization of the various secondary metabolite biosynthesis and  Papaver  plant development associated problems.","['Transcriptome', 'Alkaloid Biosynthesis', 'Poppy', 'Papaver Rhoeas', 'Papaver Nudicaule', 'Target Metabolome']","['Figure', 'Papaver', 'transcripts', 'biosynthesis', 'Metabolite Biosynthesis', 'Papaver transcriptome', 'heat map', 'biosynthesis transcripts', 'representative transcriptome', 'Papaver spp.']","[single-copy, BUSCO, PSIISO0021193, AP2-ERF, PPNISO0037702, cytochrome, PPRISO0050638, peptidase-C1A, glycosyl-transferase, food/oil crops, single-copy, single-copy, cordata, map01051, map00621, heat-maps, KOs (, S)-norcoclaurine synthase, K13382, S)-scoulerine 9-, O-methyltransferase (, K13397, reticuline  N-methyltransferase, K21580, KOs, S)-cheilanthifoline synthase, methyltetrahydrotoberberine 14-monooxygenase, KOs (1,13-dihydroxy- N-methylcandine, K22095, salutaridine synthase, K13391, K13398, monoamine oxidase, K01593, Cytochrome, cytochrome heat, cytochrome, cytochrome, cytochrome, cytochromes, cytochromes, cytochromes, cytochromes, cytochrome, Cyp724, Cyp719 cytochrome, Cyp719, cytochromes, Cyp716, cytochrome, cytochromes]",[],[],['Citrus'],NaN

Accumulation of Citral Concentrations at Different Stages of Fruit Development Because α-citral (geranial) and β-citral (neral) are the major compounds in  L. cubeba, we analysed the concentration of citral at different stages (60 to 165 DAF) ( Figure 1A). To explore oil accumulation during the development of  L. cubeba fruit, this was also analyzed ( Figure 1B). The results indicated that 75 and 90 DAF were developmental stages characterized by rapid increases in the concentration of citral and the oil content, respectively, whereas 105 DAF was the key stage for citral concentration. Furthermore, 135 DAF was the stage when the concentration of citral was stable and the oil content was high. Therefore, to detect the differentially expressed genes with increasing concentrations of citral concentration during the fruit development, the DGE sequencing and qRT-PCR analyses were performed using samples from 60 DAF, 75 DAF, 90 DAF, 105 DAF and 135 DAF stages.  2.2. Analysis of DGE Libraries and Mapping Five libraries were constructed, and sequence analyses were conducted. Approximately 34.19 million raw reads were generated. Date evaluation of the GC percentage of the clean reads in the five DGE libraries was performed ( Table 1). The GC percentages of five libraries range from 46.38 % to 47.57 %. The clean data sets are available at the NCBI SRA with the accession number: SRP073696. Subsequently, to elucidate the molecular events underlying the DGE profiles, all clean reads were aligned to the reference transcriptome of  L. cubeba. The average percentage of reads mapped to the reference transcriptome was 89.16% for the five development periods, including mismatching and empty position. Furthermore, after excluding mismatching and empty position, the average percentage of reads mapped to the reference transcriptome was 63.85%. Using the number of reads per kilobase transcriptome per million mapped reads (RPKM) approach, the expression level of each gene was measured by reading the sequencing depth and gene length. The results showed that mRNAs transcribed from the major types of genes were represented by low RPKM values, and only a small proportion of genes was highly expressed ( Figure S1). For example, in the 60 DAF stage, the number high expression genes (RPKM > 100) accounted for approximately 1% of the total number of genes ( Figure S1-A(1)), whereas the total RPKM values of these genes accounted for 50% of the RPKM values of all the genes ( Figure S1-A(2)). In contrast, the number of genes with a lower expression level (RPKM was 0–5) accounted for approximately 60% of the total number of genes, whereas the total RPKM values of these genes accounted for approximately 8% of the RPKM values of all the genes. This expression pattern indicated the non-uniformity and redundancy of mRNA. To confirm whether the number of detected genes (RPKM ≥ 1) increased proportionally to the total number of clean reads, sequencing data saturation analysis was performed.  Figure 2 shows that the relative number of genes identified increased as the total tag number of tags for all the five libraries. The number of detected genes plateaued when it approached eight million.  2.3. Differential Gene Expression Analysis To identify genes that were differentially expressed during the development of  L. cubeba fruit, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two samples were identified using statistical criteria (|log 2 (fold-change)| ≥ 1 and  p-value ≤ 0.01). Fruit at 60 days after flowering (DAF) served as the control, a total of 920, 2606, 2271 and 2661 genes were differentially expressed at 75, 90, 105 and 135 DAF, respectively. There were 415, 1255, 449 and 811 up-regulated genes and 505, 1351, 1823 and 1850 down-regulated genes identified at 75, 90, 105 and 135 DAF, respectively. The down-regulated genes were more abundant than the up-regulated genes. A Venn diagram showing all of the DEGs is shown in  Figure 3. For the up-regulated genes, 51 genes were co-expressed, and 193, 772, 104 and 285 of the up-regulated genes were specific to each of the four respective contrast groups. For the down-regulated genes, 298 genes were co-expressed, and 56, 271, 500 and 412 genes of the down-regulated genes were specific to each of the four respective contrast groups ( Figure 3). 2.4. GO Functional Enrichment Analysis of the DEGs In our research, DEGs were classified into three functional categories: cellular components, molecular functions, or biological processes ( Figure 4). In the 11 subsets (extracellular matrix, extracellular region, extracellular region part, membrane, antioxidant activity, electron carrier activity, enzyme regulator activity, nutrient reservoir activity, developmental process, pigmentation, response to stimulus), ratio of DEG unigenes numbers in all DEG unigenes numbers were more than ratio of unigenes numbers in all DEG unigenes numbers. Since this study focused on terpenoid biosynthesis, we expected to find that genes associated with this biosynthetic process would be differentially expressed during development of  L. cubeba fruit. The results showed that 14 subsets of the biological processes category and 20 subsets of the molecular functions category were found to be involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, 75 DEGs were identified to be involved with terpenoid biosynthesis. Within the biological ontology category, the DEGs involved in terpenoid biosynthesis could be further classified into two categories: precursor biosynthetic processes (26 DEGs, two of which were up-regulated and 24 down-regulated) and biosynthetic processes of diverse terpenoids (44 DEGs, two of which were up-regulated and 24 down-regulated). In the molecular function ontology category, 35 DEGs were identified (nine of which were up-regulated and 26 down-regulated) ( Table S1). 2.5. Pathway Enrichment Analysis of DEGs Using KEGG KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the five DEG libraries was performed. All annotated genes were mapped to terms in the KEGG database to search for significantly enriched genes involved in metabolic or signal transduction pathways. A total of 3384 DEGs were mapped to 262 KEGG pathways, including the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathways, the ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis pathways, the carotenoid biosynthesis pathways, the steroid biosynthesis pathways, the prenyltransferases pathways, the diterpenoid biosynthesis pathways, the limonene and pinene degradation pathways and the geraniol degradation pathways. The 447 DEGs identified in the 60 DAF vs. 75 DAF contrast group were assigned to 120 KEGG pathways. Furthermore, the 1138 DEGs identified in 60 DAF vs. 90 DAF contrast group were mapped to 181 KEGG pathways, the 1320 DEGs identified in the 60 DAF vs. 105 DAF contrast group were mapped to 186 KEGG pathways, and the 1092 DEGs identified in the 60 DAF vs. 135 DAF contrast group were mapped to 180 KEGG pathways. From all those pathways, the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway was selected for further analysis. A total of 26 DEGs were identified in this pathway ( Table 2), 14 of which were also identified in the GO analysis. Almost all DEGs (24 of 26) were down-regulated, and only two DEGs (g 8148 and g 56393) were up-regulated (geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, type III and geranylgeranyl reductase). In addition, g 4005, g 21893, g 52640, g 5372, g 39745 and g 58660 were up-regulated in the 75 DAF vs. 60 DAF contrast group, g 60046, g 5264, and g 7256 were up-regulated in the 90 DAF vs. 60 DAF contrast group, and g 60046 were up-regulated in the 105 DAF vs. 60 DAF contrast group. Furthermore, g 54221 was up-regulated in all contrast groups except for the 105 DAF vs. 60 DAF contrast group.  Figure S2 represents the locations of DEGS involved in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway. Red or green represents gene was up-regulated or down-regulated genes during the fruit development, respectively. 2.6. Clustering of Candidate Genes The clustering analysis of 80 DEGs (detected by GO and pathway analyses) during the fruit development was performed with the correlated expression profiles. The genes were clustered according to the similarity of their expression patterns. The heatmap of the ratio of the normalized log 2-transformed RPKM values of the four stages to the 60 DAF RPKM values generated using Multiple Array Viewer ( Figure 5). Up-regulated genes are shown in red, while down regulated genes are shown in blue. As shown in  Figure 5, the expression level of four DEGs (g 54506, g 60333, g 43974 and g 53869) was all increased during the fruit development, whereas the g 32346, g 54564 and g 59227 showed the opposite trend. Except for these seven DEGs, the expression of others had no unified trend during the the fruit development. Moreover, three DEGs of these seven (g 43974, g 53869 and g 59227) were involved in terpenoid biosynthetic bassed on GO analysis, which may be related the terpenoids biosynthesis and should be investigated in future analysis.  2.7. Confirmation of Differential Genes Using qRT-PCR To examine the results obtained from the DGE analysis, five genes were selected for qRT-PCR ( Table S2). The genes selected for the analysis were involved in two upstream pathways related to terpenoids biosynthesis (mevalonate (MVA) pathway) and methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway). Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBC) gene served as an internal control gene. The relative expression level of these five genes was compared with the RPKM values from the DGE analysis ( Figure 6). The result showed tha the expressed of five genes was consistent between the qRT-PCR and DGE data.","Mountain pepper ( Litsea  cubeba  (Lour.) Pers.) (Lauraceae) is an important industrial crop as an ingredient in cosmetics, pesticides, food additives and potential biofuels. These properties are attributed to monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. However, there is still no integrated model describing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in terpenoid biosynthesis during the fruit development of  L. cubeba . Here, we performed digital gene expression (DGE) using the Illumina NGS platform to evaluated changes in gene expression during fruit development in  L. cubeba . DGE generated expression data for approximately 19354 genes. Fruit at 60 days after flowering (DAF) served as the control, and a total of 415, 1255, 449 and 811 up-regulated genes and 505, 1351, 1823 and 1850 down-regulated genes were identified at 75, 90, 105 and 135 DAF, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed 26 genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. Three DEGs had continued increasing or declining trends during the fruit development. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results of five differentially expressed genes were consistent with those obtained from Illumina sequencing. These results provide a comprehensive molecular biology background for research on fruit development, and information that should aid in metabolic engineering to increase the yields of  L. cubeba  essential oil.","['Differentially expressed genes', 'Quantitative real-time PCR', 'Digital Gene Expression', 'Terpenoid Biosynthesis', 'Litsea Cubeba (Lour.)

Results and Discussion This research has been designed to follow the nectar (NE)/honey-sac (HoS)/honey (HO) pathways of the headspace, volatiles, and semi-volatiles in order to characterize Satsuma mandarin ( Citrus unshiu Marc.) honey. Two complementary methods for VOC isolation (without artefact generation) were applied: HS-SPME (with two fibres: divinylbenzene/carboxene/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) and polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB)) and USE (using two solvents: pentane/Et 2O 1:2 ( v/ v) and CH 2Cl 2). The applied chemical screening methodologies indicated striking differences in the obtained chemical profiles (depending on the volatility/solubility/sample). As was previously mentioned, the melissopalynological analysis cannot be used ambiguously to authenticate this honey. To ensure the unifloral honey origin, all of the samples were collected under controlled bee-hive locations in the area where  C. unshiu predominantly grows. In investigated samples of the local beekeepers Satsuma mandarin pollen ranged from 1%–10%, and in other samples 3%–41%. The pollen grains from other nectar plant species in the samples were:  Capsela bursa pastoris L., Asteraceae ( Taraxacum form),  Citrus sinensis L.,  Fabaceae spp.,  Rhamnus spp.,  Colutea arborescens L.,  Diplotaxis erucoides L.,  Centaurea spp. and  Cerastium spp. 2.1. The Nectars’ Chemical Composition of the Headspace, Volatiles and Semi-Volatiles The major headspace compounds from all nectar varieties were nitrogen-containing compounds 1 H-indole (7.3%–52.5%; 12.2%–47.4%) and methyl anthranilate (3.0%–8.5%; 5.6%–19.8%),  Table 1. Higher percentages of 1 H-indole was found in NE  Okithu and  Zorica and methyl anthranilate in NE  Kawano Wase. Those compounds derive from chorismate in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway ( Figure 1). The plant enzymes catalyse three subsequent steps [ 20]. PR-anthranilate transferase catalyses phosphoribosyl moiety transfer from phospho-ribosylpyrophosphate to anthranilate. In the next step, PR-anthranilate isomerase rearranges PR-anthranilate to 1-( O-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose-5-phosphate. Indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthase next forms an indole ring during the conversion of 1-( O-carboxyphenyIamino)-1-deoxyribulose-5-phosphate to indole-3-glycerolphosphate. The major oxygenated monoterpenes in NE headspace were linalool (1.2%–21.7%; 5.3%–21.1%) and α-terpineol (2.4%–16.0%; 4.1%–9.3%). Their highest percentages were found in NE  Kawano Wase and  Chahara. Other abundant monoterpenes were terpinen-4-ol (0.0%–5.9%; 0.7%–3.6%), 1,8-cineole (0.4%–2.8%; 0.0%–3.7%) and γ-terpinene (0.0%–4.4%; 0.0%–8.1%). All these compounds are biosynthetically related and derive from geranyl pyrophosphate. Other monoterpenes were occasionally found in several nectar types ( Table 1). Only a few sesquiterpenes, pharnesyl pyrophosphate derivatives, were present with  trans-caryophyllene (0.0%–2.2%; 0.0%–2.6%) as the major contributor. cis-Jasmone ( cis-3-methyl-2-(2-pentenyl)-cyclopent-2-en-1-one) was found (1.1%–3.6%; 2.8%–7.9%) in all NE. It is produced by the plants by an oxidative degradation of jasmonic acid (formed by lipoxygenase-catalyzed oxygenation of linolenic acid via 18-carbon cyclic fatty acid formed by the action of hydroperoxide cyclase, followed by reduction and β-oxidations), via 1,2-didehydrojasmonic acid [ 21]. Subsequent protonation of the carbonyl  O-atom of 1,2-didehydrojasmonic acid is assumed to induce a Grob-type fragmentation of the molecule, yielding CO 2 and  cis-jasmone ( Figure 2a). Among benzene derivatives formed by the shikimate biosynthetic pathway, 2-phenylethanol (1.3%–4.1%; 0.6%–2.8%) and benzaldehyde (0.1%–3.6%; 0.0%–0.6%) were abundant with different distributions among NE A–NE D ( Table 1). Benzyl alcohol, phenylacetaldehyde (more abundant in NE  Okitsu and  Zorica) and methyl benzoate were also found. Phenylacetonitrile (0.0%–7.3%; 0.0%–6.3%) is another benzene derivative containing nitrogen. Its formation has been found in several secondary metabolic pathways initiating from phenylalanine in the plants [ 22]. Phenylalanine is first converted to ( E, Z)-phenylacetaldoxime, which is then transformed to 2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetonitrile, probably via phenylacetonitrile formation as the intermediate ( Figure 2b). NE A–NE D headspace also contained lower aliphatic compounds up to C 10 ( Table 1), most probably derived from fatty acid degradation. These compounds include alcohols (e.g., ( Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol, pentan-1-ol or hexan-1-ol), ketones (e.g., heptan-2-one or octan-2-one), acids (acetic and hexanoic), and methyl esters (octanoate, nonanoate and decanoate). Ultrasonic solvent extracts of NE A–NE D were strikingly different from the headspace composition, containing less volatile compounds ( Table 2). The major ones were ( Z)-octadec-9-en-1-ol (14.3%–52.3%), octadecan-1-ol (5.3%–26.0%) and hexadecan-1-ol (6.9%–16.5%). The headspace nitrogen-containing compounds were also identified by USE: 1 H-indole (2.7%–10.3%) and methyl anthranilate (0.9%–11.7%). However, new nitrogen compound appeared in the extracts, 1 H-indole derivative—1,3-dihydro-2 H-indol-2-one (0.2%–18.1%). It is interesting to note that the Schiff base of 1,3-dihydro-2 H-indol-2-one and its synthetic derivatives bearing a 1,3-dihydro-2 H-indol-2-one nucleus were reported for antibacterial, antifungal, anti-HIV, and anticonvulsant activities and GAL3 receptor antagonists [ 23]. Methylxanthine-derivative caffeine was found (1.1%–8.9%) in the extracts of NE A–NE D. Xanthine (3,7-dihydro-1 H-purine-2,6-dione) derivatives belong to purine alkaloids. The major pathway of caffeine biosynthesis is xanthosine → 7-methylxanthosine → 7-methylxanthine → theobromine → caffeine [ 24]. The presence of methyxanthine derivatives in the nectar and pollen of  Coffea,  Camellia,  Theobroma,  Herrania,  Cola,  Ilex,  Paullinia, and  Citrus spp. was previously determined by HPLC [ 18]. The nectar of  C. paradise,  C. maxima, and  C. limon contained caffeine (60–487 nmol·mL −1), theobromine (0–22 nmol·mL −1), theophylline (0–55 nmol·mL −1) and paraxanthine (0–12 nmol·mL −1). It is difficult to compare the abundance of caffeine ( Table 2) determined by USE/GC-MS/FID with the results of direct HPLC analysis, which is focused on the non-volatiles analysis.  Generally, Satsuma mandarin peel essential oil was characterized by a high percentage of limonene (67.4%), followed by β-myrcene, car-3-ene, α-pinene,  p-cymene, β-pinene, sabinene, terpinolene, and α-thujene [ 25]. The principal chemical constituents of  C. unshiu flower essential oil included γ-terpinene (24.7%), β-pinene (16.6%),  o-cymene (11.5%), limonene (5.7%), β-ocimene (5.6%) and α-pinene (4.7%) [ 25]. It is already known that the composition of the nectar and essential oil from the same plant is very different [ 26]. However, several common compounds were found in the flower essential oil and  C. unshiu nectar headspace investigated herein, such as γ-terpinene, limonene, α-pinene, and β-pinene. 2.2. The Chemical Composition of the Content of Honey-Sac Headspace, Volatiles and Semi-Volatiles The gathered nectar is stocked in the honey-sac, which can contain up to 60 μL. The enzymes in the saliva start to degrade the nectar sucrose into glucose and fructose and cleave the glycosides. The content of the sacs of the bees caught at the entrance of the hive on their way back from  C. unshiu nectar-gathering was investigated by HS-SPME/GC-MS/FID ( Table 3) and USE/GC-MS/FID ( Table 4). Dominant compounds were oxygenated monoterpenes, the major ones were linalool (15.2%; 3.8%), α-terpineol (10.2%; 9.3%) and 1,8-cineole (1.9%; 3.6%),  Table 3. Two nitrogen-containing compounds were found among the abundant compounds: 1 H-indole (7.9%; 8.9%) and methyl anthranilate (7.7%; 19.8%).  cis-Jasmone was also present (5.1%; 6.9%). The headspace benzene derivatives were mainly comprised of benzaldehyde (1.0%; 2.7%), benzyl alcohol (2.9%; 3.6%), phenylacetaldehyde (0.5%; 2.0%) and phenylacetonitrile (11.0%; 10.4%). The comparison with the headspace of all nectars reveals dominant qualitative similarities regarding the major compounds with fluctuation among their percentages ( Table 1). Two compounds were found only in the HoS headspace, not in the nectars: pentan-1-ol (1.3%; 1.3%) and heptan-2-ol (7.8%; 3.3%).  USE extract of HoS contained higher aliphatic compounds, the major ones were ( Z)-octadec-9-en-1-ol (45.3%), octadecan-1-ol (8.6%), and hexadecan-1-ol (11.6%),  Table 4. These chemical structures are related to the composition of cuticular waxes and less to pheromones, but have been also found in NE ( Table 2). Fatty acids and alcohols were previously identified as the major compounds of the solvent organic extract from the sacs of the bees that collected  Mentha spp. nectar, and methyl syringate, terpendiol I and vomifoliol were attributed to the plant origin [ 27]. Other important compounds from  Table 2 were caffeine (11.5%), 1H-indole (1.6%), 1,3-dihydro-2 H-indol-2-one (6.4%), and methyl anthranilate (1.4%). USE extracts of HoS and NE were very similar. Only 1-hydroxylinalool appeared (5.4%) in HoS, which can be indication of the beginning of linalool transformations triggered by the enzymes and continued later in the combs. 2.3. The Chemical Composition of C. unshiu Honey Headspace, Volatiles and Semi-Volatiles On returning to the hive, the content of the honey-sac is regurgitated into the honeycomb and ripened into honey. Under the honeycomb oxidative atmosphere sensitive honey organic compounds can undergo oxidation [ 28]. There are only a few studies in which the organic extractives of the honey-sac have been correlated with those of the corresponding honey. The comparison of the components of the extracts of Linden honey and honey-sac contents showed that nectar and honey-sac contents contain many aldehydes which were found as corresponding acids in the honey, while the aliphatic compounds, isoprenoids and the alkaloids remained unchanged [ 28]. In another research, the major identified terpene in the honey-sac was 3,7-dimethylocta-1,5-dien-3,7-diol (terpendiol I) and it was found in  Mentha spp. honey solvent extracts, but also can transform to hotrienol, the most abundant compound in the honey headspace [ 27]. Phenylacetaldehyde was dominant compound (34.4%–47.2%; 38.3%–49.1%) of the  C. unshiu honey headspace, followed by benzaldehyde (5.8%–9.8%%; 3.3%–6.6%). Among other benzene derivatives, abundant was phenylacetonitrile (2.7%–9.9%; 3.4%–10.2%). Phenylacetaldehyde was strikingly more abundant in comparison with the nectar headspace (HS-NE) and the headspace of the honey-sac (HS-HoS), shown in  Table 1, indicating its formation during the honey ripening in the hive, since heat was not applied to the samples. This can be generated from phenylalanine either by enzyme catalysis or by Strecker degradation [ 29]. A high percentage of phenylacetaldehyde was found in the honey headspace of  Asphodelus microcarpus Salz. et Viv. [ 30]. Phenylacetonitrile was present within percentage ranges similar to those seen in the HS-NE and HS-HoS ( Table 1), while benzaldehyde percentages were elevated. In addition to phenylacetonitrile, two aliphatic nitriles were detected in several honey samples with minor percentages ( Table 3): ethylisocyanide and 3-methylbutanenitrile. Benzaldehyde was found to be the major volatile from the honey of cambara and willow, but also in lemon and orange honey [ 17, 29]. Phenylacetonitrile was found in the headspace of dandelion and thyme honeys [ 31, 32]. Linalool was present as a minor constituent (0.0%–2.2%; 0.0%–4.5%) in distinction to HS-NE and HS-HoS. However, an array of linalool derivatives were found, such as  cis-linalool oxide (3.0%–11.5%; 0.0%–4.1%), hotrienol (1.4%–2.6%; 1.2%–2.3%), lilac aldehydes, dill ether or  p-menth-9-en-1-al isomers, not present at all in HS-NE and HS-HoS. They were formed from linalool within the hive conditions. Hotrienol derive either from dehydration of 2,6-dimethylocta-3,7-diene-2,6-diol or from allylic rearrangement and dehydration of 3,7-dimethylocta-1,7-diene-3,6-diol, which can be liberated from the corresponding glucoside or from dehydration of 8-hydroxylinalool [ 7]. Lilac aldehydes are formed by oxidation of lilac alcohols generated by hydroxylation of linalool to ( E)-8-hydroxylinalool, and further to ( E)-8-oxolinalool. Dill ether and  p-menth-1-ene-9-al isomers and  p-menth-1-ene-8-ol (α-terpineol) are also derived from ( E)-8-hydroxylinalool via allylic rearrangement and cyclisation of 8-hydroxygeraniol. Epoxidation of linalool gives 6,7-epoxylinalool, which undergoes further reactions to form linalool oxides and anhydrolinalool oxides, which can further yield lilac alcohols. The formation of linalool oxides and 2,6-dimethylocta-3,7-diene-2,6-diol was probably catalysed by the enzymes secreted by the bees [ 7]. 1 H-indole and methyl anthranilate were occasionally present, but not in the headspace of all honey samples, and with markedly lower percentages in comparison to HS-NE and HS-HoS. Among lower aliphatic compounds of the honey headspace, nonanoic acid was the most abundant (2.2%–3.3%; 2.3%–4.9%), but not found in HS-NE and HS-HoS.  Predominant compounds of the extracts were higher aliphatic compounds, such as ( Z)-octadec-9-en-1-ol (20.5%–49.1%; 11.8%–22.8%), hexadecanoic acid (0.5%–6.6%; 7.3%–33.8%), octadecan-1-ol (4.5%–11.4%; 3.8%–5.4%) and hexadecan-1-ol (5.8%–15.3%; 2.4%–5.4%). These compounds (except hexadecanoic acid) were found also in the nectar extracts (E-NE) and the honey-sac extract (E-HoS), but cannot be connected with specific botanical origin since they can be transferred from the comb environment [ 33]. Similar applies for higher alkanes found only in the honey extracts: tetracosane (1.1%–20.8%; 0.1%–29.7%), tricosane (0.3%–26.4%), docosane (0.2%–15.7%; 0.0%–8.5%) or heneicosane (0.0%–3.7%; 0.0%–3.0%). Among interesting compounds of the extracts, 1 H-indole (0.1%–0.3%; 0.1%–2.6%) and 1,3-dihydro-2 H-indol-2-one (0.2%–1.7%; 0.1%–1.3%) can be pointed out, similar to E-NE and E-HoS. Caffeine was also detected in all of the extracts (0.3%–0.8%; 1.2%–7.1%) with lower abundance in comparison to E-NE and E-HoS. In distinction to E-NE and E-HoS, two interesting compounds were present in the honey extracts: 1-hydroxylinalool (0.5%–6.5%; 0.2%–2.0%) and vomifoliol (0.2%–2.0%; 0.2%–2.4%). 1-Hydroxylinalool, previously identified in E-HoS, is a good indicator of linalool transformations providing linalool derivatives found only in the honey headspace. Norisoprenoid vomifoliol was not found in E-NE and E-HoS and, therefore, could be transferred from the comb environment. Pinocembrin (5,7-dihydroxy-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-4 H-chromen-4-one) was found only in CH 2Cl 2 extracts. It is a flavanone, containing the nucleus of hesperetin (2,3-dihydro-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-4 H-1-benzopyran-4-one) that was found in  Citrus honeys [ 13]. Due to the high molecular mass of pinocembrin, GC-MS is not a good method for its quantification (as for other flavanones). In addition, it could originate from propolis and, therefore, it is not commented in detail.  In comparison with other  Citrus honey VOCs, several similarities can be pointed out. Namely, the suitability of methyl anthranilate, originating from the plant, as the chemical marker of  Citrus honey types has been already found [ 34]. Along with the detection of methyl anthranilate, more than 60 different VOCs were also reported [ 11, 12, 17] in  Citrus honey types. Similar to the present research, benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, and linalool derivatives (e.g., linalool oxides, lilac aldehyde isomers, or  p-menth-1-en-9-al) were found among important  Citrus honey headspace compounds. Caffeine was also previously found as a characteristic compound of  Citrus honey [ 35]. However, despite previous studies on  Citrus honeys, few particular compounds were present in  C. unshiu honey not already mentioned in other  Citrus honeys, such as 1 H-indole, 1,3-dihydro-2 H-indol-2-one, and phenylacetonitrile.","Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and ultrasonic solvent extraction (USE), followed by GC-MS/FID, were applied for monitoring the nectar (NE)/honey-sac (HoS)/honey (HO) pathways of the headspace, volatiles, and semi-volatiles. The major NE (4 varieties of  Citrus unshiu ) headspace compounds were linalool, α-terpineol, 1 H -indole, methyl anthranilate, and phenylacetonitrile. Corresponding extracts contained, among others, 1 H -indole, methyl anthranilate, 1,3-dihydro-2 H -indol-2-one and caffeine. The major HoS headspace compounds were linalool, α-terpineol, 1,8-cineole, 1 H -indole, methyl anthranilate, and  cis -jasmone. Characteristic compounds from HoS extract were caffeine, 1 H -indole, 1,3-dihydro-2 H -indol-2-one, methyl anthranilate, and phenylacetonitrile. However, HO headspace composition was significantly different in comparison to NE and HoS with respect to phenylacetaldehyde and linalool derivatives abundance that appeared as the consequence of the hive conditions and the bee enzyme activity.  C. unshiu  honey traceability is determined by chemical markers: phenylacetaldehyde, phenylacetonitrile, linalool and its derivatives, as well as 1 H -indole, 1,3-dihydro-2 H -indol-2-one, and caffeine.","['Caffeine', 'GC-MS', 'Use', 'Phenylacetaldehyde', 'Hs-spme', '1H-indole', '1,3-Dihydro-2h-indol-2-one', 'Citrus Unshiu Marc.

Transcript Levels of Terpenoid Biosynthetic Genes We determined differential organ-specific expression patterns of terpenoid biosynthetic genes in  V. fauriei using qRT-PCR (quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction). The results are shown in  Figure 2 and  Figure 3. The height of each bar and the error bar indicate the mean and standard deviation based on three independent measurements. The Y-axis represents transcript levels normalized to  18S expression. Most genes related to the MVA pathway showed the highest expression levels in the stem, except for  VfHMGS and  VfHMGR. The expression patterns of  VfAACT,  VfMK,  VfPMK,  VfMVD, and  VfFDS were fairly similar, with the highest levels occurring in the stem, followed by the root and the flower or the leaf. Interestingly, in roots,  VfAACT and  VfFDS, which are involved in the first and last steps of the MVA pathway, were expressed at similar levels to the stem. Among MVA biosynthetic genes, the expression of  VfAACT,  VfMK and  VfMVD was high relative to  18S, while expression of  VfFDS was the lowest relative to  18S.  VfIDI, which produces the enzyme that catalyzes the isomerization of IPP to DMAPP in both the MVA and MEP pathways, was expressed most abundantly in the stem, followed by the flower, root, and leaf. According to analyses of MEP biosynthetic gene expression levels, most genes, including  VfCMK,  VfMDS,  VfHDR, and  VfGDS, had the highest expression levels in the stem, whereas  VfDXR and  VfHDS were highly expressed in the leaf.  VfMCT had similar expression levels in all organs of  V. fauriei. The lowest expression levels of  VfDXR,  VfMDS,  VfHDS, and  VfHDR were displayed in the root. In contrast,  VfDXS transcripts, which are involved in the start of the MEP biosynthetic pathway, had their highest level in the root. Expression levels of terpenoid backbone biosynthetic genes, which lead to IPP and DMAPP production, were primarily high in stem of  V. fauriei. 2.2. Analysis of Volatile Constituents In total, 128 volatile compounds were separated and identified based on comparison of the mass spectra with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) atomic spectra database, Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data, and the related literature ( Table 1) [ 20]. The total yield of the volatile compounds was indicated by the highest amount in the root (95.66%), followed by stem (84.05%), leaf (74.91%), and flower (65.33%). We identified 18 monoterpenes, 34 sesquiterpenes, and 80 other volatile compounds from  V. fauriei. Monoterpenes, namely borneol ( 11, 22.96%), bornyl acetate ( 13, 19.92%), and camphene ( 1, 3.33%) were found in high amounts in the roots. Interestingly, β-terpinene ( 3), myrcene ( 4),  p-cymene ( 5), and borneol ( 11) were detected only in the root. The leaf extract was characterized by a high content of  endo-borneol ( 10, 11.48%) and γ-terpinene ( 7, 3.23%). Sesquiterpenes accumulated primarily in the stem (21.55%) and roots (20.66%). The stem contained the highest amount of the sesquiterpene caryophyllene oxide ( 34, 17.45%). Seven sesquiterpenes ( 20– 22,  24– 26, and  50) were root-specific, while four others ( 33,  37,  39, and  51) were flower-specific. Isovalerenic acid ( 53, 3.33%), which produces the strong smell of  Valeriana species, was found only in the root of  V. fauriei. 2.3. Amounts of Valerenic Acid and Its Derivatives Valerenic acid and its derivatives, acetoxyvalerenic acid and hydroxyvalerenic acid, were extracted from different organs (flower, stem, leaf, and root) of  V. fauriei and analyzed with HPLC. Valerenic acid and its derivatives were detected only in roots ( Table 2). However, flowers, stems, and leaves have not shown detectable levels of the three compounds. The root extract had an average of 69.450 μg of valerenic acid per g of dry weight. Acetoxyvalerenic acid (32.234 μg/g dry weight) also had a high accumulation in the root. However, hydroxyvalerenic acid was not detected in any organ.","Valeriana fauriei (V. fauriei), which emits a characteristic and unpleasant odor, is important in traditional medicine. In this study, the expression of terpenoid biosynthetic genes was investigated in different organs that were also screened for volatile compounds including valerenic acid and its derivatives. Specific expression patterns from different parts of V. fauriei were observed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The highest transcript levels of biosynthetic genes involved in mevalonic acid (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) production were found in the stem. Although the amounts of volatile compounds were varied by organ, most of the volatile terpenoids were accumulated in the root. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 128 volatile compounds, which represented 65.33% to 95.66% of total volatiles. Certain compounds were only found in specific organs. For example, isovalerenic acid and valerenic acid and its derivatives were restricted to the root. Organs with high transcript levels did not necessarily have high levels of the corresponding chemical constituents. According to these results, we hypothesize that translocation may occur between different organs in V. fauriei.","['Terpenoid', 'Volatile compounds', 'Gene Expression', 'Valerenic Acid', 'Valeriana Fauriei']","['expression levels', 'Levels', 'expression', 'root', 'stem', 'Biosynthetic Genes', 'acid', 'Valerenic Acid', 'Genes', 'Biosynthetic']","[DMAPP, DMAPP, Wiley, β-terpinene ( 3, γ-terpinene ( 7, root-specific, flower-specific, Its Derivatives Valerenic acid, 32.234 μg/g]",[],['HPLC.'],[],NaN
79,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6299004\eupmc_result.json,PMC6299004,"Results Root herbivory leads to elevated monoterpene emission in poplar As part of our ongoing research on volatile-mediated defenses in poplar, we analyzed the volatiles emitted from undamaged and  M. melolontha (cockchafer)-damaged roots of  P. trichocarpa, a species native to North America, and  P. nigra, an indigenous European species. Trees were grown in sand-filled pots and a push-pull system was used to collect root volatiles from air pumped through the soil (Supplementary Fig.  S1). Volatile analysis was conducted with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Root damage caused by the larvae was monitored after the experiment by measuring the total root biomass. For  P. trichocarpa, cockchafer herbivory led to a significantly reduced root mass in comparison to undamaged controls (Supplementary Fig.  S2). For  P. nigra, however, we could not observe significant differences, although a slight trend of root biomass reduction in the grub treatments was visible (Supplementary Fig.  S2). Undamaged roots of both poplar species released considerable amounts of monoterpenes, including (−)-α-pinene, (−)-camphene, (−)-β-pinene, and 1,8-cineole (Table  1). Two further monoterpenes,  p-cymene and an unidentified compound with a molecular mass of 136, could only be detected in the volatile bouquet of  P. trichocarpa. Herbivory significantly increased the emission of 1,8-cineole from  P. trichocarpa, while (−)-camphene and an unidentified monoterpene were significantly induced in herbivore-damaged roots of  P. nigra (Table  1). Beside monoterpenes, both species also constitutively emitted the aromatic compounds benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, and salicylaldehyde, however, emission of these compounds was not influenced by the herbivore treatment (Supplementary Table  S1). Considering that the plastics pots and the moist sand in the volatile collection system both might adsorb plant-released volatiles, our quantification of constitutive and herbivore-induced root volatiles in  P. trichocarpa and  P. nigra is likely an underestimation of the total volatile release. To measure the potential accumulation of volatile compounds in the roots, we extracted plant material with hexane and analyzed the extracts using GC-MS. While the aromatic volatiles benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, and salicylaldehyde accumulated in root material collected from  P. trichocarpa and  P. nigra, monoterpenes (camphene) could only be detected in the extracts of  P. nigra (Supplementary Table  S2). Interestingly, salicylaldehyde and benzaldehyde showed significantly increased accumulation after cockchafer herbivory, although their emission rates were not influenced by the treatment as already mentioned above (Supplementary Tables  S1 and  S2). Identification and characterization of three monoterpene synthases in  P. trichocarpa and  P. nigra The recently identified terpene synthase PnTPS1 produces camphene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene and has been shown to be involved in herbivore-induced monoterpene formation in the leaves of  P. nigra22. Another monoterpene synthase, the 1,8-cineole synthase PtTPS13, was reported to be expressed in herbivore-damaged leaves of  P. trichocarpa20. Since products of both enzymes were found in the volatile bouquets of herbivore-induced  P. trichocarpa and  P. nigra roots (Table  1), we hypothesized that these or similar enzymes are also involved in the formation of root terpenes. To identify potential orthologues of  PnTPS1 and  PtTPS13 in  P. trichocarpa and  P. nigra, respectively, we amplified the open reading frames from cDNA made from  M. melolontha-damaged root material. Amplification and cloning were successful and the resulting genes were designated  PtTPS21 ( P. trichocarpa genome version 3.0 accession, Potri.001G308300) and  PnTPS4, respectively, according to the poplar TPS nomenclature initiated in previous studies 19,  20,  22. Sequencing of several amplicons revealed another  P. trichocarpa gene with 97% nucleotide similarity to  PtTPS21 that was designated  PtTPS16 (Potri.001G308200). A sequence comparison and dendrogram analysis of predicted monoterpene synthase genes in the  P.  trichocarpa genome showed that  PtTPS16 and  PtTPS21 were part of a gene cluster comprising four members highly similar to each other (Fig.  1). Heterologous expression of the N-terminal truncated open reading frames of the identified sequences lacking their putative signal peptides and subsequent enzyme assays confirmed monoterpene synthase activity for all tested enzymes. As expected, PtTPS21 and PnTPS4 had the same activity as their putative orthologues, PnTPS1 and PtTPS13, respectively, and produced camphene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene (PtTPS21) and 1,8-cineole and a few minor products (PnTPS4) (Fig.  2). Interestingly, PtTPS16, although highly similar to PtTPS21, showed different product specificity and produced γ-terpinene together with a mixture of minor monoterpene products (Fig.  2). Chiral analysis of PtTPS21 enzyme products showed that all of the produced monoterpenes were exclusively formed as (−)-enantiomers (Fig.  3). When tested with the sesquiterpene precursor ( E,E)-FPP, PnTPS4 showed activity and produced a mixture of sesquiterpens including ( E)-α-bergamotene, ( E)-β-farnesene, ( E,E)-α-farnesene, sesquiphellandrene, ( Z)-α-bisabolene, and nerolidol (Supplementary Fig.  S3). However, since PnTPS4 was found to possess a signal peptide that targets the protein to the plastids (Supplementary Fig  S4), it functions most likely as monoterpene synthase in planta. In contrast to PnTPS4, PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 were not active with ( E,E)-FPP. The diterpene substrate ( E,E,E)-GGPP was not accepted by the tested enzymes. Homology modeling of PtTPS16 and  in vitro mutagenesis of active site residues To identify the amino acid residues that determine the observed differences in product specificity of PtTPS16 and PtTPS21, we performed homology modeling of the three-dimensional structure of PtTPS16 using the crystal structure of (+)-limonene synthase from  Citrus sinensis23 as a template. Visualization of the resulting model and an amino acid sequence comparison of PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 revealed four amino acid substitutions within the active site pockets of the two proteins (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S5).  In vitro mutagenesis of the single residues isoleucine 335, valine 441, and valine 483 in PtTPS16 revealed no or only marginal changes in product specificity of the resulting mutant enzymes PtTPS16 I335V, PtTPS16 V441I, and PtTPS16 V483L, while a mutation of threonine 336 to asparagine led to an enzyme able to produce camphene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene in addition to γ-terpinene (Fig.  5). Different combinations of single amino acid changes finally showed that the quadruple mutant PtTPS16 I335V, T336N, V441I, V483L had a product specificity highly similar to PtTPS21, although there were still minor quantitative differences in the product profiles of the mutant and PtTPS21 (Fig.  5). Gene expression analysis of terpene synthases in poplar roots The expression levels of  P. trichocarpa PtTPS13,  PtTPS16, and  PtTPS21 and  P. nigra PnTPS4 and  PnTPS1 were measured in undamaged and  M. melolontha-damaged roots using qRT-PCR. The 1,8-cineole synthase genes  PtTPS13 and  PnTPS4 were less expressed in undamaged roots than the other genes, but showed significant upregulation upon root herbivory (Fig.  6). Expression of  PnTPS1 was also significantly induced by the herbivore treatment.  PtTPS21 and  PtTPS16 showed a trend towards higher expression levels in damaged-roots, although it was not significant when compared to expression levels in undamaged control roots (Fig.  6). 1,8-Cineole reduces the growth of the plant pathogen  Phytophthora cactorum in vitro Phytophthora cactorum (Oomycetes) is a widespread plant pathogen that can infest numerous plant species including crops and trees 24. Infection by this pathogen often results in root rot and causes massive yield losses or even plant death. To prove the hypothesis that herbivore-induced root monoterpenes might play a role in protecting wounded roots against soil-borne pathogens, we tested the influence of volatile 1,8-cineole, (−)-β-pinene, and (−)-limonene on the growth of  P. cactorum in vitro. 2-Phenylethanol, a common plant volatile known to have antifungal activity 25, was also included into the experiment. While 2-phenylethanol, (−)-limonene, and mineral oil as negative control had no influence on the growth of  P. cactorum, 1,8-cineole and (−)-β-pinene significantly reduced the growth of this pathogen when present in the headspace (Fig.  7).","Volatiles are often released upon herbivory as plant defense compounds. While the formation of volatiles above-ground has been intensively studied, little is known about herbivore-induced root volatiles. Here, we show that cockchafer larvae-damaged roots of Populus trichocarpa and P. nigra release a mixture of monoterpenes, including (-)-α-pinene, (-)-camphene, (-)-β-pinene, p-cymene, and 1,8-cineole. Three terpene synthases, PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 from P. trichocarpa and PnTPS4 from P. nigra, could be identified and characterized in vitro. PnTPS4 was found to produce 1,8-cineole as sole product. PtTPS16 and PtTPS21, although highly similar to each other, showed different product specificities and produced γ-terpinene and a mixture of (-)-camphene, (-)-α-pinene, (-)-β-pinene, and (-)-limonene, respectively. Four active site residues were found to determine the different product specificities of the two enzymes. The expression profiles of PtTPS16, PtTPS21, and PnTPS4 in undamaged and herbivore-damaged poplar roots generally matched the emission pattern of monoterpenes, indicating that monoterpene emission in roots is mainly determined at the gene transcript level. Bioassays with Phytophtora cactorum (Oomycetes) revealed inhibitory effects of vapor-phase 1,8-cineole and (-)-β-pinene on the growth of this important plant pathogen. Thus herbivore-induced volatile monoterpenes may have a role in defense against pathogens that cause secondary infections after root wounding.",NaN,"['North America', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'Fig.', 'Supplementary', 'Supplementary Table', 'Root', 'trichocarpa', 'indigenous European', 'roots', 'nigra']","[(−)-camphene, nigra (, PnTPS1, α-pinene, β-pinene, nigra22, trichocarpa20, nigra roots, Potri.001G308300, Potri.001G308200, PtTPS21, PnTPS4, PnTPS1, PtTPS13, α-pinene, β-pinene, PtTPS21, PtTPS16, PtTPS21, PtTPS21, (−)-enantiomers (Fig.  3, E)-FPP, PnTPS4, PnTPS4, PnTPS4, PtTPS16, PtTPS21, E, E)-FPP, E, E)-GGPP, PtTPS16, PtTPS16, PtTPS21, PtTPS16, sinensis23, PtTPS16, PtTPS21, PtTPS16 V441I, PtTPS16 V483L, α-pinene, β-pinene, PtTPS16 I335V, T336N, V483L, PtTPS21, PtTPS21 (, PtTPS13, damaged-roots, crops]","['PnTPS1', 'PtTPS13,', 'PnTPS1', 'PtTPS13', 'PtTPS21', 'PnTPS4,', 'TPS', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS21', 'PnTPS4', 'PnTPS1', 'PtTPS13,', '(PtTPS21)', '(PnTPS4)', 'PtTPS16,', 'PtTPS21,', 'PtTPS21', 'PnTPS4', 'PnTPS4', 'PnTPS4,', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS21,', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS21,', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS13,', 'PtTPS16,', 'PtTPS21', 'PnTPS4', 'PnTPS1', 'PtTPS13', 'PnTPS4', 'PnTPS1', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS16']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
80,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6363097\eupmc_result.json,PMC6363097,"Results PpUGT85A2 expression correlates with glycosylated linalool production in peach fruit Linalool is a major monoterpene that contributes to flavor quality ( Tian   et al., 2017 ), accounting for ~6% of total volatiles in peach fruit ( Liu   et al., 2017 ). Approximately 34% of total linalool in ripe peach fruit harvested at 111 DAB ( Fig. 1A) was present as non-volatile linalyl-β- d-glucoside. To identify peach  UGT genes associated with the formation of linalyl-β- d-glucoside, a Pearson correlation analysis between  UGT transcript levels and fruit glucoside contents was performed. First, peach fruit at five different ripening stages were used for correlation analysis between  UGT gene expression and linalyl-β- d-glucoside content ( Wu   et al., 2017 ). A total of 20  UGT genes were selected for further analysis including the 10  UGT genes that had positive correlations and 10  UGT genes with negative correlations (Supplementary  Table S1). The highest correlation coefficient was observed for  UGT Prupe.1G519600 ( PpUGT85A2) ( R=0.95,  P<0.001). Following the correlation analysis, transcript levels of these  UGT genes were investigated. Among these  UGT genes,  PpUGT85A2 had the highest level of mRNA ( Fig. 1A). During peach fruit ripening, transcript levels of  PpUGT85A2 correlated with increased production of linalyl-β- d-glucoside and ethylene production ( Fig. 1A). Ethylene regulates peach fruit ripening ( Mathooko   et al., 2001 ). Treatment of fruit with exogenous ethylene stimulated internal ethylene synthesis as well as  PpUGT85A2 transcript and accumulation of linalyl-β- d-glucoside ( Fig. 1B). In contrast, treatment of fruit with the ethylene signaling inhibitor 1-MCP reduced ethylene production and reduced both  PpUGT85A2 transcript and linalyl-β- d-glucoside content ( Fig. 1B), and linalool content (Supplementary  Fig. S1). For the 20  UGT genes mentioned above,  PpUGT85A2 had the highest transcript content in response to both ethylene and 1-MCP treatment (Supplementary  Fig. S2), and positively correlated with linalyl-β- d-glucoside production ( R=0.94,  P<0.001) (Supplementary  Table S2). SA treatment significantly increased  PpUGT85A2 transcript and the contents of linalyl-β- d-glucoside ( Fig. 2A) as well as linalool (Supplementary  Fig. S3). UV-B irradiation significantly reduced production of linalyl-β- d-glucoside and expression of  PpUGT85A2 in peach fruit ( Fig. 2B), while transcripts of other  UGT genes were induced in response to UV-B treatment (Supplementary  Fig. S4;  Wu   et al., 2017 ). Transcript levels of  PpUGT85A2 correlate with contents of linalyl-β- d-glucoside between peach organs and cultivars To investigate the regulation of  PpUGT85A2 and linalyl-β- d-glucoside further, gene expression and chemical content were also determined in different organs and different peach cultivars. The highest content of linalyl-β- d-glucoside was detected in young leaf, followed by ripe fruit and fully open flower. Similar to the pattern of the glucoside, the highest transcript levels of  PpUGT85A2 were also observed in young leaf ( Fig. 3A). To clarify the relationship between  PpUGT85A2 and linalyl-β- d-glucoside content further, we examined natural variation within eight different peach cultivars. Wide variations in linalyl-β- d-glucoside and  PpUGT85A2 transcript levels were observed among the different peach cultivars ( Fig. 3B). Linear regression analysis showed that  PpUGT85A2 transcript contents strongly positively correlated with linalyl-β- d-glucoside content among the cultivars ( R=0.98,  P<0.001) ( Fig. 3C). The content of linalyl-β- d-glucoside also correlated with free linalool ( R=0.83,  P<0.05) ( Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results indicate a positive correlation between transcript and glucoside concentration, making  PpUGT85A2 a good candidate for linalyl-β- d-glucoside synthesis. Recombinant PpUGT85A2 protein catalyzes  in vitro formation of linalyl-β- d-glucoside PpUGT85A2 encodes a 483 amino acid protein, belonging to the group G glycosyltransferase family based on phylogenetic analysis ( Wu   et al., 2017 ). PpUGT85A2 is clustered with UGT85 family members that are associated with linalyl-β- d-glucoside formation ( Fig. 4), including grapevine VvGT14 ( Bönisch   et al., 2014 ) and kiwifruit AdGT4 ( Yauk   et al., 2014 ), sharing 81% and 79 % amino acid similarity, respectively. In addition to the UGT85 family, gene products from the UGT71, UGT73, UGT75, UGT76, and UGT84 family have also been associated with linalool glycosylation ( Caputi   et al., 2008 ;  Song   et al., 2016 ). These results indicate that linalool can potentially be glycosylated by UGTs with diverse sequences and structures, indicating the difficulty of predicting function based on sequence homology and the importance of enzymatic characterization to identify functions of plant UGTs. To test further if the peach homologs could be associated with formation of linalyl-β- d-glucoside, a total of 12  UGT genes were cloned and expressed in  E. coli ( Fig. 5A). Enzymatic activity analysis showed that PpUGT85A2 (Supplementary  Fig. S5) catalyzed formation of linalyl-β- d-glucoside ( Fig. 5), with much higher activity than that of UGT85 family members Prupe.6G189800 (~18.8% activity in relative to PpUGT85A2) and Prupe.6G189900 (~6.6%) or the UGT76 family Prupe.6G008000 (~3.8%) ( Fig. 5A). No linalool glucosylation activity was detected for the remaining eight UGTs, including UGT85 family Prupe.3G190100, Prupe.1G053300, Prupe.1G520000, Prupe.8G063500, and Prupe.6G190100, UGT71 family Prupe.4G117900, UGT73 family Prupe.7G124200, and UGT76 family Prupe.6G008300. These results indicate that while multiple peach UGT enzymes are capable of linalyl-β- d-glucoside synthesis, PpUGT85A2 had the highest  in vitro activity. In addition,  PpUGT85A2 expression correlated positively ( R=0.95) with the glycosylated linalool while  Prupe.6G189800 ( R= –0.68),  Prupe.6G008000 ( R= –0.43), and  Prupe.6G189900 ( R= –0.33) were all negatively correlated with glycosylated linalool content (Supplementary  Table S1). Based on all of these considerations,  PpUGT85A2 was selected for further biochemical and molecular analysis. LC/TQMS analysis showed that recombinant PpUGT85A2 was able to catalyze  in vitro formation of linalyl-β- d-glucoside using UDP-glucose as sugar donor ( Fig. 5B), and had no activity toward linalool using UDP-galactose as sugar donor (Supplementary  Fig. S6). The optimum pH for  in vitro formation of linalyl-β- d-glucoside catalyzed by PpUGT85A2 was ~7.5–8.0, and the optimum temperature was in the range of 30–40 °C ( Fig. 5C). Kinetic analysis showed that the  Km values for linalool and UDP-glucose were 0.463 mM and 0.684 mM, respectively. The specificity constant ( kcat/ Km) for linalool was 54 s −1 M −1 ( Table 1). Different substrates were also tested for alcohols whose glycosylated forms were detected in peach fruit (Supplementary  Fig. S7; Supplementary  Table. S3). Geraniol was the best substrate among the monoterpenes, followed by linalool and α-terpineol. This relatively low activity for linalool was also observed with UGTs from grape (VvGT14a) ( Bönisch   et al., 2014 ), kiwifruit (AdGT4) ( Yauk   et al., 2014 ), and strawberry (FaUGT73B23, FaUGT73B24, and FaUGT71W2) ( Song   et al., 2016 ). In ripe peach fruit,  S-(+)-linalool is the major form of both free and glycosylated linalool ( Liu   et al., 2017 ; Supplementary  Fig. S8). To investigate the enantiomeric preference of PpUGT85A2, a racemic mixture (1:1) of  R, S-linalool was used as a substrate, and enantiomerically pure  R-linalool was used as reference material. Chiral-phase GC-MS analysis of linalyl-β- d-glucoside after hydrolysis by AR2000, showed a slight enrichment of  S-(+)-linalool ( Fig. 6). The enzyme AR2000 has no enatiomeric discrimination toward  R, S-linalool ( Bönisch   et al., 2014 ). Our data demonstrated low enantiomeric selectivity toward  R-(–)-linalool during 16 h assays, different from results obtained with the grape VvGT14a enzyme ( Bönisch   et al., 2014 ). Based on these results, the kinetic values for PpUGT85A2 were determined using a racemic mixture of linalool. Transient expression of  PpUGT85A2 in peach tissue To investigate further the role of PpUGT85A2 in synthesis of linalyl-β- d-glucoside in peach, leaf disks were incubated with linalool. Transcript levels of  PpUGT85A2 were induced by ~3-fold after linalool treatment compared with the control ( Fig. 7A). We also observed an ~5-fold increase in the content of linalyl-β- d-glucoside in these disks ( Fig. 7B). These results indicated that  PpUGT85A2 expression in peach is induced by linalool, leading to production of linalyl-β- d-glucoside. Overexpression of  PpUGT85A2 increases production of linalyl-β- d-glucoside  in planta To our knowledge, production of transgenic peach fruits has not been reported. Recently, a transient expression system was developed in fruit for the purpose of gene function analysis ( Liu   et al., 2017 ). Therefore, a homologous transient overexpression system combined with heterologous transgenic plant production was used to determine the function of  PpUGT85A2 in vivo. There was a significant increase in  PpUGT85A2 transcript in fruit after infiltration with  Agrobacterium harboring the pGreen-SK and PpUGT85A2 constructs (Supplementary  Fig. S9). Introduction of the PpUGT85A2 vector resulted in an ~2-fold increase in linalyl-β- d-glucoside ( Fig. 8A) and a corresponding depletion of free linalool (Supplementary  Fig. S10A). To test the function of the peach  UGT gene further,  PpUGT85A2 was heterologously overexpressed in tobacco and Arabidopsis plants. Compared with WT plants, transgenic tobacco plants (T157 and T145) produced an ~1.5- and 2-fold higher content of linalyl-β- d-glucoside, respectively ( Fig. 8B). In Arabidopsis, the concentration of linalyl-β- d-glucoside was under the limit of detection in the WT control. However, transgenic plants (T4163, T4276, and T4246) produced readily detectable linalyl-β- d-glucoside ( Fig. 8C). These results showed that  PpUGT85A2 synthesizes linalyl-β- d-glucoside formation  in planta. In peach fruit, levels of other glycosylated volatiles did not change significantly after infiltration with  PpUGT85A2 ( Fig. 8D). This may be related to the content of free volatiles as substrates. The contents of volatiles such as 2-phenylethanol, benzyl alcohol, geraniol, and eugenol were under the detection limits in peach fruit (Supplementary  Table S4; Supplementary  Fig. S10D). In tobacco and Arabidopsis, the presence of free volatiles as potential substrates for the enzyme was detected (Supplementary  Fig. S10E, F). A significant increase in the glycosylated form of 2-phenylethanol was observed in transgenic plants overexpressing peach  PpUGT85A2 ( Fig. 8E, F), and similar accumulation was also observed for geraniol in tobacco. Subcellular localization of PpUGT85A2 To determine the subcellular location of PpUGT85A2, a recombinant PpUGT85A2 tagged at the C-terminus with GFP was constructed, and the vector  35S::PpUGT85A2-GFP was infiltrated into tobacco leaves. The green fluorescence signal of the fusion protein indicated that GFP-tagged PpUGT85A2 was located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Fig. 9). Three independent experiments showed the same subcellular localization of PpUGT85A2. A similar pattern of localization has been observed for other UGTs in plants, including zeatin  O-glucosyltransferase UGT85A1 ( Jin   et al., 2013 ), UGT87A2 involved in flower development regulation ( Wang   et al., 2012 ), and UGT73C6. This latter UGT glycosylates flavonoids ( Jones   et al., 2003 ), hydroxycoumarins ( Lim   et al., 2003 ), and brassinosteroids ( Husar   et al., 2011 ). UGT enzymes may function in the nucleus to protect nuclear components from toxins ( Hart   et al., 1989 ).","The monoterpene linalool is a major contributor to aroma and flavor in peach (Prunus persica) fruit. It accumulates during fruit ripening, where up to ~40% of the compound is present in a non-volatile glycosylated form, which affects flavor quality and consumer perception by retronasal perception during tasting. Despite the importance of this sequestration to flavor, the UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) responsible for linalool glycosylation has not been identified in peach. UGT gene expression during peach fruit ripening and among different peach cultivars was analyzed using RNA sequencing, and transcripts correlated with linalyl-β-d-glucoside were selected as candidates for functional analysis. Kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture of R,S-linalool was shown for PpUGT85A2, with a slight preference for S-(+)-linalool. PpUGT85A2 was shown to catalyze synthesis of linalyl-β-d-glucoside in vitro, although it did not exhibit the highest enzyme activity between tested substrates. Subcellular localization of PpUGT85A2 in the cytoplasm and nucleus was detected. Application of linalool to peach leaf disks promoted PpUGT85A2 expression and linalyl-β-d-glucoside generation. Transient expression in peach fruit and stable overexpression in tobacco and Arabidopsis resulted in significant accumulation of linalyl-β-d-glucoside in vivo. Taken together, the results indicate that PpUGT85A2 expression is a major control point predicting linalyl-β-d-glucoside content.",NaN,"['Supplementary Fig.', 'Fig.', 'linalyl-β', 'd-glucoside', 'Supplementary', 'UGT genes', 'UGT', 'Supplementary Table', 'peach', 'peach fruit']","[PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, Mathooko   , linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, G glycosyltransferase, PpUGT85A2, Bönisch   , UGT71, UGT75, UGT76, UGT84, UGTs, UGTs, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, UGT85, PpUGT85A2, Prupe.6G189900, UGT76, Prupe.6G008000, UGTs, UGT85, Prupe.3G190100, Prupe.1G053300, Prupe.1G520000, Prupe.8G063500, Prupe.6G190100, UGT71, Prupe.4G117900, Prupe.7G124200, UGT76, Prupe.6G008300, PpUGT85A2, PpUGT85A2, R= –0.43, –0.33, PpUGT85A2, LC/TQMS, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, ~7.5–8.0, 30–40 °C, −1 M, −1 ( Table 1, α-terpineol, UGTs, Bönisch   , FaUGT73B23, FaUGT73B24, FaUGT71W2, glycosylated linalool, Liu   , PpUGT85A2, S-linalool, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, S-linalool, Bönisch   , Bönisch   , PpUGT85A2, PpUGT85A2, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β-, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, Liu   , PpUGT85A2, pGreen-SK, PpUGT85A2, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, T157, T145, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, T4276, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, linalyl-β- d-glucoside, PpUGT85A2, PpUGT85A2, PpUGT85A2, GFP, green fluorescence signal, PpUGT85A2, PpUGT85A2, UGTs, Jin   , UGT glycosylates, Lim   , UGT, Hart   ]",[],[],[],NaN

However,  CaLas could not be detected in fruit pulp from either healthy or infected trees. Obvious phenotypic differences were found between HLB-affected and healthy fruits; symptomatic fruits were smaller and greener than the healthy fruits (Fig.  1). The soluble solids content of fruit from  CaLas-infected trees (9.52 g 100 g −1) was decreased compared with that of healthy fruit (11.24 g 100 g −1), whereas the acid content of fruit from  CaLas-infected trees (0.82%) was increased compared with that of healthy fruit (0.70%).

There were 45 downregulated proteins involved in sugar and organic acid metabolism (Table  1, Fig.  3), 22 downregulated proteins involved in amino-acid metabolism (Table  2), five differentially expressed proteins involved in terpenoid metabolism (Table  3), and three downregulated proteins involved in pectin metabolism (Fig.  4). The expression of 45 enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism was downregulated in fruit from trees infected with  CaLas, including 12 oxidoreductases (EC 1 family), 12 transferases (EC 2 family), 2 hydrolases (EC 3 family), 12 lyases (EC 4 family), and 7 isomerases (EC 5 family) (Table  1). The expression of 22 enzymes involved in amino-acid metabolism was downregulated in fruit from trees infected with  CaLas, including eight oxidoreductases (EC 1 family), five transferases (EC 2 family), three hydrolases (EC 3 family), five lyases (EC 4 family), and one ligase (EC 6 family) (Table  2). In the terpenoid biosynthesis process (Table  3, Fig.  5), there were two downregulated oxidoreductases (EC 1 family), two downregulated transferases (EC 2 family), and one upregulated isomerase (EC 5 family) in fruit from trees infected with  CaLas. Regarding pectin metabolism, the downregulated proteins were pectin methylesterase (gi|641854939), UDP- d-glucose 4-epimerase (gi|568845013), and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (gi|641853915) (Table  1, Fig.  4). Downregulated proteins involved in sugar and organic acid metabolism and homeostasis Most of the proteins included in sucrose degradation and glycolytic pathways were downregulated when compared with those in healthy mature fruit. Sucrose is degraded by sucrose synthase (SUS) to generate fructose and UDP-glucose. The expression of SUS (gi|641868466) was decreased in fruit from trees infected with  CaLas. Fructokinase (gi|568849997 and gi|641841250) and pyrophosphate:fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (gi|641866581), which catalyse the phosphorylation of fructose, were also reduced on the protein level in symptomatic fruits. UDP-glucose can be converted into glucose-1P catalysed by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (gi|641838381) and UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase (gi|568837718), which is involved in the glycolysis process (Fig.  3). It can also be converted into UDP-glucuronate catalysed by UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (gi|641853915), which is involved in the synthesis of lignin (Fig.  4). Three of the enzymes were found at lower levels in diseased fruit than in the healthy control. All homologous proteins of Arabidopsis enolases (gi|568856679, gi|568864726, and gi|568870518) and phosphoglycerate kinases (gi|568881904 and gi|568881906) related to glycolysis were downregulated in the symptomatic fruit. Two isocitrate dehydrogenases (gi|568855816 and gi|641849423), two malate dehydrogenases (gi|641829225 and gi|641838649), and a fumarate hydratase (gi|641868430) were found at lower levels in the HLB-affected orange fruits than in the healthy control. Conversely, many proteins associated with pyruvate metabolism were downregulated by  CaLas. Levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (gi|572152874 and gi|641851263) and carboxykinase (gi|568836722), which are associated with the transformation between phosphoenolpyruvate and oxaloacetate, were decreased. Levels of malic enzyme (gi|641867382), which transforms malate to pyruvate, were reduced in fruit from  CaLas-infected trees. The pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex connects glycolysis with the TCA cycle. Levels of two of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex proteins (gi|641863965 and gi|641864450) were reduced, and levels of two other components of the same complex, dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (gi|568823164) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (gi|641853224), were downregulated in symptomatic fruit (Table  1). Changes in sugar, organic acid, and amino-acid metabolism The standard products for 8 distinctive sugars, 5 organic acids, and 12 amino acids were run (Table  4). Some tetramethyl silane (TMS) derivatives of the non-volatile products could not be detected using GC-MS, including mannose, rhamnose, sorbitol, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, arginine, cysteine, glutamine, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, tyrosine, and cystine. Sucrose, fructose, and glucose were the main distinctive sugars in the Valencia pulp, and their concentration was decreased 26%, 15%, and 20%, respectively, in symptomatic sweet orange fruit compared with the healthy control. Although some low-content monosaccharides such as arabinose (18.88%), mannitol (38.07%), and ribose (28.79%), were increased, the main organic acids, citric acid and malic acid, decreased 6.50% and 9.20%, respectively, compared with the healthy control. The low-content organic acids, fumaric acid, quinic acid, and succinic acid, increased 48.06%, 20.03%, and 54.82%, respectively, compared with the healthy control. The levels of two acidic amino acids, aspartic acid (3.23%) and glutamic acid (13.71%), were decreased in symptomatic fruit. The following neutral amino acids were more highly accumulated in symptomatic fruit: alanine (10.00%), asparagine (128.12%), glycine (31.58%), leucine (73.66%), phenylalanine (79.44%), proline (20.57%), serine (74.14%), threonine (217.79%), tryptophan (61.83%), and valine (20.39%). Low levels of terpenoids and proteins involved in terpenoid metabolism According to MS peak identification and standard confirmation, six monoterpenoids and one sesquiterpenoid (valencene) were identified in the Valencia pulp. All levels were lower in the symptomatic fruits than those in the healthy fruits: α-pinene (77.33%), 3-carene (87.20%), myrcene (85.53%), limonene (82.29%), linalool (77.57%), α-terpineol (72.16%), and ( + )-valencene (78.66%) (Table  5). All isoprenoids are synthesised from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the two building blocks, which are produced by the mevalonic acid (MVA) and 2-C-methyl- d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathways. 2-C-methyl- d-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (IspD) catalyses MEP to form 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl- d-erythritol (CDP-ME) and is the third enzyme of the MEP pathway. Hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (IspG) catalyses 2-C-methyl- d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) to form 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate (HMBPP). That is the penultimate catalysing step of the biosynthesis of IPP and DMAPP through the MEP pathway. The enzyme ispD and ispG (gi|568833221 and gi|568869804) were all downregulated in symptomatic fruit. The levels of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (gi|641840281), which catalyses the rate-limiting step in geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) biosynthesis, was also reduced in symptomatic fruit (Fig.  5).","Orange fruit from trees infected by ' Candidatus  Liberibacter asiaticus' ( Ca Las) often do not look fully mature and exhibit off-flavours described as bitter, harsh, and metallic rather than juicy and fruity. Although previous studies have been carried out to understand the effect of  Ca Las on the flavour of orange juice using metabolomic methods, the mechanisms leading to the off-flavour that occurs in Huanglongbing (HLB)-symptomatic fruit are not well understood. In this study, fruits were collected from symptomatic and healthy Valencia sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis ) trees grafted on Swingle ( C. paradisi  X  Poncirus trifoliata ) rootstock. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to measure the proteins, sugars, organic acids, amino acids, and volatile terpenoids. The results showed that most of the differentially expressed proteins involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and amino-acid biosynthesis were degraded, and terpenoid metabolism was significantly downregulated in the symptomatic fruit. Valencene, limonene, 3-carene, linalool, myrcene, and α-terpineol levels were significantly lower in fruit from  Ca Las-infected trees than from healthy trees. Similar phenomena were observed for sucrose and glucose. Our study indicated that off-flavour of symptomatic fruit was associated with a reduction in the levels of terpenoid products and the downregulation of proteins in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway.",NaN,"['fruit', 'Table', 'symptomatic fruit', 'Fig.', 'family', 'downregulated proteins', 'proteins involved', 'downregulated', 'Healthy', 'acid']","[≤ , −1, −1, pectin, 12 oxidoreductases, 7 isomerases, isomerase, pectin, pectin methylesterase, gi|641854939, UDP- d-glucose 4-epimerase, gi|568845013, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, sucrose synthase, Fructokinase, gi|568849997, gi|641841250, fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, gi|641866581, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, gi|641838381, UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase, gi|568837718, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, lignin (, gi|568856679, gi|568864726, gi|568870518, phosphoglycerate kinases, gi|568881904, gi|568881906, isocitrate dehydrogenases, gi|568855816, gi|641849423, malate dehydrogenases, gi|641829225, gi|641838649, fumarate hydratase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, gi|572152874, gi|641851263, carboxykinase (, gi|568836722, malic enzyme, gi|641867382, pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, gi|641863965, gi|641864450, dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase, gi|568823164, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, gi|641853224, aspartic acid, 217.79, α-terpineol, dimethylallyl diphosphate, 2-C-methyl- d-erythritol-4-phosphate, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl- d-erythritol, Hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase, DMAPP, gi|568833221, gi|568869804, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, gi|641840281, farnesyl pyrophosphate]",[],[],[],NaN
82,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6417135\eupmc_result.json,PMC6417135,"Results Relationship between valencene production and  Cstps1 gene expression Valencene and other sesquiterpenes were measured in mature fruit of Fortune and Murcott mandarins, as well as nine of their F1 progenies randomly selected from the previous mapping population. As shown in Table  1, FoMu097 and FoMu114 produced large amounts of valencene and other sesquiterpenes. Fortune, FoMu003 and FoMu007 produced relatively lower levels of valencene and sesquiterpenes, whereas, Murcott, FoMu001, FoMu005 and FoMu012 did not produce detectable levels of valencene or other sesquiterpenes. FoMu004 also did not produce valencene, but had very low levels of sesquiterpenes, equaling to 3.65% of the total amount of sesquiterpenes in Fortune. The production of valencene was detected in FoMu083 but severely reduced, which accounted for only 5.87% of the total sesquiterpenes, far less than 50–80% of the total sesquiterpenes observed in other genotypes with detectable valencene. In our previous study, we found that the gene expression of  Cstps1 in mature fruit was over 2720 times higher in mandarin hybrid Temple than in Murcott [ 9]. Murcott mandarin  Cstps1 gene expression is severely reduced. Phenotypic segregation was determined from 92 individuals and was 45:47 (non-detected: valencene), not significantly different from a 1:1 ratio (χ2 = 0.134) (Additional file  1: Table S1). To determine if  Cstps1 is the gene underlying the quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling valencene content, we analyzed the expression level of  Cstps1 in peel of ripe fruits to determine valencene content from nine selected progenies, as well as the two parents (Fig.  2). This analysis showed high levels of  Cstps1 expression in Fortune and the four selected progenies with abundant valencene, but no detectable expression in Murcott and the four selected progenies without valencene, as well as FoMu083 with very low level of valencene. The presence or absence of  Cstps1 gene expression is mostly consistent with the presence or and absence of valencene, although there is no clear relationship between  Cstps1 gene expression levels and amounts of valencene produced. Isolation and comparison of  Cstps1 and the promoter regions in fortune and Murcott QTL analysis identified one dominant locus associated with valencene abundance, which had a LOD value of 17.2 and explained the phenotypic variance as high as 59.8% [ 10]. The identified QTL was linked to two adjacent marker m66_s3 (21.0 cM) and m261_s3 (25.9 cM) on Fortune genetic linkage group 3 (Additional file  2: Table S2), and the two markers were both located on Scaffold_3 of Clementine mandarin genome. The valencene synthase gene  Cstps1, previously isolated and characterized in Valencia sweet orange, was also located on scaffold_3 of Clementine mandarin genome. Based on  Cstps1 sequence information, cDNA and the genomic DNA region of  Cstps1 gene were isolated from Fortune and Murcott fruit. They both contain a 1647 bp open reading frame, encoding 548 amino acids. Multiple alignment analysis of the deduced protein sequence from  Cstps1 gene (Fig.  3) indicated that Fortune showed an almost identical protein sequence to the known valencene synthase protein in Valencia orange (99.5%), whereas Murcott exhibited a 96.7% identity. No clear differences were found in estimated Cstps1 protein structure between Fortune and Murcott using a protein program ( http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/). By analyzing the active sites and binding sites on the protein of Cstps1 among Murcott, Fortune and Valencia, we found that except for only one active site (8–15 aa), all others are highly conserved among three varieties (Additional file  3: Figure S1). Due to severely reduced  Cstps1 gene expression associated with undetectable valencene production, we investigated whether changes in the  Cstps1 promoter region could cause the presence or absence of  Cstps1 expression. We further cloned the promoter region of  Cstps1 gene based on genome walking. A total length of 969 bp nucleotides upstream of the  Cstps1 gene was cloned from Fortune, while 957 bp nucleotides were cloned from Murcott. Alignment analysis of the promoter sequence between Fortune and Murcott indicated extremely high identity to each other, except for a deletion of 12 nucleotides in Murcott located − 270 bp upstream of  Cstps1 gene. The nucleotide sequence of the 12-bp deletion in Murcott could be either of five types due to sequence alignment: 5′-AAAAAGAAAAAG-3′, 5′-AAAAGAAAAAGA-3′, 5′-AAAGAAAAAGAA-3′, 5′-AAGAAAAAGAAA-3′, 5′-AGAAAAAGAAAA-3′, or 5′-GAAAAAGAAAAA-3′ (Fig.  4). The presence or absence of the 12 nucleotides in Fortune, Murcott and randomly selected progenies was further confirmed by PCR with specific primers (Fig.  5). As shown, the presence or absence of these 12 nucleotides in the  Cstps1 promoter among these materials was consistent with the presence or absence of the  Cstps1 gene expression. Functional analysis of  Cstps1 promoter in sweet orange leaves We hypothesized that the 12-nucleotide deletion in the promoter region of the Murcott  Cstps1 gene might be the reason for severely reduced  Cstps1 gene expression and the resulting lost production of valencene synthase in Murcott. To test the hypothesis,  Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc)-facilitated agroinfiltration was used to study  Cstps1 promoter function by a GUS transient expression assay using binary vectors p1380-FortP-GUSin, p1380-MurcP-GUSin and and p1380-MurcP(+ 12)-GUSin (Fig.  6a). The negative control was p1380-AtHSP70BP-GUSin. After Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration, GUS was detected by histochemical staining (Fig.  6b). Our previous study indicated that Xcc-facilitated agroinfiltration enhances gene expression in citrus leaves using binary vector p1380-35S-GFP and p1380-35S-GUSin [ 11]. Notably, the Fortune  Cstps1 promoter (969 bp) showed significant GUS expression, but the Murcott  Cstps1 promoter (957 bp) did not. However, the function of the Murcott derived promoter could be mostly recovered by re-inserting the 12-bp deletion (p1380-MurcP(+ 12)-GUSin). (Fig.  6b). These results indicate that the deletion of the 12 nucleotides, to a large extent, caused absence of  Cstps1 gene expression."," Background Valencene is a major sesquiterpene in citrus oil and biosynthesized by valencene synthase (Cstps1; EC: 4.2.3.73) from the 15-carbon substrate farnesyl diphosphate. It is abundant in juice of some mandarins (e.g. Citrus reticulata Blanco cv. Fortune), however, it is undetectable in others (e.g. C. reticulata Blanco cv. Murcott), We have discovered that the Murcott mandarin Cstps1 gene expression is severely reduced. A previous genetic mapping study using an F1 population of Fortune × Murcott found that the segregation of valencene production in fruit exhibited a Mendelian inheritance ratio of 1:1. There was only one dominant locus associated with valencene content detected on the mandarin genetic map. The goal of this study was to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the valencene deficiency observed in some citrus hybrids. Results There was a clear relationship between presence or absence of the valencene synthase gene (Cstps1) expression, and presence or absence of valencene among randomly selected mandarin hybrids. Cloning the coding regions of Cstps1 from Fortune and Murcott mandarin, and aligning with previous reported Valencia orange Cstps1 sequence, showed that they both exhibited extremely high similarity with the known Cstps1. By further cloning and analyzing the promoter region of Cstps1 from Valencia, Fortune and Murcott, a 12-nucleotide deletion at approximately - 270 bp from the Cstps1 coding region was only found in Murcott. Three binary vectors, designated as p1380-FortP-GUSin, p1380-MurcP-GUSin and p1380-MurcP(+ 12)-GUSin, were developed for promoter activity analysis. Transient over-expression of Fortune Cstps1 promoter in sweet orange showed notable GUS activity, but the Murcott Cstps1 promoter did not. In addition, by re-inserting the 12-nucleotide fragment, the activity of the Murcott Cstps1 promoter was mostly recovered. Conclusion The deficiency of valencene production in some mandarins is probably due to a 12-nucleotide deletion in the promoter region of the Cstps1, which could be a crucial switch of Cstps1 transcription. Our results further enhanced the understanding of valencene biosynthesis in citrus.","['Sesquiterpene', 'Citrus', 'Cloning', 'Transient expression', 'cDNA sequencing', 'QTL mapping']","['Murcott', 'Fortune', 'valencene', 'gene expression', 'gene', 'expression', 'Fig.', 'sesquiterpenes', 'promoter', 'Murcott QTL']","[FoMu097, FoMu007, FoMu001, FoMu004, FoMu083, FoMu083, m261_s3 (25.9 , Scaffold_3, Cstps1, Fortune, http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/, Cstps1, Valencia, 8–15, Fortune, − 270 , 5′-AAAAAGAAAAAG-3′, 5′-AAAAGAAAAAGA-3′, 5′-AAAGAAAAAGAA-3′, 5′-AAGAAAAAGAAA-3′, 5′-AGAAAAAGAAAA-3′, 5′-GAAAAAGAAAAA-3′, (Xcc)-facilitated, GUS, p1380-FortP-GUSin, p1380-MurcP-GUSin, p1380-MurcP(+ 12)-GUSin, p1380-AtHSP70BP-GUSin, Xcc-facilitated, GUS, Xcc-facilitated, p1380-35S-GFP, p1380-35S-GUSin, GUS, p1380-MurcP(+ 12)-GUSin]",[],[],[],NaN
83,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6421710\eupmc_result.json,PMC6421710,"Results The monoterpene synthases (MTS) selected for this study are listed in Table  1. Codon optimized MTS genes were cloned into a binary vector designed for  Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation (ATMT) where expression is driven by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter ( pGAPDH). An example of the vector harboring the  Hypoxylon sp.  E74060B Hyp3 1,8-cineole MTS gene is shown in Fig.  2a. These constructs can be used to randomly integrate transgenes into the genome of  R. toruloides IFO0880 by ATMT or electroporation depending on how they are prepared, which adds flexibility to the engineering strategies. Sixteen constructs harboring MTS genes for the production of nine different monoterpenes were transformed into  R. toruloides by either ATMT or electroporation and at least twenty individual transformants from either transformation approach were analyzed for production of target monoterpenes by GC–MS. The relative efficiency of these two transformation methods was compared using the 1,8-cineole MTS and is described in detail below.  Two different analytical approaches were used to maximize the chances of detecting monoterpene product: (i) the use of an organic dodecane overlay to extract monoterpenes from liquid cultures and (ii) Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) of monoterpenes from the headspaces of solid medium cultures (Table  1). The first approach has a monoterpene detection sensitivity of greater than 1 mg/L, while the SPME analysis is more sensitive and can detect trace levels of monoterpenes. The production and analysis of each monoterpene is described in detail in the following sections. Comparison of electroporation and ATMT transformation methods using the 1,8-cineole MTS Two types of transformation methods have been established in  R. toruloides, electroporation and ATMT, each using a fundamentally different method for introducing recombinant DNA into the cell. The  Hypoxylon fungal 1,8-cineole  Hyp3 MTS gene (described in more detail in the next section) was transformed using both methods in order to select the most reliable method for subsequent transformations. Since both transformation methods established in  R. toruloides randomly integrate variable copies of heterologous DNA into the genome via NHEJ, a number of transformants must be screened in order to identify the integrant with the optimal copy number and integration site to produce the maximum detectable amount of the target monoterpene. To compare the two transformation methods, 1,8-cineole titers were determined for 40 and 50 independent transformants from ATMT and electroporation, respectively. It was found that all of the ATMT transformants and 70% of electroporation transformants produced 1,8-cineole in dodecane overlaid liquid cultures (Fig.  2b). Despite the difference in the number of productive transformants, both methods generated transformants that produced the same maximum titer of 1,8-cineole (see below). These results suggest that fewer transformants need to be screened using the ATMT method to identify highly productive strains, so ATMT method was employed to transform the remaining MTS constructs. Monoterpene production in  R. toruloides The  Hypoxylon fungal 1,8-cineole synthase  Hyp3 is the first identified fungal monoterpene synthase that has the conserved critical asparagine residues commonly found in plant synthase [ 58]. Overexpression of  HYP3 in  R. toruloides yielded many transformants that produced 1,8-cineole in dodecane overlay cultures. The highest cineole titer obtained by electroporation was 15.45 mg/L, and 15.81 mg/L by ATMT (Fig.  2b). A single major product was detected at a retention time (RT) of 6.42 min with a MS spectrum that is identical to an authentic 1,8-cineol standard, indicating that 1,8-cineole is the sole product of this MTS (Fig.  2c). Shaw et al. illustrated that  Hyp3 produced minor amounts of  d-limonene (about 5% of the total product) in  E. coli, but only 1,8-cineole was detected in  R. toruloides. A second 1,8-cineole synthase encoded by the  Streptomyces clavuligerus gene  SSCG_00536 CnsA was also screened.  CnsA is the first identified bacterial monoterpene cyclase that catalyzes the direct conversion of GPP into 1,8-cineole [ 59]. When the  CnsA gene was expressed in  R. toruloides, only trace amounts of 1,8-cineole were detected in the dodecane overlay of a liquid culture. By SPME analysis, a major 1,8-cineole product with RT of 6.38 min was detected (Fig.  2d). A truncated Snapdragon  Antirrhinum majus (E)-β-Ocimene Synthase ( ama0a23) was expressed in  R. toruloides, producing (E)-β-ocimene as a major product, and (Z)-β-ocimene and myrcene as minor products, detected by SPME (Fig.  3a). These results are consistent with a study in which the cell free extracted MTS protein produced by  E. coli was incubated with GPP and formed (E)-β-ocimene (97%), (Z)-β-ocimene (2%), and myrcene (1%) [ 60]. The  Licea cubeba ocimene synthase  LcTPS was also overexpressed in  R. toruloides, but no product could be detected by either dodecane overlay or SPME analysis.  The grand fir ( Abies grandis) (4S)-Limonene synthase  Ag10 was overexpressed in  R. toruloides and SPME analysis detected a major peak of limonene and minor peaks of α-pinene and β-pinene (Fig.  2b). Two additional compounds with mass fragmentation patterns indicative of monoterpenes were detected, but their identities could not be clearly determined due to a lack of authentic standards. Bohlmann et al. functionally characterized  Ag10 and also detected limonene, α-pinene, and β-pinene, as well as β-phellandrene [ 61]. The mass spectrum of one of the unidentified products in  R. toruloides was examined with the Wiley MS database library probability-based matching algorithm, and the results suggest that it is likely β-phellandrene. No match could be found for the second unidentified compound found. Two pinene synthases,  Pinus taeda PT30 and  Abies grandis AG3.18, were expressed in  R. toruloides and examined by SPME as shown in Fig.  3c and d, respectively. A single compound, α-pinene, was produced by  R. toruloides transformants expressing  PT30 gene, while both α-pinene and β-pinene were produced by transformants expressing the  AG3.18 gene. These results are consistent with previous characterizations of cell-free extracts of these enzymes expressed in  E. coli supplied with GPP as substrate [ 61,  62]. Two sabinene synthases,  Citrus jambhiri RlemTPS2 and  Salvia pomifera Sabs1, were expressed in  R. toruloides. No detectable sabinene was produced by strains expressing  RlemTPS2, while SPME analysis of the  Sabs1 strains detected sabinene and several other minor products (Fig.  3e). The three minor peaks could not be identified but produced mass fragmentation patterns indicative of monoterpenes (Fig.  3e). In a previous study of the  Sabs1 recombinant protein using GPP as substrate, several olefin monoterpenes were identified, including sabinene (63%), γ-terpinene (21%), terpinolene (7.0%), and limonene (6.5%) [ 63]. In contrast, Kampranis et al. reported that  Sabs1 produced sabinene and myrcene [ 64], indicating that this enzyme can produce different products depending on the experimental conditions, making it difficult to speculate on the identity of other monoterpenes produced in  R. toruloides along with sabinene. Two carene synthases,  Picea abies PaJF67 and  Salvia stenophylla TpsB, were expressed in  R. toruloides and only transformants expressing  TpsB produced monoterpenes (Fig.  3f). A major peak of 3-carene was detected and verified with an authentic standard, while minor amounts of mycene, 4-carene, and limonene were also produced. Three additional compounds with monoterpene mass fragmentation patterns were also detected but could not be identified. And examination of the mass spectrum using the Wiley MS database library probability-based matching algorithm suggests that one of these unidentified peaks may be β-phellandrene, which agrees with a previous study of characterization of this enzyme. In that study, cell free enzyme assay of recombinant  TpsB expressed in  E. coli revealed that this enzyme can convert GPP to (+)-3-carene (73%), (−)-limonene (13%), myrcene (6%), 4-carene (4%), and β-phellandrene (1%) [ 65]. Measuring the GPP and FPP pools in  R. toruloides by over-expression of the FaNES1 gene The expression of 16 MTS genes that are able to produce 9 different major monoterpenes in  R. toruloides revealed that most of the MTS enzymes did not produce significant amounts of product. Only the  Hypoxylon Hyp3 enzyme could drive the production of appreciable amounts of 1,8-cineole, and even then, only in mg/L quantities. These results suggest that, like  S. cerevisiae, the GPP pool in  R. toruloides may have been limiting monoterpene production. In  S. cerevisiae GPP is converted directly to FPP by  ERG20. To assess whether this phenomenon also occurs in  R. toruloides, the ratio of these two metabolites was determined. A low GPP/FPP ratio would indicate that GPP is limiting. A bifunctional linalool (monoterpene/GPP) and nerolidol (sesquiterpene/FPP) synthase  FaNES1 from strawberry was expressed and the ratio of these GPP/FPP-derived products was determined. A total of 20 independent transformants were examined, and while nerolidol was detected in several of them (up to 24 mg/L), no linalool was detected (Fig.  4). This observation is consistent with what was found in  S. cerevisiae and suggests that the low level of GPP in  R. toruloides is limiting monoterpene production and further engineering of the MEV pathway would be required to elevate monoterpene titers beyond what was observed in this study [ 40].  Conversion of lignocellulose hydrolysate to 1,8-cineole To evaluate the ability of  R. toruloides to convert lignocellulose into monoterpenes, the strain producing the highest levels of 1,8-cineole in rich media (15.81 mg/L) was cultivated in the corn stover DMR-EH (Deacetylated, Mechanically Refined, Enzymatically Hydrolyzed) hydrolysate supplemented with synthetic defined medium (SD). The hydrolysate was diluted with water to different percent volumes to determine the optimal hydrolysate concentration for 1.8-cineole production. The highest 1,8-cineole titer of 27.64 mg/L was achieved in 75% (v/v) DMR-EH hydrolysate (Fig.  5a, b). Overall, the production of 1,8-cineole in hydrolysate medium was higher than in mock medium containing equivalent amounts of sugars or in YPD medium. The 1,8-cineole production titer in 90% (v/v) DMR (21 mg/L) was found to be lower than in 75% (v/v) DMR (Fig.  5a–c), indicating possible mild growth inhibition or nutrient limitation.  R. toruloides grew slower in 90% hydrolysate than in the 75% (v/v) hydrolysate, with a final OD 600 of 11.9 and 13.3, respectively (Fig.  5b, c). 1,8-cineole production was also tested in 75% (v/v) DMR hydrolysate supplied with different nitrogen sources, using either 10 g/L yeast extract (YE) or SD with additional 2 g/L ammonium sulfate. Although  R. toruloides grew faster initially in both media compared with the original hydrolysate, it eventually reached a similar OD 600 in each medium (Fig.  5b–e). Finally, production of 1,8-cineole from lignocellulose was demonstrated in a 2L batch fermenter with 75% (v/v) DMR-EH hydrolysate or a mock hydrolysate containing 10 g/L YE. Both glucose and xylose consumption was observed in the cultivation, and 1,8-cineole titers reached 34.6 mg/L in DMR-EH hydrolysate and 47.3 mg/L in mock hydrolysate (Fig.  6).  Fuel properties of 1,8-cineole Previous research suggests that 1,8-cineole is potentially a good CI and SI fuel [ 12– 16]. To explore the SI fuel properties of this compound in more detail, two important metrics relevant to SI fuels, research octane number (RON) and motor octane number (MON) were measured. Comparisons of these and other relevant fuel properties between 1,8-cineole and the well-known SI fuel additive ethanol, are shown in Table  2. While ethanol has a higher RON (109) and Sensitivity (19) relative to 1,8-cineole (99, 8), its high oxygen content, low energy density, and hygroscopic nature are less ideal for drop-in fuels. The fact that 1,8-cineole has low water solubility (3.5 g/L), high energy density (33.5 MJ/L), and RON/MON/Sensitivity values within the range of modern gasolines suggests that it is a good potential drop-in SI fuel. With an AKI defined as (RON + MON)/2 of ~ 95, pure 1,8-cineole would qualify as a “premium” fuel under the current gasoline standards. "," Background Due to their high energy density and compatible physical properties, several monoterpenes have been investigated as potential renewable transportation fuels, either as blendstocks with petroleum or as drop-in replacements for use in vehicles (both heavy and light-weight) or in aviation. Sustainable microbial production of these biofuels requires the ability to utilize cheap and readily available feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass, which can be depolymerized into fermentable carbon sources such as glucose and xylose. However, common microbial production platforms such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not naturally capable of utilizing xylose, hence requiring extensive strain engineering and optimization to efficiently utilize lignocellulosic feedstocks. In contrast, the oleaginous red yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides is capable of efficiently metabolizing both xylose and glucose, suggesting that it may be a suitable host for the production of lignocellulosic bioproducts. In addition, R. toruloides naturally produces several carotenoids (C40 terpenoids), indicating that it may have a naturally high carbon flux through its mevalonate (MVA) pathway, providing pools of intermediates for the production of a wide range of heterologous terpene-based biofuels and bioproducts from lignocellulose. Results Sixteen terpene synthases (TS) originating from plants, bacteria and fungi were evaluated for their ability to produce a total of nine different monoterpenes in R. toruloides. Eight of these TS were functional and produced several different monoterpenes, either as individual compounds or as mixtures, with 1,8-cineole, sabinene, ocimene, pinene, limonene, and carene being produced at the highest levels. The 1,8-cineole synthase HYP3 from Hypoxylon sp. E74060B produced the highest titer of 14.94 ± 1.84 mg/L 1,8-cineole in YPD medium and was selected for further optimization and fuel properties study. Production of 1,8-cineole from lignocellulose was also demonstrated in a 2L batch fermentation, and cineole production titers reached 34.6 mg/L in DMR-EH (Deacetylated, Mechanically Refined, Enzymatically Hydorlized) hydrolysate. Finally, the fuel properties of 1,8-cineole were examined, and indicate that it may be a suitable petroleum blend stock or drop-in replacement fuel for spark ignition engines. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that Rhodosporidium toruloides is a suitable microbial platform for the production of non-native monoterpenes with biofuel applications from lignocellulosic biomass.","['Biofuel', 'Monoterpene', 'Rhodosporidium toruloides', '1,8-Cineole']","['Fig.', 'toruloides', 'MTS', 'GPP', 'ATMT', 'monoterpene', 'MTS genes', 'detected', 'transformants', 'SPME']","[MTS, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pGAPDH, ATMT, MTS, toruloides, ATMT, GC–MS, ATMT, toruloides, ATMT, toruloides, NHEJ, ATMT, toruloides, ATMT, CnsA, toruloides, ama0a23, toruloides, (E)-β-ocimene, MTS, toruloides, toruloides, α-pinene, β-pinene (Fig.  2b, α-pinene, toruloides, toruloides, α-pinene, α-pinene, β-pinene, toruloides, TpsB, toruloides, β-phellandrene (1, toruloides, MTS enzymes, toruloides, toruloides, GPP/FPP, GPP/FPP-derived, toruloides, Deacetylated, toruloides, toruloides, DMR-EH hydrolysate, hydrolysate (, RON, RON, 8), RON , “, ”, gasoline]","['LcTPS', 'RlemTPS2', 'RlemTPS2,']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
84,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6437863\eupmc_result.json,PMC6437863,"Results Differences in content and composition of volatiles among four tissues To understand the distribution pattern and differences in components of  S. album volatiles, we examined the metabolic compounds from pentane extracts of young leaves (YL), sapwood (SW) and HW from mature trees and immature wood (IW) from immature trees by GC-MS. There were significant differences in the volatile content among the four tissues. As shown in Fig.  1, the most abundant volatile was detected in HW (Fig.  1a-d). Major sesquiterpenols, α- and β-santalol, were detected in these four tissues, and sesquiterpenes, α- and β-santalene, and  epi-β-santalene were identified in YL and HW, but not in IW and SW (Fig.  1e-i, Additional file  1: Table S1). It was curious that trace amounts of α- and β-santalene,  epi-β-santalene and α-santalol (peaks 1, 3, 5 and 8, respectively) were found in almost the same proportion in YL (Fig.  1e). Of these, the distribution of the first three compounds matched that in HW (Fig.  1h, peaks 1, 3 and 5). Moreover, ( E)-α-bergamotene, ( E)-β-farnesene, and β-bisabolene were also detected from leaf extracts of  S. album. Almost the same distribution of sesquiterpenols as those in SW and HW was observed in IH (Fig.  1 f, g and i, peaks 8–15), indicating that the accumulation of sandalwood oil occurs at an early developmental stage of the stems and that more essential oil is biosynthesized in HW as the sandalwood tree grows older. Identification of new terpene synthases in  S. album We combined transcriptome sets downloaded from NCBI, including transcripts from leaves, stems and roots as described in the Methods. D e novo assembly yielded 164,548 unigenes from the three tissues (Additional file  1: Figure S1, Additional file  1: Table S2). Many unigenes were identified as  SaTPS genes, including 38 core terpene synthase genes and nine triterpene-specific synthase genes (Additional file  1: Table S3). Of these, six unigene sequences were completely aligned with those of  S. album submitted to NCBI [ 40,  42,  45]. Three unigenes contained full-length ORFs encoding TPSs, designated as  SaTPS1 to  3. In order to confirm that the assembled unigenes generated using the Trinity assembler were accurate, we designed primers to anneal around the predicted start and stop codons of unigenes to amplify ORFs of the three predicted  SaTPS genes (Fig. S2). Subsequent sequencing of these nucleotides demonstrated that they were exactly as predicted by the unigene assembly. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of three SaTPSs Three predicted proteins encoded by  SaTPS1 to  3 with a range of 564 to 604 amino acids had predicted  pIs of 6.01, 5.02 and 5.03, respectively (Additional file  1: Table S4). As shown in Fig.  2, SaTPS1 to 3 contain the arginine-tryptophan motif, R(R) X8W, which is conserved in most mono-TPSs and in some sesqui-TPSs near the N-terminus. The highly conserved aspartate-rich motif (DDXXD) and NSE/DTE motif, which are crucial for chelating divalent cations, typically Mg 2+, in the C-terminal domain [ 49], were present in these three SaTPSs. One of the distinguishing structural features between mono- and sesqui-TPSs is the presence of an N-terminal plastid transit peptide sequence. Using the signal sequence analysis program ChloroP ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP), a putative N-terminal plastid transit peptide (Tp) sequence of 44 amino acids for SaTPS1 was predicted, indicating that it is likely a mono-TPS. However, SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 did not contain a plastid Tp sequence, suggesting that they are sesqui-TPSs (Additional file  1: Table S4). A phylogenetic tree based on the deduced amino acid of sandalwood TPSs and other plant species showed that all  Santalum TPSs clustered in the TPS-b clade, with the exception of SasesquiTPS and sesquiTPSs in  S. spicatum (SspicsesquiTPS) and  S. austrocaledonicum (SaustsesquiTPS) (Fig.  3; Additional file  1: Table S5), among which the majority of angiospermous monoterpene synthases reside [ 15]. The most similar TPS sequence to SaTPS1 is that of (−)-α-terpineol synthase from  V. vinifera with 63% identity (Additional file  1: Figure S3; Additional file  1: Table S6) (Martin and Bohlmann, 2004). SaTPS2 clustered most closely to SaSSY, SspicSSY and SaustSSY, with a 100% bootstrap (Jones et al., 2011), and its amino acid sequence had highest identity with SaspiSSY (72%). SaTPS3 formed a clade with several previously characterized TPSs from  Santalum species, including SaMonoTPS, SaSQS1, SaSQS2, SaBS, SspicBS and Sspicsesquisabinene [ 42,  45,  50]. Bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses suggests that SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 might be involved in the production of essential oil in  S. album. Expression patterns of three  SaTPS genes differ from  SaSSY The tissue-specific expression of  SaTPS1 to  3 genes was determined by qRT-PCR in four key tissues, i.e., YL, IW, SW and HW. The transcript abundance of  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 genes showed a similar expression pattern, with highest expression in YL (Fig.  4).  SaTPS3 showed three-fold higher expression in IW than in YL, SW and HW. In contrast,  SaSSY was 100- and 250-fold higher in SW and HW, respectively. Additionally, comparisons of the expression levels among these  SaTPSs in specific tissues showed that  SaTPS3 showed higher expression than  SaTPS1 and Sa TPS2 in the four corresponding tissues (Additional file  1 :Figure S4). Of note, the level of  SaSSY transcript showed a 200- and 1200-fold increase relative to  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 in SW and HW, respectively. These results suggest that  SaTPS3 might play a role in the accumulation of HW essential oil whereas  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 play a minor role in the formation of terpenoids in  S. album HW. Subcellular localization of SaTPSs To elucidate the function of SaTPS1 to 3, subcellular localization of each SaTPS-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) fusion protein provided preliminary evidence. Phylogenetic and bioinformatics-based analyses in an attempt to classify TPSs indicated that SaTPS1-YFP, which has the N-terminal plastid transit peptide sequence, was localized in chloroplasts, whereas SaTPS2-YFP and SaTPS3-YFP were distributed throughout the cytosol (Fig.  5). Based on the results of subcellular localization, it was concluded that SaTPS1 is likely involved in monoterpene biosynthesis in plastids, whereas SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 might produce sesquiterpenes in the cytosol. Functional characterization of the enzymes encoded by  SaTPS1 to  3 All cDNAs subcloned into pET28a vector with 6His-tagged were successfully expressed in  E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) competent cells and recombinant proteins were then purified with a Ni-NTA agarose affinity column (Additional file  1 :Figure S5). We found that this cDNA without the transit peptide sequence could improve the expression of  SaTPS1 in  E. coli. Following an in vitro enzyme activity assay,  SaTPS1 was confirmed to encode a mono-TPS enzyme that catalyzed the formation of mostly α-terpineol (45.7%), while sabinene (14.9%), linalool (11.7%) and myrcene (10.8%), as well as a few minor monoterpenes, were also produced with GPP as the substrate and Mg 2+, as detected by GC-MS analysis (Fig.  6a, Additional file  1: Table S7). Although the same compounds were produced when Mg 2+ was replaced by Mn 2+, levels of product formation were 5-fold lower and the three major compounds, linalool (35.8%), α-terpineol (25.7%), and geraniol (12.9%) were formed (Additional file  1: Figure S6, Additional file  1: Table S7). No terpene product was observed in the reaction of SaTPS1 with FPP as a substrate and Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ (Fig.  6b). This enzyme was designated as α-terpineol synthase because it is a major monoterpene product and due to its preference for the metal ion, Mg 2+. GC-MS analysis of the reaction products catalyzed by SaTPS2 with FPP as a substrate in the presence of Mg 2+ identified at least 15 sesquiterpenoids, with ( E)-α-bergamotene (24.8%) and sesquisabinene (33.0%) as the two major products, β-bisabolene (9.0%), γ-bisabolene isomer (7.9%), and minor compounds, 7- epi-sesquithujene, ( E)-β-farnesene, α-zingiberene, and others at relative proportions less than 5% (Fig.  7a; Additional file  1: Table S7). A similar product profile comprising the major compounds, ( E)-α-bergamotene (22.4%) and sesquisabinene (35.6%), were detected when Mg 2+ was replaced with Mn 2+, but overall yield was relatively lower (Additional file  1: Figure S7, Additional file  1: Table S7). Incubation of SaTPS2 with GPP as a substrate and Mg 2+ ion led to the production of nine monoterpenes (Fig.  7b; Additional file  1: Table S7). The most abundant compound was linalool (64.9%). Likewise, assays with Mn 2+ instead of Mg 2+ showed that almost the same compounds were observed, but overall yield was 5-fold lower (Additional file  1: Figure S8, Additional file  1: Table S7). Taken together, these results indicate that SaTPS2 is a multifunctional sesqui-TPS producing major ( E)-α-bergamotene and sesquisabinene in the cytosol. SaTPS3 converts FPP and GPP substrates to sesqui- and monoterpene products, respectively. When assayed with FPP and Mg 2+, recombinant SaTPS3 catalyzed the synthesis of seven compounds, including ( E)-β-farnesene (20.7%), ( E)-nerolidol (29.8%) and ( E,E)-farnesol (21.3%) as the three major products, while a high proportion of γ-bisabolene (13.8%) was also produced (Fig.  8a, Additional file  1: Table S7). In the presence of Mn 2+, SaTPS3 recombination enzyme showed no activity, suggesting that SaTPS3 prefers Mg 2+ in the reaction with FPP. Analysis of the reaction products formed after incubation of SaTPS3 with GPP showed that the main product linalool (44.8–53.3%) was formed with Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ in considerable yield (Fig.  8b, Additional file  1: Figure S9, Additional file  1: Table S7). For the three SaTPSs tested in this study, extracts prepared from  E. coli transformed with PET28a lacking a cDNA insert and heat-denatured enzyme preparations served as controls, and no terpene products were observed. In all cases, expressed proteins incubated with GGPP did not produce detectable products. The  Km value of purified SaTPS1 with GPP was 9.08 ± 1.26 μM and the  Kcat/ Km value was 0.0171 (Table  1; Additional file  1 :Figure S10). The SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 enzymes not only accept substrate FPP but also accept the precursor of monoterpenes, GPP, as analyzed above. Enzyme kinetic properties of SaTPS2 showed that catalysis with FPP and GPP resulted in a similar  Km and  Kcat/ Km. The  Km value of the recombination SaTPS3 with FPP was 16.29 ± 1.48 μM, which was slightly higher than with GPP. The  Kcat/ Km with FPP was relatively lower than with GPP, indicating that the efficiency of this sesqui-TPS catalysis is higher when incubated with GPP. Elevated antioxidant enzyme activity under multiple stress treatments The phytohormones JA and SA play crucial roles in regulating the defensive signaling network by elevating the levels of ROS [ 51,  52]. Moreover, the mechanism by which terpenes alleviate abiotic stress suggests a general antioxidant mechanism by which harmful ROS can be quenched by reacting with unsaturated isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes [ 38]. In our study, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a key contributor in the conversion of O − to H 2O 2 in the presence of elevated levels of ROS, increased significantly under all treatments, except for a decrease in leaves exposed to 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity (approx. 250 μmol m − 2 s − 1) (Fig.  9a). Catalase (CAT) plays an important role in the antioxidant system because it enables plants to eliminate H 2O 2 by converting H 2O 2 into O 2 and H 2O (Miller et al., 2008). CAT activity was strongly elevated by these two elicitors. When the three tissues were exposed to temperature and light stresses, CAT activity was upregulated, the only exception being a slight decreased in leaves in response to high light intensity (Fig.  9b). Similarly, peroxidase (POD), which detoxifies H 2O 2 in the chloroplasts and cytosol of plant cells, also constitutes the main H 2O 2-scavenging system in cells [ 53]. POD activity increased in all treatments and roots had two-fold higher POD activity than leaves (Fig.  9c). Conversely, SOD and CAT activities were relatively higher in leaves than in stems and roots, independent of whether they were treated or untreated, suggesting differential endogenous activities of SOD, CAT or POD among different tissues. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) plays a key role in protecting plants against oxidative stress by scavenging H 2O 2 in different cell compartments [ 54]. As shown in Fig.  9d, APX activity increased significantly in most tissues under MeJA, SA, cold, heat and high light intensity treatments. Thus, the increase in SOD, CAT, POD and APX activities indicate that  S. album seedlings respond to external stresses to protect cellular membranes against oxidative stress, suggesting that these enzymes play roles in tolerance to elicitors and environmental stresses in  S. album. In addition, the effect of different adverse stresses on antioxidant enzyme activities will vary among tissues. Activation of  SaTPS1 to  3 gene expression in response to MeJA and SA To explore the responses of the three  SaTPS genes under elicitors as well as temperature and high light intensity treatments, transcript levels for  SaTPS1 to  3 and  SaSSY were determined by qRT-PCR.  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 exhibited similar expression patterns in response to the two elicitors. As shown in Fig.  10a and b, exogenous MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 genes in leaves at 24 h, with more than a 170- and 130-fold increase, respectively, when compared with the controls.  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 transcripts also increased significantly in stems and roots after the application of MeJA.  SaTPS3 expression was activated in leaves, stems and roots with an approximately 5-, 3-, and 4-fold increase, respectively compared to the corresponding controls (Fig.  10c). In contrast,  SaTPS3 was significantly up-regulated in leaves by SA, but decreased in stems and roots. Moreover, the accumulation of  SaSSY transcript were similar to that of  SaTPS3 in leaves under MeJA and SA treatments. However, the two exogenous hormones led to a decrease in  SaSSY expression in roots compared with the control (Fig.  10d). Adverse temperature and high light induced differential accumulation of  SaTPS1,  SaTPS2 and  SaTPS3 SaTPS1 to  3 expression levels were inhibited in leaves at 4°C and 38°C, but were significantly activated in roots when compared to the controls (Fig.  10e-g), suggesting that oxidative damage in leaves was more severe than in stems and roots. When exposed to high light intensity,  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 transcripts showed higher expression in stems and roots than in leaves, particularly  SaTPS1, with a 25-fold increase in stems. The level of  SaTPS3 transcripts was highest in roots under 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity stresses, with approximately 2-, 6-, and 8-fold increases, respectively, compared to the control. Conversely,  SaSSY transcript only increased by about 2-fold in roots at 4°C compared to the control. In all other cases, the expression level of  SaSSY was down-regulated to some extent in all tissues examined (Fig.  10h)."," Background It is well known that aromatic essential oils extracted from the heartwood of Santalum album L. have wide economic value. However, little is known about the role of terpenoids in response to various adverse environmental stresses as other plants do in the form of signals during plant-environment interactions. Results In this study, trace amounts of volatiles consisting of α-santalene, epi-β-santalene, β-santalene, α-santalol, β-santalol, (E)-α-bergamotene, (E)-β-farnesene and β-bisabolene were found in the leaves of mature S. album trees. We identified more than 40 candidate terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes by mining publicly-available RNA-seq data and characterized the enzymes encoded by three cDNAs: one mono-TPS catalyzes the formation of mostly α-terpineol, and two multifunctional sesqui-TPSs, one of which produces (E)-α-bergamotene and sesquisabinene as major products and another which catalyzes the formation of (E)-β-farnesene, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol as main products. Metabolite signatures and gene expression studies confirmed that santalol content is closely related with santalene synthase (SaSSY) transcripts in heartwood, which is key enzyme responsible for santalol biosynthesis. However, the expression of three new SaTPS genes differed significantly from SaSSY in the essential oil-producing heartwood. Increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, were detected in different tissues of S. album plants after applying 1 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 1 mM salicylic acid (SA), or exposure to 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity. MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of SaTPS1 and SaTPS2 in leaves. SaTPS1 to 3 transcripts were differentially activated among different tissues under adverse temperature and light stresses. In contrast, almost all SaSSY transcripts decreased in response to these environmental stresses, unlike SaTPS1 to 3. Conclusions Multifunctional enzymes were biochemically characterized, including one chloroplastic mono-TPS and two cytosolic sesqui-TPSs in sandalwood.

Anthocyanin Level in the Different Tepal Development Stages of Lycoris longituba In the small bud stage, the red color of  L. longituba ‘Pink’ tepal was very deep, and then the color intensity was significantly decreased with the rapid elongation of tepals, as shown in  Figure 1a. In contrast, the tepal color of  L. longituba ‘White’ was always white, as shown in  Figure 1a. As shown in  Figure 1b, the anthocyanin content in  L. longituba ‘Pink’ was dramatically reduced from S1-P to S3-P, and nearly no anthocyanin was detected in S3-W, as shown in  Figure 1b. These results suggested that content changes of anthocyanin could be the main reason that led to the tepals’ red color fading of  L. longituba ‘Pink’. 2.2. Transcriptome Sequencing and de Novo Assembly Twelve total RNA samples were isolated from different  L. longituba tepal developmental stages S1-P, S2-P, S3-P, and S3-W. These RNA samples were at concentrations of about 200–500 ng/μL with OD260/280 ≥ 1.9 and the RNA Integrity Numbers (RINs) of 8.6–10.0 were used for cDNA library construction. The Illumina HiSeqTM 4000 platform was used to obtain the dataset of 12 cDNA libraries. About 663.25 million raw sequencing reads with a length of 150 bp were generated, and after discarding the low-quality reads, we obtained about 85.23% (565.28 million) clean reads. For all 12 samples, the quality score above 20 (Q20) was ~98.20% and the GC percentages were 45.55–46.88%. Using Trinity software, the de novo assembly totally generated 144,922 unigenes, of average length 941 bp, from the twelve tepal transcriptomes, as shown in  Table 1. In this research, the N50 was determined to be 1527 bp, which indicated that the quality of sequence assembly was good. All raw high throughput sequence data have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Reads Archive (SRA) with the accession number PRJNA490415. 2.3. Functional Classification of Genes during Tepal Development Stages The assembled unigenes were annotated using blastx against NCBI nonredundant protein (Nr), Swiss-Prot, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) protein sequence databases with an E-value ≤10 −5. A total of 85,563 (59.04%) unigenes could be annotated while other unigenes had no significant BLAST hit, as shown in  Table 2, indicating that numerous new genes specific to  L. longituba are still functionally unknown and need to be further studied in the future. Remarkably, the plant species with the top three numbers of blastx hits were  Elaeis guineensis (23,200 transcripts; 29.62%),  Phoenix dactylifera (19,045 transcripts; 24.31%), and  Musa acuminata (6512 transcripts; 8.31%), as shown in  Table S1. These results implied that the assembled  L. longituba transcripts shared similarity with transcripts from several monocotyledons and were reliable. Based on sequence homology, gene ontology (GO) assignment analysis was performed. Of the 85,563 annotated unigenes, 44,813 (52.37%) sequences were assigned into three main categories (biological process, cellular components, and molecular function), which could be further distributed under 58 GO terms, as shown in  Figure S1. Metabolic process, cell, and catalytic activity were the most highly enriched GO terms in biological process, cellular components, and molecular function categories, respectively. 2.4. Identify Differentially Expressed Unigenes between Tepal Transcriptomes To identify differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) during tepal color fading, the unigenes that were differentially expressed between developmental stages and opening tepals with different colors were compared and shown in  Figure 2. Among the four comparisons, the smallest number of DEGs was between the S1-P and S2-P libraries (4674), of which 2330 were up-regulated and 2344 were down-regulated, and the largest number of DEGs was between the S3-P and S3-W libraries (9958), with 5786 up-regulated and 5463 down-regulated unigenes. As the tepals faded from S2-P to S3-P, 8110 unigenes were differentially expressed, with 3526 up-regulated and 4584 down-regulated unigenes. In the S1-P vs. S3-P comparison, 11,024 DEGs were detected, including 5335 up-regulated and 5689 down-regulated unigenes. The comparison between S1-P and the other tepal developmental stages (S2-P and S3-P) showed that the number of up and down-regulated unigenes were both significantly increased as the tepals developed. 2.5. KEGG Pathway Enrichment According to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis ( p-value < 0.05), the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (96 DEGs, ko00940), flavonoid biosynthesis (58 DEGs, ko00941), flavone and flavonol biosynthesis (23 DEGs, ko00944), and anthocyanin biosynthesis (4 DEG, ko00942) pathways which related to color formation were significantly different as compared to S3-P and S3-W. Interestingly, except for the anthocyanin biosynthesis and flavonol biosynthesis pathways, the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were also identified in the S1-P vs. S2-P, S2-P vs. S3-P, and S1-P vs. S3-P comparisons. These results suggested that the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways could play critical roles during red color fading and aroma formation. The statistically enriched pathways between each two transcriptomes are shown in  Figure S2. 2.6. Validation of the Gene Expression Profiles by qRT-PCR To validate the transcription profile revealed by RNA-Seq data, the expression levels of 21 genes from the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were also assessed using qRT-PCR, as shown in  Figure 3a. Linear regression analysis was used to obtain the overall correlation coefficient between RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR data, which showed a good correlation ( R = 0.89) between these two data, as shown in  Figure 3b, indicating that the 12 transcriptomics data were reliable. 2.7. Metabolome Analysis of Lycoris longituba Tepal Development Stages by GC-MS To investigate the volatile metabolic components changes of  L.longituba tepals in the opening processes, we obtained the GC-MS total ion current (TIC) chromatograms for nine  L. longituba tepal samples from three typical developmental stages (S1-P, S2-P, and S3-P), as shown in  Figure 1a. The obvious differences of chromatographic peaks were observed between sample groups, and the retention times were fairly consistent and reproducible, as shown in  Figure 4a. In this study, a total of 29 metabolites were identified in our sample libraries across all samples, as shown in  Table 3. To assess the volatile components profile changes during  L. longituba tepal development, the orthogonal partial least-squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) plot was generated from the GC-MS metabolite data of S1-P, S2-P, and S3-P tepals and showed clear metabolic differences between two stages. Remarkably, S1-P, S2-P, and S3-P tepals could be completely separated sufficiently by use of two principal components. The first principle component (PC1, accounting for 49.89%) and the second component (PC2, accounting for 32.96%) of the variation in the data could separate all three types of tepals with no outliers, as shown in  Figure 4b. The contribution of each variable to PC1 and PC2 was also calculated by giving each variable a weight value. The top two core differential metabolites of PC1 and PC2 discrimination were caryophyllene and  trans-β-ocimene, as shown in  Figure 4c. Interestingly, the  trans-β-ocimene, which had a high content in S3-P, was not detected in S1-P and S2-P, as shown in  Table 3. 2.8. Analysis of Candidate Genes Related to Color and Fragrance Metabolics To explore the genetic regulation of  L. longituba tepal color fading and aroma emission, the genes which have been reported to be involved in these two metabolic pathways were selected. With the development of tepals, several anthocyanin biosynthesis structural genes had the lowest expression levels in S3-P, such as the DFRs, CHIs, CHS2, F3’H1, and FLSs, as shown in  Figure 3a. Especially, the DFR-annotated unigenes ( DFR2-1 and  DFR2-2) which had more than a 7-fold down-regulated expression level in S1-P vs. S3-P, as shown in  Figure 3a. Five  TPS genes were also identified from the DEGs, and interestingly three ( Unigene81776,  CL6106.Contig2, and  Unigene3859) of them were predominantly expressed in S3-P, as shown in  Figure 5c. The spatial and temporal expression of pigment structural and aroma genes were usually controlled by transcription factors from MYB and bHLH [ 14, 25]. In this study, 35 MYBs and 29 bHLHs with fragments per kilobase per million fragments (FPKM) ≥ 5 were identified from DEGs, as shown in  Figure 5a,b. Among them, six MYBs and four bHLHs (in black frames) had the similar down-regulated expression trends with  DFR2-1 and  DFR2-2, and four MYBs and one bHLH (in red frames) had the similar up-regulated expression patterns with the above three  TPSs, as shown in  Figure 5.","Lycoris longituba, belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family, is a perennial bulb bearing flowers with diverse colors and fragrance. Selection of cultivars with excellent colored and scented flowers has always been the breeding aim for ornamental plants. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying color fading and aroma production during flower expansion in L. longituba remain unclear. Therefore, to systematically investigate these important biological phenomena, the tepals of L. longituba from different developmental stages were used to screen and analyze the metabolic components and relevant genes. Utilizing the Illumina platform, a total of 144,922 unigenes were obtained from the RNA-Seq libraries. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicated that the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways might play important roles during color and aroma changes. Metabolomic analysis identified 29 volatile organic components (VOCs) from different developmental stages of L. longituba tepals, and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed that trans-β-ocimene-a terpene-was the most important aroma compound. Meanwhile, we found the content of anthocyanin was significantly reduced during the tepal color fading process. Then, we identified two dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) and three terpene synthase (TPS) genes, for which expression changes coincided with the production patterns of anthocyanins and trans-β-ocimene, respectively. Furthermore, a number of MYB and bHLH transcription factors (TFs) which might be involved in color- and aroma-formation were also identified in L. longituba tepal transcriptomes. Taken together, this is the first comprehensive report of the color and fragrance in tepals of L. longituba and these results could be helpful in understanding these characteristics and their regulation networks.","['volatile organic compounds', 'Lycoris longituba', 'Tepals', 'Aroma Formation', 'Color Fading']","['Figure', 'shown', 'longituba tepal', 'Tepal', 'unigenes', 'longituba', 'Tepal Development', 'tepals', 'biosynthesis', 'tepal color']","[’, ’, S3-P, S3-W, S2-P, S3-P, ≥, 8.6–10.0, 663.25, 565.28, ~98.20, 45.55–46.88, SRA, PRJNA490415, Swiss-Prot, 85,563, 85,563, 44,813, S2-P, S3-W libraries, S2-P, S3-P, S3-P, S2-P, S3-P, S3-W., S2-P, S2-P, S3-P, S3-P, S2-P, S2-P, S2-P, PC2, PC2, PC2, S2-P, S3-P, DFRs, F3’H1, FLSs, DFR-annotated unigenes, DFR2-1, S3-P, Unigene81776, S3-P, MYB, bHLH [ 14, bHLHs]","['TPS', 'TPSs,']",[],[],NaN

Next to a high-quality genome sequence other genomic tools have also become available for rose, including transcriptomics data, a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism array and software to perform linkage and quantitative trait locus mapping in polyploids. Rose cultivars are highly heterogeneous and diverse. This vast diversity in cultivated roses can be explained through the genetic potential of the genus, introgressions from wild species into commercial tetraploid germplasm and the inimitable efforts of historical breeders. We can now investigate how this diversity can best be exploited and refined in future breeding work, given the rich molecular toolbox now available to the rose breeding community. This paper presents possible lines of research now that rose has entered the genomics era, and attempts to partially answer the question that arises after the completion of any draft genome sequence: 'Now that we have ""the"" genome, what's next?'.

However, terpene biosynthesis varies among plant species and developmental stages. In the present study, volatile headspace analysis of tobacco seedlings with MaβFS1 (an EβF synthase from the Asian peppermint Mentha asiatica) failed to generate EβF. We further targeted MaβFS1 to the tobacco plastid, using a chloroplast targeting sequence, either with or without the AtFPS1 gene for the biosynthesis of the precursor farnesyl diphosphate. When both MaβFS1 and AtFPS1 genes were targeted to the chloroplast, low levels of EβF were detected in stably transformed tobacco seedlings; resulting in specific repellence of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. These data indicate that redirecting the EβF biosynthetic pathway from its natural cytosolic location to the chloroplast is a valid strategy. This redirecting strategy may be very useful for other crop plants that do not naturally produce EβF or other repellent volatiles.","['Sesquiterpene', 'Tobacco seedling', 'Repellence', 'aphid', '()-Β-farnesene Synthase']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN

Monoterpenes are produced from a single linear substrate, geranyl diphosphate, by a group of enzymes called the monoterpene cyclases/synthases (mTC/Ss) that catalyse high-energy cyclisation reactions involving unstable carbocation intermediates. Efforts towards producing monoterpenes via biocatalysis or metabolic engineering often result in the formation of multiple products due to the nature of the highly branched reaction mechanism of mTC/Ss. Rational engineering of mTC/Ss is hampered by the lack of correlation between the active site sequence and cyclisation type. We used available mutagenesis data to show that amino acids involved in product outcome are clustered and spatially conserved within the mTC/S family. Consensus sequences for three such plasticity regions were introduced in different mTC/S with increasingly complex cyclisation cascades, including the model enzyme limonene synthase (LimS). In all three mTC/S studied, mutations in the first two regions mostly give rise to products that result from premature quenching of the linalyl or α-terpinyl cations, suggesting that both plasticity regions are involved in the formation and stabilisation of cations early in the reaction cascade. A LimS variant with mutations in the second region (S454G, C457V, M458I), produced mainly more complex bicyclic products. QM/MM MD simulations reveal that the second cyclisation is not due to compression of the C2-C7 distance in the α-terpinyl cation, but is the result of an increased distance between C8 of the α-terpinyl cation and two putative bases (W324, H579) located on the other side of the active site, preventing early termination by deprotonation. Such insights into the impact of mutations can only be obtained using integrated experimental and computational approaches, and will aid the design of altered mTC/S activities towards clean monoterpenoid products.","['Site-directed mutagenesis', 'Monoterpenoids', 'Synthetic Biology', 'Monoterpene Synthase', 'Qm/mm Md Simulations', 'Functional Plasticity', 'Limonene Synthase']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN

It has been hypothesized that the specialized epithelial cells surrounding the secretory cavities of Japanese pepper fruits and leaves are responsible for the synthesis of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which are generally produced by terpene synthases (TPSs); however, direct evidence for the formation of terpenes in Japanese pepper remains elusive. Here we report that monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes accumulate inside the secretory cavities of Japanese pepper leaves, but not in other parts of leaf tissues that do not include secretory cavities. We have obtained cDNAs for ZpTPS1 and ZpTPS2, which are responsible for biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenes β-caryophyllene and germacrene D, respectively, in Japanese pepper. In addition, we also identified a cDNA for the monoterpene synthase ZpTPS3. Expression of ZpTPS3 in Escherichia coli in addition to Agrobacterium-mediated transient ZpTPS3 expression in Nicotiana benthamiana demonstrated the catalytic activity of ZpTPS3 to form β-phellandrene as the major product. In situ hybridization in Japanese pepper leaf tissue revealed that ZpTPS3 transcript specifically accumulated in the epithelial cells surrounding secretory cavities. Expression of ZpTPS3 in epithelial cells was only detectable during early stages of cavity development, whereas the formation of volatile terpenes occurred at a constant rate throughout the expansion of secretory cavities.

Leaf Transcriptome Sequencing and De Novo Assembly Illumina sequencing generated 140 GB of data containing ca. 182 million paired-end reads. Trinity assembly resulted in 78,807 transcripts with fragment sizes ranging from 224 to 12,395 bp ( Figure 1a) and a median contig length of 595 bp.  Table 1 presents assembly statistics of the transcriptome, including transcripts that were retained with an exN50 length of 1145 bp, which represents the shortest transcript length at which half the assembled base pairs can be found. The exN50 statistic for the  P. copal suggests the Trinity assembly is of high quality. Furthermore, comparison of BUSCO analyses for all three transcriptomes ( P. copal,  B. sacra and  B. simaruba) suggest that the  P. copal assembly is the highest quality of the three with slightly better scores than  B. sacra and significantly better scores than  B. simaruba ( Figure 1b). Of the 2121 single-copy orthologs included in the BUSCO analysis, 1292 (60.9%) were found to be complete, of which 563 (26.5%) were duplicated. Five hundred and fifteen orthologs (24.3%) were fragmented, and 314 (14.8%) were missing. Of the three Burseraceae transcriptomes,  Protium copal was the most complete, with the fewest missing and fragmented orthologs ( Figure 1c). 3.2. Functional Annotation and Similarity with Other Plant Genomes The Trinotate annotation identified 38,042 nucleotide sequences (48.27%) and 24,250 protein sequences (30.77%) that showed significant homology with Viridiplantae when compared to the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database using BLASTx and BLASTp searches, respectively. Furthermore, 20,271 (25.72%) unique Pfam protein motifs were assigned ( Table S1). These protein domains can be involved in various biological processes and molecular function such as protein–protein interactions, transcription regulation, and organic compound biosynthetic processes. In contrast, Blast2GO annotation retrieved 48,951 transcripts (69.91%) were successfully matched to homologous sequences for Viridiplantae in the NR database (e-value < 1 × 10 −5). Out of the blasted transcripts, 18,822 transcripts (26.87%) were mapped to at least one gene ontology (GO) term using Blast2GO. The vast majority of BLAST hits for the transcripts came from the genus  Citrus, also a member of the order Sapindales ( Figure 2a). Our transcript dataset displayed 26,223 (37.44%) hits with the NR database and to  Citrus sinensis, followed by  Citrus clementina (10,185 top-hits, 14.54%),  Theobroma cacao (2010 top-hits), and  Hevea brasiliense (1623 top-hits) and  Vitis vinifera (1484 top-hits) ( Figure 2A). 3.3. Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) GO analysis revealed 4532 unique GO terms related to plant gene ontology. Among the three main categories, Biological processes (BP) category was the most abundant (2340 GOs), followed by molecular function (MF, 1750 GOs) and cellular component (CC, 104 GOs) categories ( Figure 2b). Within the BP category, metabolic processes (34.02%), cellular process (29.07%), and single-organism processes (16.28%) were most represented. Likewise, genes encoding binding proteins (33.40%) and genes encoding proteins related to catalytic activities (31.95%) were most abundant in the MF category. In the CC category, membrane (22.26%), membrane part (18.78%), cell (16.70%), and cell part (16.49%) were abundantly represented GO terms. In total, 10,960 (45% of the transcripts with NR blast hits for Viridiplantae) transcripts were assigned to different COG functional categories ( Table S1). The largest group is represented by the serine theorine protein kinase (COG0515, 2014 hits, 18%), followed by leucine rich repeat (COG4886, 491 hits, 13%), ankyrin repeat (COG0666, 192 hits). A few other clusters, such us chromatin structures and dynamics, cell motility, extracellular structures are underrepresented or absent. 3.4. Abundance of Transcripts Related to Terpene Functional Annotation  A total of 186 transcripts were identified as being part of monoterpenoid biosynthetic processes (GO:0016099), triterpenoid biosynthetic processes (GO:0016104), including pentacyclic (GO:0019745) and tetracyclic triterpenoids (GO:0010686), terpenoid transport (GO:0046865), terpene synthase activity (GO:0010333) and terpene/terpenoid biosynthetic processes (GO:0046246 and GO:0016114, respectively). The lengths of these transcripts varied between 232 bp and 4278 bp, with a median contig length of 736 bp. In total, we found approximately 540.2 transcripts per million (TPM) expressed for all terpene and terpenoid functional annotation ( Figure 3). Transcripts associated with the synthesis of monoterpenoids and terpenoid transport were relatively highly expressed with single transcripts having double the abundance relative to the mean TPM expressed in  Protium copal. 3.5. Phylogenetic Validation of Terpene Synthase Gene Annotations Fifty-seven  P. copal transcripts were identified as putative TPS genes ( Figure 4). With the exception of the outgroup specimens in TPSd all of the subfamilies were monophyletic. While support values are low within the TPSa and b subfamilies, the topology of the phylogeny is congruent with previous phylogenetic studies of the TPS gene family (see [ 4, 7, 30]). We conclude that the terpene genes identified in the  P. copal transcriptome are consistent with the annotation of other model terpene-rich plant species (e.g., Citrus and Arabidopsis). 3.6. Relative Diversity of Orthologous Terpene Gene Clusters in  P. copal Comparison of inferred proteins among the three species in OrthoVenn identified 107 gene clusters, with 58 clusters being shared by at least two of the three species. Protium copal was found to share a relatively high number of terpene genes with both  B. simaruba and  B. sacra transcriptome assemblies (32 terpene genes were shared with B. sacra and 35 genes were shared with  B. simaruba,  Figure 5a). More unique terpene gene clusters were identified in  P. copal and  B. simaruba relative to B. sacra. In addition,  P. copal shared more orthologous gene clusters with  B. simaruba than  B. sacra. Finally,  P. copal exhibited the highest diversity of terpene orthologous gene clusters in comparison to the other two Burseraceae species ( Figure 5b). 3.7. Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) Marker Identification A total of 11,480 repeat regions were identified across 9496 transcripts (15%). In addition, 1610 transcripts contained multiple SSRs (2.5%), and a total of 770 compound SSRs were identified in the  P. copal transcriptome. Out of the 11,480 SSRs, 7308 mono-nucleotide (64%), 1936 di-nucleotide (17%), 2010 tri-nucleotide (18%), 112 tetra-nucleotide (1%), 53 penta-nucleotide (0.5%), and 61 hexa-nucleotide markers (0.5%) were identified. Seven SSRs were identified which were found within transcripts putatively involved in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway and 3 of which were found in transcripts putatively involved in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. Of these, five were mono-nucleotides, two were di-nucleotides, one was a tri-nucleotide, and two were compound SSR regions. The list of SSR markers identified are presented in  Table S2. 3.8. SNP Discovery A total of 64,510 SNPs was identified across 25,505 transcripts ( Table S3). 36,893 SNPs were located in coding regions (CDS). 22,292 SNPs were classified as non-synonymous (35%), of which 22,159 are located in CDS regions. 74 SNPs were located across 30 transcripts involved in terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. Of these 74 SNPs, 28 were located in CDS regions and 14 SNPs were classified as non-synonymous, all of which were located in CDS regions. Fifty-seven were involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis genes, 16 in terpene synthase genes, and 1 in terpenoid biosynthesis genes.","Plants in the Burseraceae are globally recognized for producing resins and essential oils with medicinal properties and have economic value. In addition, most of the aromatic and non-aromatic components of Burseraceae resins are derived from a variety of terpene and terpenoid chemicals. Although terpene genes have been identified in model plant crops (e.g.,  Citrus ,  Arabidopsis ), very few genomic resources are available for non-model groups, including the highly diverse Burseraceae family. Here we report the assembly of a leaf transcriptome of  Protium copal , an aromatic tree that has a large distribution in Central America, describe the functional annotation of putative terpene biosynthetic genes and compare terpene biosynthetic genes found in  P. copal  with those identified in other Burseraceae taxa. The genomic resources of  Protium copal  can be used to generate novel sequencing markers for population genetics and comparative phylogenetic studies, and to investigate the diversity and evolution of terpene genes in the Burseraceae.","['Terpenoid', 'Rna-sequencing', 'De Novo Assembly', 'Protium', 'Copal Resin']","['Figure', 'transcripts', 'Gene Clusters', 'Terpene', 'copal', 'gene', 'genes', 'identified', 'terpene genes', 'clusters']","[exN50, exN50, BUSCO, single-copy, BUSCO, Trinotate, protein–, serine theorine protein kinase, COG0515, ankyrin repeat, COG0666, GO:0019745, GO:0010686, terpene/terpenoid, GO:0046246, GO:0016114, Terpene Synthase Gene, TPSd, TPSa, b, OrthoVenn identified 107, Burseraceae species, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, 1936 di-nucleotide, SSRs, 64,510, 22,292, 22,159]","['TPS', 'TPSd', 'TPSa', 'TPS']",[],"['Citrus,', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus']",terpene synthase
91,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6614452\eupmc_result.json,PMC6614452,"Results Comparative transcriptomic profile along peel ripening between Navelate and its Pinalate mutant Physiological and biochemical data suggest that Breaker (Bk) stage is a turning point in the regulation of ordinary sweet orange ripening not only because of the peel color change but also because the sharp increase in ABA content and the later increase in maturity index (Supplementary Fig.  S1). Fruit of Navelate and Pinalate at Bk and Full Colored (FC) stages were selected to compare changes in transcriptomic profiles with those occurring at Mature Green (MG) stage in order to identify the molecular mechanisms associated with citrus peel ripening. Venn diagrams in Fig.  1A indicated that major changes in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG, FDR < 0.01) were found at Bk in both cultivars, being this number higher in Pinalate fruit (2513 respect to 1594). In both genotypes, Bk and FC stages shared a low number of DEG, which indicates that molecular changes involved in citrus peel ripening are regulated in a stage-specific manner. Interestingly, at the color change (Bk) the number of induced genes in the mutant was about 4-fold higher than in the parental (1210 respect to 278), whereas that of down-regulated genes between genotypes was similar. On the contrary, at FC stage the number of repressed genes in mutant fruit almost doubled that of the parental (1206 respect to 668) while induced genes were half of those found in Navelate (445 respect to 856) (Fig.  1A). Principal Component (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analyses (HCA) were performed to validate the repeatability of the microarray data across replications and to cluster samples according to their global gene expression profiles. Under all conditions, the transcriptional profiles of the three separate RNA replicate samples were tightly clustered together (Fig.  1B). The reliability of the transcriptomic results was further confirmed by comparing microarray expression values with those obtained by real-time quantitative PCR on a list of selected genes (Supplementary Table  S1, Fig.  S2). In addition, PCA revealed marked differences in gene expression patterns among the selected ripening stages ( X-axis explaining the 53.5% of the total variation). Differences between genotypes were lower at FC and MG stages but remarkable at Bk stage ( Y- and  Z-axes explaining a 28.6% of the total variation). Accordingly, HCA revealed that samples were grouped in a ripening stage- and genotype-dependent manner (Fig.  1C). The gene-clustering in the heatmap analysis indicated that DEG responsible for the separation of genotypes and developmental stages in the PCA may be divided into two main branches: The first cluster grouped genes decreasing transcript levels from MG to FC stage, and the second is composed of genes whose expression is induced as ripening progresses (Fig.  1D). Heatmap also revealed similarity between cultivars at MG stage and substantial differences in the expression patterns of Navelate and Pinalate Bk fruit (Fig.  1D). Some clusters of genes showed high inductions in Pinalate but repression in Navelate Bk fruit, while others were repressed in both cultivars but more intensely in the mutant (Fig.  1D). At FC stage, those genes whose expression was repressed as ripening progressed showed similar transcript levels in both genotypes while those experiencing induction along maturation in the parental were still mostly repressed in the mutant at the full mature stage. Notably, some of those genes repressed in Pinalate were highly induced in the FC parental fruit (Fig.  1D). Alterations in peel ripening-related events in Pinalate fruit as compared to its parental Navelate Functional categorization analysis on the DEG identified biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components and KEGG pathways significantly (P < 0.05) under- or over-represented along peel maturation in the parental and its mutant. Gene ontology analyses revealed that the high number of DEG in Navelate and Pinalate Bk fruit were only enriched in the chlorophyll binding molecular function and in the fructose and mannose metabolic pathway, both repressed in either genotype (Table  1). The number of DEG at Bk in both cultivars suggests that a large number of molecular events are being regulated at this stage, while GO analysis indicates that they are probably involved in a wide range of responses since they are not grouped in specific biological processes. At FC stage, repressed genes in the flavedo of Navelate fruit were related to photosynthesis and syncytium formation, while those induced were enriched in the response to water deprivation and to fungus, and in the metabolism of glucan (Table  1). In contrast, down-regulated genes in FC Pinalate fruit were statistically enriched in photosynthesis and lipid biosynthetic processes, whereas the response to hypoxia was the only biological process over-represented in the set of induced genes. Therefore, biological processes induced in the peel of FC parental fruit were not found in the mutant at any developmental stage, and the down-regulation of the photosynthesis, the chlorophyll binding and the fructose and mannose metabolism were the only events in common between both genotypes (Table  1). In line with this, genes encoding light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins, which are part of the antenna proteins KEGG pathway and function in the thylakoid, were repressed in both genotypes (Table  1). However, the carbon fixation pathway, tightly related to the energy metabolism involving chloroplast and mitochondria cellular components, was only repressed in the mutant fruit, as well as the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Last, the ribonucleoprotein complex and the intracellular non-membrane-bound organelle cellular components were over-represented in the set of Navelate FC induced genes (Table  1), suggesting an enhancement of the transcriptional activity in the parental but not in the mutant fruit. To further uncover biological processes related to peel maturation and how Pinalate mutation might interfere in their regulation, we performed a more restrictive ontology analysis, considering only those DEG responsible for the separation of genotypes and ripening stages observed in the multivariate analyses. The 1116 genes satisfying the ANOVA test (P < 0.001) were enriched in a high number of biological processes that might be classified into two different groups. The first group would include biological processes related to primary and secondary metabolism and those involved in the redox potential and energy generation. This group is composed of the lignin, wax, and starch biosynthetic processes and of the transmembrane and photosynthetic electron transport categories. Secondly, we identified 12 different biological processes that may be grouped as biotic and abiotic stress responses (Table  2). Therefore, the next subsections will delve into the molecular mechanisms included in each group separately. Effects of carotenoid biosynthetic blockage and reduced ABA levels on the regulation of metabolism-related pathways, redox potential and energy generation along peel ripening To get a deeper insight into how Pinalate mutation interferes with the regulation of the molecular mechanisms controlling the lignin, wax, starch and lipid biosynthetic processes and the transmembrane and photosynthetic electron transport along fruit ripening, genes included in the most specific biological processes for each category were studied. Belonging to the lignin biosynthesis category, we identified the  HYDROXYCINNAMOYL-COA TRANSFERASE ( HCT),  CUMARATE-3-HYDROXYLASE ( C3H),  CINNAMOYL-COA REDUCTASE ( CCR2),  O-METHYLTRANSFERASE1 ( OMT1) and  FERULIC ACID 5-HYDROXYLASE1 ( F5H) genes. Only minor differences between genotypes were found among the expression values of these genes. In fact,  OMT1 and  F5H, acting downstream in the pathway, were repressed in both cultivars and no significant differences were observed when compared Navelate and Pinalate FC fruit (Table  3). However,  HCT and  C3H, encoding the enzymes that catalyze the three first steps of the lignin biosynthetic pathway and hence regulate the accumulation of caffeic and coumaric acids, displayed opposite expression patterns during ripening in both genotypes and higher transcript levels in the parental than in the mutant at FC stage (Table  3). Similarly, the expression values of the genes belonging to the wax biosynthetic process barely differed between Navelate and Pinalate FC fruit. Thus, among the  LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE2 ( LACS2),  3-KETOACYL-COA SYNTHETASE6 ( KCS6),  3-KETOACYL-COA SYNTHETASE1 ( KCS1) and  ECERIFERUM1 ( CER1) genes identified in this category, only  KCS1, which participates in the catalysis of several steps for the formation of very long chain fatty acids, showed opposite regulation between genotypes and a two-fold induction in Navelate compared to Pinalate FC fruit (Table  3). Genes belonging to the starch biosynthetic process encoded for proteins with ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase ( APL1,  APL2,  APL4) and starch branching ( SBE2.1,  SBE2.1) activities, involved in the production of ADP-alpha-glucose and in the formation of branches in amylopectin and alpha-amylose, respectively, were induced in the parental but not in the mutant FC fruit (Table  3). On the other hand, all genes included in the photosynthetic electron transport process were repressed in Pinalate as compared to Navelate fruit (Table  3). These genes included two subunits of the photosystem I ( PSI-G,  PSI-P), the delta subunit of the ATP synthase ( ATPD) and two proton pumps ( PGR5,  PGRL1B) involved in the electron flow in the photosystem I (Table  3). These lacks of induction and enhanced repressions in the mutant as compared to parental fruit were also found in the regulation of the transmembrane transport-related genes. Thus, Pinalate fruit was unable to induce the expression of  MULTI-ANTIMICROBIAL EXTRUSION ( MATE),  ABC TRANSPORTER39 ( ABCG39) or  VACUOLAR ATP SYNTHASE F and  H ( AHA-F,  AHA-H) genes, and showed higher repression values than its parental for the  ABC TRANSPORTER32 ( ABCG32) and a  PUTATIVE SUGAR TRANSPORTER 1 ( ESL1) (Table  3). Taking into account the partially overlapping results obtained separately after the two functional categorization analyses performed in this work (Tables  1 and  2), we considered that the lipid biosynthetic process (Table  1) must be included in the group of events related to primary and secondary metabolism, and deserved a deeper investigation because of this process is known as a canonical response of fruit ripening 3. The lipid biosynthesis was statistically repressed only in the Pinalate mutant FC fruit as compared to its MG stage (Table  1), although the genes belonging to this process did not show differences between genotypes at FC stage (Table  3). This category included genes related to the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway such as  HYDROXYMETHYLBUTENYL DIPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE ( HDR),  DEOXYXYLULOSE 5-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE2 ( DXS2) and  GERANYLGERANYL PYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE1 ( GGPPS1), and to the carotenoid metabolism such as  PHYTOENE SYNTHASE ( PSY) and  PHYTOENE DEHYDROGENASE ( PDS), genes related to wax and cutin biosynthesis such as  LACS2,  KCS6,  3-KETOACYL-COA SYNTHETASE10 ( KCS10) and  SQUALENE SYNTHASE1 ( SQS1), genes encoding terpene synthases involved in the generation of volatile compounds ( TPS23,  TPS21 and  TPS3), and genes involved in the catabolism of fatty acids to generate jasmonic acid such as  ALLENE OXIDASE CYCLASE4 ( AOC4),  ALLENE OXIDASE SYNTHASE ( AOS),  JASMONIC ACID CARBOXYL METHYLTRANSFERASE ( JMT),  FATTY ACID OXYGENATION UPREGULATED2 ( FOU2) and  LIPOXYGENASE1 and 2 ( LOX1 and  LOX2). Effects of ABA on the regulation of biotic and abiotic stress responses along peel ripening The response to biotic and abiotic stresses group included 12 different biological processes (Table  2). Among them, the response to water deprivation, the response to ABA stimulus, the defense response to fungus and the response to blue light, belonging to the most specific GO levels, were selected to assess transcriptional differences between parental and mutant FC fruit (Table  4). Notably, all the genes accounting for the responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses were significantly repressed in FC Pinalate as compared to FC Navelate fruit (Table  4). Indeed, parental FC fruit induced most of the genes belonging to these processes while mutant FC fruit was unable to carry out such inductions or even enhanced the repressions that eventually occurred in the parental fruit (Table  4). Within the context of this work, the response to ABA stimulus merits special mention. Among genes belonging to this process we identified a gene involved in the ABA catabolism ( CYP707A1), components of the ABA-signalosome ( PP2CA,  CPK32 and  MPK2), several transcription factors ( MYBST1,  MYB6,  ERF3b,  ABF4,  MYB102 and  GBF3) and a number of loci described as ABA-responsive genes in the  Arabidopsis model plant ( RD26,  SYP121,  ANNAT4,  LTP4,  ELF3,  ERD14,  ATAF1, PC5S,  PGL35 and  ALDH3-H1) (Table  4). We selected 8 of these genes categorized as ABA-dependent ( CsCYP707A1,  CsSYP121,  CsABF4,  CsATAF1,  CsRD26,  CsERD14,  CsGBF3 and  CsALDH3-H1) and conducted their expression analysis by qRT-PCR on Navelate and Pinalate fruit harvested at 6 ripening stages in order to investigate how Pinalate mutation affects their regulation along fruit maturation (Fig.  2). To better understand this question, two genes ( CsDREB2A and  CsSTZ) described as ABA-independent and belonging to the response to water deprivation biological process (Table  4) were also included in the analysis. Overall, expression patterns for a high number of the genes, including those described as ABA-independent, paralleled ABA accumulation along ripening in both cultivars (Fig.  2, Supplementary Fig.  S1). Thus, expression remained at low levels at green stages and sharply increased after color break to bottom down again at the end of the ripening (FC stage). Nevertheless, these genes showed higher expression values in the parental than in the mutant fruit at FC stage, when ABA levels were still 2-fold higher in Navelate than in Pinalate fruit (Fig.  2, Supplementary Fig.  S1). It should be noticed that the  CsGBF3 transcription factor and the  CsERD14 dehydrin did not follow this pattern and showed the maximum expression at the most immature stage to decrease thereafter in both cultivars (Fig.  2). On the other hand, marked differences between genotypes along all ripening stages were detected for the  CsSYP121 syntaxin and the  CsALDH3 aldehyde dehydrogenase. To narrow down the participation of ABA regulating these stress-related responses, the transcriptional regulation of the same set of genes studied along ripening was assessed in Navelate and its mutant Pinalate FC fruit after applying an ABA treatment. ABA application increased the ABA levels in Navelate FC fruit by about a 3-fold (from 0.57 to 1.73 μg/g fresh weight) and about a 10-fold in the mutant FC fruit (from 0.2 to 1.93 μg/g fresh weight), which means that ABA was efficiently uptaken by the fruit and similar levels of the hormone were reached in fruit of both cultivars upon 1 week of treatment. Consistently with data reported in Fig.  2, most of the genes were statistically repressed in the mutant as compared to control (non-treated) Navelate fruit (Fig.  3). After ABA treatment, all studied genes but  CsSTZ and  CsRD26 were induced in Navelate fruit as compared to control fruit (Fig.  3). In ABA-treated Pinalate fruit, however,  CsALDH3H,  CsERD14,  CsSYP121,  CsATAF1, CsDREB2A and  CsRD26 transcripts accumulation was increased as compared to control non-treated fruits (Fig.  3). In addition, not all these genes reached the same (or higher) transcript levels in Pinalate fruit after ABA treatment than in the parental. In fact, only  CsALDH3H,  CsERD14,  CsSYP121,  CsATAF1 and  CsDREB2A expression levels were similar between ABA-treated Navelate and Pinalate fruit; the expression of other genes such as  CsCYP707A1,  CsABF4,  CsSTZ,  CsGBF3 and  CsRD26 were still reduced in ABA-treated Pinalate as compared to control Navelate fruit, highlighting the partial ability of the mutant fruit after exogenous ABA application to recover the transcript levels found in the parental fruit.","Citrus fruit ripening is a complex process involving biochemical, physiological and molecular events that differ between the flesh and the peel of the fruit. We characterized sweet orange peel maturation by means of a comparative transcriptomic analysis between Navelate orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) and its mutant fruit Pinalate, which presents a severe blockage at early steps of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and consequently reduced ABA levels. Peel ripening involved the decrease of the photosynthetic activity and the transmembrane transport processes, as well as the buildup of starch and cuticular waxes and the cell wall modification. In addition, a number of biotic and abiotic stress responses, including the defense response, and the response to blue light, water deprivation and abscisic acid stimulus were modulated in a ripening-stage specific manner. The regulation of energy-related processes and secondary metabolism pathways was attenuated in Pinalate, while the molecular mechanisms underlying stress responses displayed dependency on ABA levels. These results indicate that ABA is a key signal inducing stress responses along orange peel ripening, which might determine the fruit postharvest performance.",NaN,"['Pinalate fruit', 'Fruit', 'Pinalate', 'genes', 'Navelate fruit', 'Fig.', 'Table', 'Navelate', 'ABA', 'mutant fruit']","[ABA, Bk, Green (MG, DEG, Bk, Bk, DEG, Bk, HCA, Pinalate Bk fruit (Fig.  1D, Navelate Bk, DEG, Pinalate Bk fruit, DEG, Bk, light-harvesting chlorophyll, lignin, ABA, lignin, CCR2, 5-HYDROXYLASE1, Pinalate FC fruit (Table  3, Pinalate FC fruit, SYNTHETASE2, SYNTHETASE6, KCS6, KCS1, CER1, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, SBE2.1, ADP-alpha-glucose, alpha-amylose, photosystem I, PSI-G, delta, PGR5, photosystem I, TRANSPORTER39 (, ABCG39, AHA-F, ABCG32, DXS2, SYNTHETASE10, KCS10, SQS1, CYCLASE4, AOC4, UPREGULATED2, FOU2, 2, LOX1, ABA, ABA, ABA, ABA, ABA-signalosome (, PP2CA, MYBST1, RD26, PC5S, CsCYP707A1, CsDREB2A, ABA-independent, ABA, ABA, syntaxin, ABA, ABA, ABA, ABA, μg/g, μg/g, ABA, ABA, CsDREB2A, ABA, ABA]","['TPS23,', 'TPS21', 'TPS3),']",[],[],terpene synthase

Identification of TaPS as a Sesquiterpene Synthase Terpenes play important roles in plant growth and environmental adaptation. Although a few diterpene synthases have been characterized in wheat, no sesquiterpene synthase was identified. Based on the wheat genome sequence released on Phytozome, we cloned one terpene synthase gene. Transit and/or signal peptide predication indicated no transit/signal peptide sequence in its encoded protein. Recombinant expression in  E. coli through metabolic engineering enabled to supply isoprenoid precursors for potential terpene synthase [ 35, 39]. This wheat terpene synthase successfully catalyzed a single sesquiterpene production while FPP was supplied through co-expression of an  E. coli FPP synthase ( Figure 1). This sesquiterpene was tentatively identified to be β-patchoulene by the retention index and mass spectrum comparison with that in NIST MS library. GGPP and GPP were also provided to test the potential diterpene or monoterpene synthase activity, respectively; however, this terpene synthase did not exhibit any capacity to catalyze monoterpene or diterpene formation. In combining all these evidences, this wheat terpene synthase gene encoded a β-patchoulene synthase, accordingly named as TaPS. 3.2. Inducible TaPS Gene Expression and β-Patchoulene Accumulation To explore the biological function of TaPS, its gene expression pattern was analyzed. As indicated in  Figure 2A,  TaPS exhibited low constitutive expression in wheat leaves, stems and roots. Upon elicitation,  TaPS gene expression was induced differentially in response to various treatments. UV irradiation and MeJA treatment elevated  TaPS gene expression only slightly. Alamethicin treatment and  F. graminearum spore inoculation drastically induced  TaPS gene expression, suggesting involvement of TaPS in biotic stress response. Consistently, herbivory with beet armyworm larvae feeding also strongly induced  TaPS gene expression in wheat leaves. Based on the gene expression analysis, alamethicin was the powerful elicitor to induce  TaPS gene expression, which then was used to treat wheat leaves for terpene analysis by GC-MS. β-patchoulene was clearly detected in treated wheat tissues (~24 ng/g FW), this for the first time, but not in controls ( Figure 2B), consistent with inducible gene expression of  TaPS. In addition, we also detected other sesquiterpenes in wheat leaves, suggesting the presence of unknown sesquiterpene synthases that await their identification in future investigation ( Figure 2B and  Figure S2). 3.3. Arabidopsis Overexpressing TaPS Produced β-Patchoulene to Repel S. Exigua Larvae To explore the biological function  in planta,  TaPS was overexpressed in Arabidopsis under control of the 35S promoter. The RT-PCR analysis indicated that  TaPS was successfully expressed in Arabidopsis ( Figure 3A). Further GC-MS analysis also showed β-patchoulene production (~130 ng/g FW) in two transgenic Arabidopsis lines ( Figure 3B,C). These results proved that TaPS catalyzed β-patchoulene formation as a sesquiterpene synthase  in planta, consistent with its biochemical activity in microbial metabolic engineering system ( Figure 1). Sesquiterpenes have been reported to exhibit various functions particularly anti-herbivory activity in plants, being repellent and/or antifeedant or attracting predators or parasitoids [ 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. β-patchoulene is the component of essential oil from  P. cablin and has not been identified to be involved in plant defense. We used transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing  TaPS to investigate the anti-herbivory activity of β-patchoulene. In the dual-choice feeding preference assay,  S. exigua larvae preferred WT over transgenic leaves ( Figure 4A). After 24 h, leaf consumption by larvae on WT leaves was significantly higher than  TaPS overexpression lines ( Figure 4B), indicating repellent activity of β-patchoulene produced by  TaPS overexpression in Arabidopsis. The potential toxicity of β-patchoulene on larvae was also explored and no significant growth inhibition was observed when larvae fed transgenic Arabidopsis ( Figure S3), suggesting that β-patchoulene might not exert a direct toxicity to  S. exigua larvae. 3.4. Exploring TaPS Catalytic Mechanism by Homology Modeling and Mutagenesis To explore the catalytic mechanism of TaPS, homology modeling and docking was performed. As shown in  Figure 5A, the residues I392 and C393 were closely localized to the final product β-patchoulene in the kink of Helix G, which was proposed to be involved in stabilization of carbocation in Nt5EAS [ 40]. Amino acid sequence alignment indicated that both residues of I392 and C393 in TaPS were distinct from equivalent residues of other sTPSs ( Figure 5B and  Figure S4). Particularly, the patchoulol synthase from  P. cablin (PatTPS177) has a Cys and Gly at the equivalent positions, respectively [ 41]. Patchoulol has only one more hydroxyl group than β-pathchoulene and their corresponding biosynthetic enzymes should involve some key residues to generate these two similar products. We mutated I392 and C393 of TaPS to the equivalent C and G of PatTps177, respectively. The product profiles of both mutants were changed with FPP as the substrate ( Figure 5C and  Figure S5). Notably, some hydroxylated sesquiterpenoids were produced by TaPS mutants. Although none of them was identified as (−)-patchoulol by comparing with the authentic standard, generation of hydroxyl products by these mutants suggests involvement of I392 and C393 in TaPS catalysis and further investigation is needed to clarify the underlying mechanism.","Terpenoids play important roles in plant defense. Although some terpene synthases have been characterized, terpenoids and their biosynthesis in wheat ( Triticum   aestivum  L.) still remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the identification of a terpene synthase gene in wheat. It encodes a sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes β-patchoulene formation with  E,E -farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrate, thus named as TaPS. TaPS exhibits inducible expression in wheat in response to various elicitations. Particularly, alamethicin treatment strongly induces  TaPS  gene expression and β-patchoulene accumulation in wheat. Overexpression of  TaPS  in Arabidopsis successfully produces β-patchoulene, verifying the biochemical function of TaPS in planta. Furthermore, these transgenic Arabidopsis plants exhibit resistance against herbivory by repelling beet armyworm larvae feeding, thereby indicating anti-herbivory activity of β-patchoulene. The catalytic mechanism of TaPS is also explored by homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. Two key amino acids are identified to act in protonation and stability of intermediates and product formation. Taken together, one wheat sesquiterpene synthase is identified as β-patchoulene synthase. TaPS exhibits inducible gene expression and the sesquiterpene β-patchoulene is involved in repelling insect infestation.","['Resistance', 'Arabidopsis', 'Sesquiterpene', 'Wheat', 'herbivory', 'Patchoulene']","['Figure', 'TaPS', 'Gene Expression', 'TaPS Gene', 'Synthase', 'gene', 'terpene synthase', 'expression', 'β-patchoulene', 'Arabidopsis']","[TaPS, terpene synthase, terpene synthase [, wheat terpene synthase, FPP synthase ( Figure 1, wheat terpene synthase, TaPS, TaPS, TaPS, 2A, TaPS, TaPS, C, TaPS, cablin, TaPS, TaPS, Nt5EAS [ 40, TaPS, sTPSs, cablin (PatTPS177, TaPS, C, PatTps177, S5, TaPS, (−)-patchoulol, TaPS]","['sTPSs', '(PatTPS177)']",[],[],terpene synthase

Citrus black spot (CBS), caused by the fungus Phyllosticta citricarpa, is associated with crop losses in different citrus-growing areas worldwide. The pathogen may infect the fruit for 20-24 weeks after petal fall, but the typical hard spot symptoms appear when the fruit have almost reached maturity, caused by fungal colonization and the induction of cell lysis around essential oil cavities. d-Limonene represents approximately 95% of the total oil gland content in mature orange fruit. Herein, we investigated whether orange fruit with reduced d-limonene content in peel oil glands via an antisense (AS) approach may affect fruit interaction with P. citricarpa relative to empty vector (EV) controls. AS fruit showed enhanced resistance to the fungus relative to EV fruit. Because of the reduced d-limonene content, an over-accumulation of linalool and other monoterpene alcohols was found in AS relative to EV fruit. A global gene expression analysis at 2 h and 8 days after inoculation with P. citricarpa revealed the activation of defence responses in AS fruit via the up-regulation of different pathogenesis-related (PR) protein genes, probably as a result of enhanced constitutive accumulation of linalool and other alcohols. When assayed in vitro and in vivo, monoterpene alcohols at the concentrations present in AS fruit showed strong antifungal activity. We show here that terpene engineering in fruit peels could be a promising method for the development of new strategies to obtain resistance to fruit diseases.","['Genetic engineering', 'Linalool', 'Phyllosticta Citricarpa', 'D-limonene', 'Cbs', 'Guignardia Citricarpa']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN

To gain insights into the differential pathogenicity exhibited by Xac and Xaa and to survey the early molecular events leading to canker development, a detailed transcriptional analysis of sweet orange plants infected with the pathogens was performed. Using differential display, suppressed subtractive hybridization and microarrays, we identified changes in transcript levels in approximately 2.0% of the approximately 32,000 citrus genes examined. Genes with altered expression in response to Xac/Xaa surveyed at 6 and 48 h post-infection (hpi) were associated with cell-wall modifications, cell division and expansion, vesicle trafficking, disease resistance, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and responses to hormones auxin, gibberellin and ethylene. Most of the genes that were commonly modulated by Xac and Xaa were associated with basal defences triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including those involved in reactive oxygen species production and lignification. Significantly, we detected clear changes in the transcriptional profiles of defence, cell-wall, vesicle trafficking and cell growth-related genes in Xac-infected leaves between 6 and 48 hpi. This is consistent with the notion that Xac suppresses host defences early during infection and simultaneously changes the physiological status of the host cells, reprogramming them for division and growth.

Recently, genome projects on mushroom fungi have provided a great deal of biosynthetic gene cluster information. However, functional analyses of the gene clusters for natural products were largely unexplored because of the difficulty of cDNA preparation and lack of gene manipulation tools for basidiomycete fungi. To develop a versatile host for basidiomycete genes, we examined gene expression using genomic DNA sequences in the robust ascomycete host  Aspergillus oryzae , which is frequently used for the production of metabolites from filamentous fungi. Exhaustive expression of 30 terpene synthase genes from the basidiomycetes  Clitopilus pseudo-pinsitus  and  Stereum hirsutum  showed two splicing patterns, i.e., completely spliced cDNAs giving terpenes (15 cases) and mostly spliced cDNAs, indicating that  A. oryzae  correctly spliced most introns at the predicted positions and lengths. The mostly spliced cDNAs were expressed after PCR-based removal of introns, resulting in the successful production of terpenes (14 cases). During this study, we observed relatively frequent mispredictions in the automated program. Hence, the complementary use of  A. oryzae  expression and automated prediction will be a powerful tool for genome mining. IMPORTANCE  The recent large influx of genome sequences from basidiomycetes, which are prolific producers of bioactive natural products, may provide opportunities to develop novel drug candidates. The development of a reliable expression system is essential for the genome mining of natural products because of the lack of a tractable host for heterologous expression of basidiomycete genes. For this purpose, we applied the ascomycete  Aspergillus oryzae  system for the direct expression of fungal natural product biosynthetic genes from genomic DNA. Using this system, 29 sesquiterpene synthase genes and diterpene biosynthetic genes for bioactive pleuromutilin were successfully expressed. Together with the use of computational tools for intron prediction, this  Aspergillus oryzae  system represents a practical method for the production of basidiomycete natural products.","['Aspergillus oryzae', 'heterologous expression', 'Terpene synthase', 'terpenes', 'Basidiomycete Fungi']",[],[],[],[],[],NaN

Volatile Profiling of Finger Citron In order to obtain comprehensive information about volatile components of finger citron, flowers, leaves and fruits at different developmental stages were subjected to SPME-GC-MS analysis ( Figure 1A). Finger citron fruit weight increased from 68.33 g to 260.77 g during development ( Figure 1B). A total of 62 volatiles were detected in finger citron throughout these developmental stages ( Figure 1C and  Table S1). Major volatile classes of finger citron included 17 monoterpene hydrocarbons, 23 oxygenated monoterpenes, 13 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, one oxygenated sesquiterpene, and 8 others including aldehydes, alkanes, ketones, and olefins ( Table S1). Among these 62 volatiles identified, 33 chemicals (53.2%) were detected in all three organs (flower, leaf, and fruit). A total of eight chemicals (12.9%) were only detected in flower. Three chemicals (4.8%) were specifically produced by fruit and no unique volatiles were detected in finger citron leaf ( Figure 1C). Monoterpene was the most abundant class, accounting for 64.82% to 90.97% of the total content, followed by monoterpene derivative accounting for 6.84% to 32.47% ( Figure 1D). Finger citron accumulated volatile compounds during organ development, with the highest content of volatiles detected in fruit, followed by leaf and flower. Among all the volatiles detected, the most abundant chemical was limonene (3.88 mg/g to 16.73 mg/g), followed by γ-terpinene (0.92 mg/g to 7.22 mg/g) ( Table S1). A heat map was constructed to provide an overall view of volatiles detected in finger citron organs at different developmental stages ( Figure 2). In brief, volatiles could be clustered into three groups based on their profiles in finger citron organs. Group I volatiles were enriched in young leaf (F1). Volatiles in group II were enriched in fruit, including the two most abundant compounds, limonene and γ-terpinene. A total of 20 volatiles from group II were mainly detected in fruit and the contents of 17 volatiles accumulated during fruit development. In contrast, the content of the major volatile limonene tended to decrease during finger citron fruit ripening, declining from 16.73 mg/g to 13.41 mg/g ( Figure 2 and  Table S1). Group III consisted of 13 volatiles that mainly accumulated in fully opened flowers. The most notable change was observed for β-caryophyllene, whose contents increased more than 90-fold during flower maturation ( Table S1). 2.2. Identification of Key Volatiles Variation in contents of volatiles observed in  Figure 2 prompted us to investigate if finger citron organs could be distinguished based on volatile profiles. A PLS-DA model was constructed to explore the separation of organs using volatiles as variables. Permutation and cross validation tests validated the significance of the treatment differences with  p < 0.01 ( Figure S1A,B), indicating that the obtained PLS-DA model is reliable. A separation of the finger citron leaf, flower, and fruit was observed in the PLS-DA score plot ( Figure 3A) with no points overlapped. In order to identify biomarkers for discriminating finger citron samples, variable importance in projection (VIP) scores were calculated for each volatile. It has been reported that variables with value exceeding 1.0 play important roles in the PLS-DA discriminant process [ 48]. A total of 24 volatiles with VIP > 1.0 were identified ( Figure S1C), indicating these were volatiles responsible for clustering and separation of finger citron samples. Among the top 10 compounds, nine were monoterpenoids, including γ-terpinene, α-terpinene, camphene, terpinolene, α-pinene, α-thujene, β-pinene, terpineol, and β-terpineol. Compared to flower and leaf, the concentrations of these monoterpenoids were higher in fruit, and they tended to accumulate during fruit ripening ( Figure 2,  Table S1). For volatiles mentioned above, terpinene isomers γ-terpinene and α-terpinene were the top two volatiles with high VIP values of 1.78 and 1.76, respectively. Our previous study observed distinct volatile profiles of finger citron fruit compared to various other Citrus species and varieties [ 25]. PLS analysis was used in order to distinguish the six species by their volatile profiles ( Figure 3B). The first two PLS-factors were able to explain 99% variance of citron relative to pummelo, hybrids, sour orange, mandarin, and sweet orange and the clustering results were in agreement with classic Citrus taxonomy. Volatile compounds that have important roles in discriminating citrus fruit samples were identified by Shen et al. and the VID-coefficients were calculated [ 25]. As an arbitrary threshold, a VID coefficient with absolute value of 0.70 was taken [ 49]. By comparing the VID-coefficient and VIP values for each volatile compound, 6 volatiles with VID score exceeding 0.70 and VIP score exceeding 1.0 were observed ( Figure 3C). These volatiles are suggested to be characteristic compounds of finger citron separating it from other Citrus species ( Figure 3). 2.3. A Transcriptome Atlas of Finger Citron In an attempt to understand the changes in gene expression causing metabolite diversity during development, we sequenced the RNA libraries extracted from flower, leaf and fruit. Information about RNA-Seq quality is summarized in  Table S2. The correlation coefficients of tested samples were listed in  Figure S2. The correlation of the three biological replicates is above 0.7, with false discovery rate (FDR) value < 0.01 indicating the reliability of sampling. The relatively low correlation between organs indicates a selectively expression pattern of finger citron genes. A total of 1.5G clean data was generated, 95.80% of which was successfully mapped to the reference genome of C. medica. We assembled 32,579 genes, which were expressed in finger citron. For functional annotation, unigenes were searched against the Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG). About 76% of the unigenes were assigned to GO terms and 42% of them were annotated with KEGG entries. This information establishes the foundation for further investigation into target genes. Fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (FPKM) values were calculated to represent gene expression levels and the gene number and FPKM distribution are summarized in  Figure S3. Most genes were expressed in the 0.3~3.57 and 3.57~15 intervals ( Figure S3). In general, flowers had the most genes expressed and fruit had the least. As mentioned above, plant terpenoids are synthesized from two independent pathways and the upstream genes and their functions are well studied [ 2]. Hence, we screened key structural genes involved in terpene biosynthesis by KEGG annotation. The values of their expression fold changes are listed in  Table 1. Table 1 shows the DEGs in MEP and MVA pathways during organ development. In total, 12 DEGs were identified. No gene transcripts changed significantly during flower development. In the MEP pathway, two DXSs (catalyzing the formation of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate), Cm152440, and Cm165980 were significantly down-regulated in fruit. DXS/Cm152440 was down-regulated in leaf while another DXS/Cm104830 showed an opposite trend. MDS/ Cm051360 and HDS/ Cm131750 were up-regulated in fruit and flower, respectively. In the MVA pathway, there were four genes differentially expressed: two were down-regulated in leaf and two up-regulated in fruit. During fruit development, the expression level of HMGR, which is considered as the rate limiting enzyme in the MVA pathway [ 50], was up-regulated by 5.5-fold. 2.4. Changes in Transcript Levels of TPS Gene Family Terpene synthases catalyze the final pathway steps converting the universal substrates GPP, FPP, and GGPP into terpenoids. There are many members of the TPS family and their complex catalytic mechanisms contribute to the terpenoid diversity in the plant kingdom [ 4]. A total of 58  TPS genes were identified from finger citron based on KEGG annotation. A schematic diagram of TPSs gene structure ( Figure S4) shows that finger citron  TPS gene lengths ranged from about 200 bp to 16,000 bp. Some of these sequences are predicted to be inactive partial fragments in comparison to characterized TPSs in tomato and sweet orange [ 9, 15]. In order to provide an overview of expression profiles of the  TPS gene family, their transcript levels were presented and visualized as a heat map ( Figure 4). As found for volatiles in  Figure 2, the  TPS genes in  Figure 4 were also clustered into groups based on their expression patterns, named TPS-Cluster1 to 4. For flower, genes in TPS-Cluster1 were mainly accumulated ( Figure 4). The expression of six  TPS genes (Cm105420, Cm186730, Cm269930, Cm126620, Cm257250, and Cm050840) increased during flower development, while four genes (Cm294730, Cm105550, Cm116860, and Cm257230) decreased. Genes from TPS-Cluster2 and TPS-Cluster3 were predominantly expressed in young and mature leaves, respectively. These two clusters together contain 25 genes, accounting for 38% of  TPS gene family members. For TPS-Cluster4, genes were mainly expressed in fruit. During fruit development, transcript levels of two  TPS genes (Cm186720 and Cm269920) increased markedly from S1 to S2 and then remained constant afterwards. High transcript levels of  TPS genes Cm107350 and Cm285480 were detected in ripe fruit at S6 stage ( Figure 4). The spatial and temporal expressing pattern implies the diverse function of TPSs and the regulating mechanism behind terpenoid metabolism, although extremely complex, can now be probed thanks to the developing of modern techniques. To evaluate expression pattern based on RNA-Seq, RT-qPCR analysis was performed. Four fingers citron TPS genes were randomly selected for gene expression analysis during fruit ripening. As shown in  Figure S5, RT-qPCR results matched the expression pattern produced by RNA-Seq. These results indicated that the RNA-Seq data of the present study were accurate and reliable.  2.5. Changes in Transcript Levels of Transcription Factors The transcript levels of  TPS genes were regulated by a number of different TFs. So far, six TF families in plants associated with terpenoid metabolism have been identified, including AP2/ERF [ 25, 26, 32, 33], bHLH [ 31], MYB [ 27], NAC [ 28], WRKY [ 29], and bZIP [ 30]. Their gene IDs are summarized in  Table S3. Changes in the transcript levels of these six TF families from developing finger citron tissues were analyzed and presented as heat maps ( Figure S6). The AP2/ERF family with 251 members was the largest, followed by the NAC family with 184 members and bHLH family with 169 members. As shown in  Figure S5, TFs from different families had unique expression patterns. For the AP2/ERF family, members were grouped into clusters according to expression profiles in developing tissues of finger citron ( Figure S6). There were 88 (35%)  AP2/ERFs mainly expressed in developing fruit, where nine members had the highest expression level in ripe fruit at the S6 stage. For flowers, 36  AP2/ERFs had the most abundant transcripts in full flower stage at F2. For finger citron leaves, higher transcript levels of 18  AP2/ERFs were observed in young leave L1 than mature leave L2 ( Figure S6). Among the 169 members in the bHLH family, 58 genes were mainly expressed in fruit, 43 genes in flowers and 68 genes in leaves ( Figure S6). For fruit, 11  bHLHs had the highest expression level in young fruit at the S1 stage. During flower development, expression of 21  bHLHs increased from F1 to F2, while 22 members decreased. Of the  bHLHs mainly expressed in leaves, 58 genes had higher transcript abundance in young leaves L1 than mature leaves L2 ( Figure S6). A total of 76 bZIP members were identified in finger citron, where 31 (41%) members were mainly expressed in leaves ( Figure S6). For MYB family, 58 (37%) of the total 155 family members were enriched in flower tissue. A total of 44  MYBs exhibited higher transcript levels in young flower at F1 ( Figure S6). We observed that  NAC genes were enriched in flowers, where 52 (28%) members were expressed mainly in young flowers ( Figure S6). Nearly half of the  WRKYs (27 out of 66 genes) were enriched in fruit tissues. All of these TF expression profiles, together with those of the  TPS genes, were used for the gene co-expression analysis. 2.6. Analysis of Gene Correlation Network Both volatiles and genes showed dynamic changes in developing organs of finger citron. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to get a better understanding of the relationships between them and their place in the complex signaling networks regulating terpenoid metabolism. A total of 45 gene modules from the dynamic hierarchical tree cut were obtained after a series of matrix transformation procedures and network construction ( Figure 5). The largest module was Module Turquoise, containing 1954 genes, and the smallest, 30 genes each, was observed for Module Ivory and Module Floralwhite. To evaluate the biological importance of the modules, the Pearson correlation between Module eigengenes and external sample traits (in this case, volatile concentrations) [ 44] were calculated and visualized in  Figure 6. The most abundant two components (limonene and γ-terpinene) with the six characteristic components identified in  Figure 3C were selected as interesting traits. The terpene synthase gene numbers in each module are shown on the left. In  Figure 6, the 58  TPSs were assigned to 22 modules according to their transcript profiles. Finger citron  TPSs occurred in more than twenty modules. This result is predictable because  Figure 4 already implied a diversity of  TPS expression patterns. The modules with the highest number of  TPS genes were Module Red (11) Module Green (7) and Module Blue (5). In addition to the only sesquiterpene, β-bisabolene, the remaining volatiles showed similar correlation coefficients with a certain module. For example, the correlation coefficients between Module Red and seven monoterpenoids fell in a narrow interval (−0.62 to −0.52) and these monoterpenoids have similar accumulation patterns in finger citron tissues ( Figure 2). Module Red, Module Green and Module Blue were large modules, comprising 661, 707, and 1406 nodes, respectively. Connections of genes were hard to distinguish in the co-expression networks constructed on all nodes ( Figure S7). So, to get a better view of genes strongly correlated to  TPS genes, subnetworks were extracted from these three modules using TPSs as seed nodes. Subnetworks constructed from Module Red and Module Blue were visualized as  Figure 7 and  Figure 8, respectively. Although Module Blue is the largest of the three analyzed modules, no TF was identified in its subnetwork ( Figure S8). In these subnetworks, two categories of genes which are the main focus of this work:  TPS genes (red nodes) and transcription factors (blue nodes). Edges in figures indicate the interactions between the node gene and surrounding TFs in a module. The subnetwork of Module Red contains four  TPSs: Cm105420, Cm186730, Cm207000, and Cm269930 ( Figure 7). Cm186730 was located on the right of the network, while the other three genes gathered in the center. A total of five TFs were observed in this subnetwork. As a member of NAC family, Cm303080 was connected to two  TPSs, Cm207000 and Cm105420 ( Figure 7). These two  TPS genes were also connected to MYB family member Cm258540. The  TPS gene Cm105420, transcript levels were also suggested to be related to transcription factor C2H2 family member Cm279030 and G2-like family member Cm127980. For  TPS gene Cm269930, transcription factor CPP family Cm308600 was connected ( Figure 7,  Table S4). No transcription factors were observed to be connected to TPS Cm186730. Based the information in  Table S4, Cm070050, Cm269580, and Cm264610 were all predicted to be polygalacturonase genes. This result indicates that, terpenoid metabolism and cell wall metabolism appear to be related in this specific module.  There were six  TPSs (Cm310520, Cm252580, Cm074160, Cm257260, Cm116770, and Cm028750) in the Module Green subnetwork. Four of them clustered together, including Cm252580, Cm074160, Cm257260, and Cm116770.  TPS gene Cm257260 was connected to four TFs, including MYB family Cm028420, bHLH family Cm110180 and Cm027020, and ARR-B family Cm022190 ( Table S5). For the other two  TPS genes, Cm028750 was localized at the right edge, while Cm310520 on the left connected to 27 genes. Cm3102520, whose expression was suggested to be related to six TFs ( Figure 8). These six TFs included MIKC_MADS family Cm111830, ARR-B family Cm022190, AP2 family Cm215520, ARF family Cm061930, bHLH family Cm227880, and HD-ZIP family Cm175400 ( Table S5). Functions of other genes were also investigated ( Figure S5). There were genes predicted to participate in secondary metabolism: Cm112960 and Cm107930. Cm093530 and Cm023630 was related to hormone signal transduction. 2.7. Phylogenetic Tree Analysis of Finger Citron TPS The functions of the TPSs remained unknown, so we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on their amino acid sequences ( Figure 9) together with the Citrus TPS reported by Alquézar et al. In  Figure 9,  TPS genes in the phylogenetic tree were highlighted by red dots. Finger citron  TPS genes were assigned to four subfamilies: 20 in TPS-a, 18 in TPS-b, 2 in TPS-e/f, and 4 in TPS-g. Genes in the TPS-a subfamily are predicted to catalyze the formation of sesquiterpenes [ 12]. There were 20 finger citron  TPS belong to this subfamily. Genes in TPS-b usually encode proteins that function as monoterpene synthases. TPS-g is a clade closely related to TPS-b and there is evidence that monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes can be formed by genes from the TPS-g clade [ 10, 51]. Despite their diverse functions, they share the common feature that all their products are acyclic. There are two finger citron TPSs that belong to the e/f clade. To get a more precise prediction of finger citron TPS function, sequence identities compared with characterized  TPS genes from other  Citrus species were calculated and are summarized in  Figure S9. Since the correlated volatiles to Module Red and Module Green were monoterpenoids ( Figure 6), attention was paid to genes in TPS-b and g subfamilies. The extracted Subnetwork of Module Red contains 4  TPS genes. Cm269930 and Cm186730 shared 97.66% identity and they both belonged to TPS-b subfamily ( Figure 9). Cm269930 was the hub gene, highly connected node, in Module Red. Sequence analysis showed that Cm269930 shared high amino acid sequence identity with  C. unshiu γ-terpinene synthase BAD27258 (72.78%) and  C. limon γ-terpinene synthase AAM53943 (71.01%) ( Figure S9). Low sequence identity (29.26%–40.00%) was observed between Cm105420 and  Citrus TPSs ( Figure S9). Module Green contains 6  TPSs. TPS family member Cm310520 was ruled out for the phylogenetic analysis because of its inadequate length. Three members (Cm028750, Cm074160, and Cm257260) belong to TPS-b family. Sequence analysis showed that Cm257260 had 90.7% identity with  C. limon (+)-limonene synthase AAM53944 and  C. jambhiri limonene synthase BAF73932 ( Figure S9). Cm116700 and Cm252580 belong to TPS-a family ( Figure 9) and the Cm116700 sequence was 95.02% identical with  C. sinensis sesquiterpene synthases Cs4g12350 ( Figure S9). Cm028750 and Cm074160 sequence identities were less than 50% homolgous to  Citrus TPSs sequences. For three  TPS genes from Module Blue, Cm206970 and Cm279170 belong to TPS-a subfamily, while Cm107390 belong to TPS-g subfamily ( Figure 9). Sequence analysis revealed that Cm206970 and Cm279170 had 96.17% and 97.76% identity with  C. unshiu linalool synthase BAP75561, respectively ( Figure S9). For Cm107390, sequence identities to characterized  Citrus TPSs were less than 45%. These results indicated possible roles of finger citron TPSs from three Modules (Red, Green, and Blue) in biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids, although their functions need to be further investigated.","Finger citron ( Citrus medica  var.  sarcodactylis ) is a popular ornamental tree and an important source of essential oils rich in terpenoids, but the mechanisms behind volatile formation are poorly understood. We investigated gene expression changes combined with volatile profiling of ten samples from three developing organs: flower, leaf, and fruit. A total of 62 volatiles were identified with limonene and γ-terpinene being the most abundant ones. Six volatiles were identified using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) that could be used as markers for distinguishing finger citron from other citrus species. RNA-Seq revealed 1,611,966,118 high quality clean reads that were assembled into 32,579 unigenes. From these a total of 58 terpene synthase (TPS) gene family members were identified and the spatial and temporal distribution of their transcripts was measured in developing organs. Transcript levels of transcription factor genes  AP2/ERF  (251),  bHLH  (169),  bZIP  (76),  MYB  (155),  NAC  (184), and  WRKY  (66) during finger citron development were also analyzed. From extracted subnetworks of three modules constructed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), thirteen  TPS  genes and fifteen transcription factors were suggested to be related to volatile terpenoid formation. These results provide a framework for future investigations into the identification and regulatory network of terpenoids in finger citron.","['Citrus', 'Transcription factor', 'Limonene', 'Rna-seq', 'Wgcna', 'Γ-terpinene', 'Terpene Synthase Gene']","['Finger Citron', 'Figure', 'TPS genes', 'TPS', 'genes', 'TPS Gene', 'citron TPS', 'Citron', 'Finger', 'module']","[Citron, 260.77, S1A, VIP, VIP >, α-pinene, VIP, PLS-factors, VID-coefficients, VID-coefficient, VIP, VIP, Citron, 32,579, 3.57~15, Cm152440, Cm165980, DXS/Cm104830, MDS/ Cm051360, HDS/ Cm131750, HMGR, GGPP, TPS-Cluster1 to 4, TPS-Cluster1, Cm105420, Cm186730, Cm269930, Cm126620, Cm257250, Cm294730, Cm105550, Cm116860, Cm257230, TPS-Cluster2, TPS-Cluster3, TPS-Cluster4, Cm186720, Cm269920, Cm107350, S5, AP2/ERF, MYB [ 27, WRKY [ 29, bZIP [ 30, IDs, AP2/ERF, S5, AP2/ERF, S6, L1, L2 ( Figure S6, F2, bZIP, MYB, Green (7, −0.62, −0.52, Blue, Blue, Blue, Cm105420, Cm186730, Cm207000, Cm269930 (, Cm186730, Cm303080, Cm207000, Cm105420, MYB, Cm258540, Cm105420, Cm279030, G2-like, Cm127980, Cm269930, Cm308600, Cm186730, Cm070050, Cm269580, Cm264610, polygalacturonase, Cm310520, Cm252580, Cm074160, Cm257260, Cm116770, Cm252580, Cm074160, Cm257260, Cm116770, Cm257260, MYB, Cm028420, Cm110180, Cm027020, ARR-B, Cm022190, S5, Cm028750, Cm310520, Cm3102520, MIKC_MADS, Cm111830, ARR-B, Cm022190, AP2, Cm215520, ARF, Cm061930, bHLH, Cm227880, HD-ZIP, Cm175400, S5, Cm112960, Cm107930, Cm023630, Citron, Cm269930, Cm186730, Cm269930, Cm269930, Cm105420, Cm310520, Cm074160, Cm257260, Cm257260, AAM53944, Cm252580, Cm116700, Cs4g12350, Cm074160, Cm206970, Cm279170, Cm107390, Cm206970, Cm279170, BAP75561, Cm107390, Blue]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-Cluster1', 'TPS-Cluster1', 'TPS', 'TPS-Cluster2', 'TPS-Cluster3', 'TPS', 'TPS-Cluster4,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs:', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-e/f,', 'TPS-g.', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPSs', 'TPSs.', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-a', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-g', 'TPSs', 'TPSs']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']","['Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus']",terpene synthase
97,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6707142\eupmc_result.json,PMC6707142,"Results Justifying the construction of an orthogonal monoterpene pathway To justify the need for constructing an orthogonal pathway, we first confirmed that the low titers of monoterpene observed in previous efforts 14,  23 were not due to product toxicity, and that additional factors, such as pathway structure, may play an important role. We evaluated the growth of yeast cells engineered to provide high levels of isoprenoid precursors (strain AM94; Supplementary Table  1) under conditions that recapitulate production of specific titers of monoterpenes. In agreement with previous studies 31,  32, yeast cells grew equally well when supplemented with increasing monoterpene concentrations up to 500 mg L −1 (Supplementary Fig.  1), which was more than seven times higher than the current best-production titers 23. Subsequently, we introduced the  Citrus limon limonene synthase ( ClLimS) 33 into strain AM94 and confirmed that limonene productivity was not reduced, even when the culture was supplemented with a limonene concentration that was tenfold higher than the titer produced by the strain (Supplementary Fig.  2). To further corroborate previous evidence suggesting that the sequential reaction of Erg20p may be a contributing factor to low monoterpene productivity 14, we supplemented the cell extract of  ClLimS-expressing AM94 cells with isoprenoid precursors and measured the formation of limonene. Addition of GPP, in the presence of IPP and DMAPP, resulted in the production of low amounts of limonene and a significant larger amount of FPP (Supplementary Fig.  3). This suggested that most of the GPP precursor was used by Erg20p to synthesize FPP, and only a small amount of the GPP added was converted to limonene by  ClLimS (Supplementary Fig.  3). Further experiments using  13C-GPP confirmed that <10% of the  13C-GPP was converted to limonene under these conditions, and most of it was channeled to FPP. Therefore, Erg20p is very efficient in utilizing GPP, reducing the GPP pool and hindering monoterpene production. Thus, we set out to engineer an orthogonal pathway that does not depend on GPP. Establishing efficient NPP biosynthesis in yeast cells A cDNA fragment encoding  SlNPPS1 was cloned into the yeast vector pHTDHmyc under the P TDH3 constitutive promoter and expressed in strain AM94. To monitor NPP synthesis, we also introduced yeast codon-optimized versions of three different NPP-specific monoterpene synthases,  Solanum lycopersicum phellandrene synthase ( SlPHS1) 28,  Solanum habrochaites limonene synthase ( ShLimS) 30, and  S. habrochaites pinene synthase ( ShPinS) 30. When expressed in yeast in the absence of  SlNPPS1, no new products were detected, as none of the three monoterpene synthases were able to utilize the available GPP. However, upon  SlNPPS1 co-expression, all three synthases produced their reported NPP-derived products. Specifically,  SlPHS1 produced  β-phellandrene (48.6%), δ-2-carene (36.6%), α-phellandrene (8.3%), and α-terpinene (6.5%).  ShLimS produced limonene as a single product, and  ShPinS produced α-pinene (84%) and limonene (16%) (Fig.  2a). Product titers in all cases were very low, ranging from 0.009 mg L −1 α-pinene to 0.16 mg L −1β-phellandrene (Supplementary Table  2). Furthermore, we observed that AM94 cells engineered to express  SlNPPS1 in the absence of any monoterpene synthase produced detectable levels of nerol, as confirmed by comparison of mass spectra and retention time with an authentic standard (Fig.  2b). By analogy to the formation of geraniol via the hydrolysis of GPP by intracellular phosphatases like Lpp1p and Dpp1p 14,  34, we attributed the production of nerol to the hydrolysis of NPP that accumulated in the absence of a suitable terpene synthase. Taken together, these results confirmed that the alternative substrate, NPP, is synthesized in the engineered yeast strain and it can be used to produce monoterpenes. To ensure that NPP can form the basis for an orthogonal pathway, we confirmed that it did not interfere with the rest of the yeast isoprenoid metabolism. With a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we confirmed that NPP was not taken up by Erg20p to produce larger prenyl diphosphates. We expressed Erg20p in  Escherichia coli and used the purified protein (Supplementary Fig.  4) in in vitro assays with GPP and NPP. Although the recombinant enzyme was able to produce FPP from IPP and GPP, it was not able to catalyze elongation of NPP. We were also unable to detect any NPP-derived products of Erg20p in yeast cells or in yeast cell extracts supplemented with NPP and IPP (Supplementary Fig.  5). We also confirmed that the growth properties of  SlNPPS1-expressing yeast cells were very similar to their empty vector-containing counterparts (Supplementary Fig.  6). Redirecting flux to the orthogonal pathway The new branching point established for monoterpene biosynthesis could function as a valve to direct the flux of substrates away from FPP synthesis and to increase the monoterpene yield (Fig.  1). First, we aimed to decrease the competition for IPP by Erg20p. To achieve this, we introduced Erg20p(N127W), a dominant-negative Erg20p variant that inhibits the FPP synthesis step of the endogenous wild-type enzyme 14,  35. This resulted in a 3–4-fold increase (depending on the enzyme) in the total monoterpene yield of all three NPP-specific monoterpene synthases (Fig.  2c and Supplementary Table  2). Heterozygous gene deletions in yeast have been shown to decrease the level of the corresponding protein to 50% 36. Thus, to further reduce the flux through the FPP-synthesizing branch, we downregulated Erg20p by shifting to the yeast strain MIC2, which carries a deletion in one of the two  ERG20 alleles 14. This resulted in a further 1.9–2.8-fold increase in monoterpene titer (Fig.  2c and Supplementary Table  2). Previous studies had shown that fusion of a heterologous enzyme to Erg20p can be beneficial for the enzyme’s stability 37–  39. We fused  SlNPPS1 to the C terminus of Erg20p(N127W) and confirmed that the fused protein reached higher intracellular levels compared with the non-fused  SlNPPS1 (Supplementary Fig.  7). We subsequently introduced the Erg20p(N127W)– SlNPPS1 variant into strain MIC2 to achieve an additional 1.4–2-fold improvement in production. The combination of these interventions resulted in an overall 12–18-fold increase, reaching 2.7 mg L −1 β-phellandrene, 2.5 mg L −1 limonene, and 0.11 mg L −1 α-pinene (Fig.  2c and Supplementary Table  2). Following these improvements, a significant amount of nerol could be detected in the NPP-producing cells overexpressing  ShLimS,  ShPinS, or  SlPHS1 (Fig.  2d and Supplementary Table  3). This suggested that the combination of these interventions achieved efficient synthesis of NPP, but utilization of the alternative substrate has reached a bottleneck at the level of the monoterpene synthases that resulted in its accumulation and eventual conversion to nerol. Canonical monoterpene synthases accept NPP as a substrate The accumulation of nerol indicated that the three NPP-specific synthases tested here could not harvest the full potential of the orthogonal pathway, and more efficient biocatalysts were required. However, only few NPP-specific synthases have been reported to date 28,  30,  40, limiting the possibility that a search to identify enzymes more active than the synthases used here would be successful. Furthermore, the product range of the known NPP-specific enzymes was limited to only four main products, β-phellandrene 28, limonene 30, α-pinene 30, and nerol 40. To identify enzymes that are more active and to enable the production of a broad range of different monoterpene scaffolds, we turned into the rich resource of canonical, GPP-converting, plant monoterpene synthases. We selected five synthases with different product profiles, including  ClLimS 33,  Salvia fruticosa 1,8-cineole synthase ( SfCinS1) 41,  Salvia pomifera sabinene synthase ( SpSabS) 41,  Pinus taeda α-pinene synthase ( PtPinS) 42, and  Solanum elaeagnifolium camphene synthase ( SeCamS) 43, and tested whether they can accept NPP as a substrate. When introduced to strain MIC2 expressing Erg20p(N127W), i.e., a GPP-synthesizing strain, all five enzymes produced their expected monoterpene products (Fig.  3). When Erg20p(N127W) was replaced by the Erg20p(N127W)– SlNPPS1 fusion to establish the production of NPP, an overall increase ranging between 1.3- and 2.8-fold (depending on the enzyme) in monoterpene formation compared with the GPP-only producing strain was achieved with all canonical monoterpene synthases (Fig.  3). This suggested that the canonical enzymes could accept both substrates, resulting in overall higher yields, and that the different enzymes had varying capacity to accept the isomeric substrate. We confirmed that the selected monoterpene synthases were able to utilize NPP in in vitro assays with bacterially expressed enzymes (Supplementary Figs.  4 and  8a). We also examined the product profile of the five enzymes with NPP in vitro and found that four of them synthesized almost the same blend of monoterpenes as with GPP. Only the profile of  SeCamS shifted from camphene toward limonene with NPP in vitro (Fig.  3e; Supplementary Fig.  8a), which was reflected in the product profile of NPP-producing yeast cells expressing  SeCamS (Supplementary Fig.  8b). There was no new monoterpene product with any of the synthases and NPP. Kinetic analysis of the reaction with each isomeric substrate revealed that the canonical synthases exhibited higher affinity and overall catalytic efficiency ( kcatapp/ KMapp) with GPP than with NPP ( SfCinS1: 0.213 min −1 μM −1 with GPP vs. 0.137 min −1 μM −1 with NPP;  ClLimS: 0.735 min −1 μM −1 with GPP vs. 0.456 min −1 μM −1 with NPP;  SeCamS: 0.21 min −1 μM −1 with GPP vs. 0.044 min −1 μM −1 with NPP; Table  1). Yet, the observation that yeast productivity with  ClLimS and  PtPinS when both the GPP and the NPP pathways were present was more than double, compared with when only the GPP pathway was active (Fig.  3), provided two main conclusions. First, it indicated that these terpene synthases were not the limiting step of the pathway. Second, the ability of  ClLimS and  PtPinS to support equal or higher titers with NPP, despite this not being their preferred substrate, suggested that the established NPP-based pathway was efficient and had the potential to exceed the GPP pathway in productivity. To further evaluate the performance of the NPP-based pathway, we examined the kinetic characteristics of  SlNPPS1 using in vitro assays with enzymes expressed and purified in  E. coli (Supplementary Fig.  4). The determined kinetic parameters revealed that  SlNPPS1 is significantly less efficient than Erg20p in utilizing DMAPP and IPP (Supplementary Table  4; refs.  14, 28). Combined with the preference of canonical terpene synthases for GPP rather than NPP (Table  1), we concluded that the observed increase in productivity is not due to favorable kinetics of the  SlNPPS1 branch. The canonical monoterpene synthases convert GPP and NPP to the same blend of products (Supplementary Fig.  8), not allowing to determine the relative contribution of the two substrates simply by examining the product profile. To resolve this, we synthesized  13C-labeled NPP (Supplementary Fig.  9), so as to distinguish the products of each substrate when mixtures of the labeled compound with unlabeled GPP were used. We added precursors to extracts of yeast cells expressing  ClLimS and determined the isotopic composition of the produced limonene using GC–APCI–QqToF analysis. In these experiments,  13C-NPP was initially shown to be channeled efficiently to limonene synthesis, while GPP was mostly consumed to produce FPP (Supplementary Figs.  10 and  11). In subsequent competition experiments between  13C-labeled NPP and GPP, when the two isomeric substrates were added at equal concentrations, over 90% of the limonene produced originated from  13C-NPP. The contribution of the two substrates to limonene production was comparable, only when GPP was in tenfold excess (Supplementary Fig.  12a). Comparison of the overall production titers revealed that  ClLimS and  PtPinS were 24 and 224 times more efficient, respectively, in limonene and α-pinene synthesis in NPP-producing yeast cells than their NPP-specific counterparts,  ShLimS and  ShPinS (Supplementary Table  5). Taken together, these findings confirmed that canonical monoterpene synthases can serve as efficient surrogate synthases in this synthetic pathway and suggested that canonical enzymes could offer a starting point for protein engineering efforts to improve NPP utilization. Engineering NPP-specific monoterpene synthases To fully exploit the potential of the orthogonal pathway, we set out to engineer the selected canonical monoterpene synthases, with the aim to increase their efficiency and specificity for NPP. Initially, we focused on  SfCinS1 due to the availability of structural information and our previous experience in engineering this enzyme to alter its substrate and product specificity 41. In these efforts, we developed a library of 19 variants at different positions in the active site 39,  41. Here, we differentially screened this library in GPP- and NPP-producing yeast strains to identify sites that potentially influence substrate specificity. As shown in Fig.  4a, one site, F571, stood out as playing a critical role in selecting between the two isomeric substrates, as several variants at this position were able to markedly improve the performance of the enzyme with NPP. Variants  SfCinS1(F571V),  SfCinS1(F571Y), and  SfCinS1(F571I) were 18, 9, and 7 times more efficient, respectively, when the NPP pathway was present, compared with their performance with only GPP as a substrate (Fig.  4a). Although the catalytic efficiency of the variants was lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (Supplementary Table  6), these findings suggested that F571 may be acting as a switch that differentiates substrate preference between NPP and GPP. In addition to F571, certain substitutions in a second residue, N338, also resulted in shifts in specificity, albeit in a less efficient or consistent manner. Variants  SfCinS1(N338A) and  SfCinS1(N338S) exhibited an opposing substrate selectivity.  SfCinS1(N338A) became a strictly GPP-utilizing enzyme, while  SfCinS1(N338S) was 6.7 times more efficient when the NPP pathway was present (Fig.  4a). To test for potential synergistic effects, we also constructed several variants combining F571 substitutions with substitutions in the other positions (Supplementary Table  7). However, no further improvements in substrate specificity were observed (Fig.  4a). For further studies, we focused exclusively on the role of F571, because of the extent and consistency of specificity changes. Analysis of the structural information available for  SfCinS1 41 in the context of biochemical and structural studies on the enzymatic mechanism of monoterpene synthases 44 provided insight into the possible role of F571. As shown in Fig.  4b, the early steps of the canonical monoterpene synthase mechanism involve the initial binding of GPP in an extended conformation, followed by the ionization of the substrate and the syn migration of the diphosphate moiety to C-3. The resulting linalyl diphosphate (LPP) maintains the transoid conformation of GPP (Fig.  4b). Thus, for cyclization to take place, the C-2,3 bond must rotate to convert LPP from the transoid to the cisoid conformer. Subsequent conformational change of LPP to the closed configuration brings C-6 and C-1 to a position competent for cyclization. Following cyclization, the resulting carbocations rearrange to finally yield different hydrocarbons (Fig.  4b). Due to the cisoid conformation of NPP, its cyclization does not require the same transition from the transoid to the cisoid form (Fig.  4b). As shown in Fig.  4b, in the structure of  SfCinS1, F571 is positioned at a short distance from C-1 of LPP. This analysis suggested two possible explanations for the ability of F571 to control isomeric substrate selectivity. Considering the extensive conformational changes that are required for the substrate to transition from the transoid to the cisoid form (compare the structure of the two intermediate analogs in Fig.  4b), one scenario would be that F571 plays a direct role in this process. In this case, substitutions in F571 that impair the transoid to cisoid transition would have a negative impact in the GPP-based reaction, but would not interfere with the transition-independent NPP reaction. Alternatively, F571 may not be directly involved in the transition process; instead, the size and orientation of the side chain at position 571 may alter the geometry of the active site to favor binding of one substrate versus the other. To distinguish between these two mechanisms, we conducted a detailed kinetic analysis of  SfCinS1 mutants.  SfCinS1(F571V),  SfCinS1(F571Y), and  SfCinS1(F571L) showed shifts in  KMapp either favoring NPP binding or disfavoring binding of GPP (Table  1), suggesting that the residue at position 571 exerts stereochemical control. In agreement, the reverse behavior of  SfCinS1(F571H), which showed preference for GPP in vivo, was the result of a significant increase in  KMapp for NPP. We explored whether residues analogous to F571 in the other canonical monoterpene synthases play a similarly critical role. Based on amino acid sequence alignment (Supplementary Fig.  13), candidate residues in the other monoterpene synthases were identified and substituted with aromatic or aliphatic side chains of different size using site-directed mutagenesis (Supplementary Table  7). As shown in Fig.  5, in all four enzymes tested, we were able to identify variants at this position that shift substrate selectivity to NPP. Specifically, in  ClLimS, all H570 variants showed higher preference for NPP than the wild-type enzyme in the yeast system (Fig.  5a, left panel). Among them,  ClLimS(H570Y) and  ClLimS(H570F) also achieved improved performance in NPP-based monoterpene production in yeast (Fig.  5a, right panel). In  ClLimS(H570Y), this was the result of a twofold improvement on the catalytic efficiency ( kcatapp/ KMapp) with NPP, which was mostly due to a lower  KMapp with NPP and a decreased  kcatapp with GPP (Table  1). In the case of  ClLimS(H570F), the higher overall productivity in the yeast system was the result of improved binding of both substrates.  ClLimS(H570I),  ClLimS(H570L), and  ClLimS(H570V) were even more specific for NPP (Fig.  5a, left panel), as manifested by an eightfold higher  kcatapp/ KMapp in  ClLimS(H570I) and a threefold higher  kcatapp/ KMapp in  ClLimS(H570L) (Table  1). However, the overall efficiency of these variants was low and could not sustain high-product titers (Fig.  5a, right panel; Table  1). We evaluated  ClLimS(H570Y) in competition experiments using yeast extracts and  13C-NPP.  ClLimS(H570Y) was markedly more efficient than wild-type  ClLimS in harvesting NPP fluxes, and even when GPP was present at a tenfold excess over  13C-NPP, over 75% of the products were derived from  13C-NPP (Supplementary Fig.  11b). In  SpSabS, substitution of H561 with F resulted in a highly efficient biocatalyst, with an almost threefold improved apparent specificity for NPP in yeast compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig.  5b, left panel) and an overall 2.5-fold improvement in performance when the NPP pathway was present (Fig.  5b; right panel). We were not able to obtain active recombinant  SpSabS(H561F) to determine the kinetic parameters underlying these improvements. In the case of  SeCamS, substitution of H583 resulted in drastic changes in specificity and activity. Variants  SeCamS(H583F) and  SeCamS(H583V) became limonene-synthesizing enzymes that exhibited three -times higher apparent selectivity for NPP compared to wild-type  SeCamS (Fig.  5c, left panel). These two variants improved overall NPP-based production in yeast by 11 and 9 times, respectively (Fig.  5c, right panel and Fig.  5e). Finally, in  PtPinS, four out of five variants of F607 switched specificity to NPP in the yeast system (Fig.  5d), nevertheless, with lower activity than the parental enzyme. Overall, these results revealed a conserved role for F571 in  SfCinS1, and the corresponding residues in the other synthases, in dictating substrate selectivity. The identification of such a key residue in the terpene synthase active site reveals fundamental mechanistic details of these enzymes and will be invaluable for future protein engineering efforts aiming to expand the synthetic pathway developed here with additional synthases. Improving titers and enabling downstream oxidation steps Using the NPP-specific synthases developed here, we were able to harvest the orthogonal pathway established to produce monoterpenes with considerably higher efficiency than only with the GPP-dependent pathway. In shake-flask batch cultivation of strain MIC2 expressing the Erg20p(N127W)- SlNPPS1 fusion, the  ClLimS(H570Y)-supported limonene titer reached 130 mg L −1, while  SpSabS(H561F) enabled the production of 72.7 mg L −1 sabinene (Supplementary Table  8). Furthermore, the engineered synthases were quite efficient in harvesting NPP, leading to a significant reduction in nerol production from excess NPP (Supplementary Table  8). Engineering efficient monoterpene scaffold production in yeast is of particular interest because yeast cells offer an advantage over prokaryotic hosts for the functional expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are required for the synthesis of more complex monoterpenoids. So far, low monoterpene titers have hindered efficient P450 catalyzed oxidation of monoterpenes by a yeast cell factory. We evaluated whether the overall improvements obtained here were sufficient to enable downstream oxidation steps by introducing the sabinene hydroxylase CYP750B1 45 from  T. plicata, together with a compatible cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase 38,  46, to establish production of  trans-sabin-3-ol. While production of  trans-sabin-3-ol was not detectable when only the GPP pathway was used, we were able to synthesize detectable amounts of  trans-sabin-3-ol in the NPP-producing MIC2 strain using wild-type  SpSabS. The levels of  trans-sabin-3-ol increased three times when the NPP-specific  SpSabS(H561F) variant was used instead of  SpSabS (Fig.  5f; Supplementary Fig.  14). Dynamic regulation of the orthogonal pathway The metabolic valve created at the point of DMAPP and IPP condensation can be dynamically controlled to divert fluxes towards NPP in response to internal metabolite levels. A key metabolite in our system is ergosterol, the main yeast sterol. To minimize flux to the sterol branch when adequate levels of ergosterol were synthesized, we implemented a dynamic design based on the promoter of the  ERG1 gene. Expression of  ERG1 is negatively regulated by ergosterol via an ergosterol-responsive regulatory element in its promoter (P ERG1) 47. A similar design was previously exploited to improve production of the sesquiterpene amorpha-4,11-diene by controlling  ERG948, and of the diterpene casbene by controlling both the  ERG9 and  ERG20 genes 49. To dynamically regulate FPP synthesis in response to ergosterol levels in our system, we replaced the promoter of  ERG20 in strain MIC2 with an 807 bp region of P ERG1 that contains the ergosterol-responsive element to give rise to strain MIC3. Using the engineered NPP-specific synthases and strain MIC3, we were able to produce monoterpenes with considerably higher efficiency than with the native GPP-based pathway. In semi-batch shake-flask cultivation,  ClLimS(H570Y)-supported limonene titer in MIC3 strain reached 166 mg L −1, which is 6.8-times higher than the titer obtained in GPP-only producing MIC2 cells with wild-type  ClLimS (Fig.  5e and Table  2). Similarly, with  SpSabS(H561F), we obtained 113 mg L −1 sabinene under dynamic regulation (MIC3), which was 7.1 times higher than the highest titer obtained in MIC2 by the native pathway and  SpSabS (Fig.  5e and Table  3).","Synthetic biology efforts for the production of valuable chemicals are frequently hindered by the structure and regulation of the native metabolic pathways of the chassis. This is particularly evident in the case of monoterpenoid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the canonical terpene precursor geranyl diphosphate is tightly coupled to the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds essential for yeast viability. Here, we establish a synthetic orthogonal monoterpenoid pathway based on an alternative precursor, neryl diphosphate. We identify structural determinants of isomeric substrate selectivity in monoterpene synthases and engineer five different enzymes to accept the alternative substrate with improved efficiency and specificity. We combine the engineered enzymes with dynamic regulation of metabolic flux to harness the potential of the orthogonal substrate and improve the production of industrially-relevant monoterpenes by several-fold compared to the canonical pathway. This approach highlights the introduction of synthetic metabolism as an effective strategy for high-value compound production.",NaN,"['Supplementary Fig.', 'Supplementary Table', 'Fig.', 'NPP', 'Supplementary', 'GPP', 'monoterpene synthases', 'Table', 'monoterpene', 'synthases']","[−1, Erg20p, DMAPP, Erg20p, Erg20p, pHTDHmyc, TDH3, ShLimS, ShPinS, NPP-derived, α-pinene, −1, intracellular phosphatases like Lpp1p, Dpp1p 14, Erg20p, Erg20p, NPP-derived, Erg20p, Erg20p, Erg20p(N127W, 3–4-fold, Erg20p, MIC2, 1.9–2.8-fold, Erg20p, C, Erg20p(N127W, Erg20p(N127W)– SlNPPS1, MIC2, 12–18-fold, −1, −1, −1 α-pinene, NPP-specific, NPP-specific enzymes, α-pinene, α-pinene synthase, MIC2, Erg20p(N127W, GPP-synthesizing, Erg20p(N127W, Erg20p(N127W)– SlNPPS1, GPP-only, −1 μM −1, −1 μM −1, −1 μM −1, −1 μM −1, −1 μM −1, −1 μM −1, NPP-based, NPP-based, Erg20p, DMAPP, GC–, α-pinene, NPP-specific, GPP-, NPP-producing yeast, GPP-based, H570, NPP (Fig.  , high-product, H561, H583, NPP-based, 9, NPP-specific, GPP-dependent, MIC2, Erg20p(N127W)- SlNPPS1, −1, −1, cytochrome P450, P450, plicata, cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, NPP-producing MIC2, DMAPP, sterol branch, ergosterol-responsive regulatory, MIC2, ERG1, MIC3, MIC3, GPP-based, MIC3, −1, 6.8-times, GPP-only, MIC2 cells, −1, MIC3, MIC2]",[],[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
98,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6742361\eupmc_result.json,PMC6742361,"Results Variation in terpene profile across cultivars To better understand how terpene content varies across  C.  sativa flower bound for the dispensary market in Washington state, GC-MS data for flower samples was filtered for samples with more than 0.5% total terpene to yield 475 samples. These were aggregated by cultivar to give a final data set of 240 cultivars. Note that while this data set represents a broad range of C. sativa samples, Jamaican Lion and Purple Kush (the source, respectively, of the assembly and transcriptome data we are using) are not in this set, so no direct correlations can be made between the oil profile data and the expression results shown below. This data set was used to construct a heat map of the twenty most abundant terpenes ( Fig 1). The heatmap has been ordered with the most abundant terpene (β-myrcene) at the top, and hierarchical clustering on the normalized and mean-centered columns (cultivars). This clustering brings together similar profiles and shows some of the patterns in terpene profile. Starting with overall terpene profile, while typically one or two terpenes dominate a particular sample, the terpene profile in  C.  sativa flowers tends to be complex, with an average of 11.2 terpenes present at above 1% of total terpene content, and 5.4 present at above 5% of the total terpenes ( S1 Fig). The dominant terpene on average constitutes just 35% of total terpene, and it’s rare, at least in this data set, for a single terpene to constitute more than 50% of total terpene. On average, the top four terpenes comprise just 72% of the total. The clustering shown in  Fig 1 suggests it would be possible to identify chemovars based on terpene profile, just grouping cultivars by the one or two most abundant terpenes. However, differences between cultivar profiles are more complex than this, and a simple classification scheme may miss potentially important variation. One of the driving features of this variability is the dynamic range of individual terpenes. Terpinolene, for example, a cyclic monoterpene with a very distinctive smell, is present at less than 0.01% fresh weight in 86% of the cultivars shown here, but in the remaining 14% of cultivars, it is either the dominant terpene, or close to it. A possible explanation for this would be to posit that there are two enzymes in  C.  sativa that produce terpinoline. The first makes terpinolene as it’s primary product, but a second enzyme produces terpinolene as a minor side product, accounting for the background level of terpinolene found in most cultivars. While variability in concentration is most pronounced with terpinolene, it is apparent across the full set of terpenes shown here. In fact, each of the top five terpenes (β-myrcene, α-pinene, D-limonene, β-caryophyllene and terpinolene) vary from being the single most abundant terpene in a cultivar to being a minor component, or in some cases not detectable. The less abundant terpenes, such as the acyclic monoterpenes β- and cis-ocimene (made by TPS6 and TPS13, respectively, [ 7]), or the acyclic sesquiterpenes α-and β-farnesene, also vary from undetectable levels to being major components in other cultivars. Another pattern visible in the heatmap is that some terpenes follow each other’s concentration very closely. The most visually obvious example of this is β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, plotted against each other in  Fig 2A. Data points are scattered around the regression line consistent with sample variability and perhaps measurement error, but there is a strong linear relationship (R^2 = 0.92). TPS9 has been shown to produce a mixture of β-caryophyllene and α-humulene at a ratio of about 2.5:1 [ 7]. In our data this ratio is 3.2:1, which is close enough to the  in vitro result that it could just represent the difference between  in vitro and  in vivo environments.  Fig 2B–2F show linear relationships between the rest of the top six most highly correlated terpene pairs. The linear relationship between the cyclic monoterpenes α-and γ-terpinene can be explained by the fact that TPS33 has been shown to make these two molecules in approximately equal proportions [ 7]. These striking linear relationships arise when molecules share a common enzymatic source, but correlation may be degraded when there are multiple enzymatic sources for a pair of molecules. The larger scale correlation structure of the data set is shown in the correlation plot in  Fig 3. Certain correlations like β-caryophyllene and α-humulene stand out, but some examples of lack of correlation are also informative. For example, β-myrcene is fairly independent in the correlation plot, with just a modest correlation to β-pinene (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.56). So far, two enzymes have been characterized that produce β-myrcene as sole product, TPS3 and TPS30 [ 7], which would lead you to suspect β-myrcene should be fairly isolated. But TPS5, which is a highly expressed gene in Purple Kush (see  Fig 4 below), has been shown to produce approximately equal amounts of β-myrcene and α-pinene [ 7]. This would seem sufficient to account for the amount of correlation we see. Further, many cyclic monoterpene synthases produce small amounts of β-myrcene as a side product [ 1]. The  C.  sativa β-pinene synthase is as yet unidentified, but it is common for α-and β-pinene synthases in other species to produce some amount of β-myrcene as a by-product [ 20]. Cis-ocimene is produced as a single product by TPS13 [ 7], and shows no correlation to other terpenes ( Fig 3). The cluster including terpinolene, α-and γ-terpinene, carene and α-phellandrene would be consistent with a yet to be identified terpinolene synthase enzyme that produces this whole group. This fits with current knowledge because all of these molecules could arise from the same carbocation intermediate [ 6], and are frequently seen as byproducts of synthases that make terpinolene, either as primary product or a byproduct [ 20, 21]. Terpene synthase family structure and genomic organization Twelve  C.  sativa TPS genes have been functionally characterized and described at the cDNA level, and in the same study about half of the TPS family was detected at least as an initial sequence similarity hit [ 7]. We conducted exhaustive reference protein-based gene discovery using a Jamaican Lion assembly, with a total size of 1.06 gb and an N50 of 2.6 mb. Our strategy started with blast searches to identify gene containing regions, followed by exonerate searches with the most similar reference TPS sequence as query in order to estimate gene models. This approach yielded 65 candidate genes which were filtered to remove those with multiple frameshifts, or that were otherwise fragmentary. This left 55 complete or essentially complete genes for further analysis. The total number of active TPS genes in  C.  sativa may be higher than this since some cultivars may carry active versions of genes we omitted for frameshifts, or because of gaps in the current genome builds, but given the relative completeness of this assembly, we expect this to represent all or most of the family.  Fig 4 shows a neighbor joining tree calculated from this set of 55 predicted proteins with ClustalW2 [ 22], with a bar plot on the right side of the figure showing expression in the Purple Kush RNA-Seq data set [ 13]. While product profile cannot yet be predicted from protein sequence [ 6], based on protein similarity we can classify by family, using the characterized TPS1 limonene synthase sequence from  C.  sativa [ 12] and the  Mentha spicata limonene synthase [ 23] as exemplars for classification of the TPS-b family, and the characterized TPS9 β-caryophyllene / α-humulene synthase from  C.  sativa [ 7] and the  Abies grandis γ-humulene synthase as exemplars for identification of TPS-a family members. The exemplar for the TPS-c family was KSG_ARATH, the  Arabidopsis ent-kaur-16-ene synthase. The TPS-a family is primarily responsible for sesquiterpene synthesis, TPS-b accounts for monoterpene synthesis and TPS-c accounts for diterpene synthesis [ 10]. These categories are labelled in the tree. The C. sativa TPS family breaks down into 26 TPS-b monoterpene synthases, 21 TPS-a sesquiterpene synthases and four TPS-c diterpene synthases. To get an idea of the sequence diversity of this family, the complete set of pairwise comparisons of the protein sequences was carried out with BLASTP to create a distance matrix. This family is extremely diverse with just 2% of pairwise comparisons having greater than 90% amino acid identity, and the median pairwise identity at just 42%. 54 of these genes had detectable transcripts in the Purple Kush RNA-Seq data set. Total expression in Purple Kush is dominated by just a few genes TPS1, TPS18 and TPS5, but there are 16 genes each accounting for at least 1% of total transcription, and 23 accounting for at least 0.5% of total TPS gene expression. While we lack detailed terpene profile data for Purple Kush, a pattern of expression like this, where a small number of synthases dominate, but the total set of expressed synthases is reasonably large would fit well with the oil profile data we report for dispensary bound samples. About half of the identified genes are in genomic arrays of various sizes, primarily containing closely related genes. These arrays are shown as blue bars on the dendrogram in  Fig 4. The largest TPS cluster contains 11 TPS-b genes, including characterized genes TPS1, TPS2, TPS3 and TPS33, spread over about a megabase, with sections of intervening unrelated genes. This would appear to be the oldest array, as on average these genes share just 66% identity, but there are three pairs of genes in this array that are nearly identical, suggesting more recent local duplications. There are two arrays of five genes each, one containing TPS-a genes, and the other TPS-b genes. The first of these spans 135kB, and contains four closely related sesquiterpene synthases, sharing an average of 90% amino acid identity, and including TPS8 (the γ-eudesmol, valencene synthase [ 7]), and a fifth gene, TPS32, that is slightly more distant at around 81% identity. From a sequence similarity standpoint, TPS7 would be expected to be found in this cluster, but no convincing candidate was found in the Jamaican Lion, Pineapple Banana Bubba Kush (GenBank accession GCA_002090435.1) or Cannatonic (GenBank accession GCA_001865755.1) contigs. The TPS7 gene is clearly expressed, however, in Purple Kush ( Fig 4), so failure to find a copy is most likely due to the incomplete nature of the genome assemblies. The second of these five gene arrays spans 225kB and includes TPS5, a β-myrcene / α-pinene synthase [ 7] and, four uncharacterized monoterpene synthases. These four are nearly identical (on average 97% identical at the protein level), and they have very similar gene structure, with seven coding exons separated by unusually compact introns, a 5’ UTR in a separate exon, and 3’ UTR in the last exon ( Fig 5). At 2650 bp in length, these are the shortest terpene synthase genes in  C.  sativa. Lastly they all show root specific expression in the Purple Kush data set (see below,  Fig 6). TPS5, on the other hand, is on average 73% identical to the four root specific synthases, is one of the longer TPS genes at about 8500 bp, including UTRs, and has a very different expression pattern (see below,  Fig 6). Interestingly, the first three coding exons are very similar both structurally and in terms of protein sequence across the entire set of five, with the length difference resulting from large additions into the last four introns. RNA-Seq expression analysis To assess tissue specific expression we used the Purple Kush RNA-Seq data [ 13], comprising samples from six tissues: root, stem, shoot, pre-flower, early flower, and midflower. This sample set contains no biological replicates for the tissue samples, so no statistical analysis can be done here, but large differences in fragment count can still be judged to be biologically significant. As discussed in Methods, sequence divergence between Purple Kush and Jamaican Lion was estimated at 0.36%, which is certainly compatible with accurate fragment alignment. Purple Kush reads were mapped onto a cDNA set representing the 55 predicted TPS genes using HISAT2 [ 24], and converted to RPMK values with the R ballgown module [ 14]. A heatmap of the 48 most abundant transcripts is shown in  Fig 6. Looking at total gene expression across the six tissue types, almost 45% of TPS gene expression occurs in the mid flower sample, while about 10% of expression occurs in roots. Transcripts are detected for 54 genes, but the top five TPS1, TPS5, TPS18, TPS7, TPS14 constitute about 70% of total TPS gene expression (this set includes synthases for D-limonene, β-myrcene and γ-eudesmol, [ 7]). One or two tissues tend to dominate expression for any given TPS, with the top tissue on average accounting for about 60% of total expression. The expression patterns fall into six clades, one for each of the six tissues in this data set, with the root specific set being the largest and having the highest degree of tissue specificity. Of the 23 genes expressed in root, ten show highly root-specific expression, meaning that roots account for greater than 80% of total expression (six of these roots are 100% root specific). TPS6, the β-ocimene synthase is the only functionally characterized synthase in this set, but nine out of the ten are TPS-b genes and thus expected to be monoterpene synthases. The flower specific clade (combining genes most highly expressed in early and mid-flower samples) accounts for most of the total expression, but these genes show less pronounced specificity than the root specific set. 44 genes have at least some expression in mid-flower plus early flower. These are a mix of mono- and sesquiterpene synthases (either demonstrated or predicted based on sequence similarity). Gene structure Gene models for 53 substantially complete terpene synthases (manually curated by combining Exonerate and StringTie outputs) are shown in  Fig 7. In terms of exon structure, the  C.  sativa TPS family shows consistent patterns that are highly conserved across angiosperms, gymnosperms, and even bryophytes [ 1, 25] The TPS-a and TPS-b subfamilies, encoding sesquiterpene and monoterpene synthases respectively, tend very strongly to have seven exons, (sometimes containing 5’- or 3’-UTRs in separate exons). Members of the TPS-c family, which is primarily responsible for diterpenes, typically have 15 exons [ 1], similar to what we observe. While the overall exon/intron structure in the  C.  sativa TPS family is conserved, gene sizes vary across a nearly eightfold range from TPS37 at 2223 bp to TPS4-like at almost 19 kbp. Most of this variation comes from intron size, from the very compact TPS37 at 135% of coding sequence length, to TPS4-like at 1150% of coding length. The average intron size for the TPS synthase genes is 984 bp with a median of 673 bp, but many of these genes have one or two exceptionally large introns. 70% of these genes have at least one intron longer than 1000 bp, and 11 have an intron longer than 5000 bp (the longest is in TPS4-like at 8672 bp). To investigate whether these introns are unusually long we needed to know more about the distribution of intron sizes in  C.  sativa. This is still a largely unannotated genome, so we constructed a high confidence reference guided transcriptome as described in the methods, requiring a read depth of 200 to call an intron junction. This yielded 10,913 transcripts across 9,173 genes with a median coverage of 730 reads. In total, this yields 80,229 introns, with an overall median length of 147 bp, and the most common length (or mode) at 88 bp. This is a highly skewed distribution, with 65% of introns shorter than 250 bp, but less common introns as large as 10 kbp (the maximum length cutoff set for this transcriptome assembly). A recently available assembly of the  C.  sativa genome includes annotation using a more comprehensive approach than we’ve used here, [ 26] and analysis of their annotation shows essentially the same overall intron length distribution. Finally, we compared the longest intron in each TPS gene against the longest introns per gene across the entire transcriptome. The length distribution for the longest introns is shown in  Fig 8 (median = 713 bp, mean = 1030 bp), with the longest TPS introns shown as red arrows. The mean length for the longest TPS introns, 2424 bp, is in the top 11% of longest introns across the whole transcriptome, and some TPS introns are among the longest in  C.  sativa. Active site variation Both the monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase active sites have been extensively studied through crystallographic, mutational, and functional activity assays [ 6]. For example, using the crystal structure of the  Mentha spicata D-limonene synthase 2ONH [ 26], alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to show that only residues within 5 angstroms of the substrate had a strong impact on enzyme output. The 24 monoterpene synthases identified in this study were aligned to the  Mentha spicata 2ONH sequence, and the aligned active site residues are shown in  Fig 9. Both the monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase active sites contain a set of completely conserved residues that, when mutated, result in complete loss of enzymatic activity [ 10]. The rest of the active site consists of highly variable positions, or plasticity residues, mutation of which can lead to a change in product profile of the enzyme [ 4, 8, 9, 27]. These are indicated in  Fig 9. Known major products from the published  C.  sativa characterization work are shown on the right hand side of the figure [ 7, 12]. Fig 10 shows an alignment of the active site residues from 25 sesquiterpene synthases, aligned to the  Abies grandis γ-humulene synthase (AAC05728), where similar studies, including a crystal structure and mutagenesis experiments have been done [ 8, 9]. There are several sets of two or even three of the  C.  sativa synthases that are identical for this set of active site residues, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they make the same products. Although TPS4 and TPS9 have identical active site residues, and are 97% identical at the protein level, TPS4 makes primarily alloaromadendrene with side products including α-humulene, while TPS9 produces β-caryophyllene and α-humulene [ 7].","Terpenes are responsible for most or all of the odor and flavor properties of Cannabis sativa, and may also impact effects users experience either directly or indirectly. We report the diversity of terpene profiles across samples bound for the Washington dispensary market. The remarkable degree of variation in terpene profiles ultimately results from action of a family of terpene synthase genes, only some of which have been described. Using a recently available genome assembly we describe 55 terpene synthases with genomic context, and tissue specific expression. The family is quite diverse from a protein similarity perspective, and subsets of the family are expressed in all tissues in the plant, including a set of root specific monoterpene synthases that could well have agronomic importance. Ultimately understanding and breeding for specific terpene profiles will require a good understanding of the gene family that underlies it. We intend for this work to serve as a foundation for that.",NaN,"['Purple Kush', 'Fig', 'genes', 'TPS', 'TPS genes', 'TPS gene', 'terpene', 'set', 'data set', 'gene']","[’s, ’s, α-pinene, β-, TPS6, TPS13, α-and, ’s, 2A, β-caryophyllene, 2B–2F, TPS33, TPS3, TPS30 [ 7, TPS5, α-pinene [ 7], α-and, TPS13 [ 7, α-and γ-terpinene, TPS1, grandis γ-humulene synthase, TPS-a, KSG_ARATH, TPS1, TPS5, TPS1, TPS2, TPS3, TPS33, TPS-a, TPS32, TPS7, TPS7, 225kB, TPS5, α-pinene synthase [ 7, ’, TPS5, TPS, UTRs, pre-flower, midflower, HISAT2 [ 24], TPS1, TPS5, TPS7, TPS14, γ-eudesmol, root-specific, TPS6, mid-flower, StringTie, 5’-, 3’-UTRs, TPS37, TPS4-like, TPS37, TPS4-like, 80,229, grandis γ-humulene synthase, AAC05728, n’t, TPS4, TPS9]","['TPS6', 'TPS13,', 'TPS9', 'TPS33', 'TPS3', 'TPS30', 'TPS5,', 'TPS13', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS1', 'TPS-b', 'TPS9', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-c', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-c', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-c', 'TPS1,', 'TPS18', 'TPS5,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS1,', 'TPS2,', 'TPS3', 'TPS33,', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPS8', 'TPS32,', 'TPS7', 'TPS7', 'TPS5,', 'TPS5,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS1,', 'TPS5,', 'TPS18,', 'TPS7,', 'TPS14', 'TPS', 'TPS,', 'TPS6,', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-c', 'TPS', 'TPS37', 'TPS4-like', 'TPS37', 'TPS4-like', 'TPS', 'TPS4-like', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS4', 'TPS9', 'TPS4', 'TPS9']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']",[],terpene synthase
99,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6804824\eupmc_result.json,PMC6804824,"Results Analysis and identification of novel floral scents from new  Lilium hybrids and cultivars Previous studies of lily fragrances have compared faint-scented or strong-scented flowers from a few different lily types, including OT hybrids “Belladonna”, “Conca D’ Or”, “Robina”, and “Yelloween”; Oriental hybrids “Marco Polo”, “Siberia”, “Sorbonne”, “Sunshine Borland”, “Love story”, “Pink Champion”, “Santander”, and “Tarrango”; Longiflorum hybrid “White Heaven”; Asiatic hybrids “Tresor”, “White Wizard”, and “Red Wizard”; and LA hybrids “Music” and “Ceb Dazzle” 14,  17,  18. In recent years, Trumpet hybrids, LO hybrids, and other new cultivars with distinct fragrances have become available. In this study, 41 cultivars of 12 different types (Table  1) were analyzed for volatile emissions, including 38 accessions that have not been investigated previously. A total of 46 individual volatile compounds were identified, ranging from 8 volatile components for “Pearl Melanie” to 34 components for “Regale album” (Supplementary Table  1). Of those components, 16 were identified for the first time in lilies, while the remainder had been identified in previous studies. Most newly identified compounds were either sesquiterpenes or derived from fatty acids (Supplementary Table  1). Grouping of lily cultivars based on their fragrance Each cultivar has a particular floral scent profile. There are 16 scent compounds that are considered major scent components and whose relative amounts are >10% in some accessions, including 5 monoterpenoids ((E)- β-ocimene, myrcene,  α-pinene, eucalyptol, and linalool), 1 sesquiterpene (caryophyllene), 3 benzenoids (methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, and toluene), 1 phenylpropanoid-related (naphthalene), and 6 fatty acid-derived compounds (3-hexen-1-ol, methyl 2-methylbutyrate, methyl tiglate, methyl hexanoate, methyl octanoate, and 2-ethenyl-1,1-dimethyl-3-methylenecyclohexane) (Supplementary Table  1). Methyl benzoate was the only component detected in all accessions. (E)- β-ocimene, naphthalene, and methyl 2-methylbutyrate were detected in 39 accessions. Myrcene was also widely detected in 36 accessions (Supplementary Table  1). Major scent compounds were classified into five groups (herbal, fruity, cool, floral, and spicy) based on their odor descriptions (Supplementary Table  2), and the scents of cultivars were classified into six groups based on the ratios of total amounts of scent compounds for each group (Table  2). Group 1, Faint scented Group 1, which had hardly any scent, comprised 14 cultivars, mainly belonging to Asiatic hybrids and AT hybrids. Although some important scent compounds such as linalool and methyl benzoate were detected in some cultivars (e.g., “Tiny Diamond”, “Levi”, “Rossella’s Dream”, and “Pearl Loraine”), most humans are unable to detect any fragrance from these flowers by nose, although a few subjects in this study were able to detect a faint fragrance from flowers of “Pink Flavour”, “Lady Alice”, “Surrender”, “Fusion”, and “Bright Diamond”, which had relatively high levels of methyl benzoate and (E)- β-ocimene. Group 2, Cool Group 2 had a weak scent with a cooling nuance and contained four cultivars, “Robert Swanson”, “Beverly Dreams”, “Mister Right”, and “Mister Cass”. All of these cultivars, which are TO hybrids, emitted a high percentage of eucalyptol and exhibited notable morphological characteristics, with dark green leaves and crooked stems, especially in young plants. Group 3, Fruity Group 3, consisting of “White Heaven”, “Golden Stone”, “Brindisi”, and “Pavia”, had a light fresh fruit odor, and methyl benzoate was the major scent compound. “White Heaven” is a Longiflorum hybrid, and the other three cultivars are LA hybrids. Compared to the other cultivars, “Pavia” had a high level of linalool in addition to methyl benzoate, which produced a fresh fruit scent with a floral note. Group 4, Musky Group 4 comprised of seven cultivars, five Trumpet hybrids (“Pink Perfection”, “Orange Planet”, “Golden Splendor”, “Regale Album”, “Regale”), one TA hybrid (“Night Rider”), and one OT hybrid (“Manissa”). All of those cultivars had a musky odor derived from high levels of eucalyptol and methyl benzoate, which many people find distasteful, especially in a confined space. Group 5, Fruity-honey Nine cultivars belonging to the OT and LO hybrids had fruity-honey odors with relatively high levels of methyl benzoate. “Triumphator” and “White Triumphator” had relatively high levels of methyl 2-methylbutyrate in addition to high levels of methyl benzoate, contributing a fruity and sweet odor. “Bell Song”, “Pink Brilliant”, and “Pink Heaven” had methyl benzoate and linalool as the major scent compounds, in addition to (E)- β-ocimene and myrcene. Linalool has a typical pleasant floral odor, (E)- β-ocimene and myrcene (ocimene-type) have herbaceous odors, and the three cultivars thus smelled fruity and sweet with a floral note. “Conca D’ Or”, “Pink Mist”, “Garden Affair”, and “Palazzo” emitted methyl benzoate in addition to eucalyptol and ocimene-type as the major scent compounds, generating a fruity odor with a sweet resinous nuance. Group 6, Lily Group 6 contained “Miss Feya” (OT hybrid) and “Sorbonne” and “Brasilla” (Oriental hybrids), which had high levels of ocimene-type and methyl benzoate, producing a strong fragrance with a cananga odor. This scent is very popular and was designated “lily”, being so reminiscent of odors from cut Oriental hybrid lily flowers. Sequence alignment of  TPS genes from different lily cultivars Methyl benzoate might be important for the formation of lily fragrance since it was detected in all lily accessions. However, monoterpenes were predicted to be the main contributors to the difference in floral scent between scented and faint-scented lilies 23. As shown in Supplementary Table  1, monoterpenes occur frequently in lilies but in different relative amounts. They are also present in some cultivars that are normally considered faint scented. Monoterpenes are known to be synthesized mainly by the MEP pathway 36, and monoTPSs encode the enzymes catalyzing the final steps of the MEP pathway. We tested the hypothesis that it was possible to identify polymorphic sites in lily flower-expressed monoTPSs related to the production of monoterpenes. Thirty-two monoTPS cDNAs with high similarity were identified and sequenced from 66 lily accessions, and the sequences were submitted to NCBI (Table  3). The cDNAs were divided into three groups: LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-3 (Fig.  1). LTPS-1 included the largest number of cDNAs (23 cDNAs in total) characterized by an ORF of 1761 bp encoding a putative LTPS protein of 586 amino acids. LTPS-3 included 7 cDNAs, with 97.71% homology to the LTPS-1 group, characterized by an ORF of 1647 bp encoding a putative LTPS protein of 548 amino acids. There were only two cDNAs belonging to LTPS-2, with 98.59% and 94.44% homology to LTPS-1 and LTPS-3, respectively. The ORF of LTPS-2 is 1773 bp and encodes a putative LTPS protein of 590 amino acids. Table  3 shows the distribution of three types of terpene synthase transcripts, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-2, found in different lily cultivars examined in this study. LTPS-1 was found in 52 (78.8%) lily cultivars. LTPS-3 was cloned from 18 cultivars, accounting for 27.3%, and 6 (9.1%) cultivars contained LTPS-2. “Sorbonne” was the only cultivar from which three types of LTPS were cloned. “Julius” was the only cultivar from which both LTPS-1 and LTPS-2 were cloned. LTPS-1 and LTPS-3 were cloned from seven cultivars, “Easy Life”, “Abbeville Pride”, “Red Life”, “Reeleeze”, “Pink Perfection”, “Amarossi”, and “Forever”. Ten cultivars had only LTPS-3, and four cultivars (“Annemarie’s Dream” “Orange Planet” “Conca D’ Or” and “Bright Diamond”) had only LTPS-2. Nucleotide diversity of LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-3, and haplotypes Sequence alignment of the 32 monoTPS sequences from lily showed 2 InDel polymorphisms (230, 873) and 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to LTPS-1, 12 base pairs were inserted in LTPS-2 (230), and 114 base pairs were deleted in LTPS-3 (873). Of the 64 SNPs, 25 were synonymous mutations, while the other 39 altered the amino acid sequences (Supplementary Table  3). Fifty-five, 8, and 41 SNP sites were identified for LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-3, respectively, of which 33, 6, and 17 were nonsynonymous substitutions. Nucleotide diversity ( π) was determined for LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-3 ORFs using the SNPs identified in the lily accessions. Overall, nucleotide diversity was higher for LTPS-1 ( π = 0.010) than for LTPS-3 ( π = 0.006) and LTPS-2 ( π = 0.001). Hd was approximately 1.0 for the three LTPS groups (Table  4). Comparison of lily genomic DNA sequences and LTPS flower transcripts The cultivar “Sorbonne” was the only accession from which three types of LTPS were cloned, and it was chosen for DNA cloning to investigate the InDel relationships between LTPS-2 and LTPS-3 at the DNA level. A total length of 2661 bp genomic LTPS DNA was cloned from “Sorbonne” ( LsoTPS–gDNA, NCBI accession number MH618207) and aligned with the cDNAs of  LsoTPS-1 (MH203231),  LsoTPS-2 (MH203303), and  LsoTPS-3 (MH203275) by the DNAMAN software. Seven exons and six introns were found for the LTPS genomic DNA. As shown in Fig.  2, the additional 12 bases of  LsoTPS-2, which are not present in  LsoTPS-1 and  LsoTPS-3, are not actually due to an insertion in the DNA-coding sequence but rather arise from the use of an alternative 5′ splice site in the first intron. Furthermore, the 114 bases missing from  LsoTPS-3 compared to  LsoTPS-1 and  LsoTPS-2 are not due to the deletion of any DNA sequence but rather arise from the use of an alternative 3′ splice site in the third intron. This suggests that the explanation for the presence of the  LTPS-1,  LTPS-2, and  LTPS-3 transcripts might be variable splicing of transcripts from an  LTPS gene. Correlation of scent compounds emitted and  TPS gene nucleotide substitutions Fifty-one SNPs were identified among the cDNA sequences from the 23 cultivars from which floral scent components were identified. Gray relational analysis was used to evaluate the gray relational degree (GRD) between the major monoterpene volatile compounds emitted and the 51  TPS nucleotide substitutions 38,  39 using the DPS V12.01 software. The compound that had the highest correlation with all nucleotide substitution sites (GRD > 0.57) was myrcene (Fig.  3). The substitution site 230–241, which corresponds to the insertion of 12 bp, was highly correlated with all major monoterpene volatile compounds (GRD > 0.59), especially (E)- β-ocimene (GRD > 0.72) (Fig.  3). Characterization of LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-3 The translation of all  LTPS cDNAs into amino sequences generated 14, 7, and 2 amino sequences for LTPS-1, LTPS-3, and LTPS-2, respectively. The amino acid sequences from “Sorbonne” lily LsoTPS-1, LsoTPS-2, and LsoTPS-3 were used for characterization of the encoded proteins. All three sequences contained the highly conserved N-terminal arginine-rich RRX8W signature sequence motif and the C-terminal aspartate-rich DDXXD and NSE/DTE substrate-binding motifs 32, with a predicted mass of ca. 66.3 kDa and a pI of ca. 5.8 (Fig.  4). The N-terminal 20 amino acids upstream of the conserved RRX8W motif were predicted to code for a transit peptide for import into plastids using the SignalP 4.1 peptide prediction tool. Although one highly conserved RX8W motif was found in the LsoTPS-1 and LsoTPS-2 amino sequences, a similar sequence was absent from the predicted LsoTPS-3 amino sequence (Fig.  4) because of the deletion produced by alternative splicing, as discussed above. Functional characterization of LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-3 To determine the functional activity of the three structurally distinct types of TPS proteins, five cDNAs were expressed separately in  Escherichia coli. BL21, three from the scented lily  Lilium cv. “Sorbonne” ( LsoTPS-1,  LsoTPS-2, and  LsoTPS-3) and two from the faint-scented  Lilium cv. “Red life” ( LrlTPS-1, MH203231, and  LrlTPS-3, MH203298). The recombinant plasmid with the full-length  LsoTPS-1,  LsoTPS-2, and  LsoTPS-3 cDNA sequences resulted in successful expression of soluble Lso TPS-1, Lso TPS-2, and Lso TPS-3 proteins of approximately 67, 68, and 62 kDa, respectively. The recombinant plasmid with the full-length  LrlTPS-1 and  LrlTPS-3 cDNAs resulted in successful expression of soluble proteins of approximately 67 and 62 kDa, respectively. Each of the purified proteins was tested for the ability to convert GPP into monoterpenes, and the products generated were analyzed by gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The results showed that all five proteins were able to convert GPP into (E)- β-ocimene, α-pinene, and limonene, which were identified by retention time at 5.79, 5.56, and 5.47 min, respectively (Fig.  5 shows the results for  LrlTPS-3 as an example). As shown in Fig.  5, even if the transformed  E. coli cells were cultivated in buffer without isopropyl-β- d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and substrate (GPP), a small amount of eucalyptol was produced, as identified by retention time at 5.58 min.","Lily is a well-known ornamental plant with a diversity of fragrant types. Basic information on lily floral scent compounds has been obtained for only a few accessions, and little is known about Lilium aroma types, the terpene synthase genes that may play roles in the production of key volatiles, or the range of monoterpenes that these genes produce. In this study, 41 cultivars were analyzed for volatile emissions, and a total of 46 individual volatile compounds were identified, 16 for the first time in lilies. Lily accessions were classified into six groups according to the composition of major scent components: faint-scented, cool, fruity, musky, fruity-honey, and lily. Monoterpenes were one of the main groups of volatiles identified, and attention was focused on terpene synthase (TPS) genes, which encode enzymes that catalyze the last steps in monoterpene synthesis. Thirty-two candidate monoterpene synthase cDNAs were obtained from 66 lily cultivars, and 64 SNPs were identified. Two InDels were also shown to result from variable splicing, and sequence analysis suggested that different transcripts arose from the same gene. All identified nucleotide substitution sites were highly correlated with the amounts of myrcene emitted, and InDel site 230 was highly correlated with the emission of all major monoterpenoid components, especially (E)-β-ocimene. Heterologous expression of five cDNAs cloned from faint-scented and strong-scented lilies showed that their corresponding enzymes could convert geranyl diphosphate to (E)-β-ocimene, α-pinene, and limonene. The findings from this study provide a major resource for the assessment of lily scent volatiles and will be helpful in breeding of improved volatile components.","['secondary metabolism', 'Transcriptomics']","['Supplementary Table', 'Marco Polo', 'Sunshine Borland', 'Ceb Dazzle', 'methyl benzoate', 'cultivars', 'Table', 'methyl', 'White Wizard', 'scent compounds']","[faint-scented, strong-scented, OT hybrids, “Conca D’, ”, “Robina”, “, ”, Polo”, “Siberia, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “Pink, ”, “, ”, “Tarrango”, ”, ”, “, ”, “Red, ”, LA hybrids, ”, “Ceb, ”, LO hybrids, “, ”, “Regale, (E)-, (E)-, “, ”, “Levi”, “Rossella, ’s, ”, “Pearl Loraine”, “, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “Bright Diamond”, (E)-, “, “Beverly, ”, “Mister Right”, “Mister Cass”, “, ”, “, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, Musky Group 4, ”, “Orange, ”, “, ”, “Regale, “Regale”, “, ”, OT hybrid, “Manissa”, Fruity-honey, OT, LO hybrids, fruity-honey, “Triumphator”, “White, ”, “Pink, Brilliant”, “Pink, ”, (E)-, (E)-, “Conca D’, ”, “Pink, ”, “, “Palazzo”, ocimene-type, “Miss Feya”, OT hybrid, “, ”, “Brasilla”, ocimene-type, cananga, “lily”, faint-scented lilies, monoTPSs, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-3 (Fig.  1, LTPS-1, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-2 is 1773 , LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, “, ”, ”, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-3, “Easy, ”, “, ”, “Red, ”, “Reeleeze”, “Pink, ”, “Amarossi”, “Forever”, “, ’s, ” “, ”, “Bright Diamond”, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-2 (230), SNP, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, π, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, π , π , LTPS-2 (, π , ”, LTPS-2, LTPS-3, “, ”, LsoTPS–, NCBI, MH203231, MH203275, 3′, GRD , 230–241, GRD , (E)- β-ocimene, GRD , LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, “, ”, LsoTPS-2, LsoTPS-3, N-terminal arginine-rich, RX8W, LsoTPS-1, LsoTPS-2 amino, LsoTPS-3 amino, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, “, ”, LsoTPS-1, ”, LrlTPS-1, MH203231, Lso TPS-3, (E)-, α-pinene, isopropyl-β- d-thiogalactoside]","['TPS', 'monoTPSs', 'monoTPSs', 'monoTPS', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS-3,', 'LTPS-2', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-2.', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS-2', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-3,', 'LTPS-2.', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3,', 'monoTPS', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3,', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-2', 'LTPS', 'LTPS', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-2', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS', 'LsoTPS–gDNA,', 'LsoTPS-1', 'LsoTPS-2', 'LsoTPS-3', 'LTPS', 'LsoTPS-2,', 'LsoTPS-1', 'LsoTPS-3,', 'LsoTPS-3', 'LsoTPS-1', 'LsoTPS-2', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-3,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LsoTPS-1,', 'LsoTPS-2,', 'LsoTPS-3', 'LsoTPS-1', 'LsoTPS-2', 'LsoTPS-3', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3', 'TPS', 'LsoTPS-1,', 'LsoTPS-2,', 'LsoTPS-3)', 'LrlTPS-1,', 'LrlTPS-3,', 'LsoTPS-1,', 'LsoTPS-2,', 'LsoTPS-3', 'TPS-1,', 'TPS-2,', 'TPS-3', 'LrlTPS-1', 'LrlTPS-3', 'LrlTPS-3']",[],[],terpene synthase
100,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6902048\eupmc_result.json,PMC6902048,"Results Four  OfUGTs Were Selected as Candidate  UGTs for Linalool and its Oxides Four candidate  OfUGT genes (Cluster 9575.22195.0, Cluster 9575.63104, Cluster 9575.37686, and Cluster 9575.35647) were selected for functional characterization based on their high similarity (> 40%) in amino acid sequence to the known terpenoid  UGTs ( Song et al., 2018). The ORF sequences were 1,458 bp, 1,449 bp, 1,422 bp, and 1,434 bp, respectively, and were designated as  UGT85A82,  UGT85A83, UGT85AF3, and  UGT85A84 (GenBank accession numbers: MG767214, MG767215, MG767216, and MG767217), respectively. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the known terpenoid UGT proteins ( Figure 1;  Table S4). A close relationship was observed between UGT85A82 and UGT85A23 from  Catharanthus roseus ( Nagatoshi et al., 2011), with the latter involved in iridoid glycosylation. UGT85A83 and UGT85A84 showed high amino acid identity to the UGT proteins from  A. thaliana and  Rubus suavissimus, including UGT85A1, UGT85A2, UGT85A5, UGT85A7, and UGT85A57, whose function was mainly to glycosylate monoterpenes and diterpenoid ( Song et al., 2018). UGT85AF3 belonged to UGT85AF subfamily. Only 7 genes were clustered into this subfamily to date ( Table S4). UGT85AF3 showed significantly high bootstrap value with UGT85AF5, UGT85AF6, and UGT85AF7 ( Figure 1). Massive Carbohydrate Biosynthesis Might Facilitate the Glycosylation of Aroma Compounds Since the Full Blossoming Stage According to Illumina Hiseq mRNA Sequencing Since the glycosylated linalool and its derivatives showed the maximum increase from the full blossoming stage ( Zeng et al., 2016), further DEG analysis was conducted based on the KEGG enrichment ( Figure S4). In terms of the DEG number, the most substantial differences between the initial and full blossoming stages were found in the categories of ‘hormone signal transduction’, ‘carbohydrate metabolism’, and ‘phenylpropanoid biosynthesis’ ( Figure S4A). Notably, 37 unigenes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, 26 unigenes involved in glycolysis, 25 unigenes involved in galactose metabolism, and 14 unigenes involved in fructose and mannose metabolism were up-regulated from the initial to full blossoming stage ( Figure S4A). In contrast, the unigenes associated with starch, sucrose, and galactose metabolism were significantly down-regulated from the full to late blossoming stage ( Figure S4B). We therefore hypothesized that the increase in the expressions of genes involved in the primary metabolism facilitated the glycosylation of aroma compounds since the full blossoming stage. UGT85A84 Expression Was Positively Correlated With the Glycosylation of Linalool and Its Oxides Transcriptome sequencing was applied to measure the expressions of genes responsible for linalool and its oxide glycosylation in the four blossoming stages ( Figure 2). Linalool and its oxides were synthesized through the MEP pathway and the expressions of a series of relevant genes including  DXS,  DXR,  CMK,  MCT,  MECPS,  HDS,  IDS,  IDI, and  GPPS, and terpene synthase genes ( TPSs) were investigated by transcriptome sequencing ( Figure 2A). The results showed that the expressions of all the upstream genes were basically increased from bud to initial or full blossoming stage and decreased in the late blossoming stage, directly leading to the massive biosynthesis of linalool and its oxides at the full blossoming stage ( Figure 2B,  Figure S8A). Unexpectedly, qRT-PCR results demonstrated that the expressions of all four candidate  OfUGTs presented a continuously decreasing trend through the blossoming stages ( Figure 3), which was opposite to the increasing trend of terpenoid glycosides ( Zeng et al., 2016). Taken together, despite the low expression of candidate  OfUGTs, the abundant aglycone and sugar donor supplies facilitated the conversion from volatiles to glycosides following the full blossoming stage ( Figure S8A). UGT85A82 expression showed obvious circadian rhythm during the full blossoming stage ( Figure 4). The expressions of four  OfUGTs simultaneously increased during the day and decreased during the night ( Figure 4). Further correlation analysis between their transcript levels and three forms of linalool and its oxides were conducted to screen the candidate terpenoid  OfUGTs. Only  UGT85A84 expression showed significantly positive correlation with the accumulation of glycosides ( Table 1). MEP pathway genes also exhibited the circadian expression patterns, which was in line with continuous increase of linalool and its oxide glycosides from 06:00–00:00 ( Zheng et al., 2017). Further correlation analysis also presented a positive association between MEP pathway gene expressions and glycoside accumulation ( Table S5). Over-Expression of  UGT85A84 Significantly Increased Linalool Oxide Glycoside  inPlanta The experiments of transient over-expression coupled with the substrate injection in  N. benthamiana leaves were conducted to investigate the glycosides produced by candidate  OfUGTs in planta. The leaves were infiltrated with Super1300-OfUGT or a control construct in the presence of linalool and its oxides. The glycosides were then extracted and purified after incubation. Subsequently, GC-MS analysis calculated the glycoside contents by quantifying the corresponding aglycones released from the glycosides. The results showed that considerable glycosides of linalool and its oxides were accumulated in the leaves with substrate injection (CK), while no glycoside was detected from wild-type tobacco leaves, indicating that the injection effectively promoted the absorption and conversion of the substrates by the leaves. It was worth noting that remarkable increase in glycoside of linalool oxide was only observed in  UGT85A84-infiltrated plants, suggesting that UGT85A84 was capable of catalyzing linalool oxides. All the four OfUGTs showed low activities towards linalool since no significant increase in linalool glycoside was observed in the transgenic plants ( Figure 5). This result was similar to the phenomenon in  O. fragrans flowers. Linalool glycoside was approximately 3 mg/g FW, whereas linalool oxide glycoside was more than 40 mg/g FW at the late blossoming stage ( Zeng et al., 2016), suggesting that linalool oxide was more likely to be glycosylated. Recombinant UGT85A84 Protein Glycosylated Linalool and Its Oxides Using UDP-Glc  in vitro Based on the transcript expression analysis and functional identification  in planta,  UGT85A84 was selected as the key  OfUGT and was subjected to further analysis. The recombinant protein of UGT85A84 was expressed in  E. coli and the purified protein was verified by SDS-PAGE ( Figure S6). Target analysis of LC-MS was an effective method for determining the specific product ( Takafumi et al., 2018). Thus, the biochemical characteristics of UGT85A84 were investigated with different sugar donors (UDP-Glc, UDP-Xyl, UDP-Rha) and aglycones (linalool, linalool oxides), respectively ( Figure S7). After 1 h or 16 h incubation, only two glycosylated products, with retention time of 6.50 min and 5.95 min, were formed in the UDP-Glc reaction mixtures ( Figure 6;  Figure S8C). No products were detected in the UDP-Xyl and UDP-Rha reactions, demonstrating that UGT85A84 had no catalytic activity towards these two sugar donors. Further full scan and MS/MS mass spectral data were used to identify and quantify the reaction products. Linalool-glycoside was shown to be the corresponding formate adduct based on the  m/z 361 [M + formate] -1 in full scan mode and the expected pseudo-molecular ion at  m/z 315 in MS 2 ( Figure 6) in the UDP-Glc + linalool reactions. Linalool oxide-glycoside was the corresponding formate adduct based on the  m/z 377 [M + formate] -1 in full scan mode and the expected pseudo-molecular ion at  m/z 331 in MS 2 ( Figure 6) in the UDP-Glc + linalool oxide reactions.  Km and  kcat values were obtained for the linalool and linalool oxide with a constant UDP-Glc concentration (0.5 mM) and for the UDP-Glc with a constant linalool and linalool oxide concentration (0.5 mM) from a hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten saturation curve, respectively ( Figure 7). The apparent  Km for linalool and linalool oxide were 136 µM and 202 µM ( Table 2), respectively, indicating that UGT85A84 had higher catalytic efficiency with linalool than with linalool oxide  in vitro. This result contrasts the catalytic performance in  N. benthamiana leaves, which might be explained by the fact that linalool is a low molecular weight compound that is highly volatile and thus might be easily released instead of being glycosylated in  N. benthamiana leaves. Taken together, the result demonstrated that UGT85A84 was capable of glycosylating linalool and linalool oxide using UDP-Glc as a specific sugar donor.","The monoterpenes linalool and its oxides are the key aroma-active compounds in  Osmanthus fragrans  Lour. flowers. The glycosides of these monoterpenes accumulate throughout flowering, leading to considerable storage of potential aroma constituents that account for the majority of non-volatile aroma compounds. However, the UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) responsible for the glycosylation of linalool and its oxides has not been clarified. Four candidate  OfUGTs  ( UGT85A82 ,  UGT85A83 ,  UGT85AF3 , and  UGT85A84 ) with high homology to the known terpenoid UGTs were screened by transcriptome sequencing. Over-expression of the candidate  OfUGTs  in tobacco showed that UGT85A84 glycosylated linalool oxides  in planta . Since the transcript levels of  UGT85A84  were positively correlated with glycoside accumulation, the recombinant UGT85A84 protein was subjected to reactions with aglycones and sugar donors. Two formate adducts were exclusively detected in UDP-Glc with linalool and linalool oxide reactions by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), indicating that UDP-Glc was the specific sugar donor. The kinetic parameters demonstrated that UGT85A84 glycosylated both linalool and lianlool oxides  in vitro . Further analysis demonstrated that the transcription levels of MEP pathway genes might play an important role in mediating terpenoid glycosylation. Our findings unraveled the mechanism underlying the glycosylation of essential aroma compounds in flowers. This study will facilitate the application of potential aroma contributors in future industries.","['Glycosylation', 'Linalool', 'Aroma', 'Osmanthus fragrans Lour.', 'Udp-glycosyltransferase', 'Linalool Oxide']","['Figure', 'Linalool Oxide', 'Linalool', 'Blossoming Stage', 'Full Blossoming', 'Cluster', 'Blossoming', 'oxide', 'Full', 'Oxides']","[9575.63104, 9575.35647, UGT85AF3, MG767214, MG767215, MG767216, MG767217, UGT, UGT85A82, UGT85A23, Nagatoshi, UGT85A83, UGT85A84, UGT, UGT85A1, UGT85A2, UGT85A5, UGT85A7, UGT85A57, UGT85AF3, UGT85AF5, UGT85AF6, UGT85AF7, ‘hormone, ’, ‘carbohydrate, ’, ‘, ’, Its Oxides, terpene synthase, S8A, S8A, UGT85A82, glycosides ( Table 1, S5, Super1300-OfUGT, CK, UGT85A84, OfUGTs, UGT85A84 Protein, Its Oxides, UGT85A84, UGT85A84, UDP-Rha, S8C, UDP-Rha, UGT85A84, Linalool-glycoside, M + formate], M + formate], UDP-Glc, µM ( Table 2, UGT85A84, UGT85A84]",['TPSs)'],[],[],terpene synthase
101,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6941427\eupmc_result.json,PMC6941427,"Results Analysis of Water, Total Polyphenol, Total Flavonoid, Catechin, Lignin, Volatile Compound, Jasmonic Acid, and Methyl Jasmonate Contents of Fresh Leaves, Indoor-Withered Leaves, and Solar-Withered Leaves The phenotypes of the FL, IW, and SW were recorded ( Figure 1). The FL were glossy, straight, and green, with a water content of 75%. In contrast, the IW were slightly curled and deformed, with a water content of 68%. The SW were obviously curled and dull green. The appearance of the SW may have been due to their relatively low water content (65%). A sensory evaluation revealed that the three leaf samples differed regarding taste and aroma. Specifically, the FL and IW were bitter and astringent, with a strong grassy aroma, whereas the SW were weakly astringent, with a mellow taste, slightly grassy flavor, and faint floral and fruity aromas. To explore the changes in the characteristic tea compounds in the FL, IW, and SW, we determined the contents of total polyphenols, total flavonoids, catechins, lignin, and volatiles in these samples. The total polyphenol contents were 235.47, 203.47, and 158.45 mg/g in the FL, IW, and SW, respectively ( Figure 2). The total flavonoid content in the SW was significantly lower than that in the FL and IW. Similarly, the total flavonoid content was significantly lower in the SW (132.89 mg/g) than in the FL (197.20 mg/g) and IW (171.83 mg/g). Moreover, the abundance of total catechins was significantly lower in the SW than in the FL and IW. An analysis of individual catechins identified EGCG as the most abundant catechin in all three leaf samples. The EGCG content was significantly higher in the FL (61.37 mg/g) and IW (57.55 mg/g) than in the SW (50.35 mg/g). Similarly, EGC, CG, GCG, and ECG were significantly more abundant in the FL and IW than in the SW. However, there were no significant differences in the C, GC, and EC contents between the FL and SW, the FL and IW, and the IW and SW. Additionally, the lignin content was significantly higher in the SW (542.10 mg/g) than in the FL (410.18 mg/g) and IW (449.65 mg/g). Thus, the total flavonoid and total catechin contents as well as the abundance of five individual catechins, especially the galloylated catechins (CG, GCG, ECG, and EGCG), were significantly lower in the SW than in the FL and IW, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for the lignin content. The contents of the top 20 volatiles in the FL, IW, and SW were detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry ( Table 1). The fatty acid-derived volatile contents were significantly affected by withering. Analyses indicated that ( Z)-3-hexenal and ( E)-2-hexenal were the most abundant volatile components in the FL. After withering, the ( Z)-3-hexenal and ( E)-2-hexenal contents were significantly lower in the IW and SW than in the FL. A further analysis revealed that the ( Z)-3-hexenal content of the SW (12.70%) was significantly lower than that of the IW (15.41%). Additionally, the ( E)-2-hexenal content of the SW (12.20%) was significantly lower than that of the IW (16.92%). The abundance of terpenoid volatiles, including β-ocimene, limonene, γ-terpinene, α-farnesene, and β-myrcene, was significantly greater in the IW and SW than in the FL. A comparison of the terpenoid volatile contents in the IW and SW indicated that all five terpenoid volatiles were present at significantly higher levels in the SW than in the IW. Similarly, glycosidically bound volatiles (benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, and methyl salicylate) and a carotenoid-derived volatile (β-ionone) were more abundant in the IW and SW than in the FL. Therefore, the combined actions of various volatile compounds may be responsible for the formation of aromas during withering. Among these compounds, the ( Z)-3-hexenal, ( E)-2-hexenal, and terpenoid volatiles, which represent a large proportion of the volatiles in oolong tea, may be the most affected by the withering process, especially solar-withering, which can trigger a significant increase in the content of these terpenoid volatiles and a decrease in the abundance of hexenal volatiles. Phytohormones, especially JA and MeJA, function as signaling molecules that promote the synthesis of related volatiles ( Dudareva et al., 2013;  Zeng et al., 2017). To clarify the accumulation of JA and MeJA during the withering process, we determined the JA and MeJA contents in fresh and withered leaves. The JA contents in the FL, IW, and SW were 0.92, 1.81, and 3.14 μg/g, respectively. The JA content was significantly higher in the SW (3.14 μg/g) than in the FL (0.92 μg/g) and IW (1.81 μg/g). Similarly, the MeJA content was also significantly higher in the SW (0.45 μg/g) than in the FL (0.08 μg/g) and IW (0.21 μg/g). The differences in the JA and MeJA contents among the three leaf samples may be related to the accumulation of volatiles. Sequencing and Assembly of Transcriptome Data To investigate the regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs during the withering of oolong tea leaves, three biological replicates of the FL, IW, and SW underwent a transcriptome sequencing analysis with the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform. After removing rRNA, low-quality reads, adapter sequences, and contaminating reads, an average of 12.66 Gb of clean data were obtained per sample ( Supplementary Table S2). All clean reads were aligned to the tea reference genome. A total of 82,077 transcripts were detected, including 32,036 lncRNAs and 50,041 mRNAs. An analysis of the length distribution and exon number for the lncRNAs and mRNAs indicated that most of the lncRNAs (72.36%) were shorter than 1,000 bp and only 3.94% were longer than 3,000 bp. In contrast, 40.46% of the mRNAs were 0–1,000 bp and 10.07% of the mRNAs exceeded 3,000 bp. Moreover, 68.22% of the lncRNAs contained only one exon, whereas 85.98% of the mRNAs comprised more than two exons. These observations are consistent with the findings of studies on maize ( Li et al., 2014), kiwifruit ( Tang et al., 2016), and longan ( Chen et al., 2018a), which confirmed that lncRNAs contain fewer exons than the annotated mRNAs and that most plant lncRNAs contain one exon. The transcriptome dataset revealed that 28,677 lncRNAs were expressed. Additionally, 26,740 expressed lncRNAs were identified in the FL, which was more than the 26,508 expressed lncRNAs in the IW and the 26,479 expressed lncRNAs in the SW. Further analyses of lncRNA expression indicated that the expression levels of most of the lncRNAs in the FL, IW, and SW were low (FPKM ≤ 1), with no more than 5% of the total number of lncRNAs detected as highly expressed (FPKM ≥ 10) ( Supplementary Figure S1). Identification of Differentially Expressed Long Non-Coding RNAs and Their Target Genes During the Tea-Withering Process To identify the DE-lncRNAs during the tea-withering process, we analyzed the following comparisons: FL vs. IW, FL vs. SW, and IW vs. SW. The expression profiles based on the normalized FPKM values revealed 12,487 DE-lncRNAs in the FL, IW, and SW. Additionally 9,847 DE-lncRNAs were identified in the FL vs. IW comparison, of which 4,243 were up-regulated and 5,604 were down-regulated; 6,506 DE-lncRNAs were identified in the FL vs. SW comparison, of which 2,659 were up-regulated and 3,847 were down-regulated; and 4,964 DE-lncRNAs were identified in the IW vs. SW comparison, of which 2,443 were up-regulated and 2,521 were down-regulated. The lncRNAs mediate the expression of some protein-coding genes through a  cis- or  trans-regulatory mechanism. Thus, the genes targeted by the DE-lncRNAs were predicted, which resulted in the identification of putative target genes for 2,892 DE-lncRNAs, including 2,180  cis-regulated and 1,096  trans-regulated target genes. Moreover, 1,694 DE-lncRNAs targeted only one protein-coding gene, whereas 14 DE-lncRNAs targeted more than six genes. A further analysis of the target genes revealed that 1,904 were regulated by only one DE-lncRNA, whereas 15 were regulated by more than six DE-lncRNAs. Functional Annotation of the Genes Targeted by Differentially Expressed Long Non-Coding RNAs Based on Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Databases The target genes were functionally characterized by aligning them to the sequences in the GO database with the BLAST algorithm. The 3,543 DE target genes in the FL vs. IW comparison were grouped into the three major GO categories ( Supplementary Figure S2), namely, biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. The top three biological process subgroups were cellular process, metabolic process, and biological regulation. In the cellular component category, most of the DE target genes were annotated with the membrane, membrane part, and cell GO terms. Regarding the DE target genes in the molecular function category, most were classified into the following three subgroups: binding, catalytic activity, and transporter activity. In the FL vs. SW comparison, 2,085 target genes were grouped into the three main GO categories ( Supplementary Figure S2). The top three biological process subgroups (cellular process, metabolic process, and biological regulation) for the FL vs. SW comparison were consistent with the results for the FL vs. IW comparison. Regarding the IW vs. SW comparison, only 890 target genes were annotated with the cellular process, metabolic process, and biological regulation GO terms ( Supplementary Figure S2). In the biological process category, the three most enriched subgroups were cellular process, metabolic process, and response to stimulus. The top three enriched subgroups in the remaining two categories were consistent with the enrichment results for the FL vs. IW and FL vs. SW comparisons. We then identified the enriched KEGG pathways among the target genes of the DE-lncRNAs. In the FL vs. IW comparison, 3,543 DE target genes were enriched in 129 pathways ( Figure 3A). The top 20 enriched pathways were as follows: plant–pathogen interaction; sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism; brassinosteroid biosynthesis; plant hormone signal transduction; pentose phosphate pathway; monoterpenoid biosynthesis; terpenoid backbone biosynthesis; stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis; glucosinolate biosynthesis; photosynthesis; DNA replication; flavonoid biosynthesis; diterpenoid biosynthesis; metabolic pathways; glycosphingolipid biosynthesis; fructose and mannose metabolism; folate biosynthesis; and lysine biosynthesis. In the FL  vs. IW and FL  vs. SW comparisons, seven of the top 20 enriched KEGG pathways were consistent ( Figure 3B). These seven pathways were plant–pathogen interaction; plant hormone signal transduction; stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis; flavonoid biosynthesis; sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis; glucosinolate biosynthesis; and monoterpenoid biosynthesis. Considering the effects of flavonoids and terpenoids on tea taste and aroma, respectively, we focused on the flavonoid and terpenoid metabolic pathways. The plant hormone signal transduction pathway is also involved, with linoleic acid metabolism related to the biosynthesis of JA and MeJA. Regarding plant hormone signal transduction, JA and MeJA induce the formation of terpenoid volatiles. An analysis of the transcriptome differences between the IW and SW ( Figure 3C) indicated that 13 of the top 20 enriched KEGG pathways were consistent between the FL vs. IW and FL vs. SW comparisons. The terpenoid metabolic pathways, including sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, and diterpenoid biosynthesis, were identified as crucial metabolic pathways. Additionally, the pathways related to flavonoid metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction also warrant further study. Analysis of the Differentially Expressed Genes and Differentially Expressed Long Non-Coding RNAs Involved in the Flavonoid Metabolic Pathway During Tea Withering The KEGG analysis identified the flavonoid metabolic pathway as one of the main enriched pathways. A total of 63 DEGs were assigned to flavonoid metabolic pathways. The following 11 gene families involved in flavonoid metabolic pathways were differentially expressed in the FL vs. IW, FL vs. SW, and IW vs. SW comparisons:  PAL ( phenylalanine ammonia-lyase),  C4H ( cinnamate 4-hydroxylase),  4CL ( 4-coumarate CoA ligase),  CHS ( chalcone synthase),  CHI ( chalcone isomerase),  F3H ( flavanone 3-hydroxylase),  F3′H ( flavonoid 3′ -hydroxylase),  FLS ( flavonol synthase),  DFR ( dihydroflavonol 4-reductase),  ANS ( anthocyanidin synthase), and  ANR ( anthocyanidin reductase) ( Supplementary Table S3). Moreover, lignin and flavonoids are parallel secondary metabolites, and flavonoid biosynthesis and lignin biosynthesis may compete for the same substrates ( Wang et al., 2017b). Thus, the following three lignin metabolism-related gene families were also identified:  CCR ( cinnamoyl-CoA reductase),  CAD ( cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase), and  HCT ( hydroxycinnamoyltransferase). A potential flavonoid metabolic pathway was constructed based on these identified DEGs ( Figure 4). The expression trends of 124 DEGs involved in the flavonoid and lignin metabolic pathways were compared based on the normalized FPKM values ( Figure 4). All of the DEGs in six gene families ( C4H,  4CL,  F3H,  F3′H,  FLS, and  HCT) were more highly expressed in the FL and IW than in the SW. Additionally, most of the DEGs in six other gene families ( PAL,  CHS,  CHI,  ANS,  ANR, and  DFR) were also more highly expressed in the FL and IW than in the SW. Moreover, nine DEGs belonging to the  CCR family were most highly expressed in the SW, as were more than half of the DEGs in the  CAD family. Furthermore, 83 DEGs in the flavonoid metabolic pathway were more highly expressed in the IW than in the SW. These results implied that the flavonoid metabolism in the SW may have been in flux more weakly than that in the IW. Therefore, solar-withering may inhibit the accumulation of flavonoids in the withered leaves. To decipher the regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs in flavonoid metabolism and lignin metabolism, the related DE-lncRNAs and their target genes were analyzed. A total of 31 DE-lncRNAs and eight DE target genes involved in the flavonoid and lignin metabolic pathways were identified in the FL, IW, and SW transcriptome dataset. The target genes included  4CL,  CHI,  F3H,  F3’H,  FLS,  CCR,  CAD, and  HCT. Additionally, the lncRNAs did not have a one-to-one regulatory relationship with the target genes. Specifically, 43 pairs of regulatory relationships (a lncRNA regulating an mRNA) were identified for these DE-lncRNAs and their target genes ( Supplementary Figure S3). A correlation analysis indicated that 39 lncRNAs were positively correlated with target genes, whereas only four lncRNAs were negatively correlated with target genes ( Supplementary Table S4). Moreover, the  HCT and  CAD genes were regulated by the most lncRNAs, with both gene families regulated by 10 lncRNAs. This was in contrast to  4CL,  CHI,  F3H, and  F3’H, which were regulated by only one lncRNA. To further investigate the expression patterns of lncRNAs related to flavonoid and lignin metabolism, the expression patterns of 31 DE-lncRNAs were analyzed in the FL, IW, and SW based on the normalized FPKM values ( Supplementary Figure S4). Similar lncRNA expression levels were detected for the FL and IW. Among the regulatory relationships between the lncRNAs and their target genes, 39 were positive regulatory relationships, whereas four were negative regulatory relationships. Moreover, we determined that some target genes were regulated by multiple lncRNAs and some lncRNAs simultaneously regulated multiple target genes. Thus, the lncRNAs may help regulate flavonoid contents by affecting the expression level of genes related to flavonoid metabolism  via complex regulatory mechanisms. To confirm the expression of the lncRNAs and their target genes in the transcriptome dataset, the expression patterns of 16 structural genes and 10 related lncRNAs involved in flavonoid metabolism in the FL, IW, and SW were analyzed by qRT-PCR ( Figure 5). The correlation in the expression of the lncRNAs and their target genes was also analyzed ( Supplementary Table S5). In the scaffolds, the structures of all important  cis-regulated genes and their lncRNAs involved in flavonoid metabolism were plotted ( Supplementary Figure S5). The following 10 lncRNAs were analyzed: LTCONS_00054003 (targeting  4CL), LTCONS_00060939 (targeting  CHI), LTCONS_00056216 (targeting  F3H), LTCONS_00044497 (targeting  F3’H), LTCONS_00031811 (targeting  FLS), LTCONS_00001863 (targeting  CCR), LTCONS_00000233 (targeting  CAD), LTCONS_00090121 (targeting  CAD), LTCONS_00030131 (targeting  HCT), and LTCONS_00101116 (targeting  HCT). The expression patterns of the detected lncRNAs and their target genes were consistent with the transcriptome dataset, implying that lncRNAs help regulate flavonoid metabolism by altering the expression levels of related genes. These expression-level changes may be an important factor mediating the obvious differences in the flavonoid metabolite contents between the IW and SW. Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes and Differentially Expressed Long Non-Coding RNAs Involved in the Terpenoid Metabolic Pathway as Well as the Jasmonic Acid/Methyl Jasmonate Biosynthesis and Signal Transduction Pathway During Tea Withering To characterize the expression of DEGs involved in the terpenoid metabolic pathway in the FL, IW, and SW, we examined the 59 DEGs associated with this pathway ( Supplementary Table S6). Unlike the  DXR ( 1- deoxy- d- xylulose 5- phosphate reductoisomerase),  MCT ( 2- C- methyl- d- erythritol 4- phosphate cytidylyltransferase),  CMK ( 4- diphosphocytidyl- 2- C- methyl- d- erythritol kinase),  GPPS ( geranyl diphosphate synthase),  PMK ( phosphomevalonate kinase),  MDC ( mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase), and  FPS ( farnesyl diphosphate synthase) gene families, the following 11 gene families comprised more than two DEGs:  DXS ( 1- deoxy- d- xylulose- 5- phosphate synthase),  MDS ( 2- C- methyl- d- erythritol 2,4- cyclodiphosphate synthase),  HDS ( 4- hydroxy- 3- methylbut- 2- enyl- diphosphate synthase),  HDR ( 4- hydroxy- 3- methylbut- 2- enyl- diphosphate reductase),  IDI ( isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase),  GGPPS ( geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase),  AACT ( acetyl- CoA C- acetyltransferase),  HMGS ( hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA synthase),  HMGR ( hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA reductase),  MVK ( mevalonate kinase), and  TPS ( terpene synthase). An analysis of the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway uncovered 49 DEGs that were assigned to the following eight gene families:  LOX ( lipoxygenase),  AOS ( allene oxide synthase),  AOC ( allene oxide cyclase),  OPR ( oxophytodienoic acid reductase),  ACX ( acyl- CoA oxidase),  MFP2 ( enoyl- CoA hydratase/ 3- hydroxyacyl- CoA dehydrogenase),  JMT ( jasmonate O-methyltransferase), and  JAR ( jasmonic acid- amino synthetase) ( Supplementary Table S7). With the exception of the  JMT family, these gene families included more than two DEGs, with the  ACX family having the most DEGs. Moreover, changes in the hexenal content are related to the hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) pathway. This pathway along with the AOS pathway function downstream of the LOX pathway. Thus, we also analyzed three genes in the HPL pathway, namely,  HPL ( fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase),  ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase), and  AAT (alcohol acetyltransferase). A possible terpenoid metabolic pathway was constructed based on these identified DEGs ( Figure 6). Comparisons of the transcript levels (FPKM values) of these DEGs revealed that 17 DEGs were more highly expressed in the IW and SW than in the FL. Moreover, the  MDS genes exhibited complex expression trends. On the basis of the normalized FPKM values, we also compared the expression trends of the 49 DEGs involved in the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway between the fresh and withered leaves ( Figure 6). Most of the DEGs in these gene families were more highly expressed in the SW than in the IW. Specifically, all of the DEGs corresponding to  LOX,  AOS,  AOC,  OPR,  MFP2,  JMT, and  JAR were most highly expressed in the SW. Additionally, the expression levels of 17 DEGs corresponding to  ACX were also higher in the SW than in the IW. These results suggested that the high transcription levels for these six JA/MeJA biosynthesis-related genes in the SW may influence JA and MeJA accumulation. Moreover,  HPL,  ADH, and  AAT were also most highly expressed in the SW, which may be related to hexenal content changes. The high expression levels of most of the DEGs corresponding to the 17 gene families involved in the terpenoid metabolic pathway may be positively correlated with the terpenoid contents. Moreover, the high expression levels of eight gene families influencing the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway may promote the accumulation of JA and MeJA, which may induce the synthesis of terpenoid volatiles ( Dudareva et al., 2013). Thus, these results suggested that the transcript levels of these DEGs may be related to the terpenoid contents in the FL, IW, and SW. To further elucidate the regulatory effects of lncRNAs on the terpenoid metabolic pathway and the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway, we also predicted the DE-lncRNAs and their target genes related to these two pathways. The correlation analysis indicated that eight lncRNAs were positively correlated with the target genes, whereas 11 lncRNAs were negatively correlated with the target genes ( Supplementary Table S8). Moreover, we identified 10 DE-lncRNAs affecting 14  cis-target genes and four DE-lncRNAs affecting five  trans-target genes in the terpenoid metabolic pathway. A subsequent analysis revealed that  GGPPS and  TPS are regulated by three lncRNAs, whereas four genes ( DXS,  CMK,  AACT, and  PMK) are targeted by only one lncRNA ( Supplementary Figure S6). In the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway, 18 DE-lncRNAs and 18 DE target genes were identified in the FL, IW, and SW. Of the target genes, six associated with the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway ( LOX,  AOS,  AOC,  OPR,  ACX, and  MFP2) were regulated by lncRNAs. The correlation analysis demonstrated that 17 lncRNAs were positively correlated with the target genes, whereas five lncRNAs were negatively correlated with the target genes ( Supplementary Table S9). We also clarified the specific lncRNA–mRNA regulatory relationships. A total of 22 pairs of lncRNA–mRNA regulatory relationships were detected among these DE-lncRNAs and target genes involved in the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway. To analyze the relationship between the expression patterns of DE-lncRNAs and their target genes, we compared their expression levels in the FL, IW, and SW. The expression patterns of 32 DE-lncRNAs were analyzed in the FL, IW, and SW based on the normalized FPKM values ( Supplementary Figure S7). The overall expression levels of the DE-lncRNAs were similar in the IW and SW but varied in the FL. Among the 41 lncRNA–mRNA regulatory pairs, 25 pairs comprised a lncRNA and potential target gene that exhibited the same expression trend, whereas 16 pairs consisted of a lncRNA and target gene that exhibited the opposite expression trend. An examination of the regulatory relationships between the lncRNAs and mRNAs detected eight lncRNAs that targeted more than one gene and 24 lncRNAs with only one target gene. These findings implied that most of the lncRNAs associated with these two pathways have a single regulatory function regarding the expression of target genes. However, the few lncRNAs that target several genes may have multiple functions. To verify the accuracy of the lncRNA and target gene expression patterns, we conducted qRT-PCR analyses of 18 structural genes involved in the terpenoid metabolic pathway. The transcript levels of eight structural genes involved in JA/MeJA biosynthesis and three structural genes involved in the HPL pathway were also analyzed by qRT-PCR. We also conducted qRT-PCR analyses to determine the expression levels of the following lncRNAs involved in the terpenoid metabolic pathway and the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway: LTCONS_00093140 (targeting  DXS), LTCONS_00012676 (targeting  CMK), LTCONS_00002173 (targeting  HDS), LTCONS_00078708 (targeting  HDR), LTCONS_00039845 (targeting  GGPPS), LTCONS_00025739 (targeting  AACT), LTCONS_00091745 (targeting  MVK), LTCONS_00092790 (targeting  PMK), LTCONS_00043160 (targeting  TPS), LTCONS_00040667 (targeting  LOX), LTCONS_00087608 (targeting  AOS), LTCONS_00035664 (targeting  AOC), LTCONS_00032547 (targeting  OPR), LTCONS_00064473 (targeting  ACX), LTCONS_00087182 (targeting  ACX), and LTCONS_00061187 (targeting  MFP2). The correlations between the expression of the lncRNAs and their target genes were also analyzed ( Supplementary Table S5). In the scaffolds, the structures of all important  cis-regulated genes and their lncRNAs involved in terpenoid metabolism and JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction were plotted ( Supplementary Figure S5). The expression trends of selected genes and lncRNAs were similar between the qRT-PCR data and the transcriptome dataset ( Figure 7). These results confirmed the significant differences in the transcript levels of terpenoid metabolism-related lncRNAs and target genes in the FL vs. IW, FL vs. SW, and IW vs. SW comparisons. Relationships Between the Long Non-Coding RNAs and MicroRNAs Involved in Flavonoid Metabolism, Terpenoid Metabolism, and Jasmonic Acid/Methyl Jasmonate Biosynthesis and Signal Transduction To analyze the relationships between the lncRNAs and miRNAs involved in flavonoid metabolism, terpenoid metabolism, and JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction, the psRNATarget program was used to predict the potential regulatory relationships between lncRNAs and miRNAs. A total of 41 lncRNAs involved in these three metabolic pathways were predicted to be the targets of 76 miRNAs from 35 families. Additionally, 133 lncRNA–miRNA interacting pairs were identified ( Supplementary Table S10). These lncRNAs included 28 that were targeted by multiple miRNAs and 13 that were regulated by only one miRNA. Similarly, we identified 36 miRNAs that targeted only one lncRNA and 40 miRNAs with more than two target lncRNAs. Thus, most of the identified lncRNAs were regulated by multiple miRNAs. As novel regulatory factors, eTMs inhibit miRNA functions by binding to miRNAs, which indirectly affects the expression of miRNA targets. Some lncRNAs function as eTMs, thereby contributing to the regulation of miRNAs. In the present study, two lncRNAs detected in the transcriptome dataset were predicted to be potential eTMs (LTCONS_00026271 and LTCONS_00020084) for two miRNAs (novel_miR44 and miR169d-5p_1) associated with the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway, respectively ( Figure 8A). Moreover, we determined that novel_miR44 targets  LOX, whereas miR169d-5p_1 targets  ACX ( Supplementary Table S11). To identify the cleavage sites, the 5′ RLM-RACE PCR products for  LOX and  ACX were analyzed. The sequencing results were shown in  Supplementary Figure S8. The results indicated that  LOX can be regulated by cleavage in the binding region between the 10 th and 11 th bases from the 5′ end pairing of novel_miR44, and  ACX can be regulated by cleavage in the binding region between the 9 th and 10 th bases from the 5′ end pairing of miR169d-5p_1 ( Figure 8B). This proved that  LOX and  ACX are directly cleaved by miRNAs. To further explore the regulatory networks of eTMs with miRNAs and target genes, the expression patterns of selected eTMs (LTCONS_00026271 and LTCONS_00020084), miRNAs (novel_miR44 and miR169d-5p_1), and target genes ( LOX: MTCONS_00093153 and  ACX: MTCONS_00008303) were analyzed. According to qRT-PCR analyses ( Figure 8C), the expression levels of LTCONS_00026271 and  LOX were significantly higher in the SW than in the FL and IW, whereas the expression level of novel_miR44 was lower in the SW than in the FL and IW. Additionally, LTCONS_00020084 and  ACX expression levels were also higher in the SW than in the FL and IW, whereas miR169d-5p_1 expression exhibited the opposite pattern. Moreover, the expression profiles of novel_miR44 and miR169d-5p_1 were confirmed by RT-PCR. These profiles were consistent with the miRNA expression levels determined by qRT-PCR. To further validate the correlations among expression levels, the expression of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in diverse leaf samples (bud, first leaf, second leaf, and third leaf) was investigated by qRT-PCR ( Supplementary Figure S9). On the basis of these results, we detected negative relationships between eTMs and miRNAs, as well as between miRNAs and target genes. Conversely, the expression levels of eTMs and target genes were positively correlated. The lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA regulatory network in the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway was also constructed ( Figure 8D). Together, these results suggested that lncRNAs may affect the expression of related mRNAs through miRNAs.","Oolong tea is a popular and semi-fermented beverage. During the processing of tea leaves, withering is the first indispensable process for improving flavor. However, the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and the characteristic secondary metabolites during the withering of oolong tea leaves remain unknown. In this study, phytochemical analyses indicated that total polyphenols, flavonoids, catechins, epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin gallate (CG), gallocatechin gallate (GCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were all less abundant in the solar-withered leaves (SW) than in the fresh leaves (FL) and indoor-withered leaves (IW). In contrast, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) contents were higher in the SW than in the FL and IW. By analyzing the transcriptome data, we detected 32,036 lncRNAs. On the basis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, the flavonoid metabolic pathway, the terpenoid metabolic pathway, and the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway were enriched pathways. Additionally, 63 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) and 23 target genes were identified related to the three pathways. A comparison of the expression profiles of the DE-lncRNAs and their target genes between the SW and IW revealed four up-regulated genes (FLS, CCR, CAD, and HCT), seven up-regulated lncRNAs, four down-regulated genes (4CL, CHI, F3H, and F3'H), and three down-regulated lncRNAs related to flavonoid metabolism; nine up-regulated genes (DXS, CMK, HDS, HDR, AACT, MVK, PMK, GGPPS, and TPS), three up-regulated lncRNAs, and six down-regulated lncRNAs related to terpenoid metabolism; as well as six up-regulated genes (LOX, AOS, AOC, OPR, ACX, and MFP2), four up-regulated lncRNAs, and three down-regulated lncRNAs related to JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction. These results suggested that the expression of DE-lncRNAs and their targets involved in the three pathways may be related to the low abundance of the total polyphenols, flavonoids, and catechins (EGC, CG, GCG, ECG, and EGCG) and the high abundance of terpenoids in the SW. Moreover, solar irradiation, high JA and MeJA contents, and the endogenous target mimic (eTM)-related regulatory mechanism in the SW were also crucial for increasing the terpenoid levels. These findings provide new insights into the greater contribution of solar-withering to the high-quality flavor of oolong tea compared with the effects of indoor-withering.","['Secondary metabolites', 'Camellia sinensis', 'Transcriptome', 'Long Non-coding Rnas', 'Withering']","['Target Genes', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Genes', 'lncRNAs', 'Supplementary Table', 'LTCONS', 'Target', 'Figure', 'expression', 'Supplementary']","[lignin, 203.47, FL, IW (171.83 mg/g, CG, C, SW, FL (410.18 mg/g, IW (449.65, E)-2-hexenal, E)-2-hexenal, E)-2-hexenal, JA, μg/g, μg/g, μg/g, IW (1.81 μg/g, μg/g, μg/g, μg/g, 32,036, 50,041, 0–1,000, 2018a, 26,508, ≤ 1, DE-lncRNAs, 4,964 DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNA, DE-lncRNAs, glutamate, JA, JA, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, anthocyanidin synthase, anthocyanidin reductase, lignin, 2017b, lignin metabolism-related, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, alcohol dehydrogenase, C4H, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, S5, LTCONS_00054003, LTCONS_00060939, LTCONS_00056216, LTCONS_00044497 (, LTCONS_00031811 (, LTCONS_00001863, LTCONS_00090121, LTCONS_00030131, LTCONS_00101116, phosphate cytidylyltransferase, geranyl diphosphate synthase, phosphomevalonate kinase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, xylulose-, phosphate synthase, methylbut- 2- enyl- diphosphate synthase, methylbut- 2- enyl- diphosphate reductase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, acetyl- CoA, acetyltransferase, hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA synthase, hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA reductase, JA/MeJA, lipoxygenase, enoyl- CoA hydratase/, CoA dehydrogenase, jasmonate O-methyltransferase, hydroperoxide lyase, AOS, LOX, alcohol dehydrogenase, alcohol acetyltransferase, JA/MeJA, JA/MeJA biosynthesis-related, JA, JA/MeJA, JA, JA/MeJA, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, JA/MeJA, JA/MeJA, LOX, DE-lncRNAs, JA/MeJA, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, JA/MeJA, JA/MeJA, LTCONS_00093140, LTCONS_00012676, LTCONS_00002173, LTCONS_00078708, LTCONS_00039845, LTCONS_00025739, LTCONS_00091745, LTCONS_00092790, LTCONS_00043160 (, LTCONS_00087608, LTCONS_00035664, LTCONS_00032547 (, LTCONS_00064473, LTCONS_00087182, LTCONS_00061187 (, S5, JA/MeJA, JA/MeJA, eTMs, eTMs, eTMs, LTCONS_00026271, LTCONS_00020084, miR169d-5p_1, JA/MeJA, miR169d-5p_1, novel_miR44, miR169d-5p_1 (, eTMs, eTMs, LTCONS_00026271, LTCONS_00020084, miR169d-5p_1, LOX, MTCONS_00093153, LTCONS_00026271, novel_miR44, LTCONS_00020084, miR169d-5p_1, novel_miR44, miR169d-5p_1, eTMs, eTMs, lncRNA–, JA/MeJA]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS),']",[],[],terpene synthase
102,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6945444\eupmc_result.json,PMC6945444,"Results Volatile compounds detected in Citrus leaves In eight sour-orange and three sweet-orange germplasms, 88 and 64 volatile compounds were detected, respectively. Monoterpenes were the most abundant in both orange species (Additional file  4: Figure S1). As many as 52 compounds were detected in the leaves of Goutou Cheng (Table  1), with  β-pinene being the most abundant, followed by linalool, caryophyllene, sabinene and  trans- β-ocimene. The most abundant compounds were linalyl acetate in Xiaoye sour orange; linalool and (+)-bicyclogermacrene in Defuniya sour orange; and  trans- β-ocimene and sabinene in sweet orange (Additional file  1: Table S1 and Additional file  3: Table S3). A total of 196 volatile compounds (Additional file  1: Table S1) were tentatively detected in the leaves of 62 citrus germplasms (Table  1) based on the NIST Mass Spectral Library, among which 57 compounds were identified with authentic standards (Additional file  2: Table S2). The 196 compounds could be classified into 16 groups, including 19 monoterpenes, 15 monoterpene alcohols, five monoterpene aldehydes, five monoterpene ketones, five monoterpene oxides, six monoterpene esters, 72 sesquiterpenes, 16 sesquiterpene alcohols, one sesquiterpene oxide, two sesquiterpene aldehydes, five alcohols, 15 aldehydes, five acids, five esters, four ketones and 16 other compounds (Additional file  1: Table S1).  The total volatile content (TVC) of different citrus germplasms ranged from 0.13 ± 0.01 mg/g (Xingshan sour orange) to 28.69 ± 1.94 mg/g (Yaoxianggan, YXG, loose-skin mandarin), and the number of compounds in each germplasm ranged from 13 (HB pummelo) to 69 (YXG) (Table  1). There was higher diversity of the dominant compounds among different species in leaves than in peels. For example, the most abundant compounds were citronellal, geranyl acetate and  trans-β-ocimene in papeda;  trans-β-ocimene, linalyl acetate, α-pinene, ( E)- β-farnesene and  γ-elemene in  Citrus ichangensis; sabinene,  γ-terpinene,  D-limonene and germacrene D in  Citrus junos;  D-limonene, α-citral,  β-citral and citronellal in citron;  β-pinene, (+)-bicyclogermacrene,  trans-β-ocimene and caryophyllene in pummelo; linalool,  trans-β-ocimene and  β-elemene in loose-skin mandarin; sabinene,  trans-β-ocimene and 3-carene in sweet orange; and linalyl acetate, linalool, caryophyllene and  β-pinene in sour orange (Additional file  3: Table S3). A total of 43 compounds were commonly detected in at least 20 germplasms, including 34 terpenoids. Notably, among these terpenoids, 31 were found at the highest levels in wild or semiwild germplasms. For example, eight terpenoids (sabinene,  β-myrcene,  D-limonene,  allo-ocimene, α-elemene,  β-elemene, (−)-humulene and germacrene D) were the most abundant in YXG; seven terpenoids (camphene,  β-pinene, isospathulenol, germacrene D-4-ol,  trans-β-ocimene, α-copaene and terpinolene) were at the highest levels in Niedu wild tangerine (NDT, loose-skin mandarin);  γ-elemene and germacrene B were the most abundant in Indian sour tangerine (loose-skin mandarin); (+)- δ-cadinene and (+)-bicyclogermacrene were the most abundant in Wulong sour mandarin (loose-skin mandarin); and α-phellandrene and 3-carene were the most abundant in Muli citron (citron) and Newhall navel orange (sweet orange), respectively (Table  2).  All 62 investigated germplasms could be classified into seven species. The TVC level was > 10 mg/g for most papeda and loose-skin mandarin germplasms; 3–10 mg/g for most  C. ichangensis germplasms, citron, sweet orange and sour orange germplasms; and < 2.5 mg/g for most pummelo germplasms (Fig. 1). Among all seven citrus species, loose-skin mandarin and sweet orange had the largest and smallest numbers of volatile compounds, respectively.  A total of 140 volatile compounds were detected in the leaves of 15 loose-skin mandarin germplasms. The total content varied widely from 2.39 ± 0.33 mg/g in Guoqing No.1 (GQ.1) to 28.69 ± 1.94 mg/g in YXG, and more than 50 compounds were identified in most loose-skin mandarin germplasms (Table  1). Monoterpenes accounted for 42–78% of the TVC in loose-skin mandarin, except in Chachi and red-tangerine (Additional file  4: Figure S1); Chachi and red-tangerine leaves specifically accumulated methyl anthranilate, which accounted for 69.88 and 43% of the TVC, respectively, while  D-limonene, linalool, and sabinene were dominant volatile compounds in other loose-skin mandarin germplasms. Sesquiterpenoids only accounted for 5% of the TVC in Chachi, which was significantly lower than that in other mandarin germplasms (Additional file  1: Table S1 and Additional file  5: Figure S2). In 10  C. ichangensis germplasms, 128 volatile compounds were detected, including 76 sesquiterpenoids, which accounted for 30–50% of the TVC (Table  1; Additional file  4: Figure S1). In  C. junos, 55 compounds were identified, including 47 terpenoids. Among these volatile compounds, 73 and 13 compounds were unique in  C. ichangensis and  C. junos, respectively (Additional file  1: Table S1). Although the number of compounds detected in  C. junos was lower than that detected in  C. ichangensis,  C. junos exhibited a higher TVC level. Notably, sabinene, the levels of  β-cubebene, germacrene D and  β-elemene in  C. junos were significantly higher than those in most  C. ichangensis germplasms (> 10-fold),while  trans-β-ocimene and (+)- δ-cadinene were present at significantly higher levels in  C. ichangensis than in  C. junos(> 10-fold) (Additional file  1: Table S1). In the leaves from 9 citron germplasms, 119 volatile compounds were identified, with TVC ranging from 4.03 ± 0.44 mg/g (Yuanjiang citron) to 15.52 ± 0.84 mg/g (red-limonia, RL) and number of compounds ranging from 41 (Danna citron) to 65 (lime) (Table  1). Monoterpenes were the dominant compounds in citron germplasms (Additional file  4: Figure S1). RL leaves contained 60 volatile compounds and had the highest TVC, with  D-limonene being the most abundant, followed by  β-pinene, ( Z, Z)-α-farnesene, and caryophyllene (Additional file  1: Table S1). In 12 pummelo germplasms, 73 volatile compounds were detected. The TVC ranged from 0.22 ± 0.03 mg/g (Kaopan pummelo) to 2.15 ± 0.12 mg/g (Shatian pummelo) (Table  1), with monoterpenes being the most abundant in most pummelo germplasms and accounting for more than 50% of the TVC (Additional file  4: Figure S1). The TVC of HB pummelo leaves was low (1.90 ± 0.26 mg/g), and sesquiterpenes were almost undetectable (Additional file  1: Table S1). CPCoA of Citrus species based on leaf volatile profiles CPCoA grouped the 62 citrus germplasms into six clusters based on the leaf volatiles: cluster 1, loose-skin mandarin; cluster 2,  C. ichangensis; cluster 3, sour orange; cluster 4, pummelo; cluster 5, papeda; and cluster 6, citron. Generally, different accessions of the same species were clustered together. Three  C. junos germplasms (GuanXian xiangcheng No.3, Qianjiang xiangcheng No.3 and Ziyang xiangcheng) were clustered with loose-skin mandarin (Fig. 2).  Mono- and Sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis in wild and cultivar Citrus Germplasms There were higher levels and a greater variety of volatile compounds, especially monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, in the leaves of most wild or semiwild germplasms than in the leaves of cultivars (Fig. 3c), which was consistent with the volatile profiles of the flavedo and juice sacs (Additional file  6: Figure S3). Comparison of the expression levels of terpenoid-related genes was conducted in two wild germplasms (JYYJ and DXYJ) and two cultivars (BTJ and QTJ). In the wild germplasms, the expression of  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoAsynthase-2 ( HMGS-2),  mevalonate kinase ( MVK),  phosphomevalonate kinase ( PMK) and  farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase ( FPPS) in the MVA pathway and  geranyl pyrophosphate synthase ( GPPS) in the MEP pathway was significantly higher than that in the cultivars. In addition,  geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase ( GGPPS) in the MEP pathway, which is involved in the metabolism of carotenoids, abscisic acid (ABA) and diterpenes, showed significantly lower expression in the wild germplasms than in the cultivars (Fig. 3)ab.  To further clarify the expression level of terpenoid-related genes in the MVA and MEP pathways in wild and cultivar germplasms, leaf samples from 10 wild and 10 cultivar citrus germplasms were used for RT-qPCR analysis. (Additional file  7: Table S4). The expression levels of most genes showed the same tendency between the wild and cultivar citrus germplasms by RT-qPCR and transcriptome data analysis. RT-qPCR results showed that the expression levels of most genes in the MVA pathway in the wild citrus germplasms were higher than those in the cultivars, while most genes in the MEP pathway were not significantly different between the wild and cultivar germplasms. In the wild germplasms, the expression of  GPPS ( GPPS-1 and GPPS-2) was higher than that in the cultivars, while  GGPPS showed lower expression in the wild germplasms than in the cultivars (Fig. 4 and Additional file  8: Figure S4).  Volatile profiles in flowers A total of 82 volatile compounds were detected in citrus flowers from 25 germplasms at two opening stages (balloon stage, F1; fully open stage, F2), including 60 terpenoids and 22 other compounds (Additional file  9: Table S5). The TVC ranged from 1414.33 ± 51.39 μg/g (GQ1, F1) to 6235.60 ± 142.94 μg/g (Star Ruby grapefruit, SRG, F1), and the number of compounds ranged from 19 (Fenghuang pummelo, FHP, F1&F2) to 45 (SRG, F2) (Additional file  9: Table S5). Terpenoids were the most abundant volatiles in citrus flowers, accounting for more than 80% of the TVC in most citrus germplasms, with the exception of red-tangerine (approximately 39%) (Additional file  10: Table S6). The dominant compounds in flowers varied among different species: sabinene was the major compound in sweet orange, followed by  D-limonene and linalool; γ-terpinene was the most abundant in most loose-skin mandarin germplasms, with the exception of red-tangerine (dimethyl anthranilate);  D-limonene and  β-ocimene were dominant in pummelo; and  D-limonene,  β-pinene and  β-ocimene were the most abundant in lemon (Additional file  9: Table S5 and Additional file  10: Table S6). In contrast to the volatiles in leaves, 8-hydroxylinalool was unique to flowers, and the levels of α-sinensal, sabinene, nerolidol and farnesol in flowers were much higher than those in leaves, while the linalool content was similar to that in leaves. However, for most volatiles, such as caryophyllene and germacrene D, lower levels were detected in flowers (Additional file  11: Figure S5). Within the same germplasm, flower volatile profiles were generally similar between the two investigated stages (Additional file  12: Table S7). However, at the fully open stage, the levels of linalool, 8-hydroxylinalool, nerolidol, and farnesol significantly increased in sweet orange, whereas that of sabinene decreased (Additional file  13: Figure S6). Pummelo showed significant increases in linalool, nerolidol, and farnesol levels, whereas decreases in  β-myrcene,  β-pinene and sabinene levels were observed. Loose-skin mandarin and lemon showed increases in farnesol levels (Additional file  9: Table S5). DEG profile in Cara Cara navel Orange flowers and characterization of  STPS A total of 36 volatile compounds were detected in the flowers of Cara Cara navel orange, including 27 terpenoids (Additional file  9: Table S5), with sabinene as the most abundant compound. The flowers at two opening stages were used for transcriptomic analysis, and a total of 35.8 G high-quality base pairs (at least 5.2 G for each sample) were obtained. Approximately 96.16–98.19% of the total reads were aligned to the sweet orange genome. Among the aligned reads, 89.67–92.41% were uniquely aligned, and 5.64–6.59% were mapped to multiple loci (Additional file  14: Table S8). In total, the expression patterns of 18,654 and 18,267 expressed genes in F1 and F2, respectively, had FPKM values higher than 0.5. The average FPKM values were 33.17 and 44.53, and the expressed genes with FPKM values ranging from 1 to 100 were 86.71 and 85.24% of all the unigenes in F1 and F2, respectively. There were 1013 and 626 genes expressed in only F1 and F2, respectively (Additional file  15: Figure S7). A total of 2528 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by RNA-Seq analysis (| Log 2FC | > 1.5 and  P-value < 0.05) (Additional file  16: Table S9). GO annotation and enrichment results were mainly associated with plant metabolites, such as lignin, phenylpropanoids, second metabolites and aromatics (Additional file  17: Figure S8). Compared with balloon-stage flowers, 1281 and 1247 genes were significantly up- and downregulated, respectively, in fully open flowers. Among these DEGs, 47  TPS and 65  CYP450 genes were found (Additional file  18: Table S10). Correlation analysis between the terpene profiles and gene expression levels revealed that the content of sabinene and the expression level of  Cs3g04360 had the highest Pearson correlation coefficient (0.95). The Pearson correlation coefficient was higher than 0.9 between linalool content and 10  TPS genes (Cs5g23540, Cs5g22980, Cs2g03570, Cs3g21560, Cs2g22180, Cs2g07250, Cs2g07240, Cs2g06470, Cs2g07230 and Cs7g17670) (Additional file  17: Figure S8 and Additional file  18: Table S10). The Pearson correlation coefficient was higher than 0.9 between 8-hydroxylinalool and 36  CYP450 genes, including seven CYP76C subfamily genes. Those candidate genes maybe contribute to the production of the corresponding volatile terpenes. According to the high Pearson correlation coefficient, a  TPS candidate gene named  STPS in this study was cloned from Cara Cara navel orange flower, with an open reading frame of 1824 bp and encoding a protein of 607 amino acids (Additional file  19: Table S11), which was similar to that encoded by  Cs3g04360 but with 10 different residues (Additional file  20: Figure S9 A). The protein contained the expected divalent-metal-binding region (DDXXD) necessary for TPS activity and the RRX 8W motif common to cyclic-monoterpene-producing enzymes (Additional file  21: Table S12). The expression of  STPS significantly decreased in fully open flowers (Additional file  20: Figure S9 B). Recombinant proteins were expressed in  E. coli and purified using a combination of Ni 2+ affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Western blot analysis showed that a prokaryotic expression vector that produced a large amount of protein was successfully constructed (Additional file  17: Figure S8 CD). With the addition of GPP or FPP in vitro, GC-MS detection after solvent extraction showed that STPS catalyzed the conversion of GPP to monoterpenes, including 61.26% sabinene, 18.68%  D-limonene, 7.89% linalool, 5.65%  trans-β-ocimene, 4.32%  β-myrcene, and 2.20% α-pinene (Fig.  5). No terpene compounds were detected when FPP was used as a substrate. ","BACKGROUND:Previous reports have mainly focused on the volatiles in citrus fruits, and there have been few reports about the volatiles in citrus leaves and flowers. However, citrus leaves and flowers are also rich in volatile compounds with unique aromas. Here, to investigate the volatiles in citrus leaves and flowers, volatile profiling was performed on leaves from 62 germplasms and flowers from 25 germplasms. RESULTS:In total, 196 and 82 volatile compounds were identified from leaves of 62 citrus germplasms and flowers of 25 citrus germplasms, respectively. The dominant volatile terpenoids were more diverse in citrus leaves than in peels. A total of 34 volatile terpenoids were commonly detected in the leaves of at least 20 germplasms, among which 31 were overaccumulated in the leaves of wild or semiwild germplasms. This result was consistent with the high expression levels of five genes and one key gene of the mevalonate and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) biosynthetic pathways, respectively, as well as the low expression levels of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase of the MEP pathway, relative to the levels in cultivars. Fully open flowers showed increased levels of four terpene alcohols and a decrease in sabinene content compared with balloon-stage flowers, especially in sweet orange. A monoterpene synthase gene was identified and functionally characterized as a sabinene synthase in vitro. CONCLUSIONS:Collectively, our results suggest that 31 important terpenoids are abundant in wild or semiwild citrus germplasms, possibly because of a negative effect of domestication on the volatiles in citrus leaves. The sweet smell of fully open flowers may be attributed to increased levels of four terpene alcohols. In addition, a sabinene synthase gene was identified by combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses.","['Citrus', 'Volatile Profile', 'Terpenoid Biosynthesis', 'Stps', 'Wild Or Semiwild Germplasms']","['Additional file', 'Additional', 'Table', 'file', 'Volatile compounds', 'compounds', 'germplasms', 'Figure', 'loose-skin mandarin', 'citrus germplasms']","[sour-orange, (+)-bicyclogermacrene, α-pinene, E)-, α-citral, Niedu, (+)-bicyclogermacrene, red-tangerine (Additional , TVC (Table, Monoterpenes, TVC (Additional file, CPCoA, CPCoA, GuanXian xiangcheng, xiangcheng, xiangcheng, JYYJ, DXYJ, QTJ, mevalonate kinase, pyrophosphate synthase, FPPS, geranyl pyrophosphate synthase, GPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, GGPPS, abscisic acid, ABA, GPPS-2, S5, 1414.33 ± 51.39 μg/g, 6235.60 ± 142.94 μg/g, SRG, F2), S5, red-tangerine, γ-terpinene, red-tangerine, S5, Additional , α-sinensal, S5, S5, S5, 96.16–98.19, 89.67–92.41, F2, F2, F2, Cs5g23540, Cs5g22980, Cs2g03570, Cs3g21560, Cs2g22180, Cs2g07250, Cs2g07240, Cs2g06470, Cs7g17670, CYP76C, cyclic-monoterpene-producing enzymes (Additional , S12, Ni 2]","['STPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'STPS', 'TPS', 'STPS', 'STPS']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']","['Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus']",NaN
103,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6986037\eupmc_result.json,PMC6986037,"Results Transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly of  Z. armatum The total RNA of five major sample types, including roots (Ro), stems (St), leaf buds (LB), mature leaves (ML) and fruits (Fr), was isolated to construct the comprehensive transcriptome of  Z. armatum. The quality of the RNA was determined using the OD260/OD280 ratio (1.88–2.21) and RIN (7.60–10.00) (Additional file  1: Table S1). A total of 126.89 G of paired-end raw reads were produced by transcriptome sequencing. After trimming adapters and low-quality bases, 7.92–9.91 G of clean bases were produced from 15 cDNA libraries in this study (Additional file  2: Table S2). The error rate of RNA-seq was only approximately 0.02%, all of the Q30 values were greater than 93.90%, and the GC content was above 43% in each sample. In addition, an assembly of 350,625 transcripts was achieved, with a mean length of 1219 bp for the  Z. armatum transcriptome (Additional file  3: Figure S1a). The longest transcript of each gene was chosen from the assembly results as the candidate unigene. Finally, a set of 111,318 unigenes was obtained in the present study (Additional file  3: Figure S1b). The length of the unigenes ranged from 301 to 17,299 bp, with an average of 1014 bp, and the lengths of more than half of the unigenes in the total assembly were greater than 1454 bp ( N50 = 1454). Identification of simple sequence repeats In recent years, various molecular markers have been widely developed in different plants to construct plant genetic maps, perform gene localization, determine hybrid purity, and examine other aspects. To obtain abundant molecular markers for the genetic analysis and marker-assisted selection breeding of  Z. armatum, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified in our transcriptome (Fig.  1). Mono- to hexanucleotide SSRs were identified using MISA software (Fig.  1, Additional file  4: Table S3). A total of 46,098 SSR loci were characterized, among which mononucleotide repeats were the most abundant (30,266, 65.66%), followed by dinucleotides (8528, 18.50%). Moreover, at least 9–12 repeats were detected among the monomer nucleotide SSRs. However, di- to hexanucleotide SSRs were explored mostly in the context of 5 to 8 repeats. These results indicated that high variation might exist in  Z. armatum. Gene functional annotation After assembly, all the unigenes were subjected to BLASTx analysis against five public databases, including NR, NT, KO, Pfam, and KOG, to characterize their gene functions (Additional file  5: Figure S2, Table  1). A total of 73,426 (65.96%) unigenes were annotated in at least one database. The highest annotation rate was obtained in the NR database, which assigned 61,598 (55.34%) unigenes. A total of 34,930 (31.38%) and 16,316 (14.66%) unigenes were annotated with the Pfam and KOG databases, respectively. The top-scoring BLASTx hits against the NR protein database showed that the E-value distribution presented a comparable pattern with 50.70% of the mapped sequences with high homologies (< 1e-45), whereas the E-values for 49.30% of the homologous sequences ranged between 1e-5 and 1e-45 (Additional file  5: Figure S2a). The distribution of sequence similarity showed that 53.90% of the mapped sequences presented similarities higher than 80%, while 10.50% of the hits exhibited similarities lower than 60% (Additional file  5: Figure S2b). Additionally, the species distribution of the NR BLASTx matches showed that the top three species were  Citrus clementina (21.80%),  Citrus unshiu (19.00%) and  Citrus sinensis (16.10%), and all of these species and  Z. armatum belonged to Rutaceae (Additional file  5: Figure S2d). All the above results indicated that a high-quality annotation was obtained in the present study.  Moreover, 34,930 (31.37%) unigenes were annotated with 55 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, including 26 terms related to biological processes, 19 terms related to cellular components, and 10 terms associated with molecular functions (Additional file  6: Figure S3). Under the biological process, cellular component and molecular function categories, the predominant groups were assigned to the cellular process (GO: 0009987) and metabolic process (GO: 0008152); cell (GO: 0005623) and cell part (GO: 0044464); and binding (GO: 0005488) and catalytic activity (GO: 0003824) terms, respectively. To further understand the biological functions and interactions of the unigenes, they were also classified into metabolic pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). A total of 24,137 unigenes (21.68%) were assigned to 19 categories divided into five clusters, including cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, metabolism and organismal systems (Additional file  7: Figure S4). Among the KEGG pathways (Additional file  8: Table S4), the top five categories were translation (2916 unigenes), carbohydrate metabolism (2226 unigenes), overview (1771 unigenes), folding and degradation (1659 unigenes), and amino acid metabolism (1394 unigenes). All of these results showed that the investigated samples were characterized by active cell development and differentiation. Four hundred and twenty two unigenes were annotated with metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, and 376 of which were related to monoterpenoid, diterpenoid, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid, limonene and pinene, carotenoid, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathways. Additionally, 314 unigenes were involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism. These unigenes were the main substances associated with fatty acid and aromatic compound accumulation. It is worth noting that all of these putative genes were differentially expressed among the five different samples in this study (Additional file  9: Figure S5, Additional file  10: Figure S6), and more unigenes were up-regulation in the fruit samples. This suggested that some organ-specific unigenes might be existed in various tissues, and the fruit could be the mainly organs to accumulate the numbing-taste related compounds. Investigation of organ-specific unigenes The Pearson correlation analysis revealed that all three independent biological replicates of each sample presented good reproducibility in the present study, and the stem samples showed the highest correlation coefficient among all of the investigated organs (Additional file  11: Figure S7). To further analyse the characteristics of the genes related to the different organs, the organ-specific unigenes of the five major samples were screened on the basis of a  p value < 0.05 and |log2(fold change)| >5. The expression values (FPKM) for each comparison were for one organ and the sum of other organs. The investigation of the organ-specific unigenes expressed in each organ showed that 4970, 90, 2314, 1955, and 650 unigenes were specifically found in the roots, stems, leaf buds, mature leaves, and fruits, respectively (Additional file  12: Figure S8a-e). The root samples (Ro) expressed the most unigenes (49.80%), including 2653 upregulated and 2317 downregulated genes (Additional file  12: Figure S8f). The stems and fruits expressed the fewest unigenes (0.90 and 6.51%, respectively). To evaluate the functional properties of these organ-specific unigenes, KEGG enrichment was performed, and the significant pathways of each organ are listed in (Additional file  13: Table S5). Seventeen KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in root samples, including flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, terpenoid biosynthesis, alkaloid biosynthesis, and zeatin biosynthesis, which indicated that the most active biological synthesis was occurring in the roots of  Z. armatum. Only two significant KEGG pathways (five unigenes) were observed in the stem samples. Additionally, 14 and 16 KEGG pathways were distinctively obtained in the LB and ML samples, respectively. In both cases, the greatest enrichment was observed for phenyl propanoid biosynthesis, glycerolipid metabolism, galactose metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways, which supply the necessary substances for the growth and development of these tissues. However, unigenes involved in plant hormone signal transduction, flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthesis and metabolism were detected at significant levels in ML samples, which might contribute to the numbing taste and peppery flavour of the leaves of  Z. armatum. Additionally, 18 significant KEGG pathways were identified in the Fr samples, most of which were enriched in terpenoid, alkaloid and flavonoid biosynthesis. These unigenes might be the main source of the special numbing taste of the fruits of  Z. armatum. Identification and characterization of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis The analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was carried out in the five major organs of  Z. armatum. To comprehensively reveal the key genes associated with the special numbing taste in the fruits of  Z. armatum, genes with a  p value < 0.05 and a |log2(fold change)| >1 identified by EdgeR were regarded as DEGs in the comparisons of fruit samples and other organs (Fr vs. Ro, Fr vs. St, Fr vs. LB, and Fr vs. ML). As a result, a total of 3091 DEGs were co-detected in all four comparisons (Fig.  2a), 1625 of which were co-screened and found to be upregulated in all four comparisons (Fig.  2b), whereas 251 of which were co-identified and found to be downregulated in all four comparisons (Fig.  2c). The KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the downregulated DEGs were mainly related to plant hormone signal transduction and amino and sugar metabolism pathways (Additional file  14: Table S6). However, most of the upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in terpenoid, alkaloid, flavonoid and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism (Fig.  2d, Additional file  14: Table S6). Thus, the following analysis was mainly focused on the upregulated unigenes to explore the genetic information associated with the special numbing taste in  Z. armatum.  In total, 53 DEGs were identified as candidate unigenes for 12 enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, and their expression values in the five major organs and TAIR10 annotations are shown in (Additional file  15: Table S7) and  (Additional file  16: Table S8). These enzymes constituted two independent subpathways upstream of the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway (Fig.  3a), both of which utilize glycolysis to obtain the initial substrate for producing dimethylallyl diphosphate (dimethylallyl- PP). Then, dimethylallyl- PP is used to generate monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, triterpenoids, and other terpenoid compounds [ 14], which are the main aromatic substances involved in the special numbing taste in the fruits of  Z. armatum [ 10]. In the present study, the results showed that almost all genes involved in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis were differentially expressed genes and detected at significant levels in the fruit samples (Fig.  3a).  To further characterize the functional properties of these DEGs, some of the DEGs were selected to perform qRT-PCR detection during fruit development and maturation. A total of eight fruit samples were collected to investigate these genes (Additional file  17: Figure S10): in Fr1, 5 days after fertilization, the fruit was green-yellowish with a smooth surface; in Fr2, 15 days after fertilization, the fruit was oval with some slightly concave and transparent speckling on the surface; in Fr3, 28 days after fertilization, the fruit was green and grew rapidly; in Fr4, 40 days after fertilization, the fruit was further expanded with obvious speckles; in Fr5, 50 days after fertilization, the fruit gradually stopped expanding, and inclusions began to accumulate within the speckles; in Fr6, 62 days after fertilization, the fruit was dark green, and significant speckles accumulated additional inclusions; in Fr7, 75 days after fertilization, the fruit gradually matured and exhibited many inclusions within speckles; and in Fr8, 85 days after fertilization, the fruit was completely mature, and the special numbing taste was fully developed. Two unigenes, Cluster-12,235.37800 and Cluster-12,235.28045, were annotated to mevalonate kinase 1 ( MVK1) and phosphomevalonate kinase ( PMVK), respectively, which belong to the MVA pathway and play rate-determining roles in the production of mevalonate- 5PP. The results showed that both of these unigenes were significantly upregulated in the Fr4 stage but showed lower expression in the preceding and the subsequent stages of fruit development and maturation, especially in the Fr7 and Fr8 stages. Cluster-12,235.38535 and Cluster-12,235.46034 were annotated to deoxy- D-xylulose phosphate synthase ( DXS), which catalyses the initial step in the transformation of  D-glyceraldehyde-phosphate into deoxy- D-xylulose-phosphate in the MEP pathway. The results showed that both of these unigenes were significantly upregulated in the Fr4 stage but downregulated in the preceding and subsequent stages of fruit development and maturation (Fig.  3b). Additionally, unigenes involved in two enzymes in the MEP pathway, Cluster-12,235.31323 ( ZaISPE) and Cluster-12,235.41588 ( ZaGCPE), presented similar expression patterns in the fruit development and maturation stages. Moreover, Cluster-12,235.40340, a key unigene annotated to geranyl-geranyl diphosphate synthase 12 ( GGPPS12), which generates important substrates associated with the biosynthesis of various terpenoid compounds, presented gradual up-regulation from the Fr1 to Fr4 stages, whereas it was significantly downregulated in the Fr4 to Fr8 stages. A consistent result was that  ZaTPS03 (Cluster-12,235.42010) was exclusively upregulated in Fr4 samples of  Z. armatum; this unigene is related to the catalysis of the production of (R)-limonene as well as other related compounds using geranyl- PP via the monoterpenoid biosynthesis process. These results indicated that the Fr4 stage could be the core period for the initiation of terpenoid compound biosynthesis and the accumulation of these compounds in the fruit development and maturation process of  Z. armatum. Identification and characterization of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis Based on KEGG enrichment, a total of 20 DEGs were screened and annotated to fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation processes (Additional file  14: Table S6, Fig.  2d). The expression values of these candidate unigenes in the five major organs and their TAIR10 annotations are shown in (Additional file  15: Table S7) and (Additional file  16: Table S8). Moreover, all 20 DEGs were only associated with six subfamilies, including the ACP desaturase 5 ( AAD5), acyl-activating enzyme 16 ( AAE16), ketoacyl-ACP synthetase II ( KASII), long-chain acyl-CoA synthase ( LACS), ketoacyl-CoA synthase ( KCS), and oxoacyl-acyl-carrier protein reductase ( FabG) subfamilies, for which homologous  Arabidopsis sequences were not identified in the TAIR10 protein database. Additionally,  KASII,  FabG, and  AAD5 were significantly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways (Fig.  4a), whereas  LACS and  KCS were mainly associated with long-chain fatty acid biosynthetic and metabolic processes (Additional file  16: Table S8).  Furthermore,  ZaKASII (Cluster-12,235.36948), a key synthetase related to the elongation of 16-carbon palmitoyl-ACP to produce 18-carbon stearoyl-ACP, was significantly upregulated in the Fr4 stage (Fig.  4b) but presented relatively low expression in the preceding and subsequent stages, especially in the fruit maturation process (Fr7-Fr8). However, Cluster-12,235.36948, annotatedto  FabG, which reduces3-Oxo- N-ACP to form 3-hydroxy- N-ACP, was not only upregulated in the Fr4 stage but also showed higher expression in the Fr6-Fr8 stages. It is worth noting that two unigenes annotated to  ZaAAD5, Cluster-12,235.43479 and Cluster-12,235.42753, showed similar patterns and were exclusively upregulated in the Fr6 stage. Both of these unigenes are involved in important reactions in the formation of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids. Identification and characterization of genes involved in fatty acid degradation A total of 168 unigenes were annotated to fatty acid degradation pathways in the transcriptome database analysed in the present study, and 14 DEGs were screened and found to be significantly upregulated in fruit samples according to KEGG enrichment analysis (Additional file  14:Table S6, Fig.  2d). The expression values of these candidate DEGs in the five major organs and their TAIR10 annotations are also listed in (Additional file  15: Table S7) and  (Additional file  16: Table S8). Interestingly, the major pathway of fatty acid degradation was beta-oxidation catabolism, and the main enzymes involved in each step were identified in our DEG profiles, which included long-chain acyl-CoA synthase ( LACS), acyl-CoA oxidase ( ACX), multifunctional protein 2 ( MFP2), hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( HADH), ketoacyl-CoA thiolase ( KAT) and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase 2 ( ACAT2) (Fig.  5a).  The two  LACS genes were investigated in the present study, whose encoded proteins catalyse the initial reactions of the fatty acid degradation process. Cluster-12,235.42753, annotated to  ZaLACS1, was only very significantly upregulated in the Fr4 stage (Fig.  5b), whereas Cluster-12,235.42753 ( ZaLACS6) was not only upregulated in the Fr4 stage but was also highly expressed in the Fr6 stage. Similar results were obtained for  ZaACX3 (Cluster-12,235.39988) and  ZaMFP2 (Cluster-12,235.50349), which catalyse the first and second reactions of fatty acid  β-oxidation, respectively, and presented two peaks of upregulation (Fr4 and Fr6). Additionally, their downstream oxidase,  ZaKATII (Cluster-12,235.55699), which generates and releases CoA, was distinctively upregulated in the Fr4 and Fr6 stages. Additionally,  ZaACAT2 (Cluster-12,235.42348), which is involved in a key step in the transformation of acetoacetyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA, was still highly expressed in the Fr4 and Fr6 stages of  Z. armatum. qRT-PCR validation To experimentally confirm the RNA-seq data, eight DEGs (with 21 terms) detected in Frvs. Ro, Frvs. St, Frvs.LB, Frvs.ML, LB vs. Ro, ML vs.LB, ML vs. Ro, and ML vs. St were tested by qRT-PCR (Additional file  18: Table S9). These genes were randomly selected based on their high fold changes indicating their crucial functions identified in this study. The results for all of these genes were consistent and showed the same trend of up- or downregulation between the qRT-PCR and the RNA-seq platform (Additional file  19: Figure S11). The correlation coefficient for the two expression measurements was 0.8059 between these 24 terms ( R2 = 0.8059). In summary, the results suggested that our transcriptome data accurately reflected the expression patterns of most genes in  Z. armatum.","BACKGROUND:Zanthoxylum armatum (Z. armatum) is a highly economically important tree that presents a special numbing taste. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of the numbing taste remains poorly understood. Thus, the elucidation of the key genes associated with numbing taste biosynthesis pathways is critical for providing genetic information on Z. armatumand the breeding of high-quality germplasms of this species. RESULTS:Here, de novo transcriptome assembly was performed for the five major organs of Z. armatum, including the roots, stems, leaf buds, mature leaves and fruits. A total of 111,318 unigenes were generated with an average length of 1014 bp. Additionally, a large number of SSRs were obtained to improve our understanding of the phylogeny and genetics of Z. armatum. The organ-specific unigenes of the five major samples were screened and annotated via GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. A total of 53 and 34 unigenes that were exclusively upregulated in fruit samples were identified as candidate unigenes for terpenoid biosynthesis or fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation and degradation pathways, respectively. Moreover, 40 days after fertilization (Fr4 stage) could be an important period for the accumulation of terpenoid compounds during the fruit development and maturation of Z. armatum. The Fr4 stage could be a key point at which the first few steps of the fatty acid biosynthesis process are promoted, and the catalysis of subsequent reactions could be significantly induced at 62 days after fertilization (Fr6 stage). CONCLUSIONS:The present study realized de novo transcriptome assembly for the five major organs of Z. armatum. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive analysis revealing the genes underlying the special numbing taste of Z. armatum. The assembled transcriptome profiles expand the available genetic information on this species and will contribute to gene functional studies, which will aid in the engineering of high-quality cultivars of Z. armatum.","['Aromatic compounds', 'Fatty acid', 'Zanthoxylum Armatum', 'De Novo Transcriptome']","['Additional file', 'Additional', 'unigenes', 'file', 'Table', 'Figure', 'Fig.', 'fruit', 'biosynthesis', 'Genes']","[LB, 7.92–9.91 G, RNA-seq, 350,625, 111,318, S1b, SSRs, SSRs, 30,266, 9–12, SSRs, SSRs, KOG, 73,426, 61,598, 34,930 (, KOG, 34,930 (, S5, numbing-taste, |log2(fold change)|, S5, Fr, Fr, St, Fr, LB, Fr vs. ML, TAIR10, Fr3, Fr4, Fr7, Fr8, Cluster-12,235.37800, Cluster-12,235.28045, mevalonate kinase 1, MVK1, phosphomevalonate kinase, PMVK, mevalonate-, Fr4, Fr7, Fr8, Cluster-12,235.38535, Cluster-12,235.46034, Fr4, Cluster-12,235.31323 ( ZaISPE, Cluster-12,235.41588 ( ZaGCPE, Cluster-12,235.40340, geranyl-geranyl diphosphate synthase 12, GGPPS12, Fr4, Fr4, Fr4, Fr4, S6, TAIR10, ACP desaturase 5, AAD5, acyl-activating enzyme 16, AAE16, ketoacyl-ACP synthetase II, KASII, LACS, ketoacyl-CoA synthase, oxoacyl-acyl-carrier protein reductase, FabG, TAIR10, Cluster-12,235.36948, Fr4, Cluster-12,235.36948, annotatedto  , reduces3-Oxo- N-ACP, N-ACP, Fr4, Fr6-Fr8, Cluster-12,235.43479, Cluster-12,235.42753, TAIR10, LACS, acyl-CoA oxidase, MFP2, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, HADH, ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, KAT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase 2, ACAT2, Cluster-12,235.42753, Fr4, Cluster-12,235.42753, ZaLACS6, Fr4, Cluster-12,235.39988, Cluster-12,235.50349, Fr4, oxidase, Cluster-12,235.55699, Fr4, Cluster-12,235.42348, acetoacetyl-CoA, Fr4, Frvs, Frvs, Frvs, Frvs, LB, Ro]",['ZaTPS03'],[],"['Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus']",NaN

Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Attack Significantly Increased Geraniol Emission from Tea Leaves Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii is the corrected scientific name of tea green leafhopper in China, one of the main pests in tea production regions [ 24]. In tea fields,  E. (M.) onukii-infested tea leaves show changes in appearance. Here, we investigated the effect of  E. (M.) onukii infestation on the formation and emission of geraniol, a volatile monoterpene derived from GPP. We conducted these experiments in the laboratory to exclude the effects of other factors (e.g., other insects/climatic conditions). Compared with control tea leaves, those infested by  E. (M.) onukii showed a significant increase in geraniol emission ( Figure 1a). However, infestation by  E. (M.) onukii did not affect the activity of GES in tea leaves ( Figure 1b). 3.2. Crude Enzyme Extract of Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Produced Geraniol from Greanyl Diphosphate Since the activity of tea leaves GES was not increased after  E. (M.) onukii attack, it was presumed that the geraniol accumulation may induced by GES which was from  E. (M.) onukii. To investigate whether elicitors such as enzymes involved in geraniol formation were present in  E. (M.) onukii, we extracted  E. (M.) onukii using buffer, and added GPP as the substrate. In contrast to controls (GPP or crude extract only), the reaction solution containing GPP and the insect extract specifically produced geraniol, but not other volatile monoterpenes such as linalool. The GES activity was higher in the body part than in the head part of  E. (M.) onukii ( Figure 2,  Table S3). These results confirmed that  E. (M.) onukii contains GES, which generates geraniol from GPP. 3.3. Terpene synthase from Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Was Able to Convert Greanyl Diphosphate to Geraniol Although typical terpene synthase was not found in insect genomic and transcriptomic sequences [ 22], the isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDSs) such as terpene synthases have been reported in  Phyllotreta striolata and  Ips pini [ 22, 25]. A full-length transcriptome of whole  E. (M.) onukii insect was sequenced with three generation PacBio sequencing technology (unpublished data). Three isoprenyl diphosphate synthases including two farnesyl diphosphate (FPPS,  EoFPPS1 and  EoFPPS2) homologue genes and one geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS,  EoTPS) homologue genes were found in this full-length transcriptome. These three genes were cloned from  E. (M.) onukii successfully. The full length of EoFPPS1 (GenBank Accession Number MH383157) was 1179 bps, encoding 392 amino acids. The full length of EoFPPS2 (GenBank Accession Number MH383158) was 1287 bps, encoding 428 amino acids. The full length of EoTPS (GenBank Accession Number MH383159) was 912 bps, encoding 303 amino acids. The calculated molecular masses of EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, and EoTPS were 45, 49, and 35 kDa, respectively. Neighbor-joining tree was generated with other isoprenyl diphosphate synthases in insect. The two farnesyl diphosphate synthase, EoFPPS1 and EoFPPS2, belong to the FPP synthase family. They clustered together with the other characterized FPPS from beetles in phylogenetic trees and were closest to the  Phaedon cochleariae FPPS ( Figure 3). The geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, EoTPS, belongs to the GGPP synthase type III family ( Figure 3) and it was closest with the  Choristoneura fumiferana GGPPS in the phylogenetic analysis. These genes were heterologously expressed in  Escherichia coli ( Figure 4a). Among these three genes, EoFPPS1 was predicted to be mitochondrion localized. To better determine the enzymatic activity of EoFPPS1, the ORF lacking pupative mitochondrial targeting peptide (the first 25 amino acids, EoFPPS1S) was also expressed in  E. coli ( Figure 4a). The activity assay results showed that only EoTPS converted GPP to geraniol ( Figure 4b,  Figure S1). It was presumed that prokaryotic expression systems may not be suitable for functional protein expression. Therefore, EoFPPS1 and EoFPPS2 were also expressed in insect Sf9 cells. The results showed that there is no difference of geraniol formation between EoFPPS1 and empty vector, or between EoFPPS2 and empty vector. Therefore, the enzyme activity assay with insect Sf9 cell expression system also proved that EoFPPS1 and EoFPPS2 could not convert GPP to geraniol ( Figure 5). 3.4. Geraniol Synthase Also Existed in Other Insects To identify whether GES was conserved in insects, the GES activity was also determined in other insects including larvae of  Ectropis oblique and  Euproctis pseudoconspersa, and adult of  Cylas formicarius. The activity was measured with crude enzyme extracted from different insects. The monoterpene synthase assay results showed that only geraniol was produced using GPP as a substrate ( Figure 6). No significant difference was observed in linalool formation between enzyme reaction and GPP self-degradation control ( Figure 6). These results suggested that GES was the monoterpene synthase that existed in these insects. 3.5. Geraniol Had in Vitro Ability to Inhibit the Growth of Endobacterial Isolated from Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii To isolate the endobacteria in  E. (M.) onukii, the dissected insect pieces were incubated in LB plate until the bacteria colonies appeared. Then, the grown bacterial was further purified to obtain single colony. The bacteria DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced. For preliminary identification, the 16S rRNA sequences were analyzed with BLASTn in GenBank database. Isolation A showed similarity of 99.86% with uncultured  Acinetobacter sp. (AB908752). Isolation B showed similarity of 99.79% with  Pseucomonas fulva (FJ972539). Isolation C showed similarity of 99.79% with  Acinetobacter johnsonii (CP037424). In the next steps, these three 16S rRNA sequences were aligned with other sequences of different species in GenBank database. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. The similar results were found in phylogenetic analysis ( Figure 7). These endobacteria were also found in other insects [ 26, 27, 28, 29].  Acinetobacter group was reported to be the major endobacteria in other insects [ 26].  Acinetobacter johnsonii is a common endosymbiont in insect [ 27, 28]. Therefore, in our present study, isolation C  Acinetobacter johnsonii was chosen to initially analyze the potential antibacterial activity of geraniol. The results showed that geraniol could inhibit the isolation C growth in vitro. The geraniol concentration of 500 μg/mL inhibited the isolation C growth in LB medium effectively according to the OD 600 analysis ( Table 1). The isolated C colony  Acinetobacter johnsonii was used for antibacterial activity assay. The experiments were performed in three replicates.","When insects attack plants, insect-derived elicitors and mechanical damage induce the formation and emission of plant volatiles that have important ecological functions and flavor properties. These events have mainly been studied in model plants, rather than crop plants. Our study showed that tea green leafhopper (Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Matsuda), a major pest infesting tea attack significantly induced the emission of geraniol from tea leaves, but did not affect the crude enzyme activity of geraniol synthase in tea leaves. An enzyme extract of E. (M.) onukii specifically produced geraniol from geraniol diphosphate. Furthermore, a terpene synthase (EoTPS) was isolated from E. (M.) onukii. This terpene synthase was able to convert geraniol diphosphate to geraniol in vitro. In addition, geraniol had in vitro ability to inhibit the growth of Acinetobacter johnsonii that is endobacterial isolated from E. (M.) onukii. This information illustrates that elicitors from piercing-sucking insects can induce the formation of volatiles from crop plants and advances our understanding of the roles of plant volatiles in the interaction among crops-insects-microorganisms.","['Tea', 'Geraniol', 'Camellia sinensis', 'Volatile', 'Aroma', 'Green Leafhopper']","['Figure', 'Geraniol', 'onukii', 'GPP', 'Tea Leaves', 'GES', 'synthase', 'Tea', 'Diphosphate', 'activity']","[Tea Leaves Empoasca (Matsumurasca), GES, Greanyl Diphosphate, GES, GES, GES, Greanyl Diphosphate, isoprenyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, FPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, GGPPS, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, MH383158, MH383159, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, FPP synthase, FPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, GGPP synthase type III, GGPPS, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS1S, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, GES, GES, GES, GenBank, FJ972539, C, CP037424, C, C]","['EoTPS)', 'EoTPS', 'EoTPS', 'EoTPS,', 'EoTPS']",[],[],terpene synthase
105,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6998195\eupmc_result.json,PMC6998195,"Results Production of (+)-valencene by CnVS expression in  S. cerevisiae Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been proven to be an ideal host for the production of highly-valued terpenoid compounds by leveraging its inherent capacity to synthesize terpenoid precursors through the MVA pathway [ 1,  2]. As (+)-valencene is the precursor for (+)-nootkatone biosynthesis, we first explored the biosynthesis of (+)-valencene in  S. cerevisiae W303 by expressing the robust (+)-valencene synthase CnVS (strain V02). n-Dodecane (10%, v/v) was added to the fermentation medium for in situ separation of the produced (+)-valencene given the low solubility of (+)-valencene in the aqueous phase and its high volatility [ 15]. Our growth test revealed that 10% n-dodecane showed only a marginal effect while (+)-valencene up to 500 mg/ml elicited hardly any inhibitory effect on the yeast growth (Additional file  1: Fig. S1). GC–MS analysis of the n-dodecane phase procured from the V02 cultivation revealed (+)-valencene as the dominant product, reaching about 11.6 mg/L (Fig.  2). The mass spectrum of the produced (+)-valencene was in agreement with that of the authentic standard. Engineering the MVA pathway to improve (+)-valencene production To further improve (+)-valencene production, FPP synthase ERG20 that catalyzes the condensation of IPP and its isomer DMAPP into GPP and consecutively the incorporation of GPP with one extra IPP to form FPP [ 1], was first overexpressed in V04 to increase the metabolic flux to FPP. Considering that FPP is also the substrate for squalene and farnesol synthesis, we tested the effect of expressing the fused form of ERG20 with CnVS using three different flexible linkers, namely GSG, GGGGS, and GSGGGGS, on (+)-valencene formation with an expectation to minimize the competitive FPP consumption by channeling the metabolic flux to the target product [ 24– 26]. Overall, the results revealed that neither the ERG20 overexpression alone nor its fused expression with CnVS improved (+)-valencene yield (Fig.  3), which was probably due to a short supply of precursors. Specifically, strains V06 and V08 expressing ERG20-GGGGS-CnVS and CnVS-GSG-ERG20 expression, respectively, even produced a significantly lower amount of (+)-valencene than V02 and strains with other fused forms. Multiple studies have shown that overexpression of the catalytic domain of the rate-limiting step enzyme tHMG1 has a profound effect on the metabolic flux of the MVA pathway [ 27]. This truncated HMG1 has also been reported to be capable of relieving the negative feedback inhibition of the MVA pathway [ 27]. We thus overexpressed  S. cerevisiae tHMG1 to increase the precursor supply for (+)-valencene synthesis. The results showed that tHMG1 overexpression greatly enhanced the production of (+)-valencene (comparing V10, V11, and V13 to V04, V05, and V07, resepectively) (Figs.  3,  4). Specifically, valencence level in V10 was almost sixfold higher than that in V04, reaching about 48.99 mg/L of cell culture. Of note, when combined with the fused overexpression of ERG20 and CnVS (V05 and V07), tHMG1 overexpression boosted (+)-valencene production by 9- and 14-fold to 88.20 mg/L (V13) and 156.95 mg/L (V11), respectively, compared with their corresponding parental strains, manifesting the effects of fusing ERG20 with CnVS. In the V09 strain, tHMG1 was overexpressed to enhance the precursor supply without ERG20 overexpression. However, the growth of V09 was severely compromised, which resulted in hardly any production of (+)-valencene. The growth inhibition may be attributed to the accumulation of IPP and DMAPP, which has been proven to be toxic to the cell [ 28,  29]. Comparing the growth and (+)-valencene production of the V09 and V10 strains suggested that overexpressing the downstream  erg20 gene relieved the growth inhibition of  S. cerevisiae, reflecting a beneficial effect of ERG20 overexpression on the simultaneous tHMG1 overexpression. Altogether, these results indicate that more FPP would be channeled to CnVS when it is appropriately fused with ERG20 on condition that there are sufficient IPP and DMAPP precursors. FPP is a key branch point in the  S. cerevisiae MVA pathway. The majority of FPP flux is directed to squalene synthase ERG9, which is dedicated to the synthesis of ergosterol [ 14,  30]. Dynamically down-regulating the ERG9 competition pathway has thus been proven very effective in enhancing the production of sesquiterpene compounds [ 14,  30]. Biochemical analysis has demonstrated that the turnover rate of ERG9 is 1000-fold higher than CnVS [ 31], implying that down-regulating the ERG9 competitive pathway would contribute to (+)-valencene biosynthesis. In addition, FPP can also be converted to farnesol by diphosphatase-catalyzed hydrolysis [ 32]. We thus replaced the  erg9 promoter with the glucose response  HXT1 promoter,which displays low transcription levels at low glucose concentrations [ 33], expecting to reduce the FPP consumption by the ergosterol pathway at the late stage of cell growth. As shown in Fig.  4, ERG9 down-regulation further increased (+)-valencene production in strains V11 and V13, and the highest yield was achieved in V15 with a 19-fold increase compared to V02 to 217.95 mg/L. To check whether farnesol formation by endogenous diphosphatases competes for the FPP pool, farnesol was determined in the constructed (+)-valencene producing strain. The results showed that significant farnesol accumulation was not observed in all tested strains (Additional file  1: Fig. S3), indicating that the catalytic efficiency of CnVS is much higher than diphosphatases and elimination of diphosphatases is not required in the present study. Overexpression of (+)-valencene oxidase for the biosynthesis of (+)-nootkatone Allylic oxidation of (+)-valencene by (+)-valencene oxidase provides an attractive route for the production of (+)-nootkatone [ 4]. Reported (+)-valencene oxidases include P450 enzymes and lipoxygenase [ 10,  21]. P450 enzymes primarily oxidize (+)-valencene to β-nootkatol while lipoxygenases produce a significant amount of (+)-nootkatone [ 10,  21]. We overexpressed the P450 HPO mutant V482I/A484I and lipoxygenase ValOx from  P. sapidus, respectively, in the (+)-valencene production strain V15. GC analysis demonstrated that the amount of (+)-valencene decreased dramatically in V15 overexpressing HPO V482/A484I (strain N06) while only minor amounts of (+)-nootkatone as well as a significant amount of β-nootkatol were identified in the product profiles (Fig.  5). Their MS profiles were in agreement with the reported standard profiles (Fig.  5b, c) [ 10]. The yield of (+)-nootkatone was determined to be 9.66 mg/L whereas quantification of nootakatol was not performed due to the lack of a standard. Lipoxygenase ValOx overexpression in V15 did not produce any oxidized product (Additional file  1: Fig, S4). (+)-Valencene is a volatile compound with very low solubility. n-Dodecane was usually over-layered on the culture for in situ separation to facilitate the quantification of valencene. However, (+)-valencene would be quickly extracted by the n-dodecane once it is produced, making the concentration of intracellular (+)-valencene too low to be efficiently transformed further. To increase (+)-valencene solubility in aqueous solution and improve its oxidation by HPO, two different solvents (DMSO and Triton X-100) were examined for their effects on  S. cerevisiae growth and the production of (+)-nootkatone (Additional file  1: Figs. S5 and S6). Increasing DMSO concentrations hardly affect cell growth until it reached 8% (v/v) (Additional file  1: Fig. S5). The highest yield of (+)-nootkatone was obtained at 1% DMSO (Additional file  1: Fig. S5). Although the cell growth were similar to DMSO when increased concentrations of Triton X-100 (0–0.1%) were applied (Additional file  1: Fig. S6), the production of (+)-nootkatone was only slightly increased. Therefore, 1% DMSO was chosen for all the subsequent fermentation experiments. Screening dehydrogenases for improvement of (+)-nootkatone production Having found that β-nootkatol was produced as the predominant product in the HPO V482/A484I overexpression strain (N06), we next tried to find a solution to improve the oxidation of β-nootkatol to (+)-nootkatone, not only because this conversion may constitute the bottleneck for (+)-nootkatone production, but also due to the fact that β-nootkatol accumulation is toxic to the cell [ 10]. In the analysis of the oxidized products from (+)-valencene by P450 enzymes, several studies have noticed that the oxidation of β-nootkatol to (+)-nootkatone is probably not catalyzed by P450 enzymes but instead by some putative dehydrogenases in the production host [ 10,  18]. Specifically, efficient oxidation of β-nootkatol to (+)-nootkatone has been reported by overexpressing an endogenous dehydrogenase ADH-C3 in  Pichia pastoris [ 23]. Several dehydrogenases from  S. cerevisiae,  P. pastoris, and plants were thus tested for their activity in converting β-nootkatol to (+)-nootkatone in the present study. There are seven alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH1-7) in  S. cerevisiae [ 34]. Among them, ADH2 is reported to be able to convert ethanol to acetaldehyde while ADH6 and ADH7 display broad substrate specificity. ADH-C3 of  P. pastoris is the only dehydrogenase thus far reported to catalyze the oxidation of β-nootkatol to (+)-nootkatone [ 23], which shares 37% and 34% sequence identity with ADH6 and ADH7, respectively. Since (+)-nootkatone is naturally produced by various plants including  C. sinensis, one short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (SDR) dehydrogenase ABA2 with reported hydroxylation activity arouse our interest in view of its broad substrate specificity [ 35]. Another SDR family dehydrogenase ZSD1 from  Zingiber zerumbet has been reported to oxidize the hydroxyl group of monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid to keto group [ 36]. Therefore, together with ADH2 and ADH6 of  S. cerevisiae, and ADH-C3 of  P. pastoris, ABA2 and ZSD1 were chosen for overexpression in the N06 strain. As seen in Fig.  6, consistent with previous results, ADH-C3 was capable of conferring efficient (+)-nootkatone production with an yield of 49.01 mg/L. Notably, ZSD1 or ABA2 expression also significantly increased the yield of (+)-nootkatone to 59.78 mg/L and 53.48 mg/L, respectively, with a decrease in the amount of β-nootkatol (Fig.  6). In contrast with ADH-C3, ZSD1, and ABA2, there was no significant change in the yield of (+)-nootkatone in ADH2- and ADH6-overexpressing strains compared with N06 although the yield of β-nootkatol slightly decreased. Overexpression of these two dehydrogenases may thus interfere with the expression of CnVS or HPO in the resultant production strains.","BACKGROUND:(+)-Nootkatone is a highly valued sesquiterpenoid compound, exhibiting a typical grapefruit aroma and various desired biological activities for use as aromatics and pharmaceuticals. The high commercial demand of (+)-nootkatone is predominately met by chemical synthesis, which entails the use of environmentally harmful reagents. Efficient synthesis of (+)-nootkatone via biotechnological approaches is thus urgently needed to satisfy its industrial demand. However, there are only a limited number of studies that report the de novo synthesis of (+)-nootkatone from simple carbon sources in microbial cell factories, and with relatively low yield. RESULTS:As the direct precursor of (+)-nootkatone biosynthesis, (+)-valencene was first produced in large quantities in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by overexpressing (+)-valencene synthase CnVS of Callitropsis nootkatensis in combination with various mevalonate pathway (MVA) engineering strategies, including the expression of CnVS and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (ERG20) as a fused protein, overexpression of a truncated form of the rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (tHMG1), and downregulating the squalene synthase enzyme (ERG9). These approaches altogether brought the production of (+)-valencene to 217.95 mg/L. Secondly, we addressed the (+)-valencene oxidation by overexpressing the Hyoscyamus muticus premnaspirodiene oxygenase (HPO) variant (V482I/A484I) and cytochrome P450 reductase (ATR1) from Arabidopsis thaliana. However, (+)-valencene was predominantly oxidized to β-nootkatol and only minor amounts of (+)-nootkatone (9.66 mg/L) were produced. We further tackled the oxidation of β-nootkatol to (+)-nootkatone by screening various dehydrogenases. Our results showed that the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily dehydrogenases ZSD1 of Zingiber zerumbet and ABA2 of Citrus sinensis were capable of effectively catalyzing β-nootkatol oxidation to (+)-nootkatone. The yield of (+)-nootkatone increased to 59.78 mg/L and 53.48 mg/L by additional overexpression of ZSD1 and ABA2, respectively. CONCLUSION:We successfully constructed the (+)-nootaktone biosynthesis pathway in S. cerevisiae by overexpressing the (+)-valencene synthase CnVS, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase HPO, and SDR family dehydrogenases combined with the MVA pathway engineering, providing a solid basis for the whole-cell production of (+)-nootkatone. The two effective SDR family dehydrogenases tested in this study will serve as valuable enzymatic tools in further optimizing (+)-nootkatone production.","['Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sesquiterpene', 'Dehydrogenases', '(+)-Nootkatone', '(+)-Valencene']","['valencene', 'valencene production', 'nootkatone', 'Production', 'Fig.', 'FPP', 'Additional file', 'MVA pathway', 'overexpression', 'nootkatone production']","[CnVS, FPP synthase, DMAPP, FPP [ 1, ERG20, CnVS, GGGGS, GSGGGGS, ERG20, CnVS, ERG20-GGGGS-CnVS, CnVS-GSG-ERG20, HMG1, V10, V05, V10, ERG20, CnVS, 9-, ERG20, CnVS, ERG20, DMAPP, V10, ERG20, CnVS, ERG20, ERG9, ERG9, CnVS, ERG9, ERG9, V13, CnVS, oxidase, P450 enzymes, P450 enzymes, β-nootkatol, P450 HPO, V482I/A484I, lipoxygenase ValOx, β-nootkatol, c) [ 10, nootakatol, Lipoxygenase ValOx, HPO, S5, S6, β-nootkatol, HPO V482/A484I, β-nootkatol, β-nootkatol, P450 enzymes, β-nootkatol, P450 enzymes, β-nootkatol, dehydrogenase ADH-C3, pastoris, β-nootkatol, alcohol dehydrogenases, ADH1-7, ADH2, ADH6, ADH7, ADH-C3, pastoris, dehydrogenase, β-nootkatol, ADH6, ADH7, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase, ADH2, ADH6, ADH-C3, pastoris, ABA2, ZSD1, N06, ADH-C3, ZSD1, ABA2, β-nootkatol (, ADH-C3, ZSD1, ABA2, ADH2-, N06, β-nootkatol, CnVS, HPO]",[],['C.'],[],NaN
106,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7069061\eupmc_result.json,PMC7069061,"Results Discovery of Potential Compounds Based on network pharmacology prediction, we identified some compounds that may have therapeutic effects, including polyphenolic compounds, sesquiterpenes, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, and steroid glycosides. These compounds have better biological activity and are common in the literature regarding the treatment of endometriosis and diseases with similar target pathways. The Venn diagram of comomn targets of major Chinese herbs in endometriosis treatment was established by FunRich, an open access standalone functional enrichment and interaction network analysis tool ( Figure 8A) ( Pathan et al., 2015). The Venn analysis suggests that the targets of these Chinese herbs are similar, which means that these herbs could play synergistic role. Furthermore, compounds such as ursolic acid, rosmarinic acid, ferulic acid, tanshinone IIA, and oleic acid could regulate pain. Quercetin, salviolone, acetic acid, formononetin, luteolin, hederagenin, tanshinone II A, palmitic acid, cryptotanshinone, rutin, and curcumol could regulate the inflammatory or immunomodulatory response. These compounds could regulate core genes related to endometriosis and with more experimental verification, and could be potentially used in the treatment of endometriosis. The potential effective compounds are listed in  Table 6, and the compounds and targets network is presented in  Figure 8B. The potential compounds and targets are listed in  Supplementary Table 10. Chinese Medicines Commonly Used for Endometriosis In the past, we have studied the prescriptions of Chinese medicine for endometriosis through literature monographs. A total of 551 literatures were screened: 513 literatures in Chinese databases (including CNKI and WanFang databases) and 38 literatures from the PubMed and Embase database. Among those screened, 315 literatures were clinical studies, and 234 literatures were experimental studies (25 literatures were  in vitro, 210 literatures were  in vivo, and one literature was both  in vitro and  in vivo). The major TCM literatures were clinical observational studies. Fifteen literatures were clinical randomized controlled studies. Some literatures contain two or three prescriptions according to different syndromes in TCM. A total of 615 medicinal prescriptions were selected from the literature screened ( Figure 1B). The most published prescriptions included those for  Guizhi Fuling Wan (GFW), Jiawei Sanleng Wan, Neiyi Fang, and  Shaofu Zuyu decoction. The total 231 kinds of Chinese herbs were selected in literatures. The top 20 herbs were determined using frequency statistics and are presented in  Table 1. The validated information of major herbs, including location, used part, famliy, genus are showed in  Supplementary Table 1. We analyzed the classification, medicinal properties, and medicinal taste of all common drugs for endometriosis. Analysis from the prescriptions for endometriosis indicated a higher proportion and frequency of deficiency-tonifying herbs, blood-activating herbs, dampness-draining diuretic herbs, heat-clearing herbs, and digestant herbs ( Figure 2A).  Curcuma phaeocaulis Valeton (Ezhu),  Sparganium stoloniferum (Buch.-Ham. ex Graebn.) Buch.-Ham. ex Juz.[Typhaceae] (Sanleng), and  Corydalis yanhusuo (Y.H.Chou & Chun C.Hsu) W.T.Wang ex Z.Y.Su & C.Y.Wu(Yanhusuo) are both effective in promoting blood circulation to alleviate pain and activate qi to resolve stagnation in Chinese theory. The treatment of endometriosis with basic theory of Chinese medicine has always been based on promoting blood circulation to minimize blood stasis and alleviate pain. The characteristics of four properties, five tastes, and channel tropism were evaluated. The analysis of herbal properties is presented in  Figures 2B–D. Chinese herbs that were considered warm and slight were given priority. The treatment of endometriosis is mainly based on invigorating the spleen, tonifying the liver to strengthen healthy qi, and supplementation with blood-activating herbs to eliminate pathogenic factors. Frequent itemset mining is a crucial data mining task with numerous applications in discovery, including recommendation and classification, among others ( Soltani and Akbarzadeh-T, 2014). By considering both the frequent itemsets and association rules, we inferred the relevant drug pairs and combinations, such as  S. stoloniferum (Sanleng) -C. phaeocaulis(Ezhu);  C. phaeocaulis-Paeonia lactiflora Pall(Chishao); and  C. yanhusuo (Yanhusuo) -Angelica sinensis (Oliv.)Diels (Danggui), among others. The main roles of these herbs were to promote blood circulation and relieve pain.  Table 2 shows the herbs commonly used in combination, as determined by frequent itemset mining analysis. The frequent item sets were showed in  Supplementary Table 2. To uncover latent knowledge, unsupervised machine learning and RNNs were applied to generate the knowledge graph, by calculating the distance between knowledge element vectors, according to preset categories. We set various parameters, and obtained multiple knowledge graphs. We obtained a ratio of nine clusters/four clusters of knowledge maps according to the clinical medication rules of Chinese medicine. Different clusters were formed by setting parameters and applying the combination rules of TCM. These clusters may reflect the law of compatibility and combination of clinical prescriptions in TCM.  Figures 2E, F demonstrate the knowledge graphs for endometriosis herbs. The classifications reflect the possible combinations of TCM prescription medications. Based on the knowledge graphs and association rule mining, synergistic herbal combinations could be derived; however, further analysis of the associated mechanism is required. GO terms and KEGG Pathway Analysis of Endometriosis-Associated Genes We collected a total of 1,289 endometriosis-related targets from Genecard, Genbank, as well as the OMIM records of genomic databases of human diseases. The Venn diagram in  Figure 3A reflects common genes from different databases. The genes significantly associated with endometriosis were tested for functional enrichment, including the relevant pathways and GO terms. The results of the GO analysis indicated that “inflammatory response,” “innate immune response,” and “chemokine production” were the most significant terms related to endometriosis in the BP category. Furthermore, the significant MF terms related to endometriosis were “cytokine activity,” “growth factor activity,” and “receptor binding.” The results of GO enrichement showed in  Figure 3B. The majority of the pathways were related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, focal adhesion, the TNF signaling pathway, and HIF-1 signaling pathway, among others ( Figure 3C). The KEGG pathways of endometriosis associated genes are showed in  Supplementary Table 3. These signal pathways can affect the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of endometriosis. We used the  cytoHubba in Cytoscape to find the hub genes. The hub genes showed in  Figure 3D. And we further used MCODE plugin densely connected regions to analyze the major modules in biological processes. The results showed that the genes associated with endometriosis could be divided into 11 clusters ( Figure 3E). The PPI network of the major endometriosis genes is showed in  Supplementary Figure 1. The genes in cluster 1, which is dominated by chemokines, are related to the chemokine signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. The genes in cluster 2 participate in receptor ligand activity, growth factor activity, HIF-1 signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, and the Ras signaling pathway. The genes in cluster 3 are mainly interleukins, suggesting pathways related to inflammation. In addition, cluster 4 is related to kinase proteins. Cluster 7 is related to hormone regulation. Cluster 9 is closely related to tumor transcription regulation. Cluster 6 and cluster 10 are related to cell adhesion, intercellular adhesion molecules, vascular cell adhesion molecules, and matrix metalloproteinases. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is related to chemokine regulation, adhesion, invasion, angiogenesis, inflammation, immunity, and hormone regulation. These findings provide the genetic background of endometriosis for further network pharmacology research. Overall Ingredients and Targets of Common Chinese Herbal Treatments Chinese herbal medicines each contain dozens or even hundreds of various ingredients. Thus, the compilation of an ingredient database is crucial. Some Chinese medicines are animal-derived compounds that were not included in the network pharmacological analysis.  Typha angustifolia L. [Typhaceae] (Puhang) and  Faeces Togopteri (Wulingzhi) represented one herbal pair (HP). The source of  F. Togopteri is  Trogopterus xanthipes feces; thus, we did not analysis this HP. The single herbs, HPs, and prescriptions were evaluated, to determine the characteristics of Chinese medicine more comprehensively. In order to further corroborate our predictions, a literature review was conducted to determine whether the compounds were already experimentally validated for any associated therapeutic effects. We analyzed gene enrichment for the major Chinese herbs, as hub herb associated targets. Compounds and targets from of major Chinese herbs for endometriosis treatment are listed in  Supplementary Table 4. The Chinese herbs associated targets are listed in  Supplementary Table 5. Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge[Lamiaceae] (Dangshen) More than 200 compounds from  Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge were found, including lipophilic diterpenoids, water-soluble phenolic acids, and other constituents. The active ingredients of  S. miltiorrhiza include tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, salvianolic acid, and dihydrotanshinone, among others ( MEIm et al., 2019). A total of 196 targets were possibly related to  S. miltiorrhiza, and 63 targets could be associated with endometriosis genes. Based on the KEGG pathway analysis, the main pathways were those associated with cancer, calcium signaling, VEGF signaling, T cell receptor signaling, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, apoptosis, and p53 signaling pathway, among others that were related to endometriosis ( P < 0.05). Compounds such as ursolic acid, rosmarinic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, tanshinone IIA, protocatechuic acid, and tetramethylpyrazine could evidently regulate pain-associated targets to reduce pain, based on the network pharmacological analysis. Angelica Sinensis (Oliv.)/Angelica Sinensis Var. Wilsonii (H.Wolff) Z.H.Pan & M.F.Watson (Danggui) Angelica sinensis var.  wilsonii (H.Wolff) Z.H.Pan & M.F.Watson is predominantly known as a treatment for intractable gynecological disorders. Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) showed that  A. sinensis contains eight components, including ferulic acid, senkyunolide A, butylphthalide, ligustilide, butylidenephalide, senkyunolide I, senkyunolide H, and levistolide A ( Gui and Zheng, 2019). The volatile oil of  A. sinensis, has evident antiinflammatory activities ( Zhong et al., 2016). A total of 86 targets were possibly related to  A. Sinensis, and 27 targets were associated with endometriosis genes. The KEGG enrichment showed associated signaling pathways in neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, calcium signaling, TNF signaling, cGMP-PKG signaling, and the estrogen signaling pathway. Corydalis yanhusuo (Y.H.Chou & Chun C.Hsu) (Yanhusuo) Corydalis yanhusuo (Y.H.Chou & Chun C.Hsu) could effectively attenuate acute inflammatory and neuropathic pain. The main alkaloid contents and composition of  C. yanhusuo includes protopine, α-allocryptopine, tetrahydrocolumbamine, coptisine, palmatine, berberine, dehydrocorydaline D, L-tetrahydropalmatine, tetrahydroberberine, corydaline, and tetrahydrocoptisine, as determined by the high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) method. A total of 165 targets were possibly related to  C. yanhusuo, and 47 targets were associated with endometriosis genes. The KEGG enrichment analysis revealed pathways associated with cancer, calcium signaling, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, VEGF signaling, apoptosis, T cell receptor signaling, and B cell receptor signaling pathway, among others. Ligusticum chuanxiong S.H.Qiu, Y.Q.Zeng, K.Y.Pan, Y.C.Tang & J.M.Xu/ Conioselinum anthriscoides ‘Chuanxiong’ (Chuanxiong) Conioselinum anthriscoides ‘Chuanxiong’ is used to regulate menstruation and relieve pain in multiple diseases. A total of 174 ingredients of  L. chuanxiong and 22 compounds demonstrated favorable bioavailability ( Chen Z. et al., 2018). A total of 95 targets may be related to  L. chuanxiong, and 26 targets were associated with endometriosis genes. Based on the KEGG enrichment analysis, we obtained the following associated pathways: neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling, pathways in cancer, and VEGF signaling pathway. We inferred that fumarine, isocorypalmine, and fagarine I could regulate the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor to reduce pain in endometriosis. Astragalus mongholicus Bunge (Huangqi) Astragalus mongholicus Bunge is one of the most popular traditional medicinal herbs with several pharmacological activities, including hematopoietic, antiinflammatory, and immunological. The main components of  A. mongholicus were hederagenin, kumatakenin, isorhamnetin, 3,9-di-O-methylnissolin, calycosin, 7-O-methylisomucronulatol, formononetin, quercetin, and betulinic acid ( Fu et al., 2014). A total of 263 targets were possibly related to  A. membranaceus, and 68 targets were associated with endometriosis genes. The KEGG enrichment analysis showed the following pathways: cancer, neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, calcium signaling, endometrial cancer, p53 signaling, T cell receptor signaling, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, toll-like receptor signaling, and VEGF signaling pathway, among others. Cyperus rotundus L. (Xiangfu) Cyperus rotundus L., a widely distributed perennial sedge has a relatively higher concentration of active ingredients in the form of essential oils, phenolic acids, ascorbic acids, and flavonoids in the tuber and rhizomes.  C. rotundus is widely used in many disorders such as inflammation, diabetes, diarrhea, tumors, among others ( Pirzada et al., 2015). A total of 246 targets were possibly related to  C. rotundus, and 74 targets were associated with endometriosis genes. The KEGG enrichment analysis showed the following pathways: PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, TNF signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and HIF-1 signaling pathway, among others. Commiphora myrrha (T.Nees) Engl. (Moyao) Commiphora myrrha (T.Nees) Engl., the Commiphora species, known as “myrrh,” are characterized by resinous exudates from the bark of plants. They are used in the treatment of trauma, arthritis, and fractures, and exert antiproliferative, antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antibacterial effects ( Shen et al., 2012). The compounds of C. myrrha include terpenoids, steroids, flavonoids, sugars, and lignans, among others. Furanosesquiterpenes, such as furanoelemanes, furanoeudesmanes, and furanogermacranes, are compounds with analgesic effects. A total of 213 targets were possibly related to  C. myrrha, and 104 targets were associated with endometriosis genes. The KEGG enrichment analysis showed the following pathways: TNF signaling, HIF-1 signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling, among others. Carthamus tinctorius L. (Honghua) Carthamus tinctorius L. can invigorate blood circulation and has been recently shown to have antioxidant, analgesic, antiinflammatory, and antidiabetic properties. Carthamidin, carthamone, carvacrol, and isocarthamidin luteolin are the main constituents of  C. tinctorius L. (Asgarpanah and Kazemivash, 2013). Furthermore, hydroxyethylcarthamin, hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), safflor yellow B (SYB), safflomin A, safflomin B, safflomin C, isosafflomin C, safflor yellow A (SYA), and precarthamin, among others, have also been reported as constituents ( Yue et al., 2013). A total of 74 targets were possibly related to  C. tinctorius, and 37 targets were associated with endometriosis genes. The KEGG enrichment analysis showed the following significant pathways: cancer, FoxO signaling, endometrial cancer, and drug metabolism - cytochrome P450, among others. HPs for Endometriosis Treatment Curcuma phaeocaulis (Ezhu) and  Sparganium Stoloniferum (Buch.-Ham. ex Graebn.) Buch.-Ham. ex Juz. (Sanleng) Curcuma phaeocaulis Valeton is the most widely used species in HPs for endometriosis in Chinese medicine, and its essential oils are widely applied in the treatment of tumors in China. In  C. Rhizoma, curcumol, bisdemethoxycurcumin, (4S,5S)-germacrone-1,4-diepoxide, aromadendrene, hederagenin, epoxycaryophyllene, and calarene showed relatively higher levels of OB and DL ( Zhou Y. et al., 2016).  S. stoloniferum is used for its hematopoietic functions, antiinflammatory activity, and immunological properties. Notable constituents include trans-gondoic acid, hederagenin, beta-sitosterol, formononetin, stigmasterol, and epibetulinic acid. A total of 130 targets were possibly related to  C. phaeocaulis and  S.stoloniferum. The GO enrichment analysis showed that  C. phaeocaulis and  S.stoloniferum could regulate apoptosis, cell death, and cell proliferation. The KEGG analysis showed significant pathways in cancer, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling, the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, apoptosis, and serotonergic synapse, among others. A total of 38 targets could be associated with endometriosis genes. Topological analysis showed the major targets included:  TP53, SRC, TNF, VEGFA, PIK3CA, IL8, and  EGFR, among others, which are also the core genes that cause endometriosis. Core Prescriptions- GFW GFW was the core prescription used in data mining for endometriosis treatment, as well as the classical prescription in Chinese medicine. A total of 565 herbal compounds could be identified from databases. There were 230 targets in  Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl [Lauraceae](Guizhi); 78 targets in  Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews [Paeoniaceae](Mudanpi); 135 targets in  Paeonia lactiflora Pall.(Chishao); 67 targets in  Prunus persica (L.) Batsch(Taoren); and 55 targets in  Poria cocos(Schw.)Wolf(Fuling). In  Cinnamomum cassia, taxifolin; beta-sitosterol; sitosterol; catechin; ent-epicatechin; and peroxyergosterol all showed effective OB and DL levels. Protocatechuic acid, coumarin, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxy cinnamic acid, cinnamic acid, and cinnamaldehyde are considered the core components of  C. cassia, and the core herbs in such prescriptions. The target proteins in  C. cassia were focused on neurological disease, inflammatory disease, cancer, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling, and molecular transport.  P. lactiflora is used for pain and blood stasis, and has hematopoietic functions, antiinflammatory activity, and immunological properties. And a total of 94 of its targets were associated with endometriosis treatment. Furthermore, 70 targets in  P. suffruticosa, 16 targets in  P. cocos and 10 targets in  P. persica could be associated with endometriosis genes. In the present study, we obtained 521 targets ( Supplementary Table 5), which may be regulated by the above mentioned Chinese herbs derived from databases. These targets were involved in kinase pathways, angiogenesis, inflammation, immunity, and other modules. The main pathways included those of neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, toll-like receptor signaling, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, VEGF signaling, apoptosis, drug metabolism, endometrial cancer, and the calcium signaling pathway, among others. The venn diagram of the common targets between Chinese herbs and conventional treatment drugs is showed in  Figure 4A. The results of GO enrichment are presented in  Figure 4B. The KEGG pathway annotation and KEGG pathways enrichment are presented in  Figures 4C, D. The major KEGG pathways of major Chinese herbs, herbs pairs and prescription are showed in  Supplementary Table 6. Furthermore, following cytoHubba analysis, we found that  VEGFA, MAPK3, JUN, AKT1, TP53, IL6, ALB, INS, MAPK1, MMP9, PTGS2, among others could be core genes in the regulation of the screened herbs. Using MCODE analysis, we determined the modules of various herbs ( Figure 4E). The results of the modules were related to the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Overlap of Chinese Herbs and Endometriosis Disease Modules We further analyzed the targets of endometriosis-associated genes that coincided with those of Chinese herbs. A total of 170 targets of Chinese herbal medicines coincided with those of genes associated with endometriosis. The targets of endometriosis-associated genes that coincided with those of Chinese herbs are showed in  Supplementary Table 7. Chinese herbal treatment for endometriosis could regulate the biological processes of “regulation of apoptosis,” “regulation of cell death,” and “response to hormone stimulus,” among others.  Figure 5A shows the GO enrichment of herb-associated targets. The GO enrichment of endometriosis-associated genes that coincided with Chinese herbs are showed in  Supplementary Table 8. We also identified associated pathways, such as those of cancer, PI3K-Akt signaling, MAPK signaling, FoxO signaling, focal adhesion, HIF-1 signaling, Ras signaling, TNF signaling, estrogen signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, and VEGF signaling pathway, among others. To determine the functions of Chinese herbs, significant pathway terms in KEGG analysis were mapped onto a bubble graph ( Figure 5B). Larger and higher bubbles in the Figure represent the highly, significantly enriched pathway terms. The network of major pathways and targets is presented in  Figure 5C.  Table 3 shows the major KEGG pathways of Chinese herbs in endometriosis treatment. The MCODE plugin was used to analyze the modules. Cluster 1 was related to endocrine resistance, prolactin signaling pathway, and pathways in cancer. Cluster 2 was related to signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. Cluster 3 was related to responses to steroid hormones. Cluster 4 was related to the Pathway Interaction Database ceramide pathway. Cluster 5 was related to steroid hormone biosynthesis, cytochrome P450-arranged by substrate type, and estrogen metabolic process. Cluster 6 was related to the adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. Cluster 7 was related to cellular detoxification in GO enrichment ( Figure 5D). Module analysis also facilitated the discovery of potential sub-modules of TCM in the regulation of endometriosis. Target-Pathway Network We constructed a KEGG map of Chinese medicine associated targets to reflect the regulation of Chinese medicine on endometriosis genes. TCM affects the development of endometriosis through multiple interactions such as inflammation, immunity, angiogenesis, and kinase pathways. Multiple pathways were integrated and overlapped, based on cross-talk targets.The common targets showed the largest overlap with the cancer signaling pathway. The multiregulation map of the KEGG pathway is shown in  Figure 6. By mapping the targets to related pathways, we found that endometriosis treatment is mostly related to four function modules of the mechanism pathways. The cross-talk pathways network of Chinese herbs in endometriosis treatment is showed in  Supplementary Figure 2. Therefore, we gained a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of these pathways. Pain relieving function is the major module in Chinese treatment, which is related to the nervous system in KEGG categories, such as neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, serotonergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, cholinergic synapse, neurotrophin signaling pathway, dopaminergic synapse, calcium signaling pathway, glutamatergic synapse, and cAMP signaling pathway, among others. The major targets, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), adrenoceptor beta, HTR2A prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PTGS), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), serotonin receptors (HTR2A, HTR3A, HTR1A, and HTR2C) are all related to the regulation of neural receptors. The regulatory mechanism of these targets can directly affect various neurotransmitter receptors and the synthesis of neurotransmitters to modulate pain. Chinese medicine could also indirectly affect pain through downstream immune inflammatory factors (IL6, IL10, and TNF), and immuno-inflammatory pathways, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, the TNF signaling, VEGF signaling, HIF-1 signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Estrogen could also regulated of the central serotoninergic system in pain. The second module was associated with cell growth and death, invasion, adhesion, and angiogenesis-related signaling pathways in endometriosis. Chinese medicine could regulate invasion and adhesion-related signaling pathways, induce apoptosis, and inhibit cell proliferation, through processes such as apoptosis, P53 signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, Wnt signaling, ECM-receptor interaction, and focal adhesion, among others. The angiogenesis and the tumor-related functions also showed considerable overlap, which included HIF signaling and the VEGF signaling pathway. The third module was associated with inflammation and the immune system. Related processes included cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, toll-like receptor signaling, T cell receptor signaling, B cell receptor signaling, NF-κB signaling, and IL-17 signaling pathway, which are also important in regulating inflammation and immune responses. Moreover, kinase signaling pathways in endometriosis could affect the proliferation and differentiation of endometriosis cells, which could be potential targets for non-hormonal therapeutics. The associated module could be related to the canonical IKKβ/NFκB pathway, MAPK pathways, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and the AMPK signaling pathway ( McKinnon et al., 2016). These results suggest that multiple targets could affect various pathways to regulate the pathological processes of endometriosis. Target Comparison of Chinese Herbs/Natural Compounds and Conventional Drugs In order to clarify the similarities and differences between the related targets of Chinese medicine and conventional drugs for endometriosis, we considered the targets of conventional therapeutic drugs for comparison. At present, the treatment options for endometriosis include NSAIDs and hormonal drugs (progestogens, dienogest, and GnRH agonists). A total of 85 protein targets of these drugs were identified from DrugBank and the TTD database of conventional drugs. The drug targets of endometriosis conventional treatment are listed in  Supplementary Table 9. Conventional drugs for the treatment of endometriosis are mainly aimed at the nervous system and hormonal pathway. The core pathways of these targets included steroid hormone biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions, among others. A total of 17 Chinese medicine associated targets ( AR, BCHE, BCL2, CYP19A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, ESR1, NR1I2, NR3C2, PGR, PLAT, PPARA, PPARG, PTGS1, PTGS2, and  THBD) coincided with the targets of conventional drugs for endometriosis treatment. The enrichment of overlapping genes was mainly focused on the regulation of hormones and pain relief. The mechanism of action of Chinese herbs was similar to that of current conventional treatments. Furthermore, Chinese medicine and its compounds provided more possibilities for multitarget therapy. Regulatory Effects of TCM on Related Targets of Endometriosis Pain Endometriosis-related pain has been the main focus of TCM research. Thus, we further analyzed the related pathways of pain, to provide a basis for the discovery of effective pain-relieving compounds. The analgesic effect of TCM is related to the regulation of neurotransmitters and related pain factors. The serotonergic synapse was the main network of neurotransmitter regulation, and its KEGG map is presented in  Figure 7A.  Figure 7B shows the network of targets network of pain associated pathways. We also selected the targets of Chinese medicines for the treatment of endometriosis from the pain database. This database is a comprehensive network of contextualized PPIs specifically associated with pain, that has been created through study of the pain interactome ( Jamieson et al., 2014). The results showed that a total of 61 genes were involved in pain prediction, which were also related to endometriosis. These included  PTGES, PTGS2, PTGS1, BDNF, TNF, IL6, ESR1, IL10, MMP9, and  MAPK, among others ( Figure 7C). These compounds, which have similar targets to those of NSAIDs and opioid analgesics, may be considered active compounds in Chinese medicine for the treatment of various pain-related diseases in the future.  Figure 7D shows the network of the “nervous system pathways-targets-compounds”. We found that Chinese medicines with analgesic effects include polysaccharides, saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids and others. Compounds such as ursolic acid, rosmarinic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, tanshinone IIA, and oleanolic acid, in  S. miltiorrhiza could regulate pain targets. Interestingly, we also found that many of the compounds that regulate pain originate from volatile oils/essential oils molecules ( de Cassia et al., 2017). Terpene compounds are the main components of volatile oils. Moreover, the combination of multiple compounds may further play a synergistic effect in Chinese medicine. These volatile oil compounds have 109 targets. The volatile oil compounds associated targets were showed in  Table 4. We found that the DL value of volatile oils was low. Thus, the pharmaceutical activity of these compounds still needs further experimental verification. Related Small Molecule Drugs Screening by CMap Analysis We used expression profile data of CMap analysis for drug discovery. By querying CMap, we screened compounds in likely drug targets showing a similar gene expression profile with the desired and chemopreventive conditions. The DEGs were downloaded from the GSE25628 expression file. This dataset contained three sets of sample data, and we chose the comparison of two sets of samples for analysis. The endometriosis eutopic groups were compared with the non-endometriosis eutopic group (healthy women group), to include 52 upregulated and 169 downregulated DEGs ( P < 0.05 and |logFC| > 2). A total of 67 upregulated and four downregulated DEGs with ectopic endometrium and eutopic endometrium were detected among the patients with endometriosis. As the results, among the drugs or natural compounds identified in Chinese medicine and plants, genistein, atractyloside, naringenin, canadine, ursolic acid, and lycorine showed a higher negative correlation with, and greater potential to effectively treat endometriosis. The natural compounds with highly significant correlations from CMap analysis results are listed in  Table 5. Based on the results of CMap analysis, we identified potential natural compounds that could be beneficial in the treatment of endometriosis, and provided a basis for further drug discovery.","Endometriosis is a common benign disease in women of reproductive age. It has been defined as a disorder characterized by inflammation, compromised immunity, hormone dependence, and neuroangiogenesis. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of endometriosis have not yet been fully elucidated, and available treatment methods are currently limited. The discovery of new therapeutic drugs and improvements in existing treatment schemes remain the focus of research initiatives. Chinese medicine can improve the symptoms associated with endometriosis. Many Chinese herbal medicines could exert antiendometriosis effects  via  comprehensive interactions with multiple targets. However, these interactions have not been defined. This study used association rule mining and systems pharmacology to discover a method by which potential antiendometriosis herbs can be investigated. We analyzed various combinations and mechanisms of action of medicinal herbs to establish molecular networks showing interactions with multiple targets. The results showed that endometriosis treatment in Chinese medicine is mainly based on methods of supplementation with blood-activating herbs and strengthening qi. Furthermore, we used network pharmacology to analyze the main herbs that facilitate the decoding of multiscale mechanisms of the herbal compounds. We found that Chinese medicine could affect the development of endometriosis by regulating inflammation, immunity, angiogenesis, and other clusters of processes identified by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. The antiendometriosis effect of Chinese medicine occurs mainly through nervous system-associated pathways, such as the serotonergic synapse, the neurotrophin signaling pathway, and dopaminergic synapse, among others, to reduce pain. Chinese medicine could also regulate VEGF signaling, toll-like reporter signaling, NF-κB signaling, MAPK signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, and the HIF-1 signaling pathway, among others. Synergies often exist in herb pairs and herbal prescriptions. In conclusion, we identified some important targets, target pairs, and regulatory networks, using bioinformatics and data mining. The combination of data mining and network pharmacology may offer an efficient method for drug discovery and development from herbal medicines.","['Bioinformatics', 'Endometriosis', 'data mining', 'Network Analysis', 'Network Pharmacology', 'Medicinal Herb']","['signaling pathway', 'Chinese herbs', 'Chinese', 'signaling', 'Chinese medicine', 'endometriosis', 'targets', 'Supplementary Table', 'pathways', 'Pathway']","[Venn, comomn, FunRich, Venn, tanshinone II A, Zuyu, famliy, Juz.[Typhaceae], Y.H.Chou, C.Y.Wu(Yanhusuo, Akbarzadeh-T, clusters/four, Genbank, Venn, “, ”, “chemokine, ”, “, ” “growth factor, ”, “receptor binding, ”, cytokine-cytokine receptor, PI3K-Akt, focal adhesion, TNF, HIF-1, cytokine-cytokine receptor, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, Ras, interleukins, intercellular adhesion molecules, vascular cell, matrix metalloproteinases, Puhang, Togopteri, MEIm, VEGF, T cell receptor, p53, Var, M.F.Watson, H.Wolff) Z.H.Pan, M.F.Watson, TNF, cGMP-PKG, Y.H.Chou, Y.H.Chou, α-allocryptopine, VEGF, T cell receptor, B cell receptor, Y.Q.Zeng, K.Y.Pan, Y.C.Tang, J.M.Xu/ Conioselinum, VEGF, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor, 3,9-di-O-methylnissolin, 7-O-methylisomucronulatol, Fu et, p53, T cell receptor, cytochrome P450, toll-like receptor, VEGF, Pirzada, PI3K-Akt, TNF, MAPK, HIF-1, “, ”, Furanosesquiterpenes, furanoeudesmanes, furanogermacranes, TNF, HIF-1, toll-like receptor, PI3K-Akt, carthamone, Kazemivash, 2013, hydroxyethylcarthamin, isosafflomin C, FoxO, cytochrome P450, OB, trans-gondoic acid, epibetulinic acid, cGMP-PKG, PI3K-Akt, SRC, TNF, VEGFA, PIK3CA, IL8, Prescriptions- GFW, peroxyergosterol all, OB, toll-like receptor, cytochrome P450, VEGF, cytoHubba, MAPK3, JUN, AKT1, TP53, IL6, ALB, INS, MAPK1, MMP9, PTGS2, “, ”, “, ”, herb-associated, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, FoxO, focal adhesion, HIF-1, Ras, TNF, toll-like receptor, VEGF, prolactin, receptor tyrosine kinases, EGFR tyrosine, cytochrome P450-arranged, adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor, GABAergic synapse, neurotrophin, cAMP, acetylcholinesterase (AChE, adrenoceptor beta, HTR2A prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, serotonin receptors, HTR2A, HTR3A, HTR1A, HTR2C, neural receptors, neurotransmitter receptors, immune inflammatory factors, IL6, IL10, TNF, cytokine-cytokine receptor, TNF, VEGF, HIF-1, toll-like receptor, PI3K-Akt, P53, PI3K-Akt, Wnt, focal adhesion, HIF, VEGF, cytokine-cytokine receptor, toll-like receptor, T cell receptor, B cell, IL-17, IKKβ/NFκB, MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, AMPK, GnRH agonists, metabolism-cytochrome P450, AR, BCHE, BCL2, CYP19A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, ESR1, NR1I2, NR3C2, PGR, PLAT, PPARA, PPARG, PTGS1, PTGS2, PTGS2, PTGS1, BDNF, TNF, IL6, ESR1, IL10, MMP9, opioid analgesics, “, GSE25628]",[],"['C.Hsu)', 'C.Y.Wu(Yanhusuo)', '-C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.Hsu)', 'C.Hsu)', 'C.', 'C.', 'Y.C.Tang', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', '5C.']",[],NaN

108,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7125107\eupmc_result.json,PMC7125107,"Results Genome sequencing and annotation L. cubeba has a diploid genome (2 n = 24) (Supplementary Fig.  2a) with an estimated haploid genome size of 1370.14 Mb (Supplementary Fig.  2b). The genome was initially assembled with 155.64× sequencing reads from the PacBio platform. The assembled contigs were subsequently linked into 1514 scaffolds with 10× genomics barcoded reads (Supplementary Note  1 and Supplementary Table  1). We obtained an initial genome assembly with 1514 scaffolds covering 1325.69 Mb, with a contig N50 value of 607.34 kb (Supplementary Table  2). Further scaffolding was done based on 292.17 Gb reads from a sequencing library of Genome-wide Chromosome Conformation Capture (Hi-C). We were able to anchor a total of 1018 scaffolds covering 1253.47 Mb (94.56%) of the assembled genome into 12 pseudochromosomes (Supplementary Figs.  2c,  3, and Supplementary Table  3). To confirm the completeness of the assembly, we performed CEGMA 22, BUSCO 23 assessments, and used mRNA sequences of  L. cubeba and found the completeness of the genome to be 95.97% (Supplementary Table  4), 88.4% (Supplementary Table  5), and 97% (Supplementary Table  6), respectively. A combination of homolog-based comparisons and structure-based analyses resulted in an annotation of 735 Mb transposable elements (TEs), representing 55.47% of the  L. cubeba genome (Supplementary Table  7), which is between that of  C. kanehirae (~48% in a 730.7 Mb genome) 12 and  L. chinense (~62% in a 1742.4 Mb genome) 11 (Supplementary Table  8). Long terminal repeats (LTRs) are the predominant TEs in the genome of  L. cubeba, which represent 47.64% (631 Mb) of the whole genome. Both  L. cubeba and  L. chinense have a larger genome size than that of  C. kanehireae12, and they both contain higher content of LTR/gypsy and copia elements (45.31%) than that of the  C. kanehireae genome (16.50%) 12. Hence, it suggests that LTR/gypsy and copia elements contribute most to the expansions of the  L. cubeba and  L. chinense genomes (Supplementary Table  8). A high-confidence set of 31,329 protein-coding genes were predicted in the  L. cubeba genome, of which 29,262 (93.4%) and 27,753 (88.59%) were supported by transcriptome data and protein homologs, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  4a and Supplementary Table  9). A total of 29,651 (94.6%) predicted protein-coding genes were functionally annotated (Supplementary Fig.  4a and Supplementary Table  10) and 30,314 (91.3%) of the genes could be located on the 12 pseudochromosomes. In addition, 1284 (89.2%) of the 1440 protein-coding genes in the BUSCO plant set were predicted in the  L. cubeba genome (Supplementary Table  5). We then compared the genomes of 26 plant species to obtain gene families that are significantly expanded in Lauraceae or that are unique to Lauraceae (Supplementary Fig.  4b, c and Supplementary Table  11). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses found that the significantly expanded gene families are especially enriched in the KEGG pathways of monoterpenoid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and metabolic (Supplementary Table  12) and in the GO terms of TPS activity, transferase activity, and catalytic activity (Supplementary Table  13). Many monoterpene synthase (TPS-b) genes are included in the above enriched KEGG pathways and GO terms, in line with the roles of TPS-b in the biosynthesis of specific scents (mainly monoterpene) in Lauraceae 12,  24. The enrichment analyses showed that the 711 unique Lauraceae gene families are specifically enriched in the KEGG pathways of plant hormone signal transduction and circadian rhythm—plant (Supplementary Table  14) and in the GO terms of regulation of cellular metabolic and organic cyclic compound metabolic processes (Supplementary Table  15). Hormone-related transcriptional factors are over-presented in the unique gene families to Lauraceae, for example, ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5) 25 and ethylene-responsive transcription factor ERF098. Furthermore, the species-specific gene families of  L. cubeba are significantly enriched in the KEGG pathways of biosynthesis of terpenoids and steroids and nitrogen metabolism, and the gene families under significant expansion in  L. cubeba include many members from the ABC transporter C family, which is generally involved in the membrane transport of the secondary metabolism 26 (Supplementary Tables  16– 21). It is interesting to notice that the TPS and ABC transporter members form gene clusters on chromosomes 8 and 12 (Supplementary Fig.  5). The phylogenetic position of Magnoliids among angiosperm Laurales are an order of Magnoliids, whose evolutionary position, mainly with respect to eudicots and monocots, is still the object of contention 10–  13. On the basis of the 160 single-copy gene families derived from 19 eudicots, 8 monocots, 4 Magnoliids, and 3 outgroup species ( Amborella trichopoda,  Ginkgo biloba, and  Anthoceros punctatus), we constructed phylogenetic trees from the concatenated sequence alignments of both nucleotide and amino acids sequences (Fig.  1a, c, left side). In these analyses, Magnoliids were found as a sister group to eudicots after their common ancestor diverged from monocots, which agrees with a previous study using the  C. kanehirae genome 12. To reduce the possibility of long branch attraction in our phylogenetic analysis, we conducted another phylogenomic analysis without Gramineae species and obtained the same topology (Supplementary Figs.  6 and  7). Because incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) may play a role in confounding resolution of early-diverging branches within angiosperms, such as the divergence of Magnoliids, eudicots, and monocots, we further conducted the multi-species coalescent (MSC)-based phylogenomic analyses using ASTRAL 27 by considering each gene tree from the 160 single-copy gene families separately (Fig.  1a, c, right side). The MSC-based phylogeny using nucleotides (Fig.  1a, right side) again supports a sister group relationship between Magnoliids and eudicots, to the exclusion of monocots. However, the MSC-based tree using amino acids (Fig.  1c, right side) suggests Magnoliids to form a sister group with monocots, after their divergence from eudicots. To evaluate the discordance of gene trees in our single-copy gene data set, we used the  Q value in ASTRAL to display the percentages of gene trees in support of the main topology (q1), and the first (q2) and second (q3) alternative topologies 27 (Fig.  1b, d). For example, the majority of gene trees inferred by both nucleotide and amino acid sequences support Amborellales being a sister group to the other angiosperms as the main topology (q1), while there are few gene trees that support either monocots (q2) or eudicots (q3) being the sister group to other angiosperms, respectively (I in Fig.  1b, d). In contrast, the branching order for Magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots displays a high level of discordance among the single-copy gene trees, with two nearly equally supported (and one slightly less supported) topologies in both nucleotide and amino acid sequences-based analyses (II in Fig.  1b-II, d-II). Other discordances among the single-copy gene trees analyzed with ASTRAL concerned the phylogenetic position of  Vitis vinifera28 and the phylogenetic position of  P. americana (left side in Fig.  1b, d). All phylogenomic analyses focusing on Lauraceae species support a sister relationship of  Litsea and  Cinnamomum (right side in Fig.  1b, d). Whole-genome duplications in Laurales Genome collinearity and paralog age distributions all show indications of two ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) events for  L. cubeba. Intragenomic analysis of gene order reveals collinear regions with up to five (but mostly two to four) paralogous segments (Supplementary Table  22 and Supplementary Fig.  8), while age distributions of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ( KS) for all paralogous genes (paranome), as well as duplicates retained in collinear regions (anchor pairs) both show two signature peaks for WGD events with a recent peak at  KS ≈ 0.5 and a more ancient peak at  KS ≈ 0.8 (Fig.  2a, b). Similarly, previously sequenced genomes (of  C. kanehirae12 and  P. americana14) and transcriptomes (from this study and 1KP 29) of Lauraceae also show two signature peaks in their paranome  KS distributions, except for  Cassytha filiformis (Supplementary Fig.  9), for which only one signature peak could be identified. WGD analyses using the  C. kanehirae genome suggested that the recent WGD in  C. kanehirae is shared by all the Lauraceae species except  C. filiformis, while the ancient WGD seems shared by Laurales and Magnoliales, i.e., the two clades that form a sister group in the Magnoliid clade 12. Also, the analysis of the genome of  L. chinense, another species in the order of Magnoliales, supported a WGD prior to the divergence between Laurales and Magnoliales 8. Our analyses of the transcriptomes of non-Lauraceae Lauralean species, however, found that although some of these species have only one WGD peak in their paranome  KS distributions, others, such as  Peumus boldus,  Laurelia sempervirens,  Gomortega keule, and  Chimonanthus praecox, have two such peaks (Supplementary Fig.  9). Specifically, compared with those in  L. cubeba, the  KS values of the two WGD peaks are larger in  C. praecox and smaller in the other three species, suggesting that the signature peaks in these species may result from either different WGD events or from various substitution rates for duplicates retained following the same WGD events. Indeed, the  KS distributions of one-to-one orthologs identified between  V. vinifera and species from Laurales and Magnoliales show different  KS peaks for the divergence event between  V. vinifera and Magnoliids, indicating different substitution rates within Laurales (Supplementary Fig.  10). In short, our results provide evidence of two WGD events not only in the Lauraceae species but also in some non-Lauraceae species in the Laurales order. To better position the two WGD events identified in the  L. cubeba genome in the lineage of Laurales, we compared the anchor-pair  KS distribution of  L. cubeba with the orthologous  KS distributions (Fig.  2b): (1) between  L. cubeba and  Dehaasia hainanensis,  G. keule, and  C. praecox to represent the divergence of different lineages in Laurales (Fig.  2c); (2) between  L. cubeba and  L. chinense to represent the divergence between Laurales and Magnoliales; and (3) between  L. cubeba and  V. vinifera to represent the divergence between Magnoliids and eudicots. Both the analysis of  KS distributions and relative rate tests to correct for different substitution rates in different species of Laurales (Supplementary Note  2) suggest that the ancient  L. cubeba WGD has occurred shortly before the divergence of Laurales and Magnoliales, while the recent WGD has occurred before the divergence of Lauraceae but closely following the divergence of the lineage including  C. praecox and the lineage including  G. keule (Fig.  2b, c). Some species, such as  L. sempervirens,  G. keule, and  C. praecox, have not experienced the recent WGD identified in  L. cubeba, but also show two signature peaks for WGDs in their paranome  KS distributions (Supplementary Fig.  9). Considering  KS peak values (Supplementary Note  2), we infer independent WGDs in three different lineages of Laurales: one in the lineage leading to  C. praecox and  Idiospermum australiense; one in the lineage leading to  L. sempervirens and  G. keule; and another in the lineage, including Lauraceae,  P. boldus, and possibly  G. americanus (Fig.  2c). Interestingly,  C. filiformis, an obligate parasitic plant in the Lauraceae, and the one with the highest substitution rate in our analysis (Supplementary Fig.  10), show a  KS peak that represents a lineage-specific WGD event after its divergence from other Lauraceae species (Supplementary Fig.  9 and Fig.  2c). However, we propose that  C. filiformis shares the same WGD history as  L. cubeba and the other Lauraceae, but draws a different picture because of its accelerated substitution rate responsible for diminishing the signature peaks for the two WGDs in its paranome  KS distribution. Lauralean species must have experienced rapid radiation over ~3 million years 30. Interestingly, the younger WGD peaks in Laurales seem to coincide with such a period (the right-hand tree in Fig.  2c), which could imply that these WGD events might even have facilitated the rapid radiation of the early Lauralean species. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled that there has been only one WGD event that has occurred shortly before the rapid radiation of Laurales. Under such scenario, our observation of three independent WGDs could be explained by one single WGD that has occurred just before the divergence of Laurales followed by independent diploidizations in the three Lauralean lineages during species radiation, with similarity to the process described in the “lineage-specific ohnologue resolution” model 31. The evolution of floral structures in Lauraceae To investigate the evolution of floral structures in Lauraceae, we first inferred the phylogenetic relationships within Lauraceae using both the concatenated and MSC approaches based on single-copy genes identified from the transcriptomes of 22 species representing 16 genera (Fig.  3a, Supplementary Notes  3 and  4, Supplementary Fig.  11, and Supplementary Table  23). We also obtained a plastid phylogeny based on the reconstructed plastid genomes from 27 species representing 19 genera in Lauraceae (Supplementary Note  5 Supplementary Tables  24 and  25). Phylogenetic trees reconstructed from concatenated sequence alignments had similar topologies than the MSC trees, except for the position of  Lindera and  Laurus (Supplementary Fig.  12). Comparing the nuclear and plastid trees, however, we identified notable differences for some genera in Lauraceae, such as  Lindera,  Laurus,  Nothaphoebe,  Phoebe,  Dehaasia,  Persea, and  Alseodaphne (Supplementary Note  6). ASTRAL analysis also shows phylogenetic discordance among gene trees for the discordant nodes between the nuclear tree and plastid tree (Supplementary Fig.  12), indicating a complicated evolutionary history of Lauraceae. Specifically,  Cryptocarya is the sister group to other Lauraceae species in the plastid tree, while in both the concatenated and MSC trees based on nuclear genes,  Cassytha is a sister to other Lauraceae species. Similar differences have been reported in previous studies 32–  34, at least in our ASTRAL analysis; strong support is given to the sister relationship between  Cassytha and other Lauraceae species with few discordant gene trees with respect to  Cassytha (Supplementary Note  6, Supplementary Fig.  13). Generally, the inflorescences in Lauraceae are panicles, spikes, racemes, pseudo-umbels, and umbels 2. These characteristics of inflorescences are of importance to the classification of the Lauraceae family (Fig.  3b). To investigate the genes that are potentially involved in the evolution of inflorescences, we considered the transcriptomes of flower buds for 21 different species (Supplementary Note  7 and Supplementary Table  26) and phylogeny of Lauraceae inferred by MrBayes 35 were conducted (Fig.  3a). In particular, we focused on the  FUWA genes in 13 genera, because  FUWA has been reported to play an essential role in determining panicle architecture in rice, sorghum, and maize 36. A phylogenetic tree based on the orthologs of FUWA in different Lauraceae species (Supplementary Note  8) seems consistent with the evolution of inflorescences (Fig.  3a, b, and e). The  Cassytha and  Cryptocarya group, which diverged earlier than other Lauraceae lineages, have spike and spikelike panicles, respectively, which are usually referred to as irregular panicles. Subsequently, regular panicles and umbels are present in other Lauraceae species. For example, cymose panicles appear in the  Alseodaphne- Phoebe clade, pseudo-umbels appear in  Sassafras, and umbels appear in the  Litsea- Laurus clade. Consistently, the analyses of domain architectures of the  FUWA gene indicate that the gene contains two conserved NHL domains in the early-diverging lineages of the  Cryptocarya Group and  Cassytha and three NHL domains in other Lauraceae species (Fig.  3e). A similar pattern has also been observed in Lauraceae for involucres. In Lauraceae, genera with panicles and racemes have no involucre, while Sassafras with pseudo-umbels has bracts linear to filamentous, and the  Litsea- Laurus clade with umbels has an obvious involucre. The inflorescences morphological differentiation could be related to the geographic distribution of Lauraceae. The  Cryptocarya Group and  Cassytha are found in the Southern Hemisphere, while the other clades are mainly distributed in the amphi-Pacific or Asian areas. The evolution of perianth tubes in Lauraceae also seems to mirror the phylogeny of Lauraceae (Fig.  3a, c). It has been known that the loss of the trihelix transcription factor PETAL LOSS (PTL) could induce the disruption of perianth development in  Arabidopsis37. Therefore, the differences in  PTL expression in Lauraceae could be consistent with the variations of perianth tubes. Indeed, comparing with the  Litsea- Cinnamomum clade, where the perianth tubes are indistinct, short, and campanulate,  PTL genes from other Lauracea clades exhibit higher level of expression in the flower buds and these species have perianth tubes turbinate or suburceolate (Supplementary Note  9 and Fig.  3c, f). The most recent common ancestor of Laurales was a tree with actinomorphic and bisexual flowers 38. Extant Lauraceae species include both bisexual (dioecious) and unisexual (monoecious) species (Fig.  3d and Supplementary Fig.  1). To identify the genes involved in the sexual determination in Lauraceae, we produced and integrated Illumina transcriptome data for flower buds from 17 species in 10 genera of Lauraceae, including 8 unisexual species in 4 genera and 9 bisexual species in 6 genera (Supplementary Note  7 and Supplementary Table  26). The comparative analyses of the transcriptome data illustrate that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between unisexual and bisexual species are enriched in the KEGG pathway of plant hormone signal transduction. Among these genes,  TGA10 shows obviously higher expression in male flowers from monoecious species than both female flowers from monoecious species and bisexual flowers from dioecious species in Lauraceae (see “Methods,” Supplementary Note  10 and Fig.  3d, g). Our results hence suggest that  TGA10 is involved in male flower development, which is consistent with studies that have found that  TGA10 is required for anther development 39. Moreover, a hypothesized protein (Lcu01G_02292) may also have contributed to sexual determination in Lauraceae, considering their differential expression patterns in bisexual and unisexual flowers in Lauraceae (Supplementary Fig.  14). We also compared the MADS-box genes in the sequenced Lauraceae species and a few other angiosperms (Supplementary Note  11, Supplementary Fig.  15, and Supplementary Table  27). Notably, we found that  SOC1-like genes are expanded in both  L. cubeba (seven members of  SOC1) (Supplementary Table  28) and  C. kanehirae (eight members of  SOC1) 12. Consistent with the expanded  SOC1 clade, the  SVP clade is also expanded and it counts five members in  L. cubeba (Supplementary Fig.  15). It has been reported that the interaction of  SOC1 and  AGL24 from the SVP clade integrates flowering signals in  Arabidopsis40. Both the expanded  SOC1 and  SVP clades could be involved in complex flowering regulation networks and could relate to differential regulation of dioecious plant flowering. Mono-TPS involved in volatiles production in Lauraceae The essential oils produced by Lauraceae are widely used commercially, and contain a variety of components (Supplementary Table  29), such as geranial, neral, limonene, and linalool 7,  12,  19,  20. TPSs are the rate-limiting enzymes in the production of such terpenoids 9,  41 (Fig.  4). The present gene family analysis suggests that the TPS-b gene clade is significantly expanded in Lauraceae (Supplementary Tables  12 and  13). We hence identified all the TPS genes in Lauraceae by combining the data for the  L. cubeba genome and the transcriptome data for 23 species, from 16 genera, in the Lauraceae family (Supplementary Tables  30 and  31). Lauraceae species with a high percentage content of essential oil had larger numbers of TPS-b members (Supplementary Tables  30 and  31), for example,  L. cubeba possessed 24 TPS-b genes in (3–7%, the percentage of essential oil in fresh fruit),  Cinnamomum verum possessed 12 TPS-b genes (1.32–2.13%, the percentage of essential oil in fresh leaves),  Machilus salicina possessed 13 TPS-b genes (1.05%, the percentage of essential oil in fresh leaves), and  P. americana possessed 17 TPS-b genes (1%, the percentage of essential oil in fresh ripe fruit) 14 (Supplementary Tables  30 and  31). We analyzed the first key enzyme in the scent biosynthetic pathway, namely 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), which has three clades (Supplementary Fig.  16). The members in the clade B are expanded across  Litsea,  Beilschmiedia, and  Sassafras (Supplementary Note  12 and Supplementary Fig.  16); as a result, Lauraceae produce high levels of terpenoids.  LcuDXS3-5 belongs to clade B and exhibits very high expression in fruits according to the transcriptome data 42 (Fig.  4). Furthermore, transient overexpression of  LcuDXS3 in  L. cubeba could induce the increase of several components of monoterpene and sesquiterpene (Supplementary Note  12 and Supplementary Fig.  17). To further investigate the members of TPS-b and TPS-g involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, additional expression and functional verification studies were conducted in  L. cubeba. Among the 52 full-length TPS genes in  L. cubeba, 27 were predicted as monoterpene synthase genes, 17 as sesquiterpene synthase genes, and the remaining 8 as diterpene synthase genes (Fig.  4 and Supplementary Tables  32– 34). Tandem duplication (Fig.  5a and Supplementary Fig.  5) events have contributed to the expansion of the TPS-b subfamilies. Both Illumina transcriptome sequencing data (Fig.  4) and qRT-PCR verification showed (Supplementary Fig.  17) that  LcuTPS22 specifically accumulated in leaves. Transient overexpression and enzyme activity assay both demonstrated that LcuTPS22 catalyzed the accumulation of α-pinene, β-pinene, eucalyptol, camphene, eucalyptol, and camphor, which are the main volatile components of the leaves of Lauraceae species (Fig.  5). In addition,  LcuTPS18,  19,  20,  25,  26, and  42 were all highly expressed in the  L. cubeba fruits (Fig.  4 and Supplementary Fig.  17). Transient overexpression and enzyme activity assay also indicated that LcuTPS42 catalyzed the biosynthesis of linalool, phellandrene, and geraniol, which are the main components of the specific scents in Lauraceae (Fig.  5 and Supplementary Fig.  18). Besides the TPS-b gene families, other genes may also function as mediators in scent biosynthesis in  L. cubeba. For example, plant hormone signal transduction enrichment of gene families is unique to Lauraceae; therefore, we investigated the endogenous hormone content and found that abscisic acid (ABA) had a unique peak close to that of the biosynthesized monoterpene in  L. cubeba (Supplementary Fig.  19a). Correspondingly, the treatment of  L. cubeba leaves with ABA induced an increase in both the level of monoterpene (Supplementary Fig.  19b) and the expression of  LcuTPS22 (Supplementary Fig.  19c). In summary, our results provide insights into the candidate genes involved in scent production in the Lauraceae family. Further studies are, however, required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of these genes in the scent biosynthetic pathways in Lauraceae.","The laurel family within the Magnoliids has attracted attentions owing to its scents, variable inflorescences, and controversial phylogenetic position. Here, we present a chromosome-level assembly of the Litsea cubeba genome, together with low-coverage genomic and transcriptomic data for many other Lauraceae. Phylogenomic analyses show phylogenetic discordance at the position of Magnoliids, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting during the divergence of monocots, eudicots, and Magnoliids. An ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) event occurred just before the divergence of Laurales and Magnoliales; subsequently, independent WGDs occurred almost simultaneously in the three Lauralean lineages.

Because there is typically large between array variation, information about the association will come from the differences in traits and expression measurements between the two values hybridised to the two dyes on the same array. It is shown that within-slide correlation of trait values should be minimised. The arrangement of samples for which this occurs will depend on the trait values in question, and is a computationally demanding problem. An alternative is to minimise the rank correlation.

110,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7144588\eupmc_result.json,PMC7144588,"Results Rosenbergiella nectarea strain 8N4 T belongs to the  Enterobacteriaceae family. A neighbor-joining tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences shows that its closest relatives are plant-associated species:  Rosenbergiella,  Phaseolibacter and  Izhakiella ( Lenaerts et al., 2014;  Aizenberg-Gershtein et al., 2016a,  2016b) ( Fig. 1). Electron-microscope imaging enabled the measurement of strain 8N4 T cells.  R. nectarea strain 8N4 T is rod-shaped and variable in size (0.6–1.1 mm wide and 1.2–3.0 mm long). Interestingly, the bacterial cells are nonflagellated rods when grown on culture media supplemented with sucrose ( Fig. 2A). However, when cells are grown on media without sucrose supplementation, flagella can be observed ( Fig. 2B). After 48 hours of incubation on LB agar supplemented with 10% sucrose at 28 °C under aerobic conditions, colonies of  R. nectarea strain 8N4 T are circular and smooth with a yellow/orange pigment. This species demonstrates poor growth in the absence of sucrose. The strain grows at 4–35 °C (optimum 28–30 °C), with 0.0–5.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 3% NaCl) and with 0–60% sucrose (optimum 10–25% sucrose) ( Halpern et al., 2013).  Table 2 shows a summary of the strain’s classification and general features. Genome properties The assembly of the draft genome sequence resulted in 30 scaffolds amounting to 3,294,717 bp, and the GC content was 47.38% ( Table 3). The number of predicted genes was 3,346, of which 3,236 encoded proteins and 110 encoded RNAs. The majority of the protein-coding genes (78.12%) were assigned a putative function, while the remaining ones were annotated as hypothetical proteins. In total we assigned 2,337 (69.84%) of the genes.  Figure 3 shows the distribution of genes into functional categories of clusters of orthologous groups (COGs). There are some indications of the presence of a prophage in the genome of strain 8N4 T. The prophage genes are presented in  Fig. 4 and listed in  Table S1. Some of the traits that were found in the genome of  R. nectarea strain 8N4 T are listed in  Table S2.","Background:Rosenbergiella nectarea strain 8N4T, the type species of the genus Rosenbergiella, was isolated from Amygdalus communis (almond) floral nectar. Other strains of this species were isolated from the floral nectar of Citrus paradisi (grapefruit), Nicotiana glauca (tobacco tree) and from Asphodelus aestivus. R. nectarea strain 8N4T is a Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacterium in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Results:Here we describe features of this organism, together with its genome sequence and annotation. The DNA GC content is 47.38%, the assembly size is 3,294,717 bp, and the total number of genes are 3,346. The genome discloses the possible role that this species may play in the plant. The genome contains both virulence genes, like pectin lyase and hemolysin, that may harm plant cells and genes that are predicted to produce volatile compounds that may impact the visitation rates by nectar consumers, such as pollinators and nectar thieves. Conclusions:The genome of R. nectarea strain 8N4T reveals a mutualistic interaction with the plant host and a possible effect on plant pollination and fitness.","['Pectinase', 'Flower', 'Attractant', 'Pyocin', 'nectar', 'whole genome', 'Repellant', 'Rosenbergiella Nectarea']","['Enterobacteriaceae family', 'Results Rosenbergiella', 'nectarea strain', 'Rosenbergiella nectarea', 'strain', 'Fig.', 'Rosenbergiella', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Table', 'sucrose']","[2016a, 1.2–3.0, 4–35 °C, ’s, 8N4]",[],[],[],NaN
111,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7148358\eupmc_result.json,PMC7148358,"Results Superficial scald symptoms development Superficial scald was evaluated for different maturity stages at harvest (H1 to H3) on 2 orchards from the same location over 3 years (Fig.  1a). Each year scald incidence decreased while fruit maturity at harvest increased. In particular in 2014 no symptom was detected on late H3 fruit, while 25% and 52% of the early H1 fruit, and 12% and 13% of the optimum H2 fruit were affected by scald (Fig.  1b). Scald incidence was significantly higher in 2015 and 2017 (Fig.  1b), with scald incidence reaching 98% to 100% at H1 and remaining above 80% at H2. 2015 and 2017 fruit were also more severely affected than in 2014 (Supplementary Fig.  S1). In 2015 incidence only slightly decreased to 90% at the latest harvest stage H3 while, as observed in 2014, 2017 incidence and severity progressively decreased with higher maturity stage at harvest (Fig.  1b and Supplementary Fig.  S1). However, 2017 incidence remained higher than in 2014. Therefore, 2014 was a “low scald” year, while 2015 and 2017 were “high scald” years. Analysis of pre-harvest climate Climatic variables were retrieved from the weather station located in the location of the orchards in order to analyse pre-harvest conditions each year. The total number of hours when hourly temperature was below 10 °C (NH10) was calculated each year from 60 d, 45 d, 30 d and 20 d before harvest (Table  1). Irrespective of the pre-harvest period considered, the NH10 was lower than 150 hours in all years. Contrary to expectation 15, NH10 was the lowest for the “low scald” year 2014. Based on these results, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for each previously cited period to identify climatic differences between years. The analysis performed for the period of 20 d before harvest showed the maximum difference between the years (Fig.  2a). The first two components of the PCA captured most of the variability accounting for respectively 46% and 30% of explained variance (Fig.  2b). These two components allow the clear separation of pre-harvest days between “low scald” year 2014 and “high scald” years 2015 and 2017. The 2014 pre-harvest days were negatively correlated with PC1 and positively correlated with PC2. PC1 was mainly defined by relative humidity (RH), in particular by the daily mean and minimum RH (RH mean correlation 0.91, P-value = 5 × 10 −25; RH min, correlation 0.86, P-value = 1.4 × 10 −19). PC2 included variables linked to the daily temperature, in particular the minimum and the mean temperature of the day (T min, correlation 0.94, P-value 2.6 × 10 −29; T mean, correlation 0.82, P-value 1.5 × 10 −16). Pre-harvest days were thus dryer and warmer in the “low scald” year of 2014 than in the “high scald” years of 2015 and 2017. Analysis of the daily average temperature confirms that the pre-harvest period was overall warmer in 2014 than in 2015 and 2017 (Fig.  2c). However three days before harvest the mean temperature dropped suddenly from 18 °C to 13 °C. This rapid decrease was especially marked for the daily minimum temperature that dropped from 15 °C to 7 °C (Fig.  2d). A drastic shift of temperature also occurred just before 2017 harvest, a “high-scald” year, but in the opposite way with a rapid increase of the mean and minimum daily temperatures. The low scald incidence observed only in 2014 could be explained by an “ in vivo” acclimation to cold due to the pre-harvest warm period followed by a rapid decrease in temperature. Transcriptome analysis at harvest In order to identify early determinants of scald development, transcriptomic analyses were performed at early harvest stage on the base of scald contrasted phenotypic data after cold storage. Expression profiles of apple peel sampled at harvest from low scald year 2014 were compared with the high scald years 2015 and 2017. Expression profiles of 2014 peel samples from P24 and P36 orchards were compared respectively with expression profiles of 2015 peel samples from P24 and P31 orchards. An additional comparison was set up between 2014-P24 and 2017-R11 peel samples (Fig.  3a). We hypothesized that genes involved in early events that prevent or induce scald development displayed similar differential expression patterns for each comparison. Therefore, we set up an additional t-test combining the three comparisons. 1491 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) were identified with significant BH adjusted P-value (BH < 0.05). Thus, 1435 sense DETs were selected, of which 41.7% were up regulated and 58.3% were down regulated in high scald samples, when compared to low scald samples (Supplementary File  S1). A search for corresponding genes on the  Malus domestica GDDH13 v1.1 genome version 32 led to the identification of 1050 (73.2%) non-redundant genes. Based on MD gene annotation, 57.1% of these DETs were assigned to functional categories (Fig.  3b; Supplementary File  S3). Among them, the most represented were “RNA biosynthesis” (7.81%), “Protein modification” (5.62%), “External stimuli response” (5.05%) and “Protein degradation” (4.57%). It is noteworthy that 42.9% of the DETs were not allocated to any category, and that 7.90% belonged to enzyme categories “oxidoreductase” or “transferase”. In order to validate data obtained from the microarray analysis, the relative transcript abundances of a subset of differentially expressed genes with contrasted expression profiles were tested by RT-qPCR using cDNA from low or high scald samples (Supplementary File  S4). The results were consistent with those obtained from the microarray analysis (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.83). Candidate genes associated with later high scald symptoms The most significantly over-represented category was “External stimuli response” (P-value = 8.61 × 10 −14) and more specifically “response to temperature” (3.81% of DETs, P-value = 3.93 × 10 −17) (Supplementary File  S3). It included members from all known Heat Shock Protein families (HSP100, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60 and sHSP) (Table  2). All 48 DETs belonging to these families were down regulated in 2015 and 2017 when scald incidences were high. The 10 most differentially expressed transcripts of the analysis are potential HSPs, in addition 64% of the top 50 DETs are HSPs (Supplementary File  S1). In particular, we verified that potential orthologous genes to Arabidopsis HSPs known to be induced in response to heat stress were down regulated in “high scald” samples:  MD15G1053800 and  MD13G1108500 respectively coding for small HSPs HSP17.6CII and HSP21, as well as  MD01G1208700 and  MD06G1201200 coding for HSP90.1 and HSP101 37–  40 (Fig.  2c). Furthermore, 74% of the DETs annotated as HSPs could be linked to a gene ontology (GO) annotation related to heat stress (Supplementary File  S1). Most of them were also annotated as responding to light stimulus and/or oxidative stress. The subgroup of Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) was also significantly over represented in the transcriptomic analysis. A potential  HsfA2, activator of transcription for many HSPs in Arabidopsis 41, and its potential targets were particularly repressed in “high scald” samples (Table  2). This transcription factor has been shown to respond to different environmental stresses, including the combination of heat and high light, as well as hydrogen peroxide (Supplementary File  S1). Other transcription factors involved in the light stress response were similarly down regulated in samples from “high scald” fruit batches (Table  3), like the potential orthologous genes of the Arabidopsis bZIP genes  HY5 and  HYH ( MD08G1147100 and  MD16G1132200) 42.  MD03G1297100 and  MD11G1316800, two potential MYB12 regulators of the flavonoid pathways known to respond to high light 43, were also down regulated. In agreement, a potential orthologous downstream regulated gene was also down regulated, namely a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL1,  MD12G1116700).  MD03G1099300, a potential  ZAT12 gene C2H2 transcription factor also named  RHL41 “responsive to high light 41”, was also down regulated. The Arabidopsis  ZAT12 gene ( AT5G59820) was shown to be also induced by heat and cold stress and to be involved in cold and photosynthetic acclimation 44,  45 (Table  3; Supplementary File  S1). A few DETs responding to cold and/or involved in cold acclimation were identified (Table  3, Supplementary File  S1). The most differentially expressed were down regulated in “high scald” samples, and as with  ZAT12 they were also annotated as responding to heat and light stimuli. In particular,  MD14G1150400, a potential orthologue for  AT3G22840 coding for a chlorophyll binding protein ELIP1 involved in photoprotection was down regulated in “high scald” samples. The  MD17G1280400 gene, potentially coding for an orthologue of the AtGOLS1 a galactinol synthase induced by heat, light and cold stimulus, was also down regulated. Finally, among the DETs with GO for response to oxidative stress or probably involved in redox cellular homeostasis, several genes potentially coding for glutathione S-transferase were down regulated ( MD05G1210700, MD05G1210000, MD05G1211000, MD05G1211100, MD04G1139400, MD04G1139500) as well as potential ascorbate peroxidase APX2 ( MD04G1104900), glutaredoxin ( MD06G1110300) and thioredoxin ( MD05G1309500, MD10G1288100) (Table  3; Supplementary File  S1). Interestingly, only 1.9% of the genes were related to the biotic stress response while 12.5% of the DETs had GO related to the abiotic stress response. The whole transcriptome profile suggested that “low scald” fruit have been exposed to abiotic stresses before harvest, probably a combination of thermal and high light stresses. Effect of post-harvest cold acclimation on scald H1 fruit harvested in 2017 were submitted to a post-harvest cold period of 1 week at low temperature prior to classic cold storage (Fig.  4a). When fruit were cold acclimated (H1-acclim), scald incidence was significantly reduced for both fruit batches dropping from 82% to 45% for R06, and from 86% to 56% for R11 after 4 months cold storage (Fig.  4b). Scald symptoms were also less severe for H1-acclim fruit than for H1 fruit (Supplementary Fig.  S3). Scald incidence for H2 fruit, harvested one week later and immediately stored in classic cold was also reduced when compared to H1 fruit, but less than for the H1 acclimated fruits. This intermediate phenotype for H2 fruit was not observed any more after 5 months. (Supplementary Fig.  S3). Therefore, the observed reduced scald incidence for H1-acclim fruit was not only due to more mature fruit (1 week delay before classic cold storage), but principally due to the cold acclimation treatment. Effect of post-harvest cold acclimation on physiological stress indicators As many HSPs responding to various stresses were found induced in 2014, the effect of cold acclimation on their expression was analysed. When compared with classic cold storage (H1 samples), the identified MD genes coding for HSP21, HSP90 and HSP101 were up-regulated after 1 day but not after 1 week of acclimation (Fig.  4c). Cold acclimation conditions tended to limit the major down regulation of HSP genes immediately observed after 1 day when fruit were stored in classic cold conditions (Supplementary Fig.  S4). After one week of acclimation, all tested HSPs gene expression were similarly repressed as in classic cold conditions. The effect of cold acclimation was further analysed using biotic and abiotic stress responsive gene expression 46. The cold acclimation treatment had a repressive effect on  MD12G1116700 gene coding for a phenyl ammonia lyase (PAL) (Fig.  4c). PAL was immediately induced by classic cold storage for 1 week, while the cold acclimation treatment limited its induction for the entire first week of storage (Supplementary Fig.  S4). In contrast, for  MD04G1064200, a PR5 Thaumatin coding gene, the acclimation had a clear repressive effect only for the R06 fruit batch (Fig.  4c). PR5 was progressively induced under classic cold storage, indicating an increasing fruit stress status (Supplementary Fig.  S4). The qPFD chip also included FAR  (MD10G1311000), coding for a terpene synthase probably involved in the pathway leading to the biosynthesis of  α-farnesene, and PPO  (MD10G1299400), coding for a polyphenol oxidase. Both genes are reporters of enzymatic activities suspected of being involved in the appearance of scald symptoms. FAR and PPO were progressively induced by cold storage (Supplementary Fig.  S4). The acclimation treatment transiently inhibited the strong induction of FAR on the first day but did not have a consistent effect on PPO (Fig.  4c) which was also induced in both conditions (Supplementary Fig.  S4).","Superficial scald is one of the most serious postharvest physiological disorders that can affect apples after a prolonged cold storage period. This study investigated the impact of pre- and post-harvest climatic variations on superficial scald in a susceptible apple cultivar. Fruit batches with contrasting phenotypes for superficial scald incidence were identified among several years of ""Granny Smith"" fruit production. The ""low scald"" year pre-harvest climate was characterised by a warm period followed by a sudden decrease in temperature, playing the part of an in vivo acclimation to cold storage. This was associated with many abiotic stress responsive genes which were induced in fruit peel. In particular 48 Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) and 5 Heat Shock transcription Factors (HSFs) were strongly induced at harvest when scald incidence was low. For ""high scald"" year, a post-harvest acclimation of 1 week was efficient in reducing scald incidence. Expression profiles of stress related genes were affected by the acclimation treatment and indicate fruit physiological adaptations to cold storage. The identified stress-responsive genes, and in particular HSPs, could be useful indicators of the fruit physiological status to predict the risk of scald occurrence as early as harvest.",NaN,"['Supplementary Fig.', 'Supplementary File', 'Fig.', 'scald', 'Superficial scald', 'high scald', 'Supplementary', 'cold', 'low scald', 'cold acclimation']","[H3, H1, H1, “, ”, “, NH10, NH10, NH10, “, “, “, PC2, −25, −19, PC2, −16, “, ”, “, °C, °C, °C, “high-scald”, “, ”, P24, P36, P24, P31, 2014-P24, DETs, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “Protein, ”, “oxidoreductase”, “transferase”, “, ”, “, ”, DETs, Heat Shock Protein, HSP100, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, sHSP, DETs, HSPs, DETs, HSPs, HSPs, “, HSPs, HSP21, HSP90.1, HSP101 37–, HSPs, Heat shock transcription factors, HSFs, HSPs, “, “, MD08G1147100, MYB12, “, ”, AT5G59820, DETs, “, “, AtGOLS1, glutathione S-transferase, MD05G1210700, MD05G1210000, MD05G1211000, MD05G1211100, MD04G1139400, MD04G1139500, ascorbate peroxidase, MD04G1104900, glutaredoxin, MD06G1110300, thioredoxin (, MD05G1309500, MD10G1288100, “, scald H1, R11 after 4, H1-acclim, H1 fruit, H1, H1, H1-acclim fruit, HSPs, HSP21, HSP90, HSP101, HSP, HSPs, PR5, qPFD, MD10G1311000, PPO  , polyphenol oxidase, PPO, PPO (]",[],['°C.'],[],terpene synthase

118,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7188761\eupmc_result.json,PMC7188761,"Results and Discussion Evaluation of the Genome Data The results showed that 4,629 Mb HiSeq-data and 3,757 Mb PacBio-data were generated in  P. digitatum DSM 62840. The assembly process produced 31 scaffolds with an estimated genome size of 29.09 Mb and an N50 of 6,602,426 bp. A total of 9,086 protein-encoding genes were predicted in strain DSM 62840 genome by publicly available databases. The length of exons and intron areas were 11,895,138 and 1,017,612 bp, respectively ( Table 1). With regard to RNA, totally 211 tRNAs, 43 rRNAs, 23 sRNAs, 14 snRNAs, and 81 miRNAs were predicted. Currently, four genomes of  P. digitatum species ( P. digitatum Pd1,  P. digitatum PHI26,  P. digitatum Pd01-ZJU, and  P. digitatum PDC 102) were available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database 3 ( Sun et al., 2011,  2013;  Marcet-Houben et al., 2012;  Julca et al., 2016). Assembly statistics of the different  P. digitatum genomes were summarized in  Supplementary Table S2, showing similar GC content but significantly different genome sizes. Additionally, the number of the scaffolds of  P. digitatum DSM 62840 was less than that of strain Pd1, PHI26, and Pd01-ZJU. The annotations with NCBI NR, GO, COG, NOG, KEGG, CAZy, SwissProt, PHI, P450, and TrEMBL protein databases were shown in  Supplementary Table S3. NCBI COG mapping showed that 997 proteins were assigned to COG categories ( Figure 1). The most gene-rich COG classifications were “general functional prediction only,” “energy production and conversion,” “amino acid transport and metabolism,” “translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis,” “carbohydrate transport and metabolism,” “lipid transport and metabolism,” and “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones.” These findings were suggestive of the presence of a variety of protein metabolism and energy metabolism functions that could enable better absorption and transformation of nutrients from the substrates. In order to further understand the gene functions in strain DSM 62840, 7,480, 1,888, and 3,706 genes were assigned to the NOG, KOG, and KEGG database, respectively ( Supplementary Figure S1). It is similar to the COG annotation that some metabolism and biosynthesis categories were highly enriched. Evaluation of the Transcriptome Data Penicillium digitatum DSM 62840 has been proved to be an efficient biocatalyst to transform limonene to α-terpineol when the conversion time was 12 h. Therefore the samples from three different periods were selected to perform RNA-seq in order to find potential candidate genes involved in limonene biotransformation. After removal of low quality reads, the number of clean reads ranged from 42.04 to 43.02 million. And approximately 75.32–80.51% of the clean reads were mapped to the  P. digitatum DSM 62840 reference genome, indicating that the quality of transcriptome sequencing data was reliable ( Supplementary Table S4). Significant changes in the transcriptome profiles were observed at various periods during limonene biotransformation. We used an adjusted  P-value ≤ 0.05 and a fold change ≥ 2.0 as thresholds to identify the DEGs. Totally 448, 4,128, and 4,148 DEGs were identified in these three comparisons (“P_0h vs. P_12h”, “P_0h vs. P_L_12h,” and “P_12h vs. P_L_12h”), respectively ( Table 2). The number of up-regulated DEGs was slightly larger than that of down-regulated DEGs. A total of 260/188, 2,080/2,048, and 2,073/2,075 up-/down-regulated DEGs were identified in these three comparisons, respectively. Apart from this, the number of DEGs in “P_0h vs. P_12h” was less than other two comparisons, owing to no limonene induction. And the number of DEGs or up-/down-regulated DEGs in “P_0h vs. P_L_12h” was almost the same with that in “P_12h vs. P_L_12h.” In order to identify the biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components contributing to limonene biotransformation, GO term analysis were executed on up-/down-regulated DEGs ( Figure 2A). The predominant GO categories included cell, cell parts, membrane and organelles in cellular components, and catalytic activity, binding, transporter activity and structural molecule activity in molecular function. In addition, the main biological process categories were associated with metabolic process, cellular process, localization and biological regulation in both “P_0h vs. P_L_12h” and “P_12h vs. P_L_12h.” These findings were consistent with the results of previous iTRAQ data ( Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover, a KEGG analysis was accomplished to find the active pathways in limonene biotransformation. The up-/down-regulated DEGs were mainly annotated to the following categories: metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of antibiotics, biosynthesis of amino acids, carbon metabolism, ribosome, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, which exemplified that limonene activated the specific metabolic process of cells ( Figure 2B). Notably, most of the genes involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation terms were down-regulated during the bioconversion, and the genes involved in ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters terms were up-regulated. Identification of Secondary Metabolite Biosynthetic Genes Involved in Limonene Biotransformation The biosynthetic genes of secondary metabolites are often in contiguous gene clusters. A number of biosynthetic genes responsible for the synthesis of secondary metabolites were forecasted through antiSMASH 5.0, such as terpene, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), and polyketide synthases (PKS). A total of 32 gene clusters were distinguished in the strain DSM 62840 genome, including 4 Nrps-like, 7 T1pks, 5 terpenes, 7 Nrps, 1 beta-lactone, 1 T1pks-terpene, 1 T1pks-Nrps-like, 1 T3pks-Nrps, 3 T1pks-Nrps, 1 indole-T1pks, and 1 terpene-Nrps-like. And 26 PKS and NRPS gene clusters were revealed, accounting for 81.25% of the total number of predicted gene clusters. The details of the gene clusters were displayed in  Supplementary Table S5. Similar results were also gained in another two  Penicillium sp.,  P. digitatum PHI26 and  Penicillium chrysogenum, which had 13 and 24 NRPSs, 14 and 23 PKS, 3 and 2 NRPS-PKS hybrids, and one and zero prenyltransferase (DMATSs) gene clusters, respectively ( Marcet-Houben et al., 2012). Terpene is one of the most important secondary metabolites in fungi, and it has been widely applied in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics fields ( Yu et al., 2019). Terpene is built from the simple five carbon precursor molecules dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), and these precursors are produced from acetyl-CoA via the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Therefore, we searched the strain DSM 62840 genome in the “terpenoid backbone biosynthesis” pathway and identified 17 key enzymes distributed in the MVA pathway ( Supplementary Table S6), but not the 2-C-methyl- D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-Dxylulose 5-phosphate (MEP/DOXP) pathway ( Supplementary Figure S2). This suggested that  P. digitatum DSM 62840 can proceed through the MVA pathway instead of MEP/DOXP pathway like most fungi. The transcriptional changes in response to limonene were observed in a set of genes associated with terpene biosynthesis ( Table 3). The expression levels of PDIDSM_00870 encoding hexaprenyl-diphosphate synthase (hexPS, COQ1), PDIDSM_339802 encoding prenyl protein peptidase (RCE1 and FACE2), PDIDSM_75960 encoding prenylcysteine oxidase/farnesylcysteine lyase (FCLY), PDIDSM_12890 encoding diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase (MVD and mvaD), PDIDSM_12330 encoding STE24 endopeptidase (STE24), PDIDSM_88970 encoding acetyl-CoA  C-acetyltransferase (atoB) and PDIDSM_69340 encoding hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) had a lower expression in P_L_12h than that in P_0h and P_12h, respectively. Whereas the expression levels of PDIDSM_04030 encoding terpenoid synthase in P_L_12h was higher than that in P_0h and P_12h. Terpenoid synthase could catalyze the IPP and its isomer DMAPP to produce geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). And these products were the precursors of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes, respectively. This suggested that limonene could stimulate the expression of these genes in strain DSM 62840. On the other hand, we found that there were 1 terpene-T1PKS (cluster 3), 1 terpene-NRPS-like (cluster 24) and 5 terpene gene clusters (the clusters of 9, 17, 19, 27, and 30) in the strain DSM 62840 genome. And cluster 3 and cluster 17 showed a 50 and 100% similarity to the PR-toxin biosynthetic gene cluster and deoxysambucinol/sambucinol/roridin E biosynthetic gene cluster, respectively. The clusters 3 and 17 were mainly responsible for the sesquiterpenoid biosynthetic process. Sesquiterpene synthases catalyze the cyclization of the acyclic precursor FPP to form monocyclic, bicyclic, and tricyclic sesquiterpenes. PDIDSM_86810 from cluster 3 was predicted to have the aristolochene synthase (ARI1) activity. ARI1 is a fungal sesquiterpene cyclase that could convert FPP to aristolochene. It is considered to be the precursor of highly oxygenated mycotoxins such us PR-toxin ( Faraldos et al., 2016). Similarly, PDIDSM_02860 from cluster 17 annotated as trichodiene synthase (TRI5) was a sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzed the cyclization of FPP to form the bicyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbon trichodiene and the coproduct pyrophosphate (PPi) ( Vedula et al., 2007). Besides, cluster 30 probably took part in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoid and triterpenes. PDIDSM_55100 from cluster 30 was predicted to possess farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase (FDFT1) activity. FDFT1 catalyzes a two-step reaction in which two molecules of FPP are converted into one molecule of squalene. It is the first committed precursor of sterols and most other triterpenes ( Kempinski et al., 2019). Its epoxidation to produce 2,3-oxidosqualene was catalyzed by PDIDSM_52510 encoding squalene epoxidase (SQLE), and the obtained product was then cyclized into lanosterol. PDIDSM_01820 was annotated as a sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51), and it catalyzed the removal of the 14 α-methyl group from lanosterol. This reaction is a necessary step in sterol biosynthesis. Several genes which were involved in the sterol-biosynthetic pathway were regulated by oxygen and heme levels, such as FDFT1, CYP51, SQLE, and HMGCR. And their expression was influenced by various transcription factors ( Geisler et al., 2013). The results indicated that the transcription of gene FDFT1, CYP51, SQLE, and HMGCR was down-regulated during limonene biotransformation, indicating the inhibition of sterol biosynthesis ( Table 3). Identification of the Differentially Expressed Genes Involved in Energy Metabolism During limonene biotransformation, the DEGs correlated to energy metabolism were significantly down-regulated ( Table 3). TCA cycle can generate metabolic intermediates and energy by a series of enzymes ( Wang et al., 2019). In the present study, it is observed that most genes participated in TCA cycle were down-regulated after limonene induction, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH, PDIDSM_28150), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, PDIDSM_53370), malate dehydrogenase (MDH, PDIDSM_47510), 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH, PDIDSM_43060), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pckA, PDIDSM_36580), pyruvate carboxylase (PDIDSM_16200), and so on. It implied that TCA cycle was blocked to reduce the production of energy for the growth and metabolism of  P. digitatum DSM 62840 with limonene induction. It was probably because that  P. digitatum was strongly inhibited by limonene. Limonene can be dissolved in the membrane cell because of its hydrophobicity, and this will result in the disruption of the membrane integrity and the increase of membrane permeability ( Gonzalez-Estrada et al., 2018). The dysfunction of the membrane interfered the generation of ATP, which could inhibit the mycelia growth of the fungi ( Sivakumar and Bautista-Banos, 2014). The present study also found that the weight of mycelia in P_12h was significantly higher than that in P_L_12h, and this showed that limonene inhibited the growth of  P. digitatum (data not shown). In addition, the iTRAQ results revealed that the differentially expressed proteins related to energy metabolism were down-regulated during limonene transformation, such as NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, SDH, and malic enzyme ( Zhang et al., 2016). Beyond that, it is also observed that cytochrome C oxidase (CCO, PDIDSM_12860) and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase cytochrome b/c1 subunit (fbcH, PDIDSM_34810) involved in oxidative phosphorylation were down-regulated. CCO is a very important electron transporter which could transfer the electrons to generate H 2O and ATP. The down-regulation of its expression could block electron transport chain, which will result in the incomplete oxidation and the overproduction of reactive oxygen species ( Lin et al., 2020). It was speculated that limonene restrained the TCA pathway and inhibited the mycelial growth of  P. digitatum cells via a membrane damage mechanism involving membrane peroxidation. Researchers have pointed out that terpene could damage the mitochondrial membrane permeability and disrupt the TCA pathway of  P. digitatum ( Zheng et al., 2015). Identification of the Differentially Expressed Genes Involved in ABC Transporters As shown previously, limonene could inhibit the growth of the strain and have toxic effect on strain DSM 62840. When the monoterpenes entered into the cell, the fungi might activate an efflux pump system to reduce the toxicity of monoterpenes to the cells through the ABC transporters ( Wang et al., 2013). ABC transporters are a large family of transmembrane proteins, and they can play an important role in the monoterpene resistance ( Demissie et al., 2019).  Wang et al. (2013) indicated that the transcript levels of ABC transporters were up-regulated when  Grosmannia clavigera was exposed to monoterpenes. In the present study, most genes involved in ABC transports were observed to have a twofold increase in their transcript level after induction with limonene, including ABCB1 (PDIDSM_49740, PDIDSM_72790), ABCB6 (PDIDSM_719402), ABCC1 (PDIDSM_06070), FXA1/2 (PDIDSM_20430), PDR5 (PDIDSM_667602, PDIDSM_17720, PDIDSM_667603, PDIDSM_66760), and SNQ2 (PDIDSM_667608, PDIDSM_667609, PDIDSM_76180, PDIDSM_78490, PDIDSM_17650) ( Table 3). Furthermore, the induction of limonene in transcript level was also supported by the results of iTRAQ analysis. The expression abundance of PDIDSM_667602, PDIDSM_719402, PDIDSM_17720, PDIDSM_76180 were significantly up-regulated by 2. 6-, 1. 3-, 2. 21-, and 5.06-fold with limonene induction, respectively (proteome data available via iProX partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD017752). It is hypothesized that the ABC transporters might identify and transport limonene to reduce the toxicity of limonene to strain DSM 62840. Identification of Candidate CYPs Involved in Limonene Biotransformation Filamentous fungi cannot only secrete many primary and secondary metabolites, but also take part in a great deal of complex bioconversions, such as hydroxylation of alkanes, terpenes, fatty acids, flavonoids, sterols, as well as detoxication of xenobiotics. The mounting evidences have showed that CYPs may be responsible for these bioconversions. CYPs-dependent reactions have been proved to include hydroxylation, oxidation, epoxidation, dealkylation, dehydration, deamination, desaturation, dehalogenation, and demethylation ( Makovec and Breskvar, 2000). In order to gain a better understanding on the enzymes which were involved in the limonene biotransformation, the influence of the inhibitors on the enzymatic activity, the enzyme localization, and the inducibility of this enzyme were assessed in this study. The effect of the inhibitors on the enzymatic activity is shown in  Figure 3. The presence of SKF-525A and 1,10-phenanthroline significantly inhibited the activity of the enzyme and retarded the limonene biotransformation ( p < 0.05). SKF-525A is a well-known CYPs inhibitor. Earlier study clearly showed that the presence of SKF-525A inhibited the valencene transformation by  Chaetomium globosum, suggesting the presence of CYPs during this transformation ( Kaspera et al., 2005). Likewise, 1,10-phenanthroline is a metalloproteinase inhibitor and it could also significantly inhibit the limonene biotransformation. This might be due to the interaction between this inhibitor with the metal ion-active site of the enzyme.  Tan et al. (1998) found that phenanthroline showed significant inhibitory effect on limonene bioconversion while the cyanide ions did not show this effect, and this implied that this catalysis system might also be CYPs. Interestingly, F1, F3, and F4 fractions were active while F2 was not active ( Figure 4A). This indicated that the enzymes mainly existed in microsome. It is different from bacterial P450s that they are generally expressed as soluble enzymes, eukaryotic P450s are usually anchored to the inner mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticulum (microsomes). The components of microsomal P450s are membrane-associated proteins. They can be isolated in a microsomal fraction by ultracentrifugation ( Bavishi et al., 2018). Triton X100 is a non-ionic detergent, and it could effectively destroy the membrane environment and promote the solubilization of membrane proteins. Our results clearly showed that the activity and protein content of F4 were higher than that of F3 ( Figures 4A,B). Triton X100 treatment could increase the enzymes’ solubilization and activity. Earlier study implied that the α-terpineol dehydratase from  Pseudomonas gladioli was a particulate-associated enzyme which can convert limonene to α-terpineol. It was partially solubilized in HEPES buffer which contained 2.0% Triton X100 ( Cadwallader et al., 1992). Additionally, it is found that the enzymatic activity of P_L_12h was significantly higher than that of P_0h and P_12h ( p < 0.05), which were up to 13.72 and 8.84%, respectively ( Figure 5). It demonstrated that the enzyme involved in this biotransformation was inducible.  Prieto et al. (2011) also indicated that the enzyme which was responsible for the limonene oxyfunctionalization was inducible in  P. digitatum DSM 62840. In contrast, the enzyme from  Sphingobium sp. was cofactor independent, non-inducible and was able to generate α-terpineol from limonene. This enzyme preferred anaerobic conditions during the biotransformation, and this indicated that it was a hydratase rather than cytochrome P450 ( Bicas et al., 2010). Based on the above results, we had reasons to believe that membrane-associated cytochrome P450 enzymes might be responsible for the limonene biotransformation. In order to find the CYPs genes and pathways related to limonene biotransformation, these two following conditions of the selected genes were required: (1) the genes were assigned to the fungal cytochrome P450 database; (2) the genes were differentially expressed ( P-value ≤ 0.05, twofold threshold) in both “P_0h vs. P_L_12h” and “P_12h vs. P_L_12h.” These results showed that a total of 58 DEGs were obtained, of which 31 were up-regulated and 27 were down-regulated ( Supplementary Table S7). It was possible that some of these potential CYPs were involved in the limonene metabolism ( Table 3). Among these potential candidate genes, the highest expression level was observed for PDIDSM_85260, which was highly similar to the fungal transcriptional regulatory protein in  Penicillium camemberti FM013 at the protein level (94% identity and 95% similarity). PDIDSM_85260 was significantly up-regulated by 3,640- and 3,258-fold in “P_0h vs. P_L_12h” and “P_12h vs. P_L_12h,” respectively. And it was annotated as hypothetical protein PDIG_38620 from  P. digitatum PHI26 containing a GAL4-like Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster DNA-binding domain and a fungal transcription factor regulatory middle homology region, suggesting a possible function as a transcription factor. Most of the zinc proteins participated either in the utilization of carbon/nitrogen sources, or the biosynthesis of amino acids/secondary metabolites, such as MlcR which was involved in the biosynthesis of compactin in  Penicillium citrinum ( Baba et al., 2008), AflR which participated in the biosynthesis of toxic aflatoxin in  Aspergillus flavus ( Woloshuk et al., 1994), NirA which was related to nitrate utilization in  Aspergillus nidulans ( Burger et al., 1991), as well as Gal4 which was responsible for galactose metabolism in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Traven et al., 2006). Thus, the high expression of PDIDSM_85260 suggested that it might take an important part in limonene bioconversion. Limonene was utilized and could activate the transcription of PDIDSM_85260 genes during this biotransformation. However, the actual function and role of PDIDSM_85260 remained to be further explored. To our knowledge, CYPs belong to a superfamily of heme-containing proteins which play a central role in oxidation of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds ( Buathong et al., 2019). CYPs catalyze the insertion of one atom of molecular oxygen into substrates while the other atom is reduced to water. The oxidation of substrates via CYPs requires electron transfer partner, such as a two-protein system (ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase) for bacterial P450s, or NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) for eukaryotic microsomal P450s. Almost all eukaryotic P450s require a protein partner CPR to gain electrons from NADPH for oxygen activation. CPR belongs to the diflavin reductase protein family, and it is located in microsomes ( Ji et al., 2019). In the present study, the expression level of PDIDSM_67430 encoding CPR was strongly stimulated by limonene. CPR expression was increased approximately 132- and 117-fold in P_L_12h compared with that in P_0h and P_12h, respectively. The up-regulation of CPR expression suggested that it might take an important role in limonene biotransformation. During the oxidation reaction of limonene catalyzed CYPs, an oxygen molecule was activated and one of its oxygen atoms was inserted into limonene, the other one was reduced to a water molecule. Meanwhile, the corresponding electron transfer partner CPR was simultaneously induced. The electrons were derived from NADPH and shuttled through CPR into the central heme-group of the CYP. Unfortunately, CPR protein was not found in the proteome data. This may be attributable to the differences of the operating conditions, the surrounding environment, and the samples from different batches, etc. And it has been reported that gene expressions at a transcription could not always transduce up to the protein synthesis due to the complicated post-transcriptional mechanisms ( Greenbaum et al., 2003). Further analysis showed that CPR was involved in tryptophan metabolism and fatty acid degradation pathways and was responsible for the hydroxylation of melatonin and fatty acid according to KEGG annotation. The enzyme catalyzing the hydroxylation of melatonin to 6-hydroxymelatonin is localized in the microsomes and requires molecular oxygen and NADPH. CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 are the important catalyst of the melatonin hydroxylation, of which CYP1A2 is the principal part ( Facciola et al., 2001;  Skene et al., 2001;  Foster et al., 2015). In addition, we noted that several genes were also associated with the hydroxylation of melatonin and fatty acid, including hypothetical protein PDIDSM_86880, PDIDSM_67660 encoding cytochrome P450 alkane hydroxylase, PDIDSM_67750 encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenas, and PDIDSM_08220 encoding P450 family fatty acid hydroxylase (CYP102A2_3). Among these proteins, the PDIDSM_86880 was related to T1PKS-terpene clusters and assigned to iron ion binding, oxidoreductase activity, heme binding and oxidation-reduction process term by GO annotation. There was 89% sequence identity between PDIDSM_86880 and cytochrome P450 from  Penicillium expansum at amino acid level, suggesting that PDIDSM_86880 might possess a putative cytochrome P450 activity. The PDIDSM_86880 was significantly up-regulated in “P_0h vs. P_L_12h” and “P_12h vs. P_L_12h” (9.9- and 6.4-fold, respectively) when incubating with limonene, suggesting that it might be likely involved in the biotransformation. Previously, CYP102 family members have been proven to be capable of hydroxylating fatty acids ( Munday et al., 2016). Of those, CYP102A1 (P450 BM3), a high activity fatty acid hydroxylase, is the first and the most representative member. It has been widely regarded as a model for studying the mechanisms of different substrates hydroxylation, such as sterols, flavonoids, and terpenes. It is able to produce perillyl alcohol from limonene, and its variations VVF (A264 V/A328 V/L437F) could increase the regioselectivity of limonene C-7 oxidation by up to 97% ( Kim and de Montellano, 2009). Furthermore, other CYP102s have been confirmed that they share many properties with CYP102A1, such as substrate specificity. CYP102A7 was not only involved in fatty acid hydroxylation, but also exhibited hydroxylation activity for terpenes and terpenoids. Specifically, the main product of limonene oxidation was 1, 2-limonene epoxide, carveol and 8, 9-limonene epoxide by CYP102A7 ( Dietrich et al., 2008). Limonene-8,9-epoxide has been implicated as an intermediate in limonene bioconversion. It was hypothesized that α-terpineol was obtained from limonene via epoxidation of limonene and reductive cleavage of epoxide using  P. digitatum ( Tan et al., 1998). Hence, we speculated that CYP102A2_3 from strain DSM 62840 might have the similar catalytic function with the CYP102A7, and it might catalyze limonene to limonene-8,9-epoxide, which would result in the production of α-terpineol. Regretfully, CYP102A2_3 expression was significantly down-regulated in “P_0h vs. P_L_12h” and “P_12h vs. P_L_12h” (3.3- and 5.1-fold, respectively) when this fungal was incubated with limonene in the present study. Gene expression levels can be affected by a variety of factors. Further studies are necessary to verify the functions of CYP102A2_3. In addition, some genes were predicted to possess benzoate 4-monooxygenase (CYP53A15) activity, such as PDIDSM_577403, PDIDSM_42610, PDIDSM_12990, PDIDSM_0468015, PDIDSM_62110, and so on. Interesting, these genes were up-regulated in both “P_0h vs. P_L_12h” and “P_12h vs. P_L_12h.” CYP53A15 belongs to CYP53 family that is highly conserved proteins. CYP53A15 is correlated to detoxification and degradation of benzoate, and is capable of hydroxylating benzoate to 4-hydroxybenzoate. It can be further metabolized by the β-ketoadipate pathway to generate intermediates which will enter into the TCA cycle ( Tamaki et al., 2018). Benzoate is essential for the metabolism pathways of aromatic compounds, and could inhibit fungal growth. It is reported that benzoate 4-monooxygenase gene from  Cochliobolus heterostrophus was up-regulated after the infection of maize, and this demonstrated that benzoate detoxification in plant pathogenic fungi contributed to their pathogenicity ( Degani, 2014). In addition, the proteomic studies showed a significant rise in PDIDSM_62110 with limonene treatment, which was in agreement with the findings of the transcriptome data. It is inferred that limonene transformation may be associated with the detoxification and degradation of benzoate. Further efforts are needed to confirm this assumption. Validation of RNA-Seq Results by RT-qPCR Ten DEGs were selected for RT-qPCR analysis to validate the transcriptome data ( Figure 6). The results showed that the expression level of CYP51 and SDH decreased with limonene treatment, and PDIDSM_55100 ( p < 0.01), MDH ( p < 0.01), CCO ( p < 0.01), and PDIDSM_08220 ( p < 0.01) were significantly down-regulated with limonene treatment. In contrast, the transcript abundance of CPR ( p < 0.01), CYP53A15 ( p < 0.01), PDIDSM_86880 ( p < 0.05), and PDIDSM_85260 ( p < 0.01) was significantly up-regulated in P_L_12h compared with that in P_0h. This result manifested that RT-qPCR data gave good agreement with the transcriptome data.","α-Terpineol has been widely used in daily chemical, pharmaceutical, food, and flavor industries due to its pleasant odor with high economic value and pharmacological action. Our previous study showed that Penicillium digitatum DSM 62840 was an efficient biocatalyst for the transformation of limonene to α-terpineol. Thus, it was meaningful to explore the genome features and the gene expression differences of strain DSM 62840 during limonene biotransformation, and the detailed bioconversion pathways. In this study, the functional genes related to limonene bioconversion were investigated using genome and transcriptome sequences analysis. The results showed that the P. digitatum DSM 62840 genome was estimated to be 29.09 Mb and it encoded 9,086 protein-encoding genes. The most annotated genes were associated to some protein metabolism and energy metabolism functions. When the threshold for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was set at twofold ratio, a total of 4,128, and 4,148 DEGs were identified in P_L_12h (limonene-treated condition) compared with P_0h (blank) and P_12h (limonene-untreated blank), respectively. Among them, the expression levels of genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, energy metabolism and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were significantly altered during the biotransformation. And the reliability of these results was further confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, we found that the enzyme participated in limonene biotransformation was inducible. This enzyme was located in the microsome, and it was inhibited by cytochrome P450 inhibitors. This indicated that the cytochrome P450 may be responsible for the limonene bioconversion. Several differentially expressed cytochrome P450 genes were further identified, such as PDIDSM_85260 and PDIDSM_67430, which were significantly up-regulated with limonene treatment. These genes may be responsible for converting limonene to α-terpineol. Totally, the genomic and transcriptomic data could provide valuable information in the discovery of related-genes which was involved in limonene biotransformation, pathogenicity of fungi, and investigation of metabolites and biological pathways of strain DSM 62840.","['Genomic', 'Cytochrome p450', 'Transcriptomic', 'Penicillium Digitatum Dsm 62840', 'Limonene Biotransformation']","['PDIDSM', 'limonene', 'limonene biotransformation', 'Supplementary Table', 'digitatum DSM', 'strain DSM', 'genes', 'genes involved', 'DSM', 'gene clusters']","[6,602,426, 1,017,612, digitatum species, PHI26, Pd01-ZJU, PHI, P450, gene-rich, “, ” “amino acid, ” “carbohydrate, ”, “posttranslational, ”, KOG, α-terpineol, RNA-seq, ≤, ≥, “P_0h, P_12h”, “P_0h, P_L_12h, ”, “P_12h, P_L_12h”, 260/188, 2,080/2,048, 2,073/2,075, “P_0h, P_12h”, “P_0h, P_L_12h”, “P_12h, P_L_12h, ”, “P_0h, P_L_12h”, “P_12h, P_L_12h, ”, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, T1pks, Nrps, S5, NRPSs, zero prenyltransferase, ”, PDIDSM_00870, hexaprenyl-diphosphate synthase, hexPS, PDIDSM_339802, prenyl protein peptidase, RCE1, FACE2, PDIDSM_75960, prenylcysteine oxidase/farnesylcysteine lyase, PDIDSM_12890, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, mvaD, PDIDSM_12330, STE24 endopeptidase, STE24, PDIDSM_88970, acetyl-CoA  C-acetyltransferase, PDIDSM_69340, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, HMGCR, P_L_12h, P_0h, P_12h, PDIDSM_04030, P_L_12h, P_0h, P_12h, DMAPP, geranyl pyrophosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, GGPP, deoxysambucinol/sambucinol/roridin E, PDIDSM_86810, Faraldos et, PDIDSM_02860, trichodiene synthase, TRI5, PDIDSM_55100, farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase, FDFT1, FDFT1, Its, PDIDSM_52510, SQLE, PDIDSM_01820, sterol 14-demethylase, CYP51, FDFT1, CYP51, SQLE, HMGCR, FDFT1, CYP51, SQLE, HMGCR, sterol biosynthesis ( Table 3, isocitrate dehydrogenase, PDIDSM_28150, succinate dehydrogenase, SDH, PDIDSM_53370, malate dehydrogenase, MDH, PDIDSM_47510, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, OGDH, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate carboxylase, P_12h, P_L_12h, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, SDH, malic enzyme, cytochrome C oxidase, PDIDSM_12860, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase cytochrome b/c1, PDIDSM_34810, Lin et al., ABC transporters, ABC transporters, ABCB1, PDIDSM_49740, PDIDSM_72790, ABCB6, PDIDSM_719402, ABCC1, PDIDSM_06070, FXA1/2 (PDIDSM_20430, PDR5, PDIDSM_667602, PDIDSM_17720, PDIDSM_667603, PDIDSM_66760, SNQ2, PDIDSM_667608, PDIDSM_667609, PDIDSM_76180, PDIDSM_78490, PDIDSM_667602, PDIDSM_719402, PDIDSM_17720, PDIDSM_76180, iProX, PXD017752, ABC transporters, CYPs, CYPs, Breskvar, SKF-525A, CYPs, CYPs, Kaspera, CYPs, F3, F2, P450s, P450s, Bavishi, F4, F3 ( Figures 4A, ’, α-terpineol dehydratase, α-terpineol, P_L_12h, P_0h, P_12h, α-terpineol, cytochrome P450, Bicas, cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYPs, cytochrome P450, ≤, “P_0h, P_L_12h”, “P_12h, P_L_12h, ”, CYPs, PDIDSM_85260, FM013, PDIDSM_85260, 3,640-, 3,258-fold, “P_0h, P_L_12h”, “P_12h, P_L_12h, ”, MlcR, AflR, NirA, Gal4, PDIDSM_85260, PDIDSM_85260, PDIDSM_85260, CYPs, CYPs, CYPs, ferredoxin, ferredoxin reductase, P450s, NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase, P450s, diflavin reductase, PDIDSM_67430, P_L_12h, P_0h, P_12h, CYPs, CYP, melatonin, melatonin, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, melatonin, CYP1A2, melatonin, PDIDSM_86880, PDIDSM_67660, cytochrome P450 alkane hydroxylase, PDIDSM_67750, cytochrome P450 monooxygenas, PDIDSM_08220, P450, PDIDSM_86880, oxidoreductase, PDIDSM_86880, cytochrome P450, PDIDSM_86880, cytochrome P450, PDIDSM_86880, “P_0h, P_L_12h”, “P_12h, P_L_12h”, hydroxylating fatty acids, CYP102A1 (, P450 BM3, Kim, CYP102s, CYP102A1, CYP102A7, 9-limonene epoxide, CYP102A7, α-terpineol, CYP102A2_3, CYP102A7, α-terpineol, CYP102A2_3, “P_0h, P_L_12h”, “P_12h, P_L_12h”, CYP102A2_3, benzoate 4-monooxygenase, PDIDSM_577403, PDIDSM_42610, PDIDSM_12990, PDIDSM_0468015, PDIDSM_62110, “P_0h, P_L_12h”, “P_12h, P_L_12h, ”, β-ketoadipate, benzoate 4-monooxygenase, PDIDSM_62110, CYP51, SDH, PDIDSM_55100, MDH, PDIDSM_08220, PDIDSM_86880, PDIDSM_85260, P_L_12h, P_0h]",[],[],[],terpene synthase
119,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7192455\eupmc_result.json,PMC7192455,"Results and discussion Identification of TS homologues TSs from different origins show substantial differences in overall primary amino acid sequence, but possess a strongly conserved metal binding domain consisting of an acidic amino acid (AA)-rich motif (D/N) DXX (D/E) or DDXXXE located within 80–120 or 230–270 AA of the N-terminus and an Asn/Ser/Glu triad closer to the C-terminus, which are the signature domains of the class I TS. 2,167 protein sequences out of 73,714 proteins were identified to be TSs and their homologues based on the HMM search as described in the Material and Methods. In a previous study, 262 presumptive bacterial TSs were identified and 27 proteins were functionally characterised in  in vivo conditions [ 37]. Several other bacterial TSs have been characterised and their activities identified with single or multiple substrates [ 24, 28, 36, 38– 41]. In this study, presumptive TS homologue protein sequences were clustered by pairwise similarity, and from the resulting neighbour-joining tree ( Fig 1) we identified TSs from Gram-positive bacteria, mainly from the order  Actinomycetales, as well as Gram-negative bacteria belonging to numerous orders. We annotated 2,167 TSs in the neighbour-joining tree including geosmin synthases, 2-methylisoborneol synthases and several presumptive TSs whose functionality could not be assigned based on their protein sequences ( Fig 1). TSs already identified in the MIBiG database (125 TSs;  https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org) [ 42] were marked when they had e-values of 0 by BLASTp search against the 2,167 HMM hit proteins. Many bacterial strains in the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phylum have TS-like genes, while more than 70% contain the phytoene synthase motif. Enzymes containing this motif are mostly involved in phytoene biosynthesis, a tetra-terpene (C 40) precursor for lycopene biosynthesis. Geosmin synthases and 2-methylisoborneol synthases from bacteria that have been well studied were excluded and presumptive TSs from Actinobacteria and proteobacteria were selected for functional characterization in this study. In total 22 TSs were selected from different clades ( Fig 1) based on one of the following criteria: (i) the sequences contain a single terpene synthase domain (330–350 AA) which belongs to the Isoprenoid Biosynthesis C1 superfamily; (ii) they are from Gram-positive, Gram-negative, thermophilic or thermo-tolerant bacteria; (iii) they are from bacteria that contain other known TSs and have at least 30–40% identity to known TSs but its functionality are not characterized. Functional characterisation of these TSs and identification of their products based on their acyclic allylic diphosphate substrate specificity requires experimental validation which is shown in this work. The 22 potential TSs are selected from the orders of Actinomycetales (Actinobacteria), Burkholderiales (Proteobacteria), Myxococcales (Myxobacteria), Flavobacteriales (Flavobacteria) and Chloroflexales (Terrabacteria). They are: two TSs (AHY47823.1 and AHY45426.1) from the radiation resistant and thermotolerant  Rubrobacter radiotolerans [ 43]; Four TSs (KYF56472.1, CAN96536, KYF59190.1, KYF75876.1) from a prolific secondary metabolite producer  Sorangium sps [ 44]; TS KFG92939.1 from  Burkholderia paludis which was isolated from Southeast Pahang tropical peat swamp forest soil in Malaysia [ 45]; AHH94051.1 from  Kutzneria albida DSM 43870; KPH97530 from  Actinobacteria bacterium OV450; ADU09376.1 from  Micromonospora sp. L5;  geoS (CAB41566.1) from  Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2); ACY98649.1 from an aerobic, cellulolytic, thermophilic Gram-positive bacterium  Thermomonospora curvata [ 46]; EXG82599.1 from  Cryptosporangium arvum DSM 44712; ELQ82238.1 from  Streptomyces rimosus; ABU58787.1 from  Roseiflexus castenholzii DSM 13941; three hypothetical proteins (KFE96946.1, KFF23441.1 and EJL71407.1) from  Chryseobacterium sps [ 47]; two (EST32145.1 and KIZ18902.1) from soil bacteria belonging to  Streptomyces sps; CFM47198.1 from  C.  vrystaatense; KJK55818.1 from  Saccharothrix sp. ST-888 ( Table 1,  S1 Fig). In vitro functional characterization of TSs TS (ADU09376.1, MiGerS) from  Micromonospora sp. L5 incubated with FPP yielded β-elemene, and 8-isopropenyl-1,5-dimethyl-1,5-cyclodecadiene (or also called 1(10),4,11-germacratriene) ( Fig 2G and  S10H Fig and  S10I Fig;  Table 1). The sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, β-elemene, found is most likely an artefact of GC-MS analysis arising from thermal cope rearrangement of germacrene A at elevated temperature [ 57– 59]. Therefore we assumed this synthase produced germacrene A in addition to germacratriene, and was annotated as germacatriene synthase, as germacatriene was the major compound produced. Incubation of the sesquiterpene synthase (10-epi-cubebol synthase; CAN96536.1, ScEpiS) from  Sorangium cellulosum Soce56 with GPP yielded the monoterpene products cis- and trans-β-ocimene, which differ in the position of the isolated double bond, and linalool which was not shown in previous work ( Fig 3C) [ 49]. All three monoterpene products were confirmed using commercial standards ( S11 Fig). When ScEpiS was incubated with FPP the products obtained were 10-epi-α-cubinene, 10-epi-β-cubinene, β-copaene, cadina-3,5-diene, cubebol, γ-cadinene, δ-cadinene, sesquiterpene alcohol 10-epi-cubebol, α-cadinene, 1,10-di-epi-cubenol and cubenol ( Fig 2H). These results confirmed previous observations [ 49] The other minor compounds previously observed: germacrene D, (+)-eremophilene, bicyclogermacrene, T-cadinol, and α-cadinol were not observed due to the solvent extraction method used in this work, instead of sensitive closed loop stripping analysis (CLSA) method used in the previous study. As we have shown in this study, others have observed that heterologous expression of the epi-cubebol synthase from  Streptosporangium roseum in  E.  coli also resulted in the production of β-pinene, β-ocimene (cis- and trans-) and linalool isomers, demonstrating that many sesquiterpene synthases can also accept GPP as substrate [ 60]. Until now, only two bacterial monoterpene synthases linalool synthase (bLinS) and 1,8-cineole synthases (bCinS) from  Streptomyces clavuligerus are well studied [ 61] and structurally characterized [ 6]. Broad substrate spectra have been observed previously for bacterial TSs: spata-13, 17-diene synthase is an enzyme with sesqui-, di-, and sester-terpene synthase activity [ 41], a bLinS from  S.  clavuligerus accepts GPP and FPP [ 23], and incubation of corvol ether B synthase (BAJ27126) from  Kitasatospora setae with GPP yielded linalool as a major product and small amounts of several acyclic and cyclic monoterpenes [ 62]. CFM47198.1, ELQ82238.1, ACY98649.1, EXG82599.1, ABU58787.1, EJL71407.1, KFE96946.1 were tested for compound production with FPP and GPP but no terpenoids were detected. ( S12 Fig) Codon optimized selected TSs were DNA synthesised and cloned into pETM11 with a TEV protease cleavable N-terminal His-tag by GeneArt ( S3 Table). For the heterologous expression of these TSs, the plasmids were transformed into either  E.  coli Bl21 (DE3) or ArcticExpress (DE3) ( S1 Table) and grown in 2xYT media with optimal inducer concentrations to obtain soluble protein. Recombinant proteins were purified using nickel affinity chromatography and subsequently salt and imidazole were removed by a desalting column prior to  in vitro activity assays. Terpenoids resulting from the incubation of the purified recombinant TSs from different bacteria with FPP were extracted using hexane ( Fig 2;  Table 1), while products formed with GPP were extracted using nonane ( Fig 3;  Table 1). Products were identified using authentic standards where possible. Purified recombinant geosmin synthase from  Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) [ 48] and crude extracts with overexpressed limonene synthase from  Mentha spicata (LimS) [ 29] were used as a positive control to validate the  in vitro assays for sesquiterpenoids and monoterpenoids, respectively. As expected, purified geosmin synthase yielded the sesquiterpenoids geosmin, germacradienol and germacrene D in the assay mixture upon incubation with FPP ( S2 Fig and  S3 Fig), whereas the monoterpene limonene was formed when GPP was added to limonene synthase containing crude extracts ( S4 Fig and  S5 Fig). Incubation of a recombinant TS (NCBI accession number AHY47823.1, RrNerS) from the radiation resistant, thermotolerant actinobacterium  Rubrobacter radiotolerans [ 43] with FPP yielded a single product that was identified as trans-nerolidol by GC–QToF analysis ( Fig 2A,  Table 1) and this was further confirmed using standards ( S6 Fig). Incubation with GPP yielded both R- and S- linalool isomers, which were confirmed using standards ( Fig 3A and  S7 Fig,  Table 1). Therefore, this TS was annotated as linalool/nerolidol synthase. Another terpene cyclase homologue, AHY45426 (RrBerS), from  R.  radiotolerans also showed activity with both FPP and GPP, yielding α-bergamotene ( Fig 2B,  S10A Fig,  Table 1) and linalool ( Fig 3B,  S8 Fig,  Table 1) respectively. Therefore, these two TSs are the first to be identified in thermotolerant bacteria,  R.  radiotolerans, which have both mono- and sesqui-terpene synthases activities and are active up to 60°C ( S9 Fig). These thermostable TSs can aid in engineering industrially important TSs to tolerate cultivation at higher temperatures [ 50]. The terpene cyclase (KYF56472.1, ScAroS) from the soil-dwelling Gram-negative bacterium  Sorangium cellulosum converted FPP into only aromadendrene in  in vitro analysis ( Fig 2C and  S10B Fig;  Table 1). Aromadendrene is mostly observed in eucalyptus oil and is also produced by a citrus TS,  CsSesquiTPS5 [ 51] and it has been shown to have antibacterial activity to multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria [ 52]. KYF56472.1 was therefore named aromandendrene synthase. The sesquiterpene cyclase (KFG92939, BpLonS) from  Burkholderia paludis was incubated with FPP to yield two sesquiterpenoids, (±)-cadinene and longiborneol ( Fig 2D and  S10C Fig and  S10D Fig;  Table 1) and was therefore assigned as longiborneol synthase. Incubation with GPP did not yield any observable products. Longiborneol synthases are mostly found in fungi [ 53] and Norway spruce [ 54]. Fusarium uses longiborneol as a precursor for producing the tricyclic mycotoxin culmorin [ 55]. This enzyme from  B.  paludis is the first bacterial longiborneol synthase identified. AHH94051.1 (KaGerS ) from  Kutzneria albida DSM 43870 has 50% identity to germacradienol/ geosmin synthase (fragment) and we tested its functionality with FPP in  in vitro conditions. This yielded germacradienol and germacrene D ( Fig 2E and  S10E Fig;  Table 1) and did not yield any monoterpenes when incubated with GPP. Production of germacradienol was confirmed by comparison to spectra published by Agger et al (2008) [ 56]. The hypothetical protein 450_5823 (KPH97530.1, AbAcoS) from  Actinobacteria bacterium OV450 converted FPP into copaene and acora-3,7(14)-diene ( Fig 2F and  S10F Fig and  S10G Fig;  Table 1), while incubation with GPP did not yield any products. KPH97530.1 was annotated as acoradiene synthase based on its product formation. In vivo production of mono- and sesqui-terpenoids by enhancing MVA pathway precursor supply To quantify the  in vivo product formation, all identified TSs were cloned into the pBbB2a-GPPS (as described in material and methods) backbone plasmid and co-expressed with pMVA plasmid in  E.  coli [ 7] and FPP is supplied via endogenous IspA activity [ 63]. Cultures were overlaid with nonane to extract the metabolites and analysed by GC-QToF. RrNerS produced monoterpenes β-myrcene, linalool, cis-geraniol; and sesquiterpenes: (±)-trans-nerolidol, α/β-farnesene and farnesol in  in vivo conditions ( Fig 4A) whereas its homologue RrBerS yielded monoterpenes β-myrcene, linalool, trans-geraniol and trans-α-bergamotene, α/β-farnesene, (±)-trans-nerolidol, farnesol ( Fig 4B).  MiGerS from  Micromonospora sp. L5 expressed in  E.  coli produced germacrene A and 1,(10),4,11-germacratriene as seen in the  in vitro assays ( Fig 4C). ScAroS and ScEpiS both from  Sorangium, produced similar mono-terpenoids, which are β-pinene, cis- and trans-ocimene, and linalool ( Fig 4D and  Fig 4E). However they produce different sesquiterpenes in both  in vitro and  in vivo conditions: aromandendrene is produced by ScAroS whereas 10-epi-α/β-cubinene, β-copaene, cadina-3,5-diene, cubebol, δ/γ-cadinene and 10-epi-cubebol are produced by CAN96536 ( Fig 4D and  Fig 4F). KaGerS from  Kutzneria albida DSM 43870 produced germacrene D and germacrenedienol ( Fig 4G). Overexpression of hypothetical protein ELQ82238.1 (SrGuaS) from  Streptomyces rimosus produced multiple sesquiterpenes: guaia-1(10)11-diene and (+)-γ-gurjunene when expressed in  E.  coli ( Fig 4H,  S14A Fig and  S14B Fig). Whereas ACY98649.1 (TcCubS) from  Thermomonospora curvata DSM 43183 ( Fig 4I,  S14C Fig) and EXG82599.1 (CaCubS) from  Cryptosporangium arvum DSM 44712 ( Fig 4J,  S14D Fig) produced minor amounts of cubebol in  E.  coli. Terpene synthases may produce different terpene skeletons when expressed natively or in heterologous host compared to their product biosynthesis in  in vitro conditions due to variations in protein folding and assay conditions [ 64]. Geosmin synthase from  Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) when expressed in  E.  coli produced various monoterpenes: β-myrcene, β-ocimene, linalool and geraniol ( S13 Fig) which was unexpected and unexplored for this enzyme as well as the sesquiterpenes: germacradienol, germacrene D but geosmin was not detected, presumably due to inactivity of the C- terminal a-domain in  in vivo ( S13 Fig). In vivo production of possible diterpenes For diterpene synthase activity, the substrate GGPP was synthesized in house but due to its hydrophobic nature the substrate was insoluble in aqueous solution and could not be used in  in vitro enzyme assays. For rapid identification of diterpene synthase activity it is essential to generate abundant amounts of GGPP for  in vivo production in  E.  coli. For this purpose, the native farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase ( ispA) from  E.  coli with two mutations D2G, C155G ( ispAM22), which can function as geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase [ 65], was employed to generate GGPP  in vivo. GGPP synthase activity using the variant prenyltransferase was confirmed by overexpression of spata-13, 17-diene synthase from  Streptomyces xinghaiensis [ 41] together with GGPP synthase ( ispAM22). This yielded the diterpene spata-13,17-diene, where the produced compound was extracted using a nonane layer ( S15 Fig). ABU58787.1 (RcDTPS ) from  Roseiflexus castenholzii DSM 13941 ( Fig 5A,  S16 Fig), EJL71407.1 (CsDTPS) from  Chryseobacterium sp. CF314 ( Fig 5B,  S17 Fig, and KFE96946 (ClDTPS) from  Chryseobacterium luteum ( Fig 5C and  S18 Fig) produced various possible diterpene products when expressed together with  ispAM22 in  E.  coli DH5α. Due to low product yields, the detected compounds could not be annotated by a NIST library search alone. By co-expressing the heterologous MVA pathway, the precursor supply for diterpene, production was enhanced which led to a 10-fold increased production. However, this was still not enough to determine the compounds produced. Large scale production and purification of the diterpenes would be required for structural determination by NMR analysis. In this study, we identified 15 putative bacterial TSs out of 22 that were tested, which produced structurally diverse mono-, sesqui- and di-terpenoids by  in vitro and/or  in vivo assays. We have shown TSs with new activity: 7 sesqui-terpenoid synthases, 3 di-terpenoid synthases and 5 mono-/sesqui-terpenoid synthases which were identified from Gram-positive, Gram-negative and thermophilic tolerant bacterial species. Many sesquiterpene synthases were shown to also have activity as a monoterpene synthase, which suggests that dual substrate specificity is very common for bacterial TSs. In vivo production of all types of terpenoids by  E.  coli makes an attractive platform for rapid identification of enzymes as well as for better and cheaper production yields through metabolic engineering. Especially the newly discovered TSs from the thermophilic/tolerant bacterial species is very promising for further protein evolution studies to design the end terpene product, which we have started [ 50] and to exploit the enzyme stability at higher temperatures. In addition, production of diterpenoids in  E.  coli as an alternative screening method to  in vitro assays is useful due to the difficulties with solubility of GGPP. The results presented in this study suggest that further exploration of putative TSs from different bacteria along with Actinomycetes could expand the structural plethora of terpenes. The majority of the terpene products identified in this study are known to be produced by plant or fungi and reveals that TSs are widely distributed in bacteria. Given the number of uncharacterized bacterial enzymes that exist in nature, it is likely that there remains a wealth of chemistry to be discovered and exploited. Expanding the search for novel terpenoid biosynthesis will provide numerous structures with unexplored properties that could potentially help to develop novel compounds for pharmacological or industrial applications.","Terpenes are the largest class of natural products with extensive structural diversity and are widely used as pharmaceuticals, herbicides, flavourings, fragrances, and biofuels. While they have mostly been isolated from plants and fungi, the availability and analysis of bacterial genome sequence data indicates that bacteria also possess many putative terpene synthase genes. In this study, we further explore this potential for terpene synthase activity in bacteria. Twenty two potential class I terpene synthase genes (TSs) were selected to represent the full sequence diversity of bacterial synthase candidates and recombinantly expressed in E. coli. Terpene synthase activity was detected for 15 of these enzymes, and included mono-, sesqui- and diterpene synthase activities. A number of confirmed sesquiterpene synthases also exhibited promiscuous monoterpene synthase activity, suggesting that bacteria are potentially a richer source of monoterpene synthase activity then previously assumed. Several terpenoid products not previously detected in bacteria were identified, including aromandendrene, acora-3,7(14)-diene and longiborneol. Overall, we have identified promiscuous terpene synthases in bacteria and demonstrated that terpene synthases with substrate promiscuity are widely distributed in nature, forming a rich resource for engineering terpene biosynthetic pathways for biotechnology.",NaN,"['Fig', 'TSs', 'synthase', 'Table', 'FPP', 'GPP', 'synthases', 'produced', 'amino acid', 'Glu triad']","[80–120, 230–270 AA, Asn/Ser/Glu, class I TS, 73,714, TSs, TSs, TSs, 38– 41], TSs, TSs, TSs, MIBiG, TSs, TSs, TSs, C1, TSs, 30–40, TSs, TSs, TSs, TSs (, AHY47823.1, AHY45426.1, TSs, CAN96536, KYF59190.1, KYF75876.1, KFG92939.1, AHH94051.1, KPH97530, OV450, ADU09376.1, CAB41566.1, ACY98649.1, EXG82599.1, ELQ82238.1, ABU58787.1, KFE96946.1, KFF23441.1, EJL71407.1, EST32145.1, KIZ18902.1, CFM47198.1, KJK55818.1, TSs TS, ADU09376.1, MiGerS, β-elemene, germacatriene synthase, CAN96536.1, ScEpiS, Soce56, ScEpiS, α-cadinol, epi-cubebol synthase, β-pinene, bLinS, TSs, spata-13, sester-terpene synthase, bLinS, FPP [ 23], corvol ether B synthase, CFM47198.1, ELQ82238.1, ACY98649.1, EXG82599.1, ABU58787.1, EJL71407.1, KFE96946.1, S12, TSs, GeneArt ( S3 Table, TSs, ArcticExpress, LimS, S2, AHY47823.1, RrNerS, GC–, R-, TS, linalool/nerolidol synthase, AHY45426, RrBerS, TSs, °C, TSs, TSs, ScAroS, KYF56472.1, KFG92939, BpLonS, AHH94051.1, KaGerS, germacradienol/ geosmin synthase, germacradienol, KPH97530.1, AbAcoS, OV450, KPH97530.1, sesqui-terpenoids, TSs, pBbB2a-GPPS, pMVA, cis-geraniol, (±)-trans-nerolidol, α/β-farnesene, RrBerS, α/β-farnesene, (±)-trans-nerolidol, ScAroS, ScEpiS, mono-terpenoids, ScAroS, CAN96536, 4F, KaGerS, germacrenedienol, SrGuaS, ACY98649.1, TcCubS, EXG82599.1, CaCubS, S13, germacradienol, C- terminal a-domain, S13, GGPP, GGPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, D2G, C155G, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase [ 65], GGPP  , GGPP, prenyltransferase, spata-13, GGPP synthase, spata-13,17-diene, S15, EJL71407.1, CsDTPS, CF314, KFE96946 (ClDTPS, TSs, di-terpenoids, TSs, TSs, GGPP]","['CsSesquiTPS5', '(RcDTPS', '(CsDTPS)', '(ClDTPS)']",['C.'],[],terpene synthase
120,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7221582\eupmc_result.json,PMC7221582,"2. Results 2.1. Influence of Inducer Concentration on Limonene Yields Previous studies with a single plasmid strain ( E. coli DH1 pJBEI-6409) cultivated in complex medium elucidated that low inducer concentrations (0.025 mM isopropyl β- d−1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)) resulted in the highest limonene titers [ 8]. It was hypothesized that the amount of LacI produced by the single copy of  lacI in the vector might not be enough to fully repress all three promoters in pJBEI-6409. The fully expressed MVA and limonene pathway at high IPTG levels could be too stressful for efficient limonene production. In the present study, different IPTG levels (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mM) were tested for the optimal expression of heterologous genes. In comparison to the mentioned study, a different single plasmid strain was used ( E. coli BL21 (DE3) pJBEI-6410), which carries a version of pJBEI-6409 harboring ampicillin resistance instead of chloramphenicol resistance. Furthermore, fermentations were carried out in M9 minimal medium instead of a complex medium. It turned out that the highest biomass specific yields could be obtained with IPTG concentrations of 0.05 mM and 0.1 mM ( Figure 2). These values are high compared to the reported inducer concentrations for the producer strain  E. coli DH1 pJBEI-6409 [ 8]. Following the hypothesis of Alonso-Gutierrez et al., the higher optimal inducer levels could be explained by a higher  lacI expression level [ 8]. In contrast to  E. coli DH1, the host strain  E. coli BL21 (DE3) carries a Lac regulatory construct in its genome [ 15]. This operon includes  lacIq, which is a mutant of  lacI with a 10-fold higher expression level that leads to a lower basal expression of T7 RNA and therefore to a more tightly controlled expression [ 16]. For the following experiments, the inducer concentration of 0.1 mM IPTG was chosen to ensure sufficient induction during bioreactor experiments. 2.2. Glycerol as the Sole Carbon Source for Fermentative Limonene Production A prolonged growth phase of  E. coli and higher product concentrations with glycerol as the sole carbon source were described by Willrodt et al. in an aforementioned study [ 13]. In order to investigate if these influences can also be observed with  E. coli BL21 (DE3) pJBEI-6410, shake flask experiments were carried out using either glucose or glycerol as the sole carbon source. In the case of glucose, the substrate was consumed completely after 10 h, whereas glycerol was still present in the fermentation medium after 11 h. Finally, the carbon source was fully consumed in both cultivations. The growth curves were also similar (Appendix,  Figure A1). Using glucose for the carbon supply resulted in a final limonene concentration of 121 ± 1 mg·L org−1 in the organic phase ( Figure 3A). By comparison, the fermentation with glycerol showed a prolonged production phase, resulting in a final limonene concentration of 184 ± 11 mg·L org−1. The limonene yields relative to the carbon source were 9.3 ± 0.1 g·C-mol −1 and 14.2 ± 0.8 g·C-mol −1, for glucose and glycerol, respectively ( Figure 3B). These results confirm previous observations that glycerol is the better choice as a carbon source for fermentative limonene production with  E. coli. 2.3. Fermentative Limonene Production in a Stirred-tank Reactor The first attempt to produce limonene with  E. coli BL21 (DE3) pJBEI-6410 and glycerol as the sole carbon source in a two-liquid phase fed-batch setup was carried out in a 3.1 L reactor with 1 L of M9 minimal medium and 0.5 L of the organic carrier solvent diisononyl phthalate (DINP). A carbon limited exponential feed was applied with a calculated growth rate of 0.18 h −1 ( Figure 4A,B), which was based on a substrate specific biomass production rate obtained from an initial batch cultivation. Heterologous gene expression was induced with the addition of 0.1 mM IPTG after two hours of fed-batch cultivation. After 10 h of exponential growth, no further increase in biomass was observed. The growth rate for this period was 0.15 h −1 and a final cell dry weight (CDW) of 28.7 g·L −1 was achieved. No accumulation of glycerol was detected until this time point. Acetate formation was suppressed during growth. After 11 h, growth stopped, and the exponential feed was set constant. During the next 15 h, glycerol accumulated, followed by acetate formation, leading to final concentrations of 5.7 g·L −1 glycerol and 2.8 g·L −1 acetate. The ammonium concentration increased during the fermentation from 0.4 to 1.9 g·L −1, probably due to the pH regulation with ammonia as a result of acetate and carbon dioxide formation. The specific activity of limonene synthesis increased after induction with IPTG and reached a maximum of 2.6 U g CDW−1 by the end of exponential growth. However, significant limonene formation was still observed for the non-growing cells, and a final limonene concentration of 4.4 g·L org−1 was achieved. Concentrations of limonene were determined for the organic phase volume, because of the significant dilution of the aqueous phase due to the addition of the feed solution. The cell growth and the production of limonene seemed to be limited by a yet unidentified mechanism, which might be the accumulation of limonene or another compound related to the biosynthesis of limonene—such as an intermediate or metabolite—or a limitation caused by the depletion of a medium component. To test whether intracellular limonene, terpene intermediates, or the expression of heterologous pathway genes influence cell growth, a glycerol-limited fed-batch fermentation was carried out without the induction of the heterologous pathway (data not shown). Although heterologous gene expression was not induced, 222 mg·L org−1 limonene was produced during the exponential growth. These small amounts are probably caused by leaky expression of the pathway genes. Nearly identical CDW was achieved, while 20-fold less limonene was produced. Therefore, toxification by intermediates of the MVA pathway or intracellular limonene can be excluded. In order to overcome the growth limitation, the parameters for the fermentation were changed to permit prolonged exponential growth, coupled with higher limonene concentrations. A carbon limited exponential feed was set up with a calculated growth rate of 0.15 h −1, which is lower than in the previous experiments (0.18 h −1) ( Figure 4C,D). Furthermore, additional US* trace elements were supplied. After 6 and 16 h of cultivation, 2 and 1 mL of US* trace element solution were spiked, respectively. The exponential growth could be maintained for nearly 17 h, with a growth rate of 0.12 h −1. Thus, the addition of trace elements prolonged the growth phase, and a CDW of 48.8 g·L −1 was reached, whereas the second trace element spike did not affect the cells in their stationary phase. The specific activity quickly increased reaching a maximum of 1.8 U g CDW−1 after 5 h, before it decreased with ongoing fermentation. In contrast to in previous experiments, the specific activity could be maintained above 1 U g CDW−1 for a time period of more than 17 h. The prolonged production phase and higher biomass concentration resulted in 7.3 g·L org−1 limonene after 24 h by the end of the fermentation. To our knowledge, this is the highest limonene titer reported so far.","Monoterpenes, such as the cyclic terpene limonene, are valuable and important natural products widely used in food, cosmetics, household chemicals, and pharmaceutical applications. The biotechnological production of limonene with microorganisms may complement traditional plant extraction methods. For this purpose, the bioprocess needs to be stable and ought to show high titers and space-time yields. In this study, a limonene production process was developed with metabolically engineered  Escherichia coli  at the bioreactor scale. Therefore, fed-batch fermentations in minimal medium and in the presence of a non-toxic organic phase were carried out with  E. coli  BL21 (DE3) pJBEI-6410 harboring the optimized genes for the mevalonate pathway and the limonene synthase from  Mentha spicata  on a single plasmid. The feasibility of glycerol as the sole carbon source for cell growth and limonene synthesis was examined, and it was applied in an optimized fermentation setup. Titers on a gram-scale of up to 7.3 g·L org  -1  (corresponding to 3.6 g·L -1  in the aqueous production phase) were achieved with industrially viable space-time yields of 0.15 g·L -1 ·h -1 . These are the highest monoterpene concentrations obtained with a microorganism to date, and these findings provide the basis for the development of an economic and industrially relevant bioprocess.","['Bioprocess', 'Monoterpenes', 'glycerol', 'Limonene', 'Mevalonate Pathway', 'Biocatalyst', 'Reaction Engineering', 'In Situ Product Removal', 'Two-liquid Phase Fermentation']","['Limonene', 'growth', 'Carbon Source', 'IPTG', 'limonene production', 'Carbon', 'limonene concentration', 'Glycerol', 'exponential growth', 'Figure']","[Inducer, β- d−1-thiogalactopyranoside, LacI, pJBEI-6409, Alonso-Gutierrez, Lac, Willrodt, mg·L org−1, ±, g·C-mol −1, g·C-mol −1, Stirred-tank, −1, −1, g·L −1, g·L −1 glycerol, g·L −1, g·L −1, U g CDW−1, g·L org−1, mg·L org−1, CDW, −1, −1, US, −1, g·L −1, U g CDW−1, g·L org−1]",[],[],[],NaN
121,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7238024\eupmc_result.json,PMC7238024,"2. Results 2.1. Copy Number of MVK and DXR Genes in Plants We used a diverse array of angiosperm species to perform genome-wide analysis of  MVK and  DXR genes and three species as outgroups: one basal angiosperm, one basal Viridiplantae and one Chlorophyta ( Figure 1). Thirty-one  MVK and 31  DXR sequences were identified in 24 species. We identified 22  MVK and 21  DXR genes in 16 eudicotyledonous species, while in monocotyledons we identified 7  MVK and 6  DXR sequences in five species. In the three outgroup species assessed, we identified 2  MVK and 4  DXR genes, except in the unicellular green algae,  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which does not have a gene encoding  MVK ( Table 1).  Chenopodium quinoa,  Glycine max,  Gossypium raimondii,  Marchantia polymorpha,  Populus trichocarpa,  Ricinus communis,  Musa acuminata and  Setaria italica had between two and three genes encoding  MVK and  DXR ( Table 1). As expected, predictions of the subcellular localization of MVK and DXR proteins for all 24 species revealed that MVK is likely located in the cytosol and DXR is likely located in chloroplasts. 2.2. Phylogenetic Analyses We focused our phylogenetic analysis on plant species whose complete genomes were available within the PLAZA 4.0 database ( Figure 2 and  Figure 3). The  MVK gene family was divided into three groups ( Figure 2). The first group was composed of outgroup species (red). The second group (blue) contained monocotyledon species and the last group (black) contained eudicotyledon species ( Figure 2). The phylogenetic tree of  DXR revealed a more complex division than  MVK ( Figure 3). We observed one group containing the outgroup species  C. reinhardtii and  M. polymorpha (red), while the monocotyledon genes were grouped into one major group (blue) and dicotyledons were divided into two groups (black), one of which was near the outgroup species  A. trichopoda. In  C. arabica,  MVK (comp31934) and  DXR (comp33448) sequences were retrieved from a transcriptome set previously developed by our group [ 28]. In this case, we demonstrate that these sequences are closely related to  C. canephora genes ( Figure 4). 2.3. Exon–Intron Structure of MVK and DXR Genes Exon–intron structures were analyzed to enhance our understanding of the structural diversity of the  MVK and  DXR genes of angiosperm species. To perform the analyses, publicly available genomic sequences from the PLAZA database ( Figure 5A,B) were used. According to these analyses, the  MVK gene from all species have five exons, except the  LOC_Os10g18220 gene from  O. sativa, which has four ( Figure 5A). Further, most  DXR genes have between 11 and 13 exons, but for the  CAN.G1077.21 gene of  C. annuum we observed only four exons ( Figure 5B). The shortest  MVK and  DXR full length gene occur in  U. gibba (≅ 2Kb), while the longest ~12 kb  MVK full length gene is from  S. italica ( Seita.3G273700) and the longest  DXR full length gene ( ~10 kb) is in  C. quinoa (A UR62008212) ( Figure 5A,B). 2.4. Nucleotide Substitution and Selection in MVK and DXR Genes To verify the possibility of distinct evolutionary pressures, we analyzed the individual selection profile of each amino acid, as well as the non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions in eudicotyledonous and monocotyledonous  MVK and  DXR genes. Our results showed that the dN/dS ratios of sequences among the  MVK and  DXR genes were distinct ( Table 2). In addition, all estimated dN/dS values were substantially less than 1, suggesting that all  MVK and  DXR sequences within each group assessed are under strong purifying selection pressure. We observed lower dN/dS ratios in  DXR than  MVK ( Table 2). Both genes had lower dN/dS ratios in eudicotyledons than in monocotyledons, except for  DXR in model M5 ( Table 2). We found three positively selected sites in eudicots within the  MVK gene using a Bayesian inference approach to calculate site-specific positive and purifying selection. We also evaluated the identification of sites of positive selection using three methods: SLAC (single likelihood ancestor counting), FEL (fixed-effects likelihood) and MEME (Mixed Effects Model of Evolution). FEL and SLAC software did not detect any positively selected codon sites. MEME analyses, however, did positively identify the selected sites ( Table 3). In  MVK, the MEME model detected three positively selected sites in eudicotyledons and four sites in monocotyledons. Site 42 was identified as a positively selected site in both angiosperm groups. With regard to the analysis of  DXR using MEME, five positively selected sites in eudicotyledons and two in monocotyledons were identified. 2.5. Estimated Time of Duplication of MVK and DXR Genes The duplication rates of the  MVK and  DXR genes were estimated for species with more than one gene copy ( M. polymorpha, G. raimondii, P. trichocarpa, R. communis, M. acuminata, S. italica, C. quinoa and  G. max). We used substitution data and inferred nucleotide substitution rates ( Table 4 and  Table 5). In order to clarify cases of tandem duplication, segmental duplication and whole-genome duplication, we also retrieved a synteny analysis from Plaza database 4.0 ( Figure S1). The  MVK gene has been duplicated in seven angiosperm species ( Table 4). Five species are eudicotyledons ( C. quinoa,  G. max, G. raimondii, P. trichocarpa and  R. communis) and two species are monocotyledons ( M. acuminata and  S. italica). In  MVK, the lowest dN/dS ratio and the most recent duplication event was identified in  P. trichocarpa ( Table 4), which corresponds to a tandem duplication ( Figure S1) between two copies of  MVK—Potri.005G034600 and  Potri.005G035300—which occurred less than 1 million years ago ( Figure S1 and  Table 5). The oldest event was determined to occur in  M. acuminata ( Table 4). Among the species considered, only  R. communis and  S. italica had more than one copy of  MVK and no recent genomic duplication events were identified [ 14], suggesting that a species-specific event generated these gene duplications. We identified that  G. raimondii and  P. trichocarpa that had undergone a recent whole-genome duplication also have duplicated  MVK coding genes ( Figure S1 and  Table 4). All species with duplicated  MVK genes also have duplicated  DXR, except for  S. italica and  R. comunnis. Thus,  DXR duplication appears to be more genome duplication-dependent than  MVK duplication.  P. trichocarpha and  G. max have an unusual profile of the genes in which each have three  DXR genes and three  MVK genes, respectively ( Table 5). The synteny analysis ( Figure S1) corroborate that most observed duplications correspond to WGD with two cases of local gene duplication. It was not possible to calculate distance for  DXR in  M. polymorpha ( Table 5). 2.6. Recombination Events of MVK and DXR Genes We identified intragenic recombination events in  MVK and  DXR using Geneconv, RDP and MaxChi methods. Five  MVK genes—in two eudicot species, two monocot species and one outgroup—experienced recombination events ( Table 6). A total of eight  DXR genes—in five eudicot species, two monocots and one outgroup—also had recombination events ( Table 7). In the analysis of the  MVK genes, Seita.3G273700 from  S. italica had the highest number of recombinations (5). The lowest number (1) was observed in  M. acuminta, in the gene MAC04G2409 ( Table 7). For  DXR, the highest number of recombinations (6) was observed in  M. polymorpha, in the Mapoly0064s0074 gene, and the lowest number of recombination events (1) in  T. cacao, in the TCA.TCM_01200 gene ( Table 7). 2.7. RNA-seq-Based Expression Profiles To determine the  MVK and  DXR gene expression profiles among angiosperms, we used public RNA-seq data from seven plant species ( A. thaliana, C. canephora, P. trichocarpa, O. sativa, S. bicolor, B. distachyon and S. italica) and four tissues (leaves, roots, flowers and fruits) ( Figure 6).  MVK transcripts were expressed most highly in  A. thaliana roots with 56 RPKM ( At5g27450),  P. trichocarpa roots with 60 RPKM ( Potri.013g024000),  C. canephora flowers ( Cc00_g15600) with 70 RPKM and  S. bicolor flowers with 42 RPKM ( Sobic.004g012400) ( Figure 6).  DXR, on the other hand, was most highly expressed in  A. thaliana leaves ( At5g62790) with 181 RPKM  C. canephora roots with 88 RPKM ( Cc04_g14010),  O. sativa leaves with 308 RPKM ( Os01g01710),  S. bicolor leaves with 215 RPKM ( Sobic.003g103300) and  S. lycopersicum flowers with 608 RPKM ( Solyc03g114340.2). For both genes, the lowest levels of expression were observed in  P. trichocarpa in most organs analyzed ( Figure 6). Our results indicated that  MVK is mostly expressed in roots and flowers, and  DXR in leaves. Digital gene expression (DGE) profile analysis of  CaMVK ( Figure 7A,B) and  CaDXR ( Figure 7C,D) from several organs of  C. arabica was also analyzed. The  CaDXR ( Figure 7C) gene had higher transcript levels than  CaMVK ( Figure 7A) in leaves, flowers and fruits (30 to 150 DAF). However, while  CaMVK steadily decreases its expression along fruit development,  CaDXS is decreased only in the late stages of fruit development. In addition, we observed that application of methyl jasmonate upregulated the expression of  CaMVK and  CaDXR in fruits ( Figure 7B,D). In order to provide an overall picture of transcriptional responses of MVA and MEP pathways in coffee, we provide DGE analysis of 23 genes of these pathways after MJ application ( Figure S2) and in several organs ( Figure S3), including  CaMVK and  CaDXR. Eleven genes (52.3%) were upregulated similarly to  CaMVK and  CaDXR ( CaDXS2,  CaDXS4,  CaMCT,  CaCMK,  CaHDS1,  CaHDS2,  CaIDI,  CaGGPPS1,  CaGGPPS2,  CaAACT2,  CaHMGS,  CaMPDC and  CaIDI), while six were downregulated ( CaDXS1,  CaDXS3,  CaMECPS,  CaGGPPS3,  CaAACT1,  CaPMK) and two genes ( CaIDS and  CaHMGR) did not show significant differences under MJ application ( Figure S2). We observed in the fruit development DGE analysis ( Figure S3) that 18 genes showed similar expression pattern with  CaMVK and  CaDXR—high transcript levels in flowers and low in leaves ( CaDXS2, C aDXS4,  CaCMK,  CaMECPS,  CaHDS1,  CaHDS2,  CaIDI,  CaIDS,  CaGGPPS1,  CaAACCT1,  CaAACCT2,  CaHMGS,  CaHMGR,  CaPMK,  CaMPDC and  CaIDI). 2.8. RT-qPCR-Based Transcriptional Profile of MVK and DXR Genes in C. arabica Levels of  CaMVK and  CaDXR gene expression in flowers, endosperm and the perisperm of fruits 120 days after flowering (DAF) were evaluated using RT-qPCR. Both genes were more active in flowers, followed by perisperm and endosperm ( Figure 8A,B). We also verified that exogenous application of hexanoic acid, a well-known natural priming substance, was capable of modulating  CaMVK and  CaDXR transcriptional profiles in leaves and roots.  CaMVK was upregulated in the roots of Obatã cultivar ( Figure 8D) post-Hx treatment.  CaDXR was downregulated in leaves of Catuaí Vermelho ( Figure 8E) treated with Hx.","Terpenoids are a diverse class of metabolites that impact plant metabolism in response to environmental cues. They are synthesized either via a predominantly cytosolic (MVA) pathway or a plastidic pathway (MEP). In  Arabidopsis , several enzymes from the MVA and MEP pathways are encoded by gene families, excluding  MVK  and  DXR , which are single-copy genes. In this study, we assess the diversity, evolution and expression of  DXR  and  MVK  genes in selected angiosperms and  Coffea arabica  in particular. Evolutionary analysis revealed that  DXR  and  MVK  underwent purifying selection, but the selection effect for  DXR  was stronger than it was fo r MVK . Digital gene expression (DGE) profile analysis of six species revealed that expression levels of  MVK  in flowers and roots were high, whereas for  DXR  peak values were observed in leaves. In  C. arabica , both genes were highly expressed in flowers, and  CaDXR  was upregulated in response to methyl jasmonate.  C. arabica  DGE data were validated by assessing gene expression in selected organs, and by plants treated with hexanoic acid (Hx) using RT-qPCR.  MVK  expression was upregulated in roots treated with Hx.  CaDXR  was downregulated in leaves by Hx treatment in a genotype-specific manner, indicating a differential response to priming.","['Coffea', 'Purifying Selection', 'Rt-qpcr', 'Mva And Mep Pathways']","['DXR Genes', 'MVK', 'DXR', 'Figure', 'MVK gene', 'MVK genes', 'Genes', 'Table', 'gene', 'species']","[PLAZA 4.0, comp31934, comp33448, PLAZA, Seita.3G273700, SLAC, —Potri.005G034600, comunnis, WGD, Seita.3G273700, MAC04G2409, Mapoly0064s0074, TCA.TCM_01200, Potri.013g024000, Cc00_g15600, Sobic.004g012400, At5g62790, Os01g01710, Sobic.003g103300, Solyc03g114340.2, D, D, MJ, CaDXS2, CaDXS1, MJ, C aDXS4, Obatã]",[],"['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']",[],NaN

Frankliniella occidentalis Oviposits Preferentially on INSV and TSWV Mixed-Infected Leaves In all choice tests ( Figure 1), the number of eggs deposited was significantly higher in the leaf disc mixed-infected with TSWV and INSV when female thrips were allowed to choose between mixed-infected leaf discs and singly infected (INSV or TSWV) or uninfected leaf discs of  Emilia sonchifolia.  E. sonchifolia is the host commonly used to maintain TSWV and is generally liked by  F. occidentalis. Our result demonstrates that female thrips prefer mixed-infected leaves over singly infected or healthy leaves for their offspring. Results from the preference test suggest that vector thrips’ preference for mixed-infected plants may lead to an increase in transmission rate of TWSV and INSV mixed infection. Since symptoms of TSWV and INSV in  E. sonchifolia mixed-infected plants were indistinguishable from the ones seen in single virus infection ( Figure 2), we tested if other cues rather than visual were involved in thrips behavior and compared volatiles from mixed-infected  E. sonchifolia with those from singly infected or healthy plants using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). In our results, we found a total of 42 volatiles identifiable with confidence after removal of common GC–MS contaminants ( Table S1, Supplementary Materials). Although we were unable to detect specific volatile compounds that only associated with mixed-infected plants, and although the profile of all plant volatiles collected from different treatments was similar based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ( Figure S1, Supplementary Materials), few volatiles already seen to be important in virus–plant–vector interactions appeared in our analyses ( Table S1, Supplementary Materials). Among them, ( Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate, already shown to attract the parasitic wasp  Cotesia glomerata [ 41], was seen only in mixed-infected plants (two out of four mixed-infected plants), while undecanal (aldehydes) and  d-limonene (monoterpenes) were not present in TSWV-infected plants but were present in the other treatments (in three healthy, two mixed-infected, and one INSV-infected plants out of four plants for each treatment; and in three healthy, one mixed-infected, and one INSV-infected plants out of four plants for each treatment).  d-Limonene is a known attractant of some insects such as  Diaphorina citri (also known as Asian citrus psyllid, the vector of citrus greening) and of their predators [ 42, 43].  Propylaea japonica is more attracted to healthy sour orange ( Citrus aurantium) because of the high level of the combination of  d-limonene and beta-ocimene, and lack of methyl salicylate emitted by those plants [ 43]. Finally, citrus varieties that are tolerant to  Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (the causal agent of citrus greening) emitted more aldehydes (undecanal, geranial, citronella, and neral) and monoterpenes including  d-limonene [ 44]. On the contrary, methyl salicylate, a well-known SA-derived volatile that attracts the aphid predator  Coccinella septempunctata [ 45] and the beneficial insect  Chrysopa nigricornis [ 46], but is repellant to predators of  Diaphorina citri [ 43], was only present in TSWV-infected plants (two out of four TSWV-infected plants). 2.2. INSV Is Preferentially Acquired and Transmitted from Singly and Mixed-Infected Plants Results from the egg oviposition experiment suggested that the vector  F. occidentalis prefers mixed-infected plants and this may lead to an increase in transmission rate of mixed infections. Thus, the ability of  F. occidentalis to acquire and transmit TSWV, INSV, and both viruses was tested. The status of the infected plants at the time of acquisition was tested by ELISA, and plants with similar level of each virus (Optical Density O.D. = 1.7) were used for virus acquisition and transmission tests. Virus retention by 21 groups of five thrips each from TSWV-, INSV-, or mixed-infected  E. sonchifolia was evaluated by testing the presence of TSWV and INSV by RT-PCR in the insect bodies two days after they reached adulthood. Seventeen out of 21 thrips groups were able to retain only INSV from mixed-infected plants, one group retained both TSWV and INSV (total of 18 groups for INSV), and one group retained only TSWV from mixed-infected plants (for a total of two groups able to acquire TSWV). Two groups of thrips were unable to retain either virus. The virus retention rate for single thrips, calculated using binGroup [ 47], was as follows: 0.3078 (30.78 individuals in 100) for INSV, 0.0194 for TSWV, and 0.0095 for both viruses. Experiment results of single thrips transmission using  E.  sonchifolia leaf discs showed that thrips tended to transmit TSWV (average 16.65%,  n = 64) less efficiently compared with INSV (average 30.11%,  n = 56), when insects were left feeding on either TSWV or INSV singly infected leaf discs ( Figure 3). Both viruses could be transmitted from mixed-infected plants (average 3.37% for TSWV and 27.97% for INSV,  n = 89). There was no significant difference in transmission efficiency for INSV between singly (average 30.11%) and mixed-infected (average 27.97%) plants. However, transmission efficiency for TSWV from mixed-infected plants was much lower (3.37%,  n = 89) than from TSWV singly infected plants (16.65%,  n = 64) ( p < 0.05). No simultaneous transmission of TSWV and INSV was ever detected in this experiment. Our results suggest that, even if TSWV retention and transmission efficiency were decreased by the presence of INSV, TSWV could still be transmitted to a new plant host, either by itself or, at a very low rate, together with INSV.","Mixed infections provide opportunities for viruses to increase genetic diversity by facilitating genomic reassortment or recombination, and they may lead to the emergence of new virus species. Mixed infections of two economically important orthotospoviruses, Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus (TSWV) and Impatiens necrotic spot orthotospovirus (INSV), were found in recent years, but no natural reassortants between INSV and TSWV were ever reported. The goal of this study was to establish how vector preferences and the ability to transmit INSV and TSWV influence transmission and establishment of mixed infections. Our results demonstrate that thrips prefer to oviposit on TSWV and INSV mixed-infected plants over singly infected or healthy plants, providing young nymphs with the opportunity to acquire both viruses. Conversely, we observed that thrips served as a bottleneck during transmission and favored transmission of one of the two viruses over the second one, or over transmission of both viruses simultaneously. This constraint was relaxed in plants, when transmission of TSWV and INSV occurred sequentially, demonstrating that plants serve as orthotospovirus permissive hosts, while thrips serve as a bottleneck. Viral fitness, as measured by virus replication, transmission, and competition with other viral strains, is not well studied in mixed infection. Our study looks at the success of transmission during mixed infection of orthotopoviruses, enhancing the understanding of orthotospovirus epidemiology and evolution.","['Mixed infection', 'bottleneck', 'thrips', 'Tswv', 'Vector Preference', 'Orthotospovirus', 'Insv']","['TSWV', 'INSV', 'mixed-infected plants', 'plants', 'Mixed-Infected', 'Supplementary Materials', 'singly infected', 'thrips', 'Figure', 'singly']","[TWSV, INSV-infected, INSV-infected, Mixed-Infected Plants, TSWV-, INSV-, binGroup]",[],[],['Citrus'],NaN
123,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7272924\eupmc_result.json,PMC7272924,"Results Herbivory Final leafhopper densities ranged from 0 to 1.14 insects/leaf (mean = 0.49,  SD = 0.35) and mean percent damaged leaf area ranged from 0.57% to 11.58% (mean = 2.99,  SD = 2.83) ( Figure 1). There was a non-linear trend in the relationship between final leafhopper density and visible leaf damage ( Figure 1B). Damage remained below 3% leaf area until about 0.6 insects/young leaf, when damage started to increase with increasing leafhopper density. Additionally, mean damage across all leaves and damage to the DCSE focal leaf were strongly correlated (Pearson’s  r = 0.71). Volatiles We found 155 volatile metabolites in total ( Supplementary Table S1) with 76 compounds detected in all samples. Final leafhopper density explained 10.66% of the variation in volatile profile. There was a significant effect of final leafhopper density on the volatile profile [RDA,  F(1, 16) = 1.1,  p = 0.002]. Step functions (a line with a slope of zero but a change in y-intercept at a threshold) best described the relationship between leafhopper density and natural log-transformed RPA for 12 of the biomarkers, linear models best described the relationship for 11 biomarkers, and an intercept-only model best explained the relationship for 12 of the biomarkers ( Table 1). Linear and step function relationships for all biomarker compounds were positive (increasing RPA with increasing insect density) except for cyclopentanone. For compounds with linear relationships, slopes ranged from −2.22 to 3.94, and for compounds with step relationships the difference between intercepts ranged from 7.27 to 15.08. The compounds most strongly correlated with the RDA axis were  cis-3-hexenyl butyrate, ( E, E)-α-farnesene, sulcatone, ( Z)-3-hexenyl hexenoate, unknown 3, ( E)-β-ocimene, and three linalool oxides ( Figure 2 and  Table 1). We did not detect any significant relationship between natural log-transformed mean percent leaf damage and volatile profiles [RDA,  F(1, 16) = 1.132,  p = 0.259]. However, the effect of focal leaf damage on volatile profile was marginally significant [RDA,  F(1, 16) = 1.329,  p = 0.076] and explained 7.67% of the variation in volatiles. Linear relationships best described the shape of the relationship for 15 biomarkers, and intercept-only models best described the relationship for 7 biomarkers ( Table 2). Most biomarkers had a positive relationship with focal leaf damage. Only isovaleric acid,  cis-methyl dihydrojasmonate, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene showed a negative relationship with increasing focal leaf damage. The compounds most strongly correlated with the RDA axis were 1-hexanol; ( Z)-3-hexenyl hexanoate;  cis-3-hexenyl isovalerate; benzyl alcohol; phenylethyl alcohol;  cis-3-hexenyl butyrate; ( Z)-2-hexenol; isovaleric acid; and diendiol I ( Figure 3). Non-volatiles We did not detect a significant relationship between leafhopper density and total polyphenols ( Figure 4B). However, for mean percent leaf damage, there was a significant negative linear relationship (ΔAIC > 2 for other model comparisons and  p = 0.035) ( Figure 4A). Final leafhopper density explained only 5.44% of the total variation in LC-MS compound catechins, methylxanthines, and  L-theanine) concentrations and did not have a significant effect [RDA,  F(1, 16) = 0.922,  p = 0.449]. Although not statistically significant, mean percent damaged leaf area explained 9.58% of the total variation in LC-MS compound concentrations [RDA,  F(1, 16) = 1.696,  p = 0.124]. Most compounds had negative loadings along the one significant RDA axis, which corresponds to decreasing concentrations with increasing leaf damage. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), theobromine, epicatechin gallate, and caffeine were identified as biomarkers. EGCG and theobromine had significant negative linear relationships with leaf damage ( Figure 5).","Insect herbivores have dramatic effects on the chemical composition of plants. Many of these induced metabolites contribute to the quality (e.g., flavor, human health benefits) of specialty crops such as the tea plant ( Camellia sinensis ). Induced chemical changes are often studied by comparing plants damaged and undamaged by herbivores. However, when herbivory is quantitative, the relationship between herbivore pressure and induction can be linearly or non-linearly density dependent or density independent, and induction may only occur after some threshold of herbivory. The shape of this relationship can vary among metabolites within plants. The tea green leafhopper ( Empoasca onukii ) can be a widespread pest on tea, but some tea farmers take advantage of leafhopper-induced metabolites in order to produce high-quality ""bug-bitten"" teas such as Eastern Beauty oolong. To understand the effects of increasing leafhopper density on tea metabolites important for quality, we conducted a manipulative experiment exposing tea plants to feeding by a range of  E. onukii  densities. After  E. onukii  feeding, we measured volatile and non-volatile metabolites, and quantified percent damaged leaf area from scanned leaf images.  E. onukii  density had a highly significant effect on volatile production, while the effect of leaf damage was only marginally significant. The volatiles most responsive to leafhopper density were mainly terpenes that increased in concentration monotonically with density, while the volatiles most responsive to leaf damage were primarily fatty acid derivatives and volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids. In contrast, damage (percent leaf area damaged), but not leafhopper density, significantly reduced total polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and theobromine concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. The shape of induced responses varied among metabolites with some changing linearly with herbivore pressure and some responding only after a threshold in herbivore pressure with a threshold around 0.6 insects/leaf being common. This study illustrates the importance of measuring a diversity of metabolites over a range of herbivory to fully understand the effects of herbivores on induced metabolites. Our study also shows that any increases in leafhopper density associated with climate warming, could have dramatic effects on secondary metabolites and tea quality.","['Secondary metabolites', 'Camellia sinensis', 'Catechins', 'herbivory', 'Induced Responses', 'Crop Quality', 'Plant Vocs', 'Empoasca Onukii']","['Results Herbivory', 'leafhopper density', 'leaf', 'Figure', 'Herbivory Final', 'RDA', 'leaf damage', 'Final leafhopper', 'relationship', 'damage']","[intercept-only, RPA, E)-α-farnesene, Z)-3-hexenyl hexenoate, intercept-only, Z)-2-hexenol, diendiol I, Non-volatiles, ΔAIC > 2]",[],[],[],NaN

Effect of Soil Ameliorators on pH Value of Acidic Soil in Citrus Orchard A soil pH survey of the experimental field showed that there was a serious degree of soil acidification. Although soil pH values fluctuate slightly, most of the orchard measurement points selected in this experiment had pH values between 4.5 and 5.5 ( Figure 1A). In the present study, the pH of the soil in the citrus orchard was restored to 6.0–6.5 in five months after treatment by adding appropriate lime ( Figure 1A), which is suitable for growth of citrus plants. Subsequent investigation results showed that the application of soil amendments in our study could maintain the stability of soil pH value for at least one year ( Supplementary Figure S1). 2.2. Effect of Acid Soil Improvement on Management of HLB Disease in Southern China 2.2.1. HLB Infections Rate The new infections rate of HLB disease in the FCK (control grove in the field trial) and FT (treatment grove in field trial) was investigated using PCR assay at the fifth month after application of soil ameliorants in the field. The results showed that the average natural incidence rate of CLas was 20.2% in the FT and 32.2% in the FCK ( Figure 1B). In the following year, we continued to monitor the infection rate in both groves. The rate of HLB infections in FT was about 61%, and most of the HLB-infected citrus trees presented mildly infected symptoms, whereas more than 95% of plants in FCK were infected, and most of the citrus trees presented seriously infected symptoms ( Supplementary Figure S1). At the same time, the proportion of CLas bacterium in new shoots of the HLB-infected citrus was determined. The proportion of detectable CLas pathogens in the FCK was over 93.0%, while it was about 60.0% in the FT ( Figure 1C). These results indicate that regulation of soil acidification is beneficial for limiting the movement of CLas bacterium to new shoots in infected plants and inhibiting the spread of HLB disease to healthy plants. 2.2.2. Chlorophyll Content and Disease Index We also evaluated the HLB disease index by calculating the yellowing rate of the canopy upon different soil pH conditions in the field. In the FT, the disease index of about 70% of HLB-infected citrus trees was level 1 or level 2. While in the FCK, the disease index of 80% of citrus trees was mostly estimated to be at level 3, level 4 or level 5 ( Figure 2C). In the case of the greenhouse trial, many of the citrus leaves in the GCK (control group in greenhouse trial) showed obvious symptoms of spotted-yellowing at the fifth month after soil treatment, whereas typical symptoms did not appear on the leaves of GT (treatment group in greenhouse trial) (Figure 4A). Meanwhile, the relative chlorophyll content of the leaves was measured. The chlorophyll content in the FT was significantly increased (about 10%) than that in the FCK ( Figure 2A). The result of the greenhouse trial showed that the chlorophyll content of citrus leaf from soil with pH 6.5 conditions was also 15% higher than that from pH 4.5 soil ( Figure 2B). The infected leaves in the GCK not only showed more obvious symptoms in appearance, but it was also found that the plugging of their sieve tubes was more exacerbated than that in the GT, using SEM observation (Figure 4). It was speculated that HLB-infected citrus plants grown in suitable soil pH conditions were more likely to delay disease progression than those grown in acidic soils. 2.2.3. The titre of CLas bacterium The titre of CLas in the leaf midribs were quantified monthly using q-PCR after treatment in the orchard. The titre of CLas showed a continuous downward trend in both groves, but the decreasing trend was more obvious in FT. Especially at the fifth month, the titre of CLas was about 3 times lower than that in the FCK ( Figure 3A). In the greenhouse trial, the titre of CLas increased slightly over time under acidic soil conditions (pH = 4.5), and it was about 3.5 folds decreased under amended soil conditions (pH = 6.5) compared with the control sample at the fifth month ( Figure 3B). The above results suggest that regulation of soil acidification effectively inhibited the accumulation of the CLas in the infected plants. 2.2.4. Fruit Yield and Quality Soil acidification accelerated the loss of production capacity and reduced the fruit quality of HLB-infected citrus trees. The average yield of the infected plants in the FT was 57.6 kg per tree, which was higher than in the FCK (52.0 kg per tree) at the first year after soil treatment by liming ( Table 1). The fruit yield survey in the following year found that the average yield of HLB-positive plants in the FT remained above 50 kg per tree, however, in the FCK, the yield of HLB-positive plants dropped sharply, with an average yield of 27.1 kg per tree, some of which lost their economic value because the yield was below 20 kg per tree ( Supplementary Figure S1). Meanwhile, the diameter of the fruit in the FT increased by 8.42%, and the fruit drop rate markedly reduced by 50% compared with that in the FCK ( Table 1). It was observed that the CLas-infected fruits in the FCK were small, poorly coloured, misshapen, whereas the infected fruits in the FT presented more like healthy fruit in visual appearance ( Supplementary Figure S1). The results of assays of fruit quality indexes showed that in the FT, three monosaccharides, such as glucose (2.5 g × 100 g −1), sucrose (4.4 g × 100 g −1), fructose (2.4 g × 100 g −1), and the soluble solids content (>12%) of fruits ( Table 1) basically reached the nutritional requirements of edible fruits for commercial use, while the diseased fruits in the FCK failed to meet the requirements according to the Green food-Citrus NY/T 426-2000 of Agricultural Standards of China. Based on the above results, it is inferred that providing suitable growth soil conditions for citrus trees infected with HLB disease is more likely to produce asymptomatic infected fruits and maintain the yield and quality of infected plants. 2.3. Effect of Soil pH on the Expression of the Ion Transport-Related Genes and Metabolic Activity in the HLB-Infected Roots In the greenhouse trial, the activity of CLas-infected roots grown in the GT was determined using the TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) reduction method, which was significantly enhanced compared with that in the GCK (Figure 5A). The roots in the FT also possessed higher root viability than those in the FCK in the field trial ( Supplementary Figure S2). The lateral roots of seedlings in the GCK showed sparse, short and stunted symptoms compared to those in the GT ( Figure 4B). Furthermore, the expression level of four genes,  CsAmtB (ammonium transporter),  CsVIT1 (vacuolar iron transporter),  CsZIP1 (zinc transporter) and  CsBOR1 (boron transporter), associated with ion transporters in greenhouses were measured using q-PCR. In the GCK, the expression level of the four ion-transporting genes in root tissues of CLas-infected seedlings was respectively down-regulated by 4.76, 1.92, 1.63 and 2.85 times compared to that in the GT ( Figure 5B). These results indicate that the regulation of soil acidification had a beneficial influence on the root metabolic activity and the nutrient uptake ability of the HLB-infected seedlings. 2.4. Effect of Soil pH on the SA Content and Expression of the Resistance-Related Genes in the HLB-Infected Plants In this study, the content of endogenous hormone SA and the expression of genes involved in host disease resistance were determined in the greenhouse trial. The results showed that the SA content in the roots and midribs in the GCK was 1.55 and 1.67 times lower than in the GT ( Figure 6B,D). Additionally, in the leaves and roots, the expression of resistance-related genes in the GT was up-regulated significantly more than that in the GCK. q-PCR analysis indicated that in infected roots, the pathogenesis-related proteins genes,  CsPR1 and  CsPR5, were meaningfully higher in the GT than that in the GCK. In addition, the  CsNPR1 and  CsALD1 genes were involved in plant systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and were up-regulated 4.75-fold and 5.78-fold, respectively. Meanwhile, in leaf midribs, the expression levels of the  CsPR1,  CsPR5,  CsNPR1 and  CsALD1 genes of HLB-infected seedlings in the GT were up-regulated more than those in the GCK ( Figure 6C). The expression levels of the other two WRKY transcription factors in leaves and roots were both remarkably increased ( Figure 6A), which is related to the resistance in the biotic and abiotic stress pathway [ 19]. The above results indicated that soil improvement had an affirmative effect on the expression of the resistance genes and the SA signalling hormone synthesis in HLB-infected citrus plants. 2.5. Proteome Characteristics of Midribs of HLB-Infected Plants Grown in Different Soil pH Conditions TMT-labelled proteome analyses were applied to understand the metabolic process of midribs of HLB-infected citrus under differing soil pH conditions. We identified 119 differentially expressed proteins at a cutoff value of >|±1.5|-fold ( p value < 0.005) ( Supplementary Table S2), including 55 up-regulated and 64 down-regulated proteins, in the midribs sample in liming-amended soils (pH = 6.5) compared with the midribs sample collected from untreated soils (pH = 4.5). Most significantly, most of the up-regulated proteins are involved in stress/defence responses and secondary metabolism. The stress/defence response-related proteins mainly include two pathogenesis-related proteins, five methyltransferases and a probable leucine-rich repeat receptors and the secondary metabolites biosynthesis pathway-related proteins, including three dirigent proteins, three serine-type carboxypeptidases, a terpene synthase, a 3-beta-hydroxy-delta5-steroid dehydrogenase and a UDP-glucosyltransferase ( Table 2). Most down-regulated proteins were annotated as unknown function or heat-shock proteins that can protect other proteins against heat-induced denaturation and aggregation. The details of the differentially expressed proteins are listed in  Supplementary Table S2. Based on analysis of comparative proteomics data, it is speculated that defence response of infected plants may be more intensely activated in liming-amended soil than in heavily acidic soil.","Huanglongbing (HLB) is a devastating citrus disease that has caused massive economic losses to the citrus industry worldwide. The disease is endemic in most citrus-producing areas of southern China, especially in the sweet orange orchards where soil acidification has intensified. In this work, we used lime as soil pH amendment to optimize soil pH and enhance the endurance capacity of citrus against Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas). The results showed that regulation of soil acidity is effective to reduce the occurrence of new infections and mitigate disease severity in the presence of HLB disease. We also studied the associated molecular mechanism and found that acid soil improvement can (i) increase the root metabolic activity and up-regulate the expression of ion transporter-related genes in HLB-infected roots, (ii) alleviate the physiological disorders of sieve tube blockage of HLB-infected leaves, (iii) strengthen the citrus immune response by increasing the expression of genes involved in SAR and activating the salicylic acid signal pathway, (iv) up-regulate 55 proteins related to stress/defence response and secondary metabolism. This study contributes to a better understanding of the correlation between environment factors and HLB disease outbreaks and also suggests that acid soil improvement is of potential value for the management of HLB disease in southern China.","['Salicylic acid', 'Huanglongbing', 'Soil acidification', 'Plant Immune Response', 'Root Metabolic Activity']","['Figure', 'Soil', 'Supplementary Figure', 'FCK', 'HLB Disease', 'HLB-infected citrus', 'Citrus', 'plants', 'citrus trees', 'soil acidification']","[6.0–6.5, FT, FT, FT, FT, FT, GCK, spotted-yellowing, GT, FT, GCK, GT, FT, FT, FT, HLB-positive, FT, CLas-infected fruits, FT, FT, −1, Green food-Citrus NY/T 426-2000, HLB disease, Ion Transport-Related, GT, TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, GCK, FT, GCK, GT, ammonium transporter, zinc transporter, GCK, ion-transporting, CLas-infected, GT, HLB-Infected, GCK, GT, GT, GCK, GT, GCK, 5.78-fold, GT, GCK, WRKY, HLB-Infected, TMT-labelled, |±1.5|-fold, leucine-rich repeat receptors, serine-type carboxypeptidases, UDP-glucosyltransferase, heat-shock]",[],[],"['Citrus', 'food-Citrus']",terpene synthase

These chemotypes possessed high, low and absent levels of D-borneol, respectively. Here, we used a GC/MS method to analyze the composition of volatile oil in these  C. burmannii samples ( Figs. 2D– 2J). A total of 28 compounds were detected in the three chemotype samples, of which nine were common to all three. D-borneol was the most abundant component of the volatile terpenoids in both HBT and LBT groups, accounting for 42.23% and 57.26%, respectively. In the BFT group, the main component was cymene, accounting for 27.44% of the volatile terpenoids ( Figs. 2K– 2N,  Data S3– S4). Transcriptome analysis To identify genes related to the biosynthesis of D-borneol, we performed deep transcriptome sequencing of the three  C. burmanni chemotypes using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. In total, 21.21 Gb of clean sequence data with GC content of 47.55% was obtained from all samples after filtering and removing adapter sequences from the raw data: 8.40 Gb from the HBT group, 6.39 Gb from the LBT group and 6.42 Gb from the BFT group. Raw data and quality control data statistics are summarized in  Table 1. All RNA-Seq raw data has been submitted to CNGBdb with accession number  CNP0000810. For further analysis, high-quality clean reads were assembled using the TRINITY program, resulting in 142,673 transcripts and 100,218 unigenes with N50 of 1,625 bp and 1,128 bp and average length of 935 bp and 713 bp, respectively. The majority of the reads for both transcripts and unigenes were shorter than 1,000 bp in length, accounting for 92% and 88%, respectively. Only 2% of the transcripts and 3% of the unigenes were longer than 2,000 bp in length. All assembled data are summarized in  Table 2 and  Fig. 3A. Moreover, 80.80% of the clean reads were perfectly mapped to the assembled unigenes by RSEM, indicating that these mapped genes were of high quality and could be used to conduct the subsequent analysis ( Table 1). Sequence of the 100,218 unigenes were shown in  Data S5. All resulting 100,218 unigenes were used for BLAST searches against the GO, KEGG, NR, Pfam and Swiss-Prot databases for annotation, resulting in 28,798, 15,376, 44,495, 28,107 and 24,238 annotated unigenes for the above database, respectively ( Fig. 3B,  Data S6). In total, 45,485 unigenes were annotated to at least one database, and 9,730 unigenes shared annotation in all five databases ( Fig. 3C). The species distribution of the annotated unigenes is shown in  Fig. 3D. Identification of DEGs A total of 8,860 DEGs were identified among the comparison groups. The expression patterns of these DEGs could be classified into four clusters ( Figs. 3E– 3F,  Data S7). Cluster 1 consisted of 2,600 genes significantly down-regulated in the LBT group in comparison with both the HBT and BFT groups. Cluster 2 exhibited the opposite expression pattern to that of cluster 1, containing 3,721 unigenes that were particularly up-regulated in the LBT group in comparison to both the HBT and BFT groups. Cluster 3 contained 2,539 unigenes significantly up-regulated in the BFT group in comparison to both the HBT and LBT groups. Ten genes significantly down-regulated in the BFT group in comparison to both the HBT and LBT groups formed cluster 4. We used a Wayne diagram ( Fig. 3G) to show the number of DEGs between each group. There were 3,140 up-regulated unigenes and 3,643 down-regulated unigenes in the HBT vs LBT comparison. In the HBT vs BFT comparison, we identified 1,303 up-regulated unigenes and 924 down-regulated unigenes. In the LBT vs BFT comparison, 3,902 unigenes were up-regulated while 2,357 unigenes were down-regulated ( Fig. 3H). To gain a deep understanding of the biological functions of these 8,860 DEGs, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. We used dot plots to show the top 20 most enriched KEGG pathway categories with  p value <0.05, which indicated that the top three most enriched KEGG pathways were “cutin, suberin and wax biosynthesis,” “vancomycin resistance” and “fatty acid degradation” ( Fig. 4A,  Data S8). The top 10 most enriched GO terms under the three general sections Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC) and Molecular Function (MF) are summarized in  Fig. 4B and  Data S9. The most enriched GO term in the MF category was protein serine/threonine kinase activity. Within the CC category, the most abundant GO term was chloroplast. In the BP category, the most associated term was protein phosphorylation. In addition, terpene synthase activity was also significantly enriched. Mining of candidate genes related to D-borneol biosynthesis Monoterpenes derived from plants are biosynthesized in the plastid through the MEP pathway. We detected 30 unigenes involved in the MEP pathway, but only three of them exhibited significantly different expression levels among the three comparison groups. Most of the unigenes (11/30), including one DEG, were annotated as  DXS genes, which encode the first rate-limiting enzyme in the MEP pathway. Relatively higher expression of the  DXS gene in the HBT group compared to that in the other two groups might contribute to the differences in D-borneol accumulation in  C. burmannii. Six unigenes were annotated as encoding GPPS, responsible for GPP formation. It is well known that GPPSs exist as homomeric and heteromeric structures in plants ( Burke, Klettke & Wise, 2004;  Rai et al., 2013;  Wang & Dixon, 2009;  Yin et al., 2017) and that plants contain multiple GGPPS or GGPPS-related enzymes, some functioning as large or small subunits (LSU/SSU) of heteromeric GPPS ( Tholl et al., 2004;  Wang & Dixon, 2009). For example, there are 12 GGPPS paralogs in the Arabidopsis genome ( Beck et al., 2013;  Lange & Ghassemian, 2003); however, AtGPPS11 and AtGGPPS12 were characterized as LSU and SSU, with their interaction involved in monoterpene biosynthesis in Arabidopsis flowers ( Chen, Fan & Wang, 2015). To confirm whether the  C. burmannii GPPSs formed homomeric or heteromeric structures, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of seven KEGG-annotated CbGPPS/GGPPS proteins from  C. burmannii and the amino acid sequences of other characterized GPPS/GGPPS proteins. We identified six GPPSs, including two putative homomeric GPPSs, three putative GPPS.SSUs and a putative GPPS.LSU. Only one unigene might encode a GGPPS ( Fig. S1). It has been reported that monoterpene biosynthesis in gymnosperms is mainly regulated by homomeric GPPS and SSUs of heteromeric GPPS ( Schmidt et al., 2010;  Tholl et al., 2004). The 2 putative homomeric GPPSs, 3 putative GPPS.SSUs identified in this study may provide a possible explanation for the monoterpene richness of  C. burmanni. There were 40 unigenes annotated as  TPS by KEGG, among which 11 were associated with the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathway (ko00904), eight were monoterpenoid synthase unigenes (ko00902) and 21 encoded diterpenoid synthase (ko00909). Since D-borneol is a monoterpene, the eight putative monoterpenoid synthase genes were selected for further analysis. The expression patterns of these eight unigenes encoding monoterpenoid synthase, along with those of genes related to the MEP metabolic pathway (Ko00900), were normalized and shown in  Figs. 5A– 5B and  Data S10. Considering the relatively high accumulation of D-borneol in the HBT group compared to the other two groups, we rationalized that metabolism-related genes might exhibit more activity in the HBT group than in the other two groups. Inspiringly, two unigenes encoding monoterpenoid synthase (designated  CbTPS2 and  CbTPS3) were significantly up-regulated in the HBT group compared with the LBT and BFT groups ( Data S11). Furthermore, both unigenes had complete open reading frames. Sequence comparison using BLAST indicated that  CbTPS2 (c122670.graph_c0) exhibited highest similarity [53.27% amino acid (aa) sequence identity] to an (E)-beta-ocimene/myrcene synthase (ADR74206.1) from  Vitis vinifera, while  CbTPS3 (c129067.graph_c0) presented similarity in aa sequence with a S-(+)-linalool synthase (RVW86370.1) from  Vitis vinifera ( Martin et al., 2010). These two candidate  TPS genes were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis, along with other  TPS genes that have been functionally characterized. Similar to other well-characterized  BPPS genes,  CbTPS2 fell within the TPS-b subfamily ( Fig. S2). Furthermore, sequence alignment showed that  CbTPS2 had conserved mono-TPS domains, including RRX8W, RXR, DDXXD and (N,D) D (L,I,V) X (S,T) XXE (NSE/DTE) ( Fig. S3). To find out whether the candidate unigenes differed between each chemotype, the transcriptomes of the three groups were assembled separately, and the sequences were compared. The assembled sequences of each chemotypes were shown in  Data S6– S14. The amino acid sequences of CbTPS2 in the three different  C. burmannii chemotypes differed only by two amino acids, and these sites were not located within the conserved domain, suggesting that these differences may not affect the function of these proteins ( Fig. S4). However, it is interesting that the complete sequence of CbTPS3 could only be found in the HBT and LBT groups, whereas only a small fragment was found in the BFT group ( Fig. S5). This may be due to poor assembly of the BFT transcriptome, or perhaps  CbTPS3 is a pseudogene in BFT. We speculated that  CbTPS2 and  CbTPS3 are probably candidate genes responsible for the biosynthesis of D-borneol in  C. burmannii. Mining of candidate transcription factors related to D-borneol accumulation Transcription factors play an important role in regulating the biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites ( Hong et al., 2012). In our transcriptome analysis, we identified 1,108 transcription factors, which could be assigned to 47 families ( Data S15). Several TF families, including MYB, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), WRKY, basic region/leucine zipper motif (bZIP) and APETALA2/ethylene-response factor (AP2/ERF) families, function in regulating the structural genes involved in monoterpenoid biosynthesis ( Su et al., 2019). These five TF families cover most of the TFs identified in this study ( Fig. 5C). We identified 116 MYB, 65 AP2/ERF, 63 BHLH, 60 bZIP and 47 WRKY candidate genes, among which 35 MYB, 27 AP2/ERF, 24 BHLH, 10 bZIP and 9 WRKY genes were classified as DEGs ( Figs. 5D– 5H,  Data S16). Notably, one WRKY (c122191.graph.c0), two BHLH (c117041.graph.c0, c127743.graph.c0), one AP2/ERF (c130684.graph.c1) and three MYB candidate genes (c68268.graph.c0, c120253. graph.c0, c123637.graph.c0) were significantly up-regulated in both the HBT and LBT groups compared to the BFT group. The different transcription factor expression patterns might be responsible for regulating monoterpenoid biosynthesis. Moreover, the up-regulated transcription factors in the HBT and LBT groups compared to the BFT group provide us with a candidate TF pool related to the biosynthesis and accumulation of D-borneol. Validation of DEGs using Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) To verify the accuracy of RNA-Seq data, we performed expression level analysis on nine unigenes related to the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway and six candidate transcription factors related to D-borneol accumulation using the qRT-PCR method. As shown in  Fig. 6, their expression patterns were similar to those revealed from RNA-Seq data. Thus, these results help confirm the reliability of the transcriptomic analysis."," Background Dextrorotatory borneol (D-borneol), a cyclic monoterpene, is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine as an efficient topical analgesic drug. Fresh leaves of  Cinnamomum  trees, e.g.,  C. burmannii  and  C. camphor , are the main sources from which D-borneol is extracted by steam distillation, yet with low yields. Insufficient supply of D-borneol has hampered its clinical use and production of patent remedies for a long time. Biological synthesis of D-borneol offers an additional approach; however, mechanisms of D-borneol biosynthesis remain mostly unresolved. Hence, it is important and necessary to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of D-borneol. Results Comparative analysis on the gene expression patterns of different D-borneol production  C. burmannii  samples facilitates elucidation on the underlying biosynthetic pathway of D-borneol. Herein, we collected three different chemotypes of  C. burmannii , which harbor different contents of D-borneol.A total of 100,218 unigenes with an N50 of 1,128 bp were assembled de novo using Trinity from a total of 21.21 Gb clean bases. We used BLASTx analysis against several public databases to annotate 45,485 unigenes (45.38%) to at least one database, among which 82 unigenes were assigned to terpenoid biosynthesis pathways by KEGG annotation. In addition, we defined 8,860 unigenes as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), among which 13 DEGs were associated with terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. One 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and two monoterpene synthase, designated as  CbDXS9 ,  CbTPS2  and  CbTPS3 , were up-regulated in the high-borneol group compared to the low-borneol and borneol-free groups, and might be vital to biosynthesis of D-borneol in  C. burmannii.  In addition, we identified one WRKY, two BHLH, one AP2/ERF and three MYB candidate genes, which exhibited the same expression patterns as  CbTPS2  and  CbTPS3 , suggesting that these transcription factors might potentially regulate D-borneol biosynthesis. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR was conducted to detect the actual expression level of those candidate genes related to the D-borneol biosynthesis pathway, and the result showed that the expression patterns of the candidate genes related to D-borneol biosynthesis were basically consistent with those revealed by transcriptome analysis. Conclusions We used transcriptome sequencing to analyze three different chemotypes of  C. burmannii , identifying three candidate structural genes (one DXS, two monoterpene synthases) and seven potential transcription factor candidates (one WRKY, two BHLH, one AP2/ERF and three MYB) involved in D-borneol biosynthesis. These results provide new insight into our understanding of the production and accumulation of D-borneol in  C. burmannii .","['Biosynthesis', 'Monoterpene', 'Transcriptome', 'transcriptional factors', 'Terpene synthase', 'Terpene', 'Bpps', 'Tianran Bingpian', 'C.

126,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7299927\eupmc_result.json,PMC7299927,"Results Accessions differ in TSSM-induced chlorotic spots, volatile emission and attraction of predatory mites Damage as a result of TSSM feeding was visible as chlorotic spots (Fig.  1a) from 2 days after introduction of mites onwards and total chlorotic area reached 5.6% of the leaf in accession Chinese long 9930 (CL) and 8% in Corona (CO) after 3 days (Fig.  1b). Mites performed better on CO than on CL as more eggs per female were deposited over a time span of 7 days in a leaf disc assay (Fig.  1c). TSSM infestation increased volatile emission in both accessions. Green Leaf Volatiles (GLVs)—including ( E)-2-hexenal, ( Z)-3-hexen-1-ol and ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate—rapidly increased on the first day post infestation followed by a small decrease in the next 2 days and was stronger in CO compared to CL (Fig.  1d). Methyl salicylate was emitted in small amounts by CL only and increased continuously during the 3 days post infestation (data not shown). Emission of monoterpenoids—including α-pinene, limonene, ( E)-β-ocimene, an unidentified monoterpene and linalool—gradually increased from the onset of infestation, while sesquiterpene emission—including ( E)-β-caryophyllene, α-bergamotene, ( E,E)-α-farnesene and an unidentified sesquiterpene—increased from day 2 onwards. While the increase was comparable in both accessions, the absolute emission of mono- and sesquiterpenoids was higher in CO. Emission of homoterpenes DMNT and ( E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT) increased strongest, and together they were emitted at even higher levels than the sum of mono- and sesquiterpenoids together (Fig.  1d). In both accessions homoterpenes were the dominant compounds in the induced volatile blend after 3 days of TSSM infestation. Predatory mites were attracted to the volatiles emitted by TSSM-infested plants. The relative attractiveness of both accessions increased with progressing infestation, while the blend of 3-day TSSM-infested CO attracted more predatory mites compared to that of 3-day TSSM-infested CL (Fig.  1e). To determine the time frame of early defence responses and hence select time points for RNA-seq analysis, we analysed  LIPOXYGENASE (Csa2M024440) and ( E,E) -α-FARNESENE SYNTHASE (Csa3M095040) expression, two genes known to be induced by TSSM and involved in the biosynthesis of volatile compounds (Mercke et al.  2004). Comparison of non-infested and TSSM-infested CL leaves showed that transcripts of both genes were not significantly induced within the first 15 h after the onset of infestation (Supplemental Fig. S1). After 24 h,  LIPOXYGENASE transcripts increased, whereas ( E,E)-α-FARNESENE SYNTHASE expression increased at 3 days after infestation, corresponding with ( E,E)-α-farnesene emission. As we have predominantly interest in adaptation of the metabolome, we analysed overall gene expression after 24, 48 and 72 h of TSSM infestation. Induced cucumber transcriptional responses to TSSM feeding As we have interest in the early responses of cucumber leaves to TSSM infestation, plants were infested with a low density of mites, to more or less mimic a normal dispersal scenario. Since mites were not removed from the leaves when these were harvested, we aligned the clean reads from the RNA-seq analysis to the TSSM genome (Grbic et al.  2011) resulting in max 1% of the reads that could be mapped to the TSSM genome (data not shown), while more than 80% of the reads could be mapped to the cucumber genome (Supplementary Fig. S2). In summary, the assessment suggests that the obtained sequencing data are representative of the changes in the cucumber transcriptome during the time-course experiment (Supplemental Fig. S2). Validation of RNA-seq transcript data by analysing expression patterns of selected genes by qRT-PCR indicated comparable expression patterns during the time span of our experiment and we concluded that the gene expression data we obtained form a good basis for further analysis (Supplemental Fig. S3). Unbiased principal component analysis (PCA) using Log 2(RPKM) values showed that the first two principal components explain 46.2% of the total variation corresponding to the effect of both accession and TSSM (Fig.  2a). Subsequently, 2348 DEGs were identified by comparing gene expression at every time point of infestation with that of the non-infested sample for both accessions (Supplemental Table S2). Two days after the onset of infestation, less than 200 DEGs were identified in CL, whereas in CO more than 400 DEGs were found of which 304 were up-regulated and 108 were down-regulated compared with non-infested leaves (Fig.  2b). For both accessions the number of DEGs strongly increased with progressing infestation to 1006 in CL and 1534 in CO after 3 days. Accessions shared 505 DEGs 3 days after infestation, representing half of all DEGs in CL and almost a third in CO (Fig.  2c). Around 60% of the commonly identified DEGs were found to be up-regulated and 40% were down-regulated in both accessions. Hierarchical cluster analysis based on Pearson correlation of DEGs confirmed that within the first 2 days of infestation differences in gene expression between accessions are larger than changes in expression as caused by TSSM feeding (Fig.  2d, Supplemental Table S4). Three days after the onset of infestation, the herbivores became the major driving force for expression differences and overruled expression differences between accessions. Analysis of the 2 kB upstream sequences of DEGs identified motifs that are enriched upon TSSM infestation. MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 elements, all binding sites of MYC TFs, MYB55_2 element binding to MYB TFs and DEAR3 binding to ERF TFs were the five most enriched motifs found (Fig.  2e). Furthermore, PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs PIF4, PIF5 and PIF3 motifs that can bind to bHLH TFs, MYB and ERF/AP2 binding motifs were found to be enriched as result of TSSM infestation. A similarity matrix of gene expression patterns based on Pearson correlations showed that DEGs could be divided into five major clusters (Fig.  3). Cluster II contains only 29 genes that show quite a different expression pattern compared to all other clusters as expression of these genes was highly up-regulated after 1 day of infestation and decreased on day 2 and 3 compared to the non-infested control. Confirmation of the expression pattern in time was found for Csa1M589140, Csa2M055050 and Csa7M061710 using qRT-PCR (Supplemental Fig. S3). In cluster II only GO category ‘ oxidoreductase activity’ was enriched (8 out of 29 genes). While our data are too limited to allow reliable conclusions, and we cannot distinguish between plant or mite-derived gene transcripts, interestingly, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases are present in the saliva of TSSM (Bajda et al.  2017; Jonckheere et al.  2016). As oxidoreductases are known to catalyse redox reactions and known to suppress plant defences, other DEGs in cluster II DEGs might be associated with perception of attack. Cluster III includes 817 genes of which expression was induced from day 1 onwards and continued to increase over 3 days in both CO and CL (Fig.  3). Upregulated GO biological processes include those related to ‘ response to biotic stimulus’, ‘ wounding and jasmonic acid’ and also metabolic and catabolic processes including ‘ secondary metabolites’, ‘ aromatic amino acids’, ‘ L-phenylalanine’, ‘ carbohydrates’, indicating that DEGs in this cluster are related with transcriptional responses of signalling and first metabolite reconfiguration (Fig.  3, Supplementary Table S3). GO-term analysis did not yield any enrichment of cellular components and for molecular functions only ‘ phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity’ was found enriched. Cluster I contains 302 genes of which expression increased on day 3 and that were expressed higher in CL than in CO (Fig.  3b). GO enrichment showed that biological processes related with ‘ response to red and far-red light’, ‘ photosynthesis’ and ‘ translation’ were enriched and furthermore processes related with ‘ generation of precursor metabolites and energy’. Molecular functions of these genes are classified as ‘ electron carrier activity’ and ‘ structural constituent of ribosome’ whereas cellular component analysis showed that the GO-terms related to ‘ photosynthetic membrane’, ‘ photosystem’, ‘ thylakoid’, ‘ plastid’, ‘ nucleolus’ and ‘ ribosome’ were significantly enriched (Fig.  3, Supplementary Table S2). Clusters IV (371 genes) and V (829 genes) represent genes of which expression was suppressed by TSSM infestation compared with non-infested controls (Fig.  3). In group IV suppression is strongest in accession CL, while in group V it is strongest in CO. In group IV cellular components of ‘ cell wall’, ‘ cytosolic ribosome’ and ‘ apoplast’ were enriched but no GO-terms for biological processes nor for molecular functions were significantly enriched. DEGs in group V were enriched for ‘ phenylpropanoid- and flavonoid metabolic processes’, suggesting that TSSM might have a negative effect on these metabolic classes. It seems that the different clusters represent the temporal order of events, starting with perception of mite-attack (Cluster II), followed by signalling events and first alteration of the metabolome (Cluster III) and finally changes in the primary and specialized metabolome in both positive (Cluster I) and negative directions (Cluster IV and V). To obtain more insight in how different metabolic pathways that were found enriched in the GO-term analysis interact with each other, TSSM-induced DEGs were mapped to the KEGG pathway database (Supplementary Fig. S4). Three days after the onset of infestation several pathways were significantly influenced, including ‘ ribosome’, ‘ protein export’,  photosynthesis, the ‘ phagosome pathway’ and  sesquiterpenoid and  triterpenoid biosynthesis. Only just not significant were  diterpenoid biosynthesis and  terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. Pathways that were significantly altered already on day 1 after infestation included  phenylpropanoid biosynthesis,  phenylalanine metabolism and  linoleic acid metabolism. To identify TFs that might play a role in early responses towards TSSM, we retrieved the 1212 genes from the cucumber genome with a putative TF function. Transcription of 119 TF genes was differentially regulated by TSSM infestation, of which 60 were generally upregulated and 59 were downregulated (Table  1). Among these 119 TF genes, the WRKY family was relatively most represented as 21% of the WRKY genes putatively present in the cucumber genome were differentially expressed upon TSSM infestation, followed by AP2/ERF (16%), bHLH (14%) and MYB (10%) TF genes. Considering the general trends of TF gene expression among DEGs, ERFs were preferentially upregulated and WRKYs preferentially downregulated upon TSSM herbivory. For the other TF families, fewer genes were found to be regulated by TSSM infestation as they were randomly distributed over induced and repressed DEGs. We compared our results with the transcriptional response of cucumber towards the pathogen downy mildew (DM,  Pseudoperonospora cubensis) as described by Adhikari et al. ( 2012) to study similarities and differences in the involvement of TFs in the response of cucumber to two different biotic stresses. DM infection resulted in more TF gene families with DEGs than TSSM infestation, of which WRKY, NAC and GRAS were among the strongest affected TF genes upon DM infestation. Comparing both datasets resulted in 46 TF genes that were differentially expressed as a result of DM infection as well as TSSM infestation, although not always in the same direction (Fig.  4). Genes involved in biosynthesis of terpenoids are regulated by TSSM GO and KEGG analysis revealed terpenoid-related processes and pathways dominantly present among DEGs induced by TSSM, including ‘ terpene metabolic processes’, ‘ terpenoid backbone biosynthesis’, ‘ sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis’, and ‘ limonene and pinene degradation’ (Supplementary Fig. S4). Five DEGs were assigned the GO term of ‘ terpenoid backbone biosynthesis’. Csa1M420340 encoding DXP-synthase (1-DEOXY-D-XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE) catalysing the rate limiting enzymatic step in the plastidic MEP/DOXP pathway that supplies the substrate for mono- and diterpene biosynthesis, was upregulated (Fig.  5a). In addition, the strongest TSSM induced TF, i.e. MYC (Csa3M002860) co-expressed with DXP. Csa6M487640 and Csa7M211090 both encoding GERANYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE were upregulated in CL, while in CO this was true only for Csa7M211090. In contrast, despite the enrichment of ‘ sesquiterpene metabolic process’, gene Csa7M029390 encoding 3-HYDROXY-METHYLGLUTARYL COENZYME A REDUCTASE catalysing the rate limiting step in the cytosolic mevalonate pathway to produce the substrates for sesquiterpene and triterpene biosynthesis was down-regulated in both accessions during early mite infestation. Expression of Csa2M299880—encoding a putative monoterpene synthase—and Csa3M095040—encoding ( E,E)-α-farnesene synthase (Mercke et al.  2004)—was not or hardly detected in non-infested plants and was up-regulated during the first 3 days of infestation in both accessions. In addition, expression of the putative monoterpene synthase Csa1M066560 was induced in CL and those of Csa1M068570 and Csa2M298300 in CO. A small increase in expression of ( E)-β-caryophyllene synthase (Csa3M097040, Mercke et al.  2004) was detected in TSSM-infested CO leaves, but not in CL. The upregulation of the expression of these genes coincided with mono- and sesquiterpenoid emission, as ( E)-β-ocimene, α-pinene, and linalool were found to be present in the blend from TSSM-infested plants from day 1 onwards, while ( E,E)-α-farnesene and ( E)-β-caryophyllene were emitted from day 2 after infestation (Fig.  1). Strongest TSSM-induced terpene synthase genes (Csa2M29988 and Csa3M09504) closely co-expressed with each other and with a bHLH (Csa2M047780), a MYB (Csa7M000020) and an ERF TF (Csa5M167110) (Fig.  5b). Three of the seven P450 genes, which were mapped onto the pathway of ‘ limonene and pinene degradation’ and hence might be involved in conversion of terpenes into more oxidised terpenoids, were up-regulated in both accessions after infestation. Two of these (Csa3M853160; Csa3M852560) have high homology to CYP82G, which in Arabidopsis is known to be involved in the conversion of nerolidol to DMNT and geranyl linalool to TMTT (Lee et al.  2010). Further studies must resolve whether these cucumber P450s are indeed responsible for the formation of TSSM-induced homoterpenoids in cucumber. In contrast, three other P450s in this group were suppressed by TSSM infestation, with their annotations suggesting a role in flavonoid (Csa6M088160) and triterpene (Csa3M698490) biosynthesis. TSSM suppress expression of genes associated with biosynthesis of cucurbitacin C Nine genes functional in the cucurbitacin C biosynthetic pathway were previously identified (Shang et al.  2014) and transcripts of all except one were detected in our RNA-seq data. Interestingly, the expression of these eight genes was down regulated after TSSM infestation in both the bitter accession CL and the non-bitter accession CO (Fig.  6a). Expression of OXIDOSQUALENE CYCLASE (Csa6M088690, Bi) known to confer bitterness, was not detected in our RNA-seq experiment. However, qRT-PCR analysis for this gene revealed that transcripts are indeed present in CL and decreased after infestation (Fig.  6b). Furthermore, the amount of cucurbitacin C in TSSM-infested leaves of accession CL showed a negative (though not significant) trend with progressing infestation (Fig.  6d), while no cucurbitacin C was detected in CO. Seven cucurbitacin associated genes were found co-expressed with a gene encoding a bHLH TF (Csa1M051740), which has not been described previously, suggesting a role in the early steps of cucurbitacin biosynthesis. This TF was assigned GO term ‘ response to gibberellin stimulus’."," Key message Cucumber plants adapt their transcriptome and metabolome as result of spider mite infestation with opposite consequences for direct and indirect defences in two genotypes. Plants respond to arthropod attack with the rearrangement of their transcriptome which lead to subsequent phenotypic changes in the plants' metabolome. Here, we analysed transcriptomic and metabolite responses of two cucumber (Cucumis sativus) genotypes to chelicerate spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) during the first 3 days of infestation. Genes associated with the metabolism of jasmonates, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids and L-phenylalanine were most strongly upregulated. Also, genes involved in the biosynthesis of precursors for indirect defence-related terpenoids were upregulated while those involved in the biosynthesis of direct defence-related cucurbitacin C were downregulated. Consistent with the observed transcriptional changes, terpenoid emission increased and cucurbitacin C content decreased during early spider-mite herbivory. To further study the regulatory network that underlies induced defence to spider mites, differentially expressed genes that encode transcription factors (TFs) were analysed. Correlation analysis of the expression of TF genes with metabolism-associated genes resulted in putative identification of regulators of herbivore-induced terpenoid, green-leaf volatiles and cucurbitacin biosynthesis. Our data provide a global image of the transcriptional changes in cucumber leaves in response to spider-mite herbivory and that of metabolites that are potentially involved in the regulation of induced direct and indirect defences against spider-mite herbivory.","['Cucumis sativus', 'Transcriptome', 'volatile organic compounds', 'Herbivores', 'secondary metabolism', 'Two-spotted Spider Mites']","['TSSM infestation', 'Fig.', 'TSSM', 'Supplemental Fig.', 'infestation', 'genes', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'expression', 'DEGs', 'days']","[TSSM-induced chlorotic, CO, CO, Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, Z)-3-hexenyl acetate—, CO, α-pinene, α-bergamotene, E)-α-farnesene, CO, TSSM, TSSM-infested, TSSM-infested CO, TSSM-infested CL, Csa2M024440, E) -α-FARNESENE, Csa3M095040, TSSM, E, E)-α-FARNESENE, TSSM, TSSM, RNA-seq, Log 2(RPKM, TSSM (Fig.  , CO, CO after 3, CO (, TSSM, MYC2, MYC3, MYC, MYB55_2 element binding, MYB TFs, DEAR3, PIF4, PIF5, PIF3, MYB, ERF/AP2, TSSM, Csa1M589140, Csa2M055050, Csa7M061710, ‘ oxidoreductase, ’, ubiquinone oxidoreductases, Bajda, CO, CL (Fig.  3, ‘, ’, ‘, ‘, ’, ‘ aromatic, ‘ L-phenylalanine, ‘ carbohydrates, ’, ‘ phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, ’, CO, ‘, ‘, ’, ‘, ’, ‘, ’, ‘ electron, ’, ‘, ‘, ‘ photosystem, ‘ thylakoid’, ‘ plastid’, ‘ nucleolus’, ‘ ribosome’, V (829 genes, TSSM, CO, ‘ cytosolic, ’, ‘ apoplast’, ’, mite-attack (Cluster II, TSSM-induced, ‘ ribosome, ’, ‘, ’, ‘, ’, TSSM, TF, TSSM, TF, WRKY, WRKY, TSSM, AP2/ERF, bHLH (14, MYB, WRKYs, TSSM, TSSM, WRKY, GRAS, TF, TSSM, TSSM, TSSM, ‘, ’, ‘ terpenoid, ’, ‘ sesquiterpenoid, ’, ‘, ’, ’, Csa1M420340, DXP-synthase (, 1-DEOXY-D-XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE, MYC, Csa3M002860, Csa6M487640, Csa7M211090, CO, Csa7M211090, ‘, ’, Csa7M029390, 3-HYDROXY-METHYLGLUTARYL COENZYME A, E)-α-farnesene synthase, Csa1M066560, Csa1M068570, Csa2M298300, CO, Csa3M097040, TSSM-infested CO, α-pinene, TSSM-infested, E)-α-farnesene, TSSM-induced terpene synthase, Csa2M29988, Csa3M09504, MYB, Csa7M000020, Csa5M167110, P450, ‘, ’, Csa3M853160, Csa3M852560, CYP82G, TSSM-induced homoterpenoids, P450s, TSSM, Csa6M088160, RNA-seq, TSSM, OXIDOSQUALENE, Csa6M088690, RNA-seq, CO, Csa1M051740, TF, ‘, gibberellin, ’]",[],[],[],terpene synthase

Total Dry Matter (Biomass) The effect of the treatments on total dry matter (biomass) was statistically significant ( p ≤ 0.01). According to the results ( Figure 1), the lowest biomass (3.18 g/plant) was observed in the control plot and the highest biomass (10.42 g/plant) belonged to plants treated with psyllium seed mucilage (PSM) at a concentration of 0.1% (soil + root application). In Stockosorb ® treatments, regardless of the method of application, the medium concentration (0.2%) produced higher biomass. In PSM treatments, increasing the concentration from 0.1% to 0.3% by soil application improved the biomass; however, in soil + root application, we observed a reversed trend with the highest biomass detected in lower concentrations of PSM, and there were no significant differences between 0.1% and 0.2% concentrations. There was no significant difference between biomass produced in the treatment of Stockosorb ® mixed with soil + root and biomass produced in the plot treated with PSM at the concentration of 0.2% (soil + root application). Improving the physical and chemical properties of soil by the application of hydrogels was confirmed, as well as the increased water use potential during the establishment of crops [ 33, 34]. Improving the water holding capacity increased plant performance and yield in other agricultural crops such as millet [ 35] and groundnut [ 36]. The buffering environment and water conservation in soil upon application of hydrogel are the main reasons for increasing the plant dry weight after using these types of superabsorbent polymers [ 37]. It has also been claimed that hydrogel reduced the fertilizer leaching through interaction between the hydrogel and nutrient of fertilizers [ 38]. In the present study, nutrient absorption was not evaluated, but the increase in the dry matter upon application of the superabsorbent indirectly showed the improved nutrient absorption. The increased yield of biomass after application of superabsorbent polymers has also been previously reported [ 24, 25]. In any case, the application of the hydro-absorbent in agriculture and horticulture needs economic evaluation [ 37]. Application of hydrogel on the root (when applied as root dip only) coats the fine roots and protects the root against desiccation, especially after seedling transplanting. One explanation is that the hydrogel could act as natural root exudates and polymeric mucilage produced by healthy roots [ 39]. Other researchers confirmed that root dip application of hydrogels weakens the water potential drop at the root–soil interface and decreases the energy needed to absorb water from soil [ 28]. The method of the superabsorbent polymer also improves the root-to-soil contact and filling-in air space around seedling roots after transplanting [ 39]. The optimum concentration is very important for obtaining fast results and decreasing the amount of hydro-absorbent needs for field unit area. In total, using the PSM mixed with soil + root improved dry matter more than using it only in soil, but for Stockosorb ® (STS), it is better to use in soil. For cultural practices in horticulture, it will be easy to add synthetic HPs during soil preparation before plant cultivation when direct seeding is proposed, whereas, for indirect cultivation (seedling transplanting), soil + root application will be recommended. The method of application in soil depends on the cultivation system. In furrow cultivation, banding of the polymer needs only 46 kg ha −1. For fruit trees, several injection machines have been designed to apply dry polymers or hydrated polymers in the root zone [ 40]. In greenhouse production of horticultural crops, nursery crops, seedling production, or rooted cutting, the method of application is adding to soil, soil + root, or soilless media [ 40]. 2.2. Water Use Efficiency (WUE) Water use efficiency is expressed as the amount of each crop yield (kg) that could be produced from the unit volume of water (cubic meter or liter) [ 29]. It depends on soil water holding capacity, irrigation efficiency, and plant transpiration behavior. Increasing the WUE in arid and semi-arid regions is very important because of water limitation. According to the results of analysis of variance, in comparison to the control, all treatments increased water use efficiency (WUE) significantly ( p ≤ 0.01). For the soil application method, increasing the concentration of both PSM and Stockosorb ® from zero (control) to 0.3% improved WUE (from 0.24 to 0.96 g DW/L H 2O for STS and from 0.24 to 0.69 for PSM). We found Stockosorb ® to be significantly superior to PSM in regard to WUE ( Figure 2). The WUE in soil + root application was higher than that of soil application in both PSM and Stockosorb ®, and the PSM was superior to Stockosorb ® except at the highest concentration (0.3%) where STS was better than PSM. The highest WUE (1.91 g/L) was observed in plants treated with PSM at a concentration of 0.1% (mixed with soil + root); furthermore, there was no significant difference with PSM at a concentration of 0.2% (mixed with soil + root) ( Figure 2). The lowest WUE (0.24 g/L) resulted from the control plot. The application method of Stockosorb ® had no significant effect on WUE, but in PSM, the method of application had a significant effect on the WUE with soil + root application, resulting in superior performance.  Hydrogel application by preventing water leaching from soil, decreasing evaporation and infiltration, improved the WUE [ 34]. Increasing the level of hydrogel increased the WUE in pearl millet [ 35] and  Pinus halepensis [ 22]. In citrus fruit, application of Stockosorb increased the period of water availability for 15 days, and this was in accordance to soil water holding from 28.74% to 34.63% [ 41]. Greenhouse crop producers also search for methods that could reduce the water requirement and also decrease the watering time during each production season. They use hydrogels or water-absorbent polymers in soil or soilless media such as holly, juniper, and azalea [ 42]. Several authors confirmed an increase in irrigation efficiency through the application of superabsorbent polymers [ 20, 26, 29]. The application of PSM in soil + root in comparison to the application in soil alone was more efficient for increasing the WUE. This is probably because of better water retention in the root zone. 2.3. Leaf Area According to the result, the leaf area/plant was affected significantly by all treatments in comparison to the control treatment ( p ≤ 0.01). In the soil application method, both hydrophilic materials increased the leaf area significantly, and at low (0.1%) and medium (0.2%) concentration, Stockosorb ® was more efficient than PSM except at the highest concentration where there were no significant differences between Stockosorb ® and PSM. In the soil + root application method, increasing the PSM concentration decreased the leaf area from 453.1 (in 0.1%) to 184.6 cm 2/plant (in 0.3%). With low and medium concentrations of PSM, the leaf area was significantly higher than Stockosorb ®-treated plants. The highest and the lowest leaf area (553.13 and 98.02 cm 2/plant) were produced in plants treated with PSM (0.1% mixed with soil + root) and the control plot, respectively ( Figure 3). Increasing leaf area after superabsorbent polymers application was also reported in  Acacia victoriae [ 25], soybean [ 24], and  Pinus halepensis [ 22]. Decreasing leaf area upon increasing the PSM concentration (in soil + root application method) may be related to the negative effect of this high concentration of PSM (0.2% and 0.3% PSM) for direct application on root, and it may be higher than the optimum concentration or more than the tolerant level of the basil root. Other possible explanations for getting this effect may be related to the induction of a high matric water potential effect around plant roots that belongs to the nature of the PSM. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the use of PSM on the soil + root of basil or other plants for comparison, and it may related to the concentration that needs more research for evaluating the lower concentration of PSM when applied on soil + root of basil. The soil + root application of hydrogel could be useful in the indirect cultivation of horticultural crops (seedling transplanting). By comparison to other evaluated factors, the 0.1% PSM is a good treatment, and more research needs to evaluate lower PSM concentrations. On the other hand, in the present work, nutrient uptake in different treatments was not evaluated, and much work remains to be done for determining the mode of action of the superabsorbent polymer on the leaf area  2.4. Essential Oil Content (%v/w) The results of analysis of variance indicated that essential oil content was significantly affected ( p ≤ 0.01) by all treatments. The highest essential oil content was produced in plants treated with PSM and Stockosorb ® at a concentration of 0.3%, and the lowest essential oil content (0.18%  v/ w) was extracted from control plants ( Figure 4). According to the results in both application methods, increasing the concentration of Stockosorb ® increased essential oil content. The essential oil content of plants treated with PSM increased by increasing the PSM concentration mixed with soil, while it decreased when it mixed with soil + root ( Figure 4). Essential oil biosynthesis in herb was controlled by two main factors, endogenous and exogenous. The former related to the plant genetic characteristic but the latter related to environmental conditions such as light, temperature, nutrient level, and moisture. The exogenous factors may exert their effects directly or indirectly [ 43].  According to the Council of Europe (2001) [ 44], the standard essential oil content of basil on the basis of dry weight should be 0.8%  v/ w [ 45]. Overall, the yield and essential oil percentage was severely reduced by the water stress conditions. Medium water stress has been shown to increase secondary metabolites without negative effects on physiological activities, growth, and flowering [ 2, 46]. Increased essential oil content in  Lippia citriodora through the application of balanced fertilization + biofertilizer + superabsorbent polymer as a water preservative in soil and mild stress has also been reported [ 47]. Mild water stress in arid and semi-arid regions demonstrated increased activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and this protein synthesis shift toward phenol and final shift to essential oil.  2.5. Essential Oil Yield  According to the results, significant effects ( p ≤ 0.01) were recorded in the case of essential oil yield by all treatments. According to  Figure 5, the lowest essential oil yield (0.06 mL per plant) was observed in control plants and the highest (0.21 mL per plant) belonged to plants treated with Stockosorb ® at 0.2% (soil + root application); furthermore, there was no significant difference with PSM at a concentration of 0.3% (soil + root application). All treatments in comparison to the control decreased the adverse effect of water shortage of the root zone and kept soil water content near to the field capacity. Treatments provided greater support of the plants’ water requirements for proper growth and development, increasing essential oil yield in comparison to the control when the Stockosorb ® and PSM applications were at a concentration of 0.2% and 0.3% (mixed with soil + root), respectively. Essential oil yield is directly related to the essential oil content (on the basis of g/100 g DW) and herb yield. In turn, herb yield depends on cultivar, harvest season, and soil water availability [ 30, 45]. Essential oil yield in published articles on medicinal plants has been presented as kg/ha [ 48] or mL/plant. The former depends on the number of plant/ha and is related to the plant density that is affected by geographical conditions, especially light intensity, whereas the latter could be presented in pot experiments or small plot research projects. In our study, the essential oil yields in different treatments were presented as mL/plant in the range of 0.06–0.21 mL/plant. Ichimura et al. (1995) [ 49] by studying the effect of P fertilizer on the growth and essential oil yield of basil showed that phosphorus fertilizer could increase the essential oil yield from 0.006 to 0.04 mL/plant in spring and from 0.035 to 0.06 mL/plant in summer. A higher level of essential oil yield in our study could be related to the cultivar and climatic conditions. They did not express the basil cultivar in their research. Zheljazkov et al. (2008) [ 48] studied 38 accessions of basil and reported an essential oil yield in the range of 3.1–58.8 kg/ha. The plant density in their study was near 3 plant/m 2. Other researchers have verified increased essential oil yield by increasing water availability in soil [ 6]. Shii et al. [ 50] showed that Stokosorb treatment prolonged the water supply to plant duration and increased growth in  Populus popularis. In our study, growth parameters of basil improved after the use of water preservative compounds in soil and indirectly increased essential oil yield by increasing herb yield ( Figure 1).  2.6. Essential Oil Quality Results of the GC-MS analysis of the basil essential oil are shown in  Table 1 and  Table 2. In total, 49 to 52 components were determined in the essential oil of basil treated with Stockosorb ® mixed with soil + root that represented 98% of the essential oils. The major constituents of the essential oil in the samples were linalool (from 53.4% to 63.4%), 1,8-cineole (from 3.7% to 7.8%), epi-α-cadinol (from 5.1% to 5.9%), trans-α-bergamotene (from 2.7 to 3.1%), methyl chavicol or estragole (from 1.2% to 3.9%), and eugenol (from 2.1% to 2.5%) ( Table 1). In addition, 37 to 45 compounds were identified in the essential oil of  O. basilicum treated with Stockosorb ® mixed only with soil (98.5% of the total essential oils). The main constituents found in the essential oil of these samples were linalool (from 52.4% to 55.2%), 1,8-cineole (from 3.3% to 5.1%), epi-α-cadinol (from 4.98% to 6.6%), trans-α-bergamotene (from 3.5% to 5.3%), methyl chavicol (from 1.9% to 2.9%), and eugenol (from 2.8% to 4.9%) ( Table 2). In  O. basilicum treated with PSM mixed with soil + root, 35 to 46 constituents were determined (99% of the total essential oils), linalool (from 57.4% to 63.6%), 1,8-cineole (from 4.8% to 8.8%), epi-α-cadinol (from 4.2% to 5.3%), trans-α-bergamotene (from 3.5% to 5.3%), methyl chavicol (from 1.0% to 4.2%), and eugenol (from 2.3% to 3.1%), which are reported as the main components of volatile oils ( Table 1). While in plants treated with PSM mixed only with soil (at 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% concentration), 41 to 50 constituents were observed (99% of the total essential oils) with the dominant components consisting of linalool (from 59.9% to 62.8%), 1,8-cineole (from 3.6% to 5.1%), epi-α-cadinol (from 3.8% to 6.2%), trans-α-bergamotene (from 2.1% to 2.4%), methyl chavicol (from 0.2% to 9.4%), and eugenol (from 1.3% to 3.6%) ( Table 2).  According to the GC-MS analysis of the essential oils ( Figure 6), regardless of the method of application of HPs, linalool and eugenol ( Figure 6D,B) contents of basil essential oils increased and decreased, respectively. The methyl chavicol content of plants treated with PSM (in soil application methods) was stable ( Figure 6A), but application of Stockosorb ® (in both methods) increased the constituent drastically. Plants treated with PSM (in both methods and in different concentrations) had a greater amount of major constituents of essential oil than Stockosorb ®-treated plants. The highest amount of linalool ( Figure 6D) and methyl chavicol ( Figure 6A) was obtained in plants treated with PSM mixed only with soil at 0.1% and 0.2% concentrations, respectively. Plants treated with PSM mixed with soil + root (at 0.2% concentration) had the maximum 1,8-cineole ( Figure 6C). Timmerman et al. (1984) [ 51] expressed, on the basis of more than 200 essential oil analysis reports, the maximum level of linalool synthesized in wet growing conditions in comparison to dry growing conditions. Bettaieb et al. (2009) [ 52] reported that the highest amount of 1,8 cineole was detected in mild drought stress, which was consistent with the results of this study. Therefore, increased 1,8 cineole and linalool constituents were due to applying the superabsorbent polymer and increasing water availability in the soil and root zone. Ocimum basilicum essential oils are mainly originated from mevalonic acid or phenylpropanoid pathways. The biosynthesis of volatile oil constituents was catalyzed by different enzymes ( Scheme S1 in Supplementary Materials). Lawrence (1988) [ 53] classified four major essential oil chemotypes of basil: (1) methyl chavicol-rich, (2) linalool-rich, (3) methyl eugenol-rich, (4) methyl cinnamate-rich, and also numerous subtypes. Bruneton (1993) [ 54] obtained results that were generally different to the literature findings concerning the major compounds. The observed differences might be the result of different growing environments, genetic factors, or chemotypes, as well as other potential factors that can influence the oil composition. Lee et al. (2005) [ 55] reported that, regardless of environmental, genetic, or chemotype factors, 1,8-cineole, methyl cinnamate, methyl chavicol, and linalool are generally the main compounds responsible for the typical basil aroma [ 53]. The chemical composition of various cultivars of sweet basil essential oils was evaluated by Kartnig and Simon (1986) [ 56] in three harvest times. They found that in all varieties and all harvest times, linalool was the main constituents (in the range of 39.8–75.5%). Simon et al. (1992) [ 57] evaluated the essential oil content and composition of sweet basil upon water stress treatments and confirmed that water stress affects the chemical composition of basil essential oil. They showed that the relative percentage of linalool and eugenol decreased in moderate stress in comparison to the control (from 29.5% to 16.3% and 4.3% to 0.1%, respectively) but methyl chavicol instead increased (from 30.3% to 49.9%). They finally concluded that even mild water stress can increase essential oil content and change the essential oil constituents. In the present research, by increasing the HP concentration (decreasing matric potential of water), the linalool content increased but eugenol decreased and the methyl chavicol content did not show a defined trend. The results may be related to the method of representing each constituent (relative percentage) that increases in one or two constituents should force the other constituents to decrease. For a deeper explanation of the effect of HP application on essential oil constituents, the evaluation of enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of each compound, and also independently measuring each compound content (not relative content), is necessary. There are consumption restrictions for some compounds of basil essential oil such as methyl chavicol (or estragole), eugenol (phenolic compounds), eucalyptol, and some alkyl benzene compounds like methyl eugenol and, notably, safrole (a phenylpropanoid ether) ( Table S1 in Supplementary Materials). According to the information of Gubta et al., sweet basil essential oil, with a low content of methyl chavicol (<7%) and high linalool content, has been recommended [ 58]. Plants rich in linalool (a terpene alcohol) demonstrate potent effects on the central nervous system in vivo, including sedative, spasmolytic, and hypothermic activity. Linalool also has a local anesthetic effect [ 54]. The greater antioxidant potential of  O. basilicum essential oil might be correlated to the high content of linalool in this oil [ 45]. According to the results in this study ( Table 1 and  Table 2), the linalool constituent was enhanced by the use of both polymers (PSM and Stockosorb ®).","One of the major factors limiting the production of medicinal plants in arid and semi-arid areas is water deficit or drought stress. One-third of the land in the world is arid and semi-arid and is inhabited by nearly 4 × 10 8  people.  Ocimum basilicum  (sweet basil) is a valuable medicinal plant that is sensitive to water deficit, and water shortage negatively affects sweet basil yield and quality. Water availability in the root zone of basil could ameliorate the negative effects of water shortage. To the best of our knowledge, although the effects of hydrophilic polymers (HPs) have been studied in different agricultural crops, the effects of HP application in medicinal plants have not been previously investigated. This investigation was conducted to explore the effects on water use efficiency when using Stockosorb ®  (STS) and psyllium seed mucilage (PSM) as hydrophilic polymers (HPs) and the effects of these HPs on essential oil quality, quantity, and yield. The research was set up in a factorial experiment on the basis of completely randomized block design with three replications. We used two HPs, STS (industrial) and PSM (herbal), with two methods of application (mixed with soil, mixed with soil + root) at four concentrations (0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% ( w / w )). Results showed that the STS and PSM significantly increased the dry herb yield (both shoot and root) in comparison to the control, and the improving effect was higher when these HPs were mixed with soil + root. The highest dry herb yield (6.74 and 3.68 g/plant for shoot and root, respectively) was detected in the PSM at 0.1% mixed with soil + root. There was not any significant difference in dry herb yield among PSM (0.1%), PSM (0.2%), and STS (0.2%) when mixed with soil + root. Soil application of PSM and soil + root application of STS at a concentration of 0.3% increased the Essential Oil (EO) content almost three-fold in comparison to the control (0.5% and 0.52% to 0.18%  v / w , respectively). The maximum essential oil yield was recorded in plants treated with STS (0.2% in) or PSM (0.1%) by soil + root application (0.21 and 0.19 mL/plant, respectively). PSM at concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% (mixed with soil + root) showed the highest water use efficiency (1.91 and 1.82 g dry weight (DW)/L H 2 O, respectively). STS mixed with soil also significantly improved water use efficiency (WUE) in comparison to the control. The application of these HPs improved the quality of sweet basil essential oil by increasing the linalool and decreasing the eugenol, epi-α-cadinol, and trans-α-bergamotene content.","['Water use efficiency', 'Hydrophilic Polymer', 'Basil', 'Essential Oil Content', 'Volatile Oil Quality']","['Essential Oil', 'PSM', 'soil', 'Oil', 'Essential', 'application', 'root application', 'root', 'Oil Yield', 'Stockosorb']","[≤, Stockosorb ®, PSM, Stockosorb ®, PSM, groundnut [ 36], hydro-absorbent, root-to-soil, hydro-absorbent, Stockosorb ®, −1, WUE, ≤, Stockosorb ®, Stockosorb ®, PSM, WUE, PSM, Stockosorb ®, Stockosorb ®, PSM, PSM, Stockosorb ®, WUE, pearl millet [ 35], Stockosorb, PSM, ≤, Stockosorb ®, Stockosorb ®, PSM, PSM, 2/plant, PSM, Stockosorb ®, 2/plant, PSM (, soybean [ 24], PSM, PSM, PSM, ≤, PSM, Stockosorb ®, Stockosorb ®, PSM, PSM, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, ≤, Stockosorb ®, PSM, PSM, soil water, plant/ha, Zheljazkov, Shii, Stokosorb, Stockosorb ®, epi-α-cadinol, Stockosorb ®, epi-α-cadinol, epi-α-cadinol, epi-α-cadinol, PSM, Stockosorb ®, PSM, chavicol-rich, eugenol-rich, cinnamate-rich, 39.8–75.5, PSM, Stockosorb ®]",[],[],[],NaN
128,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7332032\eupmc_result.json,PMC7332032,"Results and discussion Volatiles profiling of  Plectranthus amboinicus leaves Headspace—solid phase microextraction—gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) analysis demonstrated that the  P.  amboinicus volatiles were dominated by α-bergamotene (19.5%), carvacrol (19.6%), caryophyllene (19.2%), p-cymene (8.2%), γ-terpinene (10.5%) and humulene (5.6%) ( Table 1,  Fig 1). Seven terpene alcohols including 1-octen-3-ol, terpinene-4-ol, linalool and nerolidol were detected which formed 2.35% of  P.  amboinicus volatiles. Carvacrol has a characteristic pungent spicy-woody odor which contributes to the strong oregano-like aroma [ 23], and together with the high relative percentages of citrus odor of α-bergamotene [ 24] and caryophyllene (spicy-woody) [ 25] collectively contribute to the unique, strong aromatic odor of  P.  amboinicus. This result is in agreement with the known volatile constituents of  P.  amboinicus previously reviewed by Arumugam et al. [ 1]. However, the phytochemical composition of plants may vary depending on geographical locations, climatic conditions, methods of extraction and identification. The volatile constituents of  P.  amboinicus leaves collected from Uganda which were also extracted using HS-SPME showed the presence of linalool (50.3%) as the main component with other detected volatiles such as carvacrol (14.3 4%), geranyl acetate (11.7%), nerol acetate (11.6%) and γ-terpinene (3.2%) [ 26]. On the other hand,  P.  amboinicus oil from Cambodia was shown to contain dominant constituents of thymol (57.4%), carvacrol (13.5%), γ-terpinene (5.6%) and p-cymene (5.2%) [ 27]. Interestingly, thymoquinone and thymohydroquinone, phytochemical compounds with potential application as an anti-cancer drug that can be found in  Nigella sativa were also detected in  P.  amboinicus albeit in small amounts. The presence of thymoquinone in  P.  amboinicus has also been documented by Chen et al. [ 28] in water-hexane extract with further identification using mass spectrophotometer and NMR analysis. Isolation of full-length monoterpene synthase gene and sequence characterization The partial  PamTps1 transcript (Accession No.: GGXS01005129) was identified from the  P.  amboinicus transcriptome (SRA Accession No.:SRR7842030) using the BLAST alignment that showed hits to known terpene synthases and also on the basis of the presence of its conserved sequence characteristics that are shared by all terpene synthases. The full-length  PamTps1 transcript (Accession no: MK050501) contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1797 bp encoding a protein of 598 amino acids with theoretical isoelectric point (pI) and molecular weight of 5.40 and 69.6 kDa, respectively. The transcript was predicted to contain a 52 amino acid N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide, which most likely targets this protein to the plastid, the location of monoterpenes biosynthesis found in other Lamiaceae members. This predicted transit peptide was characterized by high contents of serine and threonine, and low number of acidic residues which in accordance to Williams et al. [ 29] is expected for the  Tpsb subfamily. The sequence identity of  PamTps1 at the amino acid level was compared via BLASTp algorithm against the NCBI non-redundant protein database and showed 60–70% amino acid sequence identity to monoterpene synthases of other Lamiaceae members including  T.  caespititius γ-terpinene synthase (AID51201.1) [ 14],  S.  rosmarinus pinene synthase (ABP01684.1),  P.  frutescens linalool synthase (AAL38029.1) and  P.  setovensis geraniol synthase (ACN42010.1) [ 30]. This analysis confirmed that the sequence similarity among Lamiaceae terpene synthases was relatively high but may not necessarily be linked to the catalytic function of the enzyme. Based on the sequence similarity and presence of N-terminal transit peptide,  PamTps1 was designated as a putative monoterpene synthase. Despite the sequence diversity, terpene synthases share several conserved amino acid residues both at the N- and C-terminal protein domains. These conserved motifs were found in the deduced amino acid sequence of  PamTps1 ( Fig 2) notably the tandem arginine motif (RRx 8W) located downstream of the transit peptide at the N-terminal region of monoterpene synthases. Deletion of this motif on the  Mentha spicata limonene synthase was found to affect the ability of the enzyme to utilize geranyl pyrophosphate as a substrate, suggesting that this motif might be involved in the isomerization of geranyl pyrophosphate to a cyclizable intermediate [ 29]. This arginine pair has also been reported to stabilize the closed active site in the enzyme-ligand complexes reaction [ 31]. The LQLYEASFLL motif which was also found in  PamTps1 but as a LQLYEASFLE sequence is another conserved motif that is believed to be part of the active site and might be involved in substrate binding [ 15, 32]. Another conserved region in terpene synthases is the aspartate-rich DDxxD motif that has been found in almost all isolated plant terpene synthases. This highly conserved motif, which occurs as DDVYD in  P.  amboinicus, is located at the C-terminal domain of all terpene synthases and is known to be involved in the binding of divalent metal ion cofactor such as Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ to initiate binding and activation of the diphosphate moiety of the substrate [ 33– 35]. The DDxxD motif located at the entrance of the catalytic site was demonstrated to be critical in positioning the substrate for catalysis as mutation of this motif often led to decreased catalytic activity and abnormal product [ 36, 37]. Besides that, an additional metal cofactor binding motif NSE/DTE which evolved from a second aspartate-rich region to form a consensus sequence of (L,V)(V,L,A)(N,D)D(L,I,V)x(S,T)xxxE occurred as LADDLGTAPFE in  PamTps1. Both the DDxxD and NSE/DTE motifs bind to a trinuclear magnesium ions cluster and are involved in the fixation of pyrophosphate substrate.  PamTps1 also contains other motifs such as RxR and GTLxEL that are postulated to be part of terpene synthases active site [ 17, 38] and occur as RDR and GTLDEL, located about 35 amino acids upstream and two amino acids downstream of DDxxD, respectively. Functional expression of  PamTps1 The N-terminal transit peptide necessary for plastidial targeting of monoterpene synthases has been reported to facilitate formation of inclusion bodies in an  E.  coli expression system. High yield expression of soluble monoterpene synthases can be accomplished by truncation of the transit peptide from the coding region to remove the target sequence [ 11]. Previous studies on bacterial expression of terpene synthases isolated from other members of Lamiaceae such as  M.  spicata limonene synthase and  T.  caespititius γ-terpinene synthase demonstrated the expression of functional enzymes upon removal of the transit peptide upstream of the double arginine motif [ 13, 29]. Therefore, the signal peptide was removed from  PamTps1 sequence during cloning in order to achieve expression of a soluble and functional putative monoterpene synthase in an  E.  coli system. The complete  PamTps1 ORF was 1797 bp, of which 147 bp corresponding to the putative transit peptide was removed to improve protein solubility during expression. The truncated  PamTps1 was cloned into pET32b(+) expression vector that contained a dual-fusion tag consisting of thioredoxin (TrxA) and histidine (His 6) to give a predicted mass of 79 kDa for the fusion protein. The truncated  PamTps1 was expressed in Rosetta™ 2(DE3) strain which supplied rare tRNAs to cope with the differences of codon usage between  PamTps1 and  E.  coli that may impede translation due to the demands for tRNAs that may be lacking in the bacterial host. Protein expression analysis for the clone harboring the truncated  PamTps1 was compared with the control expression containing the empty pET32b(+) vector. The recombinant protein was then purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by gel filtration chromatography to yield a pure protein for functional characterization study. The SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses showed the presence of a corresponding protein band of an estimated size of ~79 kDa ( S1 Fig). Functional characterization of  PamTps1 Most of the previously described terpene synthases were multi-product enzymes where the identity and relative abundance of the terpene products did not accurately predict the protein function [ 15, 39, 40]. Thus, the activity of  PamTps1 was investigated through  in vitro enzymatic assay and  in vivo expression in an  E.  coli system. The  PamTps1 enzymatic reaction demonstrated that this protein predominantly catalyzed formation of linalool from GPP confirming that  PamTps1 is a functional monoterpene synthase ( Fig 3A). Interestingly, when FPP was provided as a substrate,  PamTps1 was able to synthesize sesquiterpene nerolidol, the C 15 analogue of linalool ( Fig 3B). The identification of linalool and nerolidol produced from  PamTps1 enzymatic reaction was conducted by comparing their retention times and mass spectra with the authentic standard materials and NIST14 library ( Fig 3 and  S2 Fig). Smaller peaks of linalool and nerolidol were observed in the control reactions without enzyme which could arise as a result of non-enzymatic solvolysis of GPP and FPP in the presence of metal ions ( S3 Fig) [ 41]. However, it was evident from the chromatogram that the significant and higher signal abundances of linalool and nerolidol as compared to the control reactions were the products of  PamTps1 enzymatic reactions, albeit with partial contamination of solvolysed products of the substrates. These enzymatic products of  PamTps1 were also detected in the volatiles composition of  P.  amboinicus although only present at 0.2% of the total volatiles detected ( Table 1). Some terpene synthases may behave differently in  in vivo as compared with the  in vitro due to differences in cofactors availability and other biochemical conditions [ 42, 43]. It was previously shown that terpene synthase products can vary depending on the expression host and the subcellular localization of the protein [ 42, 44, 45]. Thus, in order to demonstrate whether multi-substrate activity of  PamTps1 extends to the  in vivo environment, microbial production of terpenoids in the  E.  coli system was conducted. The terpenoid profile produced in the recombinant  E.  coli host up to 24 h of post-induction was illustrated in  Fig 3F. It was observed that the recombinant  E.  coli harboring  PamTps1 was capable of producing both linalool and nerolidol  in vivo without supplementation of any exogenous GPP or FPP substrates, which correlated with the  in vitro activity of  PamTps1. This outcome validated the multi-substrate use of this enzyme in producing linalool and nerolidol in both the  in vivo and  in vitro systems. Hence, we designated  PamTps1 as a linalool/nerolidol synthase, and this is the first report describing isolation and functional characterization of such substrate promiscuity of a terpene synthase from  P.  amboinicus. Recent advances and progresses in the characterization of enzymes responsible for terpenoids biosynthesis in plants and bacteria have revealed the existence of multi-substrate terpene synthases capable of synthesizing terpenes of different chain lengths depending on corresponding substrate availability. Pazouki and Niinemets [ 46] highlighted that there were at least 40 confirmed cases of multi-substrate enzymes among plant terpenoids, suggesting that the substrate promiscuous terpene synthases are prevalent within the plant kingdom. Based on the functional assay study, it was evident that  PamTps1 is a high-fidelity, multi-substrate enzyme capable of performing both monoterpene and sesquiterpene activities in  in vitro and  in vivo systems for the formation of linalool and nerolidol. In  planta, the formation of linalool and nerolidol requires either two specialized terpene synthases (linalool and nerolidol synthases) or a substrate promiscuous linalool/nerolidol synthase. Linalool synthases are widely identified from both angiosperms and gymnosperms, and are considered a defective monoterpene cyclase that can catalyze the initial ionization and rearrangement of GPP but cannot proceed to the subsequent cyclization steps [ 47]. It was an interesting observation that most papers reported linalool synthase or nerolidol synthase or linalool/nerolidol synthase showed high-fidelity activity by producing exclusively either linalool or nerolidol instead of multiple compounds as demonstrated by the promiscuous terpene synthases [ 33, 48– 52]. The  PamTps1 shared a similarity of less than 36% with other linalool/nerolidol synthase from  V.  vinifera [ 53, 54],  Streptomyces clavuligerus [ 55],  A.  majus [ 48] and  S.  lycopersicum. Sequence comparison of  PamTps1 with plant monoterpene synthases showed that Lamiaceae linalool synthases differ from others by a three-amino acid deletion (i.e. between residues 524–526 in  PamTps1) at the C-terminal region of the protein ( Fig 2) which structurally provided more water access to the active site of linalool synthase and caused premature quenching by water capture [ 47]. However, no deletion of such amino acids was observed in  PamTps1, and it was postulated that this premature quenching was due to the less efficient active site closure in the enzyme-ligand complexes which thereby was unable to shield reactive carbocation intermediates from the water molecule [ 56]. It will be interesting to further explore this  PamTps1 to identify the structural features that confer the multi-substrate function that can be exploited to engineer terpene synthases with high fidelity and specificity for production of terpenoids in a microbial cell factory. Expressional analysis of  PamTps1 Volatile terpenoids are often synthesized and emitted from specific plant tissue at a particular time that correlates with the spatio-temporal expression of their terpene synthases, suggesting that the terpenoid biosynthesis is transcriptionally regulated [ 57]. The leaf and stem tissues of aromatic plants were generally associated with the presence of secretory structures that produced large quantities of volatile terpenoids consisting mostly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes [ 58, 59]. Based on our preliminary histomorphology results (unpublished),  P.  amboinicus leaves exhibited high accumulation of essential oils. Since Lamiaceae leaves produce essential oils rich in terpenoids and stems are also frequently used for essential oils extraction, both tissues were selected for  PamTps1 differential expression analysis using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). Comparison of volatiles released by  P.  amboinicus leaf and stem tissues during the natural 24 h day/night cycle is displayed in  S4 Fig. From this analysis, it was evident that the leaves of this herbal plant emitted a vast array of volatiles throughout the day and the amounts declined towards the night. A similar observation was made in  Lillium whereby its floral scent emission was significantly influenced by light intensity and temperature [ 60]. Preferential accumulation of  PamTps1 transcripts was observed in the leaf tissue instead of the stems, and this concurred with the emission of linalool and nerolidol from the leaves ( Fig 4). Overall, our findings revealed that the  PamTps1 showed a 42-fold preferential expression in leaves as compared to the stem with a maximal expression in the afternoon. This observation was also noted with the terpene synthases expression in  S.  guaranitica such as linalool synthases 1 and 2, geranyl linalool synthase, selinene synthase and β-caryophyllene synthase that showed high expression levels in the leaf tissue as compared to the stems [ 61]. Likewise, a  Citrus terpene synthase exhibited preferential expression in leaves and fruit flavedo which corresponds to the terpenes accumulation and essential oils production by these tissues in the  Citrus plants [ 62]. Similarly, germacrene A synthase in  Achillea millefolium showed high expression levels in the leaves and flowers in contrast to the stem tissue [ 63]. In constrast, expression of linalool synthase was mostly reported in flower tissues which accounted for the floral scents emission of  Lillium [ 64],  A.  argute [ 65] and  Osmanthus fragrans [ 66] that correlated with the volatiles released during flower development. The expression of terpene synthase genes has been reported to be highly up-regulated in specialized cells such as those in glandular trichomes, which were located on the aerial parts of the plants [ 11, 14, 67]. A number of Lamiaceae terpene synthases, including linalool synthase, involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in secretory glandular trichomes had been functionally characterized as reviewed by Lange & Turner [ 68]. In  P.  amboinicus, our preliminary histomorphological results showed that the glandular trichomes are probably the storage sites for the essential oils produced in the leaves. However, it remains unknown whether  PamTps1 expression is associated with this storage site. The  PamTps1 expression in the leaves followed a diurnal circadian rhythm with increased level exhibited early in the morning at 2.00 AM, and achieved a high point around 2.00 PM before diminishing during the remainder of the day ( Fig 4). This expression pattern is similar to  A.  chinensin bifunctional nerolidol synthase ( AcNES1) expression in the whole flower that showed an increment from 4.00 AM to a maximum point at midday before decreasing afterwards [ 69]. The  AcNES1 expression accompanied by time point analysis of terpenes suggested that nerolidol was largely accumulated throughout the day with maximal emission at midnight preceded by a steady decrease and remained low until morning. Similar trend was observed in  P.  amboinicus leaf where the highest nerolidol emission occurred early in the morning (2.00 AM) and the amounts reduced thereafter. In contrast, maximal linalool emission from the  P.  amboinicus leaf was observed at 8.00 AM and started to decline in the afternoon till midnight ( Fig 4). Based on this pattern, we hypothesized that the accumulation of linalool happened during the night before the morning emission. Similar correlation was observed with Chen et al. [ 65] study where the  A.  argute linalool synthase ( AaLS1) displayed constitutive expression with slight reduction in the morning and an increased at midday accompanied by maximal emission rate of linalool at 8.00 AM. This phenomenon could possibly be related to the study previously demonstrated in  Pinus pinea where large emission of oxygenated monoterpenoid linalool was controlled by stomata opening, which was influenced by light intensity and temperature [ 70, 71]. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in the emission rate of monoterpenoids during midday which was attributable to diurnal water-stress leaves with closed stomata [ 70]. It remains uncertain whether the diurnal water-stress leaves with closed stomata could explain the terpenoids emission pattern in  P.  amboinicus. Phylogenetic analysis of  PamTps1 Phylogenetic profiling of  PamTps1 protein was conducted to infer its evolutionary relationship with members of the plant terpene synthase subfamilies and other terpene synthases from the Lamiaceae family. Plant terpene synthases share a common evolutionary origin based upon their similar reaction mechanisms and conserved structural and sequence characteristics that include amino acid sequence homology and conserved sequence motifs [ 9, 10, 72]. The bifurcation of the terpene synthases involved in primary and secondary metabolism appears to occur before the separation of angiosperms and gymnosperms. Previous phylogenetic analysis of terpene synthases from the gymnosperms and angiosperms delineated the  Tps gene family into eight subfamilies, designated as  Tpsa through  Tpsg and α-farnesene synthase cluster [ 9, 72, 73]. Terpene synthases that produce secondary metabolites are classified into subfamilies of  Tpsa (angiosperm sesquiterpene and diterpene synthases),  Tpsb (angiosperm monoterpene synthases) and  Tpsd (gymnosperm monoterpene synthases) are only distantly related to  Tpsc (copalyl diphosphate synthase) and  Tpse (kaurene synthase) subfamilies that are rich in specialized (i.e. secondary) metabolism beyond carrying the enzyme involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, and distantly ancient branch  Tpsf containing linalool synthase [ 9, 11]. Functional characterization of  PamTps1 using  in vitro and  in vivo expression systems showed that this multi-substrate enzyme possesses a monoterpene synthase and a sesquiterpene synthase activity producing exclusively linalool and nerolidol, respectively. The phylogenetic tree ( Fig 5) reveals that  PamTps1 belongs to the  Tpsb group as expected for a Lamiaceae monoterpene synthase. The presence of RRx 8W motif, which is characteristic of the angiosperm  Tpsb group [ 11, 73], positioned  PamTps1 in the  Tpsb cluster. This monophyletic  Tpsb group contains terpene synthases such as pinene synthase, linalool synthase and limonene synthase which produce cyclic and acyclic products, which were grouped together on the basis of their sequence similarities and the presence of tandem arginine motif, despite differences in their catalytic functions. It is evident from  Fig 5 that the phylogenetically closest sequences to  PamTps1 are  Lavandula and  Salvia terpene synthases with more than 67% similarity, signifying a close relationship between these genera that are cluster together in  Tpsb regardless of the product specificity [ 67]. This could probably be related to the adaptive evolutionary process of ancestral gene copy that had undergone a divergence in structure and function which contributed to the large diversity of terpene synthases [ 10]. The other known multi-substrate terpene synthases that belong to the  Tpsb and have a transit peptide are the  S.  lycopersicum linalool synthase [ 74],  Hedychium coronarium terpene synthase [ 75] and β-ocimene synthase of  Arabidopsis thaliana [ 45]. It is noteworthy to mention that most of the reported linalool/nerolidol synthases belong to the  Tpsg group, a clade closely related to the  Tpsb which comprises of angiosperm acyclic terpene synthases that produce monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. However,  Tpsg group members lack the common structural feature of RRx 8W motif present in the  Tpsb members [ 9, 54]. The multi-substrate activity of terpene synthases are widely divergent across the  Tps subfamilies in the multiple plant species. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that all plant terpene synthases originated from the ancient diterpene synthases of the  Tpsc clade that represents the base of the rooted phylogenetic tree such as illustrated in  Fig 5 [ 9, 76, 77]. These old diterpene synthases adopt a tri-domain architecture of  αβγ proteins that contain a transit peptide [ 78– 80]. Further evolutionary modifications over time have witnessed diversification of product profiles that are not only been associated with changes in the active site center structure, but also loss of  γ-domain in the isoprene, monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases, and transit peptide loss in the sesquiterpene synthases [ 78– 80]. Identification of two plastidic and cytosolic linalool/nerolidol synthases in  A.  majus and  F.  ananassa further suggests that sesquiterpene synthases might have evolved from the monoterpene synthases ancestor through the loss of plastid signal peptide and acquirement of an active site adaptation to the FPP substrate [ 46, 48, 81, 82]. The evolution of terpene synthases family shows that these enzymes possesses a remarkable flexibility to evolve into new functional diversification and subsequently contributes to the chemical diversity of terpenoids in nature [ 9].","Plectranthus amboinicus (Lour.) Spreng is an aromatic medicinal herb known for its therapeutic and nutritional properties attributed by the presence of monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds. Up until now, research on terpenoid biosynthesis has focused on a few mint species with economic importance such as thyme and oregano, yet the terpene synthases responsible for monoterpene production in P. amboinicus have not been described. Here we report the isolation, heterologous expression and functional characterization of a terpene synthase involved in P. amboinicus terpenoid biosynthesis. A putative monoterpene synthase gene (PamTps1) from P. amboinicus was isolated with an open reading frame of 1797 bp encoding a predicted protein of 598 amino acids with molecular weight of 69.6 kDa. PamTps1 shares 60-70% amino acid sequence similarity with other known terpene synthases of Lamiaceae. The in vitro enzymatic activity of PamTps1 demonstrated the conversion of geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate exclusively into linalool and nerolidol, respectively, and thus PamTps1 was classified as a linalool/nerolidol synthase. In vivo activity of PamTps1 in a recombinant Escherichia coli strain revealed production of linalool and nerolidol which correlated with its in vitro activity. This outcome validated the multi-substrate usage of this enzyme in producing linalool and nerolidol both in in vivo and in vitro systems. The transcript level of PamTps1 was prominent in the leaf during daytime as compared to the stem. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that maximal linalool level was released during the daytime and lower at night following a diurnal circadian pattern which correlated with the PamTps1 expression pattern. The PamTps1 cloned herein provides a molecular basis for the terpenoid biosynthesis in this local herb that could be exploited for valuable production using metabolic engineering in both microbial and plant systems.",NaN,"['terpene synthases', 'synthases', 'synthase', 'linalool synthase', 'terpene', 'linalool', 'monoterpene synthases', 'nerolidol synthase', 'expression', 'Fig']","[SRA Accession No.:SRR7842030, MK050501, ABP01684.1, AAL38029.1, geraniol synthase, ACN42010.1, enzyme-ligand complexes, LQLYEASFLL, LQLYEASFLE, DDVYD, Mg 2, (L, V)(V, D)D(L,, V)x(S, T)xxxE, LADDLGTAPFE, GTLxEL, GTLDEL, pET32b(+, thioredoxin (, TrxA, pET32b(+, IMAC, multi-product enzymes, C, NIST14 library, metal ions ( S3 Fig, linalool/nerolidol synthase, linalool/nerolidol synthase, linalool/nerolidol synthase, linalool/nerolidol synthase, Lamiaceae linalool, enzyme-ligand, 2, geranyl linalool, β-caryophyllene synthase, AaLS1, α-farnesene synthase cluster [ 9, copalyl diphosphate synthase, gibberellin, β-ocimene synthase, linalool/nerolidol, 78– 80, 78– 80, cytosolic linalool/nerolidol, plastid signal peptide]",[],[],"['Citrus', 'Citrus']",terpene synthase

Characterization of CpMYC2 and bHLH13  Using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique, a transcriptomic library (NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession number PRJNA492170) was constructed from the full open flower stage of the Wintersweet H29 cultivar ( Figure 1), and out of 16 identified members of the  bHLH family, the desired sequence of two transcription factors  CpMYC2 (2858 bp) and  bHLH13 (2425 bp) was selected for further study [ 45]. Based on the NCBI ORF finder, the open reading frame of 1884 bp and 1779 bp nucleotide, encoding 628 and 593 amino acids, were observed in  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13, respectively. The theoretical isoelectric point (pI) and the molecular weight (Mw) of the  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 proteins were Pi/Mw: 5.65/68707.29 and Pi/Mw: 6.43/65502.53, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment of wintersweet  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 proteins with their homologous protein sequences in other species, especially  A. thaliana,  Nicotiana tabacum,  V. vinifera,  Cinnamomum micranthum,  Solanum lycopersicum, and  Zea mays revealed the presence of a basic helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain (446–493 amino acids for  CpMYC2 and 429–476 amino acids for  CpbHLH13) with an MYC-N terminal, which is a common feature of MYC family proteins ( Figure 2 and  Figure 3). The three-dimensional protein structure of  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 is shown in  Supplementary Figures S1 and S2. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that  CpMYC2 was closely related to the transcription factor Arabidopsis MYC2  (AT1G32640), whereas  CpbHLH13 was most homologous to  AtbHLH13 (AT1G01260), also known as JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED MYC2-like2 (JAM2) ( Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). Further phylogenetic analysis with different species revealed that  CpMYC2 had a close relationship with the predicted protein of  Cinnamomum micranthum ( CmMYC2) with 65.13% identity and  A. thaliana ( AtMYC2) with 54%, while  CpbHLH13 was mostly homologous to  C. micranthum ( CmbHLH13) with 69.77% identity followed by  Nelumbo nucifera ( NnMYC2) with 62.46% identity and  A. thaliana AtbHLH13 with 42% identity, although they were not in the same clade. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that  CpbHLH13 had a close relationship with the  A. thaliana AtbHLH13/JAM2 (At1g01260) and  AtbHLH17/JAM1 (At2g46510) transcription factors (See  Supplementary Figures S5 and S6). A summary of the homology of wintersweet  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 with identity% and functions of the genes from various plants is described in  Table 1 and  Table 2. 2.2. CpMYC2 and CpbHLH13 Expression in Wintersweet To determine whether  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 expression was correlated with VOC biosynthesis during wintersweet inflorescence, the expression profile of  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 was analyzed in five developing stages of the flower of H29: flower bud (FB) stage, display petal (DP) stage, partially-open flower (POF) stage, open flower (OF) stage and senescing flower (SF) stage ( Figure 1) using qRT-PCR. The results indicated that the expression levels of  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 increased from the budding stage of the flower to the fully-open flower stage and then gradually decreased in the senescing stage ( Figure 4a,b). We also measured the expression level of both the genes in different tissues of wintersweet and found that the expression level of these genes was highest in flowers, followed by leaves and stems, and lowest in fruits ( Figure 4c,d). This indicates their importance and possible involvement in producing VOCs during blooming, also indicating that these two genes may play an important role in blooming and aroma production. 2.3. Expression Analysis of the Terpene Synthase Genes in Wild-Type and Transgenic Plants Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of terpene synthase genes in wild-type and transgenic plants. The results indicate that the expression of the linalool-producing gene  At1g61680 was about one and a half times higher in the plants transformed by  CpMYC2 than the other plants, while wild-type Col-0 plants, the mutant Salk_083483, and mutant plants transformed by the empty vector pCAMBIA2300S (2300S-Sk83) also showed lower expression of the  At3g25810 gene as compared to 35S:: CpMYC2 plants ( Figure 5a). Similarly, the expression of the β-caryophyllene-producing genes  At5g23960 and  At5g44630 was almost threefold higher in the plants transformed by the  CpbHLH13 gene than the wild-type arabidopsis plants (Col-0) and the plants transformed by the vector pCAMBIA2300S ( Figure 5b). The expression of the  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 genes in transgenic tobacco and arabidopsis plants was also measured ( Supplementary Figure S7) and the plants with almost identical expression were used for further experimentation. 2.4. Overexpression of CpMYC2 and CpbHLH13 Induces VOC Emission The positively selected plants obtained from T3 generation were used to detect the terpenes from the inflorescence of transgenic arabidopsis and tobacco plants using GC-MS. We analyzed the emission of terpenes in arabidopsis and tobacco transgenic plants overexpressed with the  CpMYC2 and  CpbHLH13 gene. The results indicate that linalool was the most abundant monoterpene ( Figure 6a,b) and its emission was more than 1.5 and 2 times higher in transgenic arabidopsis and tobacco plants transformed by the  CpMYC2 gene (35S:: CpMYC2), respectively, compared to the wild type (Col-0 and SR1) and transgenic plants transformed by the vector pCAMBIA2300S ( Figure 7a,b). Similarly, it was found that β-caryophyllene was the most abundant sesquiterpene produced in arabidopsis and tobacco plants transformed by the  CpbHLH13 gene ( Figure 6c,d). GC-MS analysis of linalool and β-caryophyllene emitted from the flowers of transformed  A. thaliana and tobacco plants is shown in  Figure 7 and  Figure 8. The results also indicate that the emission of β-caryophyllene was about twofold higher in the plants transformed by the  CpbHLH13 gene than the transgenic plants transformed by the vector pCAMBIA2300S and wild-type tobacco SR1 ( Figure 8a,b). 2.5. Application of MeJA and GA3 on Overexpressed CpMYC2 Plants Following MeJA and gibberellic acid (GA3) treatment, terpenoids were detected in the inflorescence of transgenic arabidopsis plants using GC-MS. The results again indicate that the emission of linalool was more than 1.5 times higher in the plants transformed by the  CpMYC2 gene (35S:: CpMYC2), while the mutant plants Salk_083483, mutant plants transformed by the vector pCAMBIA2300S (2300S-Sk83), and the Col-0 wild-type plants showed a lower amount of linalool emission compared to the wild-type (35S:: CpMYC2) plants ( Figure 9 and  Figure 10). Further analysis using real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated that the expression of the linalool-producing gene  At1g61680 was about twofold higher in the plants transformed by  CpMYC2 (35S:: CpMYC2) than the other plants, while the wild-type Col-0, mutant plants Salk_083483, and mutant plants transformed by the vector pCAMBIA2300S (2300S-Sk83) showed a lower expression of the  At3g25810 gene as compared to 35S:: CpMYC2 plants ( Figure 11). 2.6. Overexpression of CpbHLH13 Reduces Flower Pigmentation in Tobacco Plants  A few of the flowering transformed lines of  CpbHLH13 also showed phenotypic changes in petal pigmentation. These transgenic plants showed a reduction in the pigmentation of flowers ( Figure 12a). Anthocyanin contents from the inflorescence of these tobacco plants were measured by a spectrophotometer which showed a clear reduction in the anthocyanin concentration in 35S:: CpbHLH13 plants compared with those of the wild type and those transformed by the empty vector pCAMBIA2300S (2300S-SR1) ( Figure 12b,c). By measuring the anthocyanin contents in  CpbHLH13 gene-transferred transgenic tobacco (35S:: CpbHLH13) plants, we confirmed the reduction of anthocyanin contents in their inflorescence.","Wintersweet ( Chimonanthus praecox  L.) is an ornamental and economically significant shrub known for its unique flowering characteristics, especially the emission of abundant floral volatile organic compounds. Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanism of the production of these compounds is necessary to create new breeds with high volatile production. In this study, two  bHLH  transcription factors ( CpMYC2  and  CpbHLH13 ) of Wintersweet H29 were functionally characterized to illustrate their possible role in the production of volatile compounds. The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of  CpMYC2  and  CpbHLH13  increased from the flower budding to full bloom stage, indicating that these two genes may play an essential role in blooming and aroma production in wintersweet. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis revealed that the overexpression of  CpMYC2  in arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana )  AtMYC2-2  mutant (Salk_083483) and tobacco ( Nicotiana tabaccum ) genotype Petit Havana SR1 significantly increased floral volatile monoterpene, especially linalool, while the overexpression of  CpbHLH13  in  Arabidopsis thaliana  ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) and tobacco genotype SR1 increased floral sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene production in both types of transgenic plants respectively. High expression of terpene synthase (TPS) genes in transgenic  A. thaliana  along with high expression of  CpMYC2  and  CpbHLH13  in transgenic plants was also observed. The application of a combination of methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) showed an increment in linalool production in  CpMYC2 -overexpressing arabidopsis plants, and the high transcript level of TPS genes also suggested the involvement of  CpMYC2  in the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway. These results indicate that both the  CpMYC2 and CpbHLH13  transcription factors of wintersweet are possibly involved in the positive regulation and biosynthesis of monoterpene (linalool) and sesquiterpene (β-caryophyllene) in transgenic plants. This study also indicates the potential application of wintersweet as a valuable genomic material for the genetic modification of floral scent in other flowering plants that produce less volatile compounds.","['Molecular cloning', 'Functional analysis', 'Bhlh Transcription Factors', 'Volatile Production', 'Terpene Production', 'Wintersweet (Chimonanthus Praecox L.)']","['plants', 'Figure', 'plants transformed', 'Supplementary Figures', 'Transgenic Plants', 'tobacco plants', 'transformed', 'Expression', 'mutant plants', 'gene']","[CpMYC2, bHLH13  , Wintersweet H29, 5.65/68707.29, Pi/Mw, 6.43/65502.53, 429–476 amino acids, MYC, AT1G32640, AT1G01260, JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED MYC2-like2, JAM2, CmMYC2, CmbHLH13, thaliana AtbHLH13/JAM2, At1g01260, At2g46510, S5, S6, identity%, CpbHLH13, Wintersweet, Salk_083483, 2300S-Sk83, CpMYC2 plants, pCAMBIA2300S, CpbHLH13, CpMYC2, CpbHLH13, SR1, pCAMBIA2300S, β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene, pCAMBIA2300S, CpMYC2, gibberellic acid, Salk_083483, pCAMBIA2300S, 2300S-Sk83, Salk_083483, pCAMBIA2300S, 2300S-Sk83, CpMYC2 plants, CpbHLH13, CpbHLH13, pCAMBIA2300S, c, CpbHLH13]",[],['C.'],[],terpene synthase
130,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7417412\eupmc_result.json,PMC7417412,"Results Most of the  TPS-a genes in the Poaceae belong to five well-defined clades In order to identify  TPS-a genes from the Poaceae, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of terpene synthase genes that were extracted using BLASTP analysis from six grass species, including  Zea mays,  Sorghum bicolor,  Setaria italica,  Panicum virgatum,  Oryza sativa, and  Brachypodium distachyon, and a number of other monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species available in the NCBI database and the Phytozome 9.1 database (Supplemental Figure S1). In accordance with the literature (Chen et al.  2011), all obtained  TPS genes clustered into one of the established TPS subfamilies  TPS-a,  TPS-b,  TPS-c,  TPS-e,  TPS-f, and  TPS-g. The  TPS-a genes formed two groups, one containing genes from dicotyledonous species and the other containing genes of monocotyledonous species (Supplemental Figure S1, Chen et al.  2011). A deeper dendrogram analysis of the identified monocotyledonous  TPS-a genes revealed five well-defined monophyletic clades, I–V, each of which possessed exclusively  TPS-a genes from the Poaceae (Fig.  1). Two genes from  P.  virgatum were similar to clade IV and clade V sequences, but clustered separately. Four other Poaceae  TPS-a genes, from rice, sorghum, and bamboo, were found to form a very basal clade among the monocotyledonous  TPS-a subfamily, while  TPS genes from families outside the Poaceae clustered separately from the five Poaceae clades (Fig.  1). The Poaceae  TPS-a genes in clades I–V encode enzymes with distinct catalytic features A literature survey of the properties of the Poaceae  TPS-a encoded enzymes characterized to date revealed that clades I–V have distinctive catalytic features (Table  1). All previously characterized clade I enzymes are sesquiterpene synthases that accept ( E, E)-FPP as substrate and, with two exceptions, catalyze an initial C10-C1 or C11-C1 closure (Fig.  2). All characterized clade II enzymes are also sesquiterpene synthases, but produce either acyclic terpenes or cyclic terpenes derived from an initial C6-C1 closure. In contrast to the sesquiterpene synthases of clades I and II, characterized clade III enzymes mainly accept GPP as substrate and produce monoterpenes derived from an initial C6-C1 closure (Fig.  2). Moreover, most of the clade III sequences are predicted to contain a transit peptide for plastid localization, indicating that these enzymes likely function as monoterpene synthases in planta. The terpene synthases in clades IV and V, however, are diverse in terms of substrate specificity and initial cyclization reaction. The characterized enzymes in these clades form monoterpenes or sesquiterpenes, and catalyze initial C6-C1, C10-C1, or C11-C1 closures (Table  1). Characterization of TPS-a enzymes from maize and  Brachypodium distachyon To provide more information about the differences among these Poaceae  TPS-a clades, we characterized three previously unstudied  TPS-a genes from maize and two  TPS-a genes from  B.  distachyon, a species from which no TPS has been characterized so far. The selected terpene synthases belong to clade I (maize ZmTPS20-Del and ZmTPS22-Del,  B.  distachyon Bradi3g14710), clade II ( B.  distachyon Bradi3g15956), and clade III (maize ZmTPS15-B73). Genes were cloned and heterologously expressed in  E.  coli, and partially purified proteins were incubated with the potential substrates GPP and ( E, E)-FPP in the presence of 10 mM Mg 2+ as cofactor. Enzyme products were analyzed using GC–MS. The three clade I enzymes ZmTPS20-Del, ZmTPS22-Del, and Bradi3g14710 showed exclusively sesquiterpene synthase activity and produced sesquiterpenes derived by either an initial C10-C1 closure or an initial C11-C1 closure, corresponding to the properties of clade I enzymes in the literature. ZmTPS20-Del produced mainly germacrene A (C10-C1 closure), which appeared as the thermal rearrangement product β-elemene in the traces of the GC chromatograms (Fig.  3; Supplemental Figure S2). ZmTPS22-Del produced a complex mixture of sesquiterpenes with the bicyclic β-copaene (C10-C1 closure) as the major component (Fig.  3). In contrast to ZmTPS20-Del and ZmTPS22-Del, Bradi3g14710 had higher product specificity and formed ( E)-β-caryophyllene (C11-C1 closure) with trace amounts of α-humulene and germacrene A (Fig.  3). Monoterpene synthase activity with GPP was not observed for any of the three enzymes. The clade II enzyme Bradi3g15956 converted ( E, E)-FPP into β-macrocarpene and γ-macrocarpene, two bicyclic sesquiterpenes both derived by an initial C6-C1-closure (Fig.  3). GPP, however, was not accepted by Bradi3g15956 as substrate. Maize ZmTPS15-B73 showed no activity when provided with ( E, E)-FPP. However, it converted GPP into a mixture of monoterpenes dominated by the bicyclic alcohol 1,8-cineole (C6-C1 closure) (Fig.  3). Subcellular localization prediction using three different algorithms revealed the presence of an N-terminal transit peptide for plastid localization (Supplemental Figure S3), indicating that ZmTPS15-B73 likely acts as a monoterpene synthase in maize plastids. The reconstruction and characterization of TPS-a ancestor enzymes Most of the enzymes in clades I–III share clade-specific catalytic features, catalyzing either a common initial cyclization or having the same substrate specificity (Table  1; Fig.  2). To test whether these features were already pronounced in the ancestors of the different clades, we reconstructed the respective ancestor sequences, expressed the synthesized genes in  E.  coli, and tested the recombinant enzymes obtained with GPP and ( E, E)-FPP. The putative clade I ancestor showed only sesquiterpene synthase activity and produced mainly germacrene A (C10-C1) and ( E)-β-caryophyllene (C11-C1) (Figs.  2 and  4, Supplemental Figure S2). The putative clade II ancestor accepted both GPP and ( E, E)-FPP as substrate and produced mixtures of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. While the monoterpene blend was dominated by the acyclic myrcene, the major sesquiterpenes were identified as β-bisabolene and ( E)-γ-bisabolene, which are both formed via an initial C6-C1 closure (Figs.  2 and  4). In contrast to the putative ancestors of clade I and clade II, the clade III ancestor, which was expressed without the N-terminal signal peptide, possessed exclusively monoterpene synthase activity and produced the cyclic limonene (C6-C1) as its major product (Figs.  2 and  4)."," Key message Distinct catalytic features of the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily arose early in grass evolution and the reactions catalyzed have become more complex with time. The structural diversity of terpenes found in nature is mainly determined by terpene synthases (TPS). TPS enzymes accept ubiquitous prenyl diphosphates as substrates and convert them into the various terpene skeletons by catalyzing a carbocation-driven reaction. Based on their sequence similarity, terpene synthases from land plants can be divided into different subfamilies, TPS-a to TPS-h. In this study, we aimed to understand the evolution and functional diversification of the TPS-a subfamily in the Poaceae (the grass family), a plant family that contains important crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum. Sequence comparisons showed that aside from one clade shared with other monocot plants, the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily consists of five well-defined clades I-V, the common ancestor of which probably originated very early in the evolution of the grasses. A survey of the TPS literature and the characterization of representative TPS enzymes from clades I-III revealed clade-specific substrate and product specificities. The enzymes in both clade I and II function as sesquiterpene synthases with clade I enzymes catalyzing initial C10-C1 or C11-C1 ring closures and clade II enzymes catalyzing C6-C1 closures. The enzymes of clade III mainly act as monoterpene synthases, forming cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes. The reconstruction and characterization of clade ancestors demonstrated that the differences among clades I-III were already present in their ancestors. However, the ancestors generally catalyzed simpler reactions with less double-bond isomerization and fewer cyclization steps. Overall, our data indicate an early origin of key enzymatic features of TPS-a enzymes in the Poaceae, and the development of more complex reactions over the course of evolution.","['Evolution', 'Maize', 'Grasses', 'Terpene synthase', 'Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction']","['TPS-a genes', 'Poaceae TPS-a', 'genes', 'clade', 'Supplemental Figure', 'NCBI database', 'Fig.', 'Poaceae', 'TPS-a', 'clade III']","[Phytozome 9.1 database (, I–V, I–V, I–V, E, E)-FPP, C10-C1, C11-C1, V, C10-C1, C11-C1, TPS-a enzymes, ZmTPS22-Del, Bradi3g14710, clade III, E, E)-FPP, Mg 2, ZmTPS22-Del, Bradi3g14710, C10-C1, ZmTPS22-Del, C10-C1, ZmTPS20-Del, ZmTPS22-Del, Bradi3g14710, C11-C1, E, E)-FPP, E, E)-FPP, ZmTPS15-B73, TPS-a ancestor, E, E)-FPP, C10-C1, C11-C1, E, E)-FPP, N-terminal signal peptide]","['TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS-e,', 'TPS-f,', 'TPS-g.', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'ZmTPS20-Del', 'ZmTPS22-Del,', 'ZmTPS15-B73).', 'ZmTPS20-Del,', 'ZmTPS22-Del,', 'ZmTPS20-Del', 'ZmTPS22-Del', 'ZmTPS20-Del', 'ZmTPS22-Del,', 'ZmTPS15-B73', 'ZmTPS15-B73', 'TPS-a']",[],[],terpene synthase
131,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7465836\eupmc_result.json,PMC7465836,"2. Results 2.1. TF Genes in the Cucumber Genome Based on the annotated set of genes predicted from the cucumber genome ( http://www.icugi.org/cgi-bin/ICuGI/index.cgi), 1212 genes with a putative TF function of different classes were retrieved ( Figure 1). Half of all TF genes belong to only four different TF gene families, i.e., MYB (189), bHLH (149), AP2/ERF (143) and C2H2 zinc fingers (131). Furthermore, among the 1212 TF genes there are 84 genes encoding NAC domain proteins, 73 genes encoding bZIP (basic-leucine zipper domain) proteins and 67 genes encoding WRKYs. In addition, there are 10 TF gene families with less than 50 members each, including MADS (41 genes), GRAS (37 genes), WTHT (33 genes), TCP (27 genes), GATA (26 genes), NF-Y (26 genes), ZF-TF (22 genes), ARF (20 genes), HOX (17 genes) and 99 putative TFs that do not belong to any of the above TF families. 2.2. Cucumber Genes Responsive to Spider-Mite Feeding Previously, using an RNA-seq approach, we identified 2348 genes that were differentially expressed between spider mite-infested and non-infested plants of two genotypes of cucumber, accession Chinese long with bitter and accession Corona with non-bitter foliage [ 44]. All DEGs were organized into four groups based on their expression at different time points after feeding ( Figure 2). In group I, gene expression increased during the period of feeding in both accessions whereas group IV contained genes for which expression decreased in both accessions. Groups II and III include those genes for which transcripts remained more or less unaltered in Chinese long but increased (group II) or decreased (group III) in Corona after spider-mite feeding. Statistical analysis showed that both duration of feeding and the genotype had significant effects on the transcript abundance of genes and there was a significant interaction between both factors in three of the four groups of genes ( Figure 2). We used this collection of DEGs as a data set to identify TFs that play a role in both positive and negative early responses towards two-spotted spider mites in cucumber. We compared our results with the transcriptional response of cucumber towards the pathogen  Pseudoperonospora cubensis downy mildew as described by Adhikari, et al. [ 45] to study similarities and differences in the involvement of TFs in the response of cucumber to these two different biotic stresses ([ 44],  Table 1). 2.3. Regulation of TF Expression in Response to Spider-Mite Herbivory Out of the 1212 TF-encoding genes ( Figure 1), transcription of 119 was differentially regulated by spider-mite feeding, of which 60 were generally upregulated (in group I and group II DEGs) and 59 were downregulated (in groups III and IV). The distribution of the number of genes in the different groups of DEGs over the TF gene families was analyzed ( Table 1) to discover general trends in the expression of these genes. Groups I and II, both representing increased gene transcript levels after spider-mite feeding, included five MYBs. In contrast, seven MYBs were present in group III and two in group IV, which both represent genes for which transcription is repressed by spider-mite feeding. TF genes of the bHLH family were almost equally distributed over the four groups, with 4 to 6 genes in each of the groups. Most of the ERF TF genes were included in group I (4) and group II (13) and displayed increased transcription upon spider-mite feeding, while seven ERF genes displayed decreasing transcription, six in group III and one in group IV. Most of the WRKY genes were assigned to group III or group IV, and thus displayed decreasing transcription in response to spider-mite feeding. Taken together it seems that ERFs and WRKYs were preferentially up- and downregulated by spider-mite herbivory, respectively, while MYBs and bHLHs were about equally up- and downregulated. The other TF families were basically randomly distributed over the four groups of DEGs ( Table 1). As the WRKY, AP2/ERF, bHLH and MYB TF genes were most responsive to spider mites and were also reported to encode important TFs in plant defense [ 20], we made a more detailed analysis of their expression pattern during early spider-mite feeding ( Figure 3). Expression of MYBs and bHLHs during the first three days after the onset of spider-mite feeding was equally up- and downregulated ( Figure 3), obviously corresponding to their classification in the DEG self-organizing maps ( Figure 1). Most of the AP2/ERFs were found to be upregulated after spider-mite feeding, particularly in Corona. The majority of WRKYs were found in group III and thus were suppressed by spider-mite feeding. However,  Figure 3 shows that expression of most of the WRKYs actually increased on the first or second day of spider-mite feeding before transcripts were downregulated on the third day. 2.4. TF Genes Most Strongly Influenced by Spider-Mite Feeding Spider-mite feeding resulted in differential expression of TF genes in both directions. The relative transcript abundance of a putative bHLH gene (Csa3M002860) increased about 20-fold (log 2Ration ≈ 4.4) one day after the onset of spider-mite feeding compared to transcription in non-infested leaves making it the most strongly affected TF gene in spider mite-infested cucumber leaves. Although the absolute abundance of the transcripts of this TF gene decreased on days 2 and 3, expression was still about 14- and 10-fold higher than in non-infested plants, respectively ( Figure 4). A similar pattern was found for a MYB TF gene, Csa6M121970, with the strongest induction (18-fold) on day 1, and about 7- and 6-fold higher compared with non-infested plants on succeeding days. The other putative TF genes that are depicted in the right panel of  Figure 4 have the strongest induction of expression on different days, but all belong to the ten most upregulated TFs. This group includes three ERFs. In contrast, the two strongest downregulated TF genes belong to the bHLH family ( Figure 4, left panel). Transcription of the bHLH TF gene, Csa3M850530, first increased slightly after one day of feeding and subsequently decreased to approximately half the amount of transcripts of non-infested leaves on day 2 and to 8% (log 2Ration ≈ 3.6) on day 3. Expression of the bHLH TF gene, Csa7M452040, showed a similar pattern, resulting in a decrease in transcripts to 10% (log 2Ratio ≈ 3.3) compared to non-infested plants after three days. The expression of the ten strongest suppressed TF genes decreased mainly on day 3 and this category includes three MYBs. 2.5. Co-Expression of TF Genes with Defense-Related Genes Co-expression analysis between TF genes and genes involved in the biosynthesis of defense-related metabolites may give insight in their regulatory relationships. As we have particular interest in genes and pathways that are involved in biosynthesis of compounds within the herbivory-induced volatile blend that is of importance for attraction of natural enemies of spider mites, we focused on the expression profiles of a gene encoding a lipoxygenase (LOX) which may be involved in green leaf volatile [ 46, 47] and/or JA biosynthesis [ 48] and two genes encoding terpene synthases (TPS) that synthesize multiple mono- and sesquiterpenes and were found to be induced upon spider-mite feeding [ 44]. Furthermore, we included a gene encoding an UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT),  CsUGT, putatively involved in the glycosylation of secondary metabolites [ 49] and a gene encoding a sucrose transporter (SUT),  CsSUT, both of which were selected as representatives of the genes downregulated by spider-mite feeding. In addition to the gene expression patterns detected in response to spider-mite herbivory, expression profiles of these genes after infection with downy mildew [ 45] and in different organs of unchallenged plants [ 12] were included to analyze co-expression relationships with the 119 selected TF genes that show differential expression upon spider-mite herbivory. Hierarchical clustering of these genes was analyzed using Genemaths ( www.applied-maths.com) based on log 2-transformed and mean-centered expression data [ 44]. Distances between genes and clusters and significance of co-expression were calculated based on Pearson correlation and UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean). We found that the TF genes most closely co-expressed with  LOX ( p = 0.05) are a  HOX, two  bZIPs and two  MYBs ( Figure 5). Both spider mite-induced  TPSs closely co-expressed with each other and with a  bHLH, a  MYB and an  ERF ( p = 0.04). Furthermore, although not significantly, three other  MYBs, a  NAC, a  TFIIIC and a  TCP, co-expressed with both  TPS genes more than other TF genes ( p = 0.08).  CsUGT and  CsSUT co-expressed with an  ERF, a  bHLH, a  MYB and a  WRKY ( p = 0.05) ( Figure 5). In addition, the strongest induced TF, i.e.,  MYC ( Csa3M002860) co-expressed with a gene encoding DXS (1-DEOXY-D-XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE), and eight other genes that encode proteins with unknown functions ( Figure S1). All these genes were upregulated during spider-mite feeding, especially in accession Corona. Seven genes co-expressed with the most strongly suppressed TF  bHLH ( Csa3M002860), however protein functions of these genes are mostly unknown except for one gene that encodes a putative lyase. 2.6. Motifs in Promoters of Defense-Related Genes The binding motifs in the promoter regions of spider mite-inducible  CsLOX,  CsTPS9 and spider mite-suppressed  CsUGT and  CsSUT were analyzed to obtain more hints for possible regulators. Multiple motifs were found in each of the promoters by aligning the sequences to PlantCARE, the database of plant  cis-acting regulatory elements [ 50]. There were 32 non-redundant elements in the promoter of  CsLOX, 35 in the promoter of  CsTPS9, and 24 and 30 in the promoters of  CsUGT and  CsSUT, respectively ( Figure 6). Thirteen elements were present in all four promoters, including motifs HSE, circadian, Box I, G-box, TTC-rich repeats, CGTCA-motif, AAGAA-motif, TATA-box, CAAT-box, and three unnamed motifs ( Figure 6). The promoters of the upregulated genes,  CsLOX and  CsTPS9, shared an AE-box, an MBS (MYB Binding Sites) and a motif with unknown function, while there was no common motif shared by the promoters of the downregulated  CsSUT and  CsUGT. Every one of these promoters also had multiple specific motifs which were not present in the other three.","To gain insight into the regulatory networks that underlie the induced defense in cucumber against spider mites, genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) were identified in the cucumber (Cucumissativus) genome and their regulation by two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychusurticae) herbivory was analyzed using RNA-seq. Of the total 1212 annotated TF genes in the cucumber genome, 119 were differentially regulated upon spider-mite herbivory during a period of 3 days. These TF genes belong to different categories but the MYB, bHLH, AP2/ERF and WRKY families had the highest relative numbers of differentially expressed genes. Correlation analysis of the expression of TF genes with defense-associated genes during herbivory and pathogen infestation, and in different organs resulted in the putative identification of regulators of herbivore-induced terpenoid and green-leaf-volatile biosynthesis. Analysis of the cis-acting regulatory elements (CAREs) present in the promoter regions of the genes responsive to spider-mite feeding revealed potential TF regulators. This study describes the TF genes in cucumber that are potentially involved in the regulation of induced defense against herbivory by spider mites.","['Promoter', 'Transcription factor', 'Cucumber', 'Cis-acting Regulatory Elements', 'Spider Mite']","['Genes', 'Spider-Mite Feeding', 'Figure', 'Spider-Mite', 'gene', 'Feeding', 'group', 'group III', 'expression', 'groups']","[TF, MYB, bHLH (149), AP2/ERF (143), TF, bZIP, WRKYs, TF, MADS (41 genes, TCP (27, NF-Y, ZF-TF (, ARF, HOX (17 genes, Spider-Mite, TF, Spider-Mite, WRKY, WRKYs, bHLHs, WRKY, AP2/ERF, bHLH, MYB TF, bHLHs, DEG, WRKYs, WRKYs, TF, Spider-Mite, TF, Csa3M002860, 3, MYB TF, Csa6M121970, TF, Csa3M850530, Csa7M452040, TF, herbivory-induced, LOX, UDP-glycosyltransferase, UGT, sucrose transporter, SUT, downy mildew, Arithmetic, TF, TF, TF, Csa3M002860, 1-DEOXY-D-XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE, TF  , PlantCARE, Box I, G-box, TTC-rich, AAGAA-motif, TATA-box, CAAT-box, AE-box, MBS, MYB]","['(TPS)', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'CsTPS9', 'CsTPS9,', 'CsTPS9,']",[],[],terpene synthase

EOs Chemical Composition In  M. alternifolia EO, 51 chemical constituents were identified, accounting for 96.3% of the entire oil components, while 24 constituents were identified in  C. reticulata EO, accounting for 99.9% of the whole oil. The most abundant constituent of  M. alternifolia EO was 1,8-cineole (22.4%), followed by 4-terpineol (17.6%), α-terpineol, δ-cadinene and α-terpinene, whereas limonene (83.6%) was the main chemical compound in  C. reticulata EO ( Table 2). Monoterpene hydrocarbons constituted the most abundant class of compounds in  C. reticulata EO (90.4%), while oxygenated monoterpenes (45.9%) represented the main chemical class of  M. alternifolia EO ( Table 2). 3.2. Behavioral Assays The tests performed by the two-way olfactometer showed that both EOs exerted a repellent or attractive effect against  D. suzukii adults, depending on the concentration: at the highest EO tested concentration, a significant repellent effect was observed, while at lower concentrations we observed a significant attractive effect. In general, the repellence increased together with the increment in the EO concentration, and the attractiveness with the decrease in the concentration of the EOs ( Figure 3). The repellence activity was observed at 23.87 mL L −1 for  C. reticulata EO ( χ2 = 6.533,  p = 0.011), and at 23.87, and 2.39 mL L −1 for  M. alternifolia EO ( χ2 = 19.200,  p < 0.001;  χ2 = 6.533,  p = 0.011, respectively) ( Figure 3). A significant attractive effect was instead observed at 0.6 and 1.19, mL L −1 for both  C. reticulata ( χ2 = 6.119,  p = 0.013;  χ2 = 11.267,  p = 0.001, and  χ2 = 13.067,  p < 0.001, respectively) and  M. alternifolia ( χ2 = 17.067,  p < 0.001;  χ2 = 17.067,  p < 0.001, and  χ2 = 18.458,  p < 0.001, respectively) EOs. No significant effect was observed at intermediate concentrations of 2.39 and 1.79 µL L −1 ( χ2 = 2.133,  p = 0.011;  χ2 = 3.379,  p = 0.069, respectively) for  C. reticulata, and 1.79 µL L −1 ( χ2 = 0.267,  p = 0.606) for  M. alternifolia EOs. In accordance with the results obtained in the two-way olfactometer tests,  C. reticulata and  M. alternifolia EOs exhibited different action also on the oviposition activity of  D. suzukii, depending on the concentration at which they were tested ( Figure 4). Overall, one-way ANCOVA showed no significant difference between the oviposition deterrence activity of  C. reticulata and  M. alternifolia EOs after controlling for the effects of the EO dose (F 1, 160 = 0.553;  p = 0.458; η p2 = 0.003) with margin means (estimated at = 0.41 µL L −1 air) of 22.17 ± 7.78 and 31.23 ± 9.32 µL L −1 air, for  C. reticulata and  M. alternifolia EOs, respectively. However,  M. alternifolia EO showed a stronger correlation between concentration and oviposition deterrence than the  C. reticulata one ( M. alternifolia r = 0.790,  p = 0.006;  C. reticulata r = 0.622,  p = 0.055). Moreover,  M. alternifolia EO showed a complete oviposition deterrence starting from 2.8 µL L −1 air;  C. reticulata EO, instead, was able to exert only 75% of inhibition of the oviposition at the highest dose tested of 4.2 µL L −1 air ( Figure 4). 3.3. Sensorial Analysis of EOs Treated Fruit With the exception of cherries ( Table 3), during the observation period the color of fruits did not change as a consequence of dipping treatment (data not shown). On the other hand, when cherries were dipped in  C. reticulata or  M. alternifolia EO solutions, the lightness ( L*) significantly increased in comparison with both control samples, and the  M. alternifolia EO solution induced a significant color change, also in terms of the increasing of blue-yellow ( b*) components ( Table 3), thus indicating a rapid browning of the treated fruits. Furthermore, when the metric distances among the chromatic coordinates were calculated referring to both controls ( Table 4), the cherries dipped in  C. reticulata showed small color differences, while the color of cherries dipped in  M. alternifolia EO solution was completely different (6 <  ΔEab* < 12). Based on the ANOVA calculated for all quantitative ( Table 5) and hedonic ( Table 6) parameters evaluated during tasting sessions, differences highlighted for both quantitative and hedonic parameters were significant for most of them, with the formulation of dipping solution recorded as the main effect. When a new formulation is explored, the level of hedonic quality expressed by the new product is fundamental in determining its consumer acceptability [ 52]; therefore, despite the panel test being performed by trained judges, some hedonic parameters related to the overall pleasantness and quality of smell were also evaluated ( Table 6) to collect some preliminary indications about the organoleptic appeal of the different treatments. In this context, both controls for each fruit showed the highest values of hedonic parameters in terms of overall pleasantness and frankness, thus indicating that the influence of Tween 80, used for dipping, on the sensorial expression of treated fruits was negligible. On the contrary, the dipping in both the EOs solutions (1%) showed an evident impact on the fruit sensorial expression. The fruits dipped in  M. alternifolia EO solution were characterized by the worst smell profile, due to the highest number of off-flavors ( Figure 5) perceived. Namely, the smell profile developed in the presence of  M. alternifolia EO was so negative that all the treated fruits were defined as “not suitable for tasting” by panelists ( Table 6), determining the lowest values of all the hedonic parameters. On the contrary, the strawberry and blueberry dipped in  C. reticulata EO maintained an Overall Hedonic Index around the acceptability limit fixed at OHI = 5 ( Figure 6).","The essential oils extracted from mandarin ( Citrus reticulata  Blanco) fruits, and from tea tree ( Maleleuca alternifolia  (Maiden and Betche) Cheel) leaves have been chemically analyzed and tested for their bioactivity against  D. suzukii . Besides, to estimate consumers' acceptability of the essential oil (EO) treatments, we evaluated their impact on the organoleptic characteristics of the EO-treated fruits. The main chemical constituents of the two EOs were 1,8-cineole and 4-terpineol for  M. alternifolia  (22.4% and 17.6% of the total components, respectively), and limonene (83.6% of the total components) for  C. reticulata . The behavioral tests indicate that the two EOs are able to deter  D. suzukii  oviposition and that  D. suzukii  shows positive chemotaxis to low concentrations of the EOs and negative chemotaxis when the EO concentration increases. While no negative effects on the organoleptic profiles were detected for fruits treated with  C. reticulata  EO, the olfactory profile of fruits treated with  M. alternifolia  EO was so negative that they were defined as ""not suitable for consumption"" by panellists. Overall, our findings indicate that the use of EOs for the post-harvest protection of small fruits is feasible, provided that the essential oils are selected not only for their bioactivity against the insect pest but also for their affinity with the consumers' sensorial system.","['Tea tree', 'Attractiveness', 'Mandarin', 'Repellence', 'Oviposition Deterrence', 'Spotted-wing Drosophila', 'Organoleptic Profile']","['alternifolia', 'reticulata', 'alternifolia EOs', 'Table', 'EOs', 'Figure', 'significant', 'hedonic', 'hedonic parameters', 'showed']","[α-terpineol, −1, −1, −1, 17.067, 17.067, −1, −1, µL L −1, ±, µL L −1, −1, µL L −1, cherries, “, ”]",[],"['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']",[],NaN

Generation of RNAi Mediated Knock Down Line of Limonene Synthase Gene in Spearmint We identified and cloned the limonene synthase gene  MsLS from the previously published RNA seq data of spearmint PGT from our lab [ 35]. Full length ORF of  MsLS was cloned from mint PGT cDNA and found 98 percent similar to the previously reported LS gene (L13459) ( Figure S1) [ 27]. The gene was functionally characterized in vitro to test its ability to produce limonene from GDP.  MsLS was cloned into pDEST-6His using gateway cloning system and expressed in  E. coli BL21(DE3). Recombinant MsLS was purified using HisPurTM Ni-NTA spin purification kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Singapore) The purified protein was then used to assay for production of limonene from GDP in vitro. The products were analyzed by GC-MS based on a comparison of retention times and mass spectra of limonene standard. Results showed that incubation of MsLS with GDP produced limonene ( Figure 1A).  No terpenes were detected when MsLS was incubated with farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). With the aim to reduce flux into the native limonene biosynthesis pathway,  MsLS RNAi lines were generated. Of the seven independent transgenic lines confirmed by southern blot, three had single insertion of T-DNA ( Figure 2A). Six out of the seven lines showed a significant reduction in  MsLS expression when compared to WT ranging from 65 to 98% as determined by qRT-PCR ( Figure 2B). No phenotypic difference was observed in the  MsLS RNAi lines and they appeared similar to wild type plants. The comparison of MsLS RNAi lines and WT was based on observable characteristic of both the plants, such as plant height, leaf size and shape, growth rate etc. 2.2. Silencing of MsLS Reduces Monoterpene Production and Affects Flux into Other Metabolic Pathways Three lines (2,4 and 5) with significant reduction in the expression of  MsLS were chosen for further study. Single quadrupole GC-MS analysis was performed on young leaves (2–3 cm) to analyze the effect on production of monoterpenes upon  MsLS suppression.  Peaks were identified based on comparison of the mass spectra with authentic standards. All the three lines exhibited substantial decrease in both limonene and carvone production, ranging from 96% to 99% for limonene and 67% to 91% for carvone, when compared to WT respectively ( Figure 3A). Although the MEP and MVA pathway are well separated there are studies that indicate a crosstalk between the two pathways. The MVA pathway is mainly responsible for the formation of sesquiterpenes and phytosterols. To identify changes in metabolites on a larger scale an untargeted GC- and LC-QTOF-MS analysis was performed on the three  MsLS RNAi lines.  The major sesquiterpene observed in the spearmint variety are caryophyllene,  cis-β-farnesene,  cis-muurola-4(15), 5-diene and germacrene D. Single quadrupole GC-MS analysis revealed that all the three  MsLS RNAi lines showed increase in total amount of sesquiterpenes ranging from 38% to 96% when compared to WT ( Figure 3B). Additionally, GC-QTOF-MS showed an increase in phytosterols namely stigmasterol and sitosterol ranging from 55% to 65% when compared to WT ( Figure 4). An increase in sesquiterpenes and phytosterols indicate an increase in flux towards the MVA pathway upon suppression of the native monoterpene pathway. Further GC and LC–QTOF-MS analysis, showed an increase in the total amounts of fatty acids ranging from 40 % to 55 %, and in flavonoids and phenolic metabolites ranging from 65% to 85 % in all the three  MsLS RNAi lines when compared to WT respectively ( Figure 4 and  Figure S2).  Table 1 and  Table 2 list the various metabolites, which were found significantly increased upon  MsLS suppression. The MEP pathway is localized in the plastids, which is also the site for shikimate and fatty acid pathways. All the three pathways share phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate as common biosynthetic precursors derived from primary metabolism. Our results indicate that alteration of MEP pathway in spearmint also affects the production of metabolites from the other two pathways present in the plastids. 2.3. Expression of Heterologous TPSs in MsLS RNAi Background Among the seven  MsLS RNAi lines, line 4 was chosen for introduction of the heterologous terpene synthases, namely  MsLS RNAi4.  MsLS RNAi4 was a single T-DNA insertion line and showed significant reduction in  MsLS expression and endogenous monoterpene accumulation. The three heterozygous monoterpene synthases (TPSs), linalool synthase (PaLinS) and myrcene synthase (PaMyrS) from  Picea abies and geraniol synthase (CoGerS) from  Cananga odorata (ylang-ylang) were introduced into the  MsLS RNAi4 individually. At least 6 transgenic lines were generated for each TPS. They were characterized by southern blotting and analyzed for individual TPS expression by qRT-PCR ( Figures S3 and S4). Three independent single insertion lines with high TPS expression were advanced for further characterization for each TPS gene. Compared to MsLS RNAi4 with plant growth rate, plant height, leaf size and leaf shape, no observable differences were observed in analyzed transgenic lines expressing PaMyrS, CoGerS and PaLinS. 2.4. Metabolite Profiling of Transgenic Lines Expressing Heterologous TPSs in MsLS RNAi4 Reveals Complex Metabolism of Introduced Monoterpenes Three independent lines expressing linalool synthase (PaLinS), myrcene synthase (PaMyrS) and geraniol synthase (CoGerS) respectively were propagated and maintained for the purpose of metabolite profiling. As monoterpenes are known to be further metabolized to nonvolatile derivatives, methanol extract of leaves of transgenic plants were also analyzed by LC–QTOF-MS in negative mode and positive mode in an untargeted approach to identify derivatives of introduced monoterpenes.  GC-QTOF-MS analysis of three lines expressing geraniol synthase (CoGerS) revealed the presence of geraniol related compounds such geranyl isovalerate, nerolidyl propionate, geranyl hexanoate, geranyl oleate, geranyl palmitate and geranyl acetate but at low levels (up to 5% in the presence of a high sample matrix background). These compounds were not found in WT or  MsLS RNAi lines. LC-QTOF-MS analysis revealed the presence of geraniol glycosides which were putatively identified as malonyl–hexosyl geraniol dimer, malonyl hexosyl geranic acid dimer and hexosyl hydroxy geranic acid. Loganin, an iridoid was also observed ( Table 3 and  Figure S5). Geraniol is a known precursor metabolite of the monoterpenoid iridoid pathway. The above data indicates towards the bioconversion of geraniol by spearmint endogenous enzymes to many different compounds. Further LC-MS/MS of geraniol standard at series of different concentrations was performed to establish a calibration curve. The total amount of geraniol derivatives was quantified based on the relative response factor. With this method the amount of total geraniol derivatives ( Figure 5A) observed ranged from 0.6 ng/g to 0.85 ng/g.  GC-QTOF-MS analysis of three lines expressing linalool synthase (PaLinS) detected no significant amount of free linalool or volatile linalool derivatives in them. LC-QTOF-MS analysis showed the presence of glycosylated non-volatile derivatives of linalool, which were putatively identified as linalool-3-glucoside, and linalyl β- d-glucopyranoside. A linalool ester was also observed which was putatively identified as linalool butyrate ( Table 3 and  Figure S6). Further LC-MS/MS of linalool standard at different concentrations was performed to establish a calibration curve and linalool derivatives were quantified based on the relative response. With this method the amount of total linalool derivatives ( Figure 5B) observed in the three lines ranged from 0.5 ng/g to 0.8 ng/g. Three lines expressing myrcene synthase were analyzed by GC-QTOF-MS but no significant amount of free myrcene or volatile myrcene derivatives were found. LC-QTOF-MS analysis showed the presence of non-volatile derivatives of myrcene which were putatively identified as myrcenyl acetate and dimethyl-3-oxopentane-1-5-diyl dibenzoate ( Table 3 and  Figure S7). LC-MS/MS of myrcene standard at different concentrations was performed and myrcene derivative levels were quantified based on the relative response factor of the standard and derivatives. With this method the amount of total myrcene derivatives ( Figure 5C) observed in the three lines ranged from 0.4 ng/g to 0.6 ng/g. Of all the introduced monoterpenes geraniol showed the maximum number of derivatives and myrcene the least. The above results showed complex metabolism of introduced heterologous monoterpene by endogenous enzymes of spearmint. Principal component analysis was performed between WT and  MsLS RNAi4 LC-MS data sets and between  MsLS RNAi4 and CoGerS, PalinS and PaMyrS lines individually. The PCA ( Figure 6A–D) score plot showed the distribution of the metabolites between the respective groups. The PCA analysis for WT and  MsLS RNAi4 showed two principal components which accounted for 50.6% and 49.4% of the variation with Eigen values for PC1 (3.00) and PC2 (1.78) in the spectral data respectively. For  MsLS RNAi4 and CoGerS line two principal components accounted for 44.1% and 30.3% of variation with Eigen values as PC1 (2.22) and PC2 (1.52).  MsLS RNAi4 and PalinS line showed two principal components accounting for 32.9% and 23.7% variation with Eigen values as PC1 (2.43) and PC2 (1.65). For  MsLS RNAi4 and PaMyrS line, two principal components accounted for 52.6% and 32.4% of the variation, with Eigen values are PC1 (5.06) and PC2 (3.06) respectively. Based on these results, we can now detect the distribution of metabolites whose levels are abundant between the groups. The positive values strengthen the evidence of differences between samples groups, negative values argue against. Thus, the PCA score plots showed a visible discrimination along the PC1 and PC2 explaining the variation of the data.","Spearmint produces and stores large amounts of monoterpenes, mainly limonene and carvone, in glandular trichomes and is the major natural source of these compounds. Towards producing heterologous monoterpenes in spearmint, we first reduced the flux into the native limonene pathway by knocking down the expression of limonene synthase ( MsLS ) by RNAi method. The  MsLS  RNAi lines exhibited a huge reduction in the synthesis of limonene and carvone. Detailed GC-MS and LC-MS analysis revealed that  MsLS  RNAi plants also showed an increase in sesquiterpene, phytosterols, fatty acids, flavonoids, and phenolic metabolites, suggesting an interaction between the MEP, MVA shikimate and fatty acid pathways in spearmint. Three different heterologous monoterpene synthases namely, linalool synthase and myrcene synthase from  Picea abies  and geraniol synthase from  Cananga odorata  were cloned and introduced independently into the  MsLS  RNAi mutant background. The expression of these heterologous terpene synthases resulted mainly in production of monoterpene derivatives. Of all the introduced monoterpenes geraniol showed the maximum number of derivatives. Our results provide new insights into MEP pathway interactions and regulation and reveals the existence of mechanisms for complex metabolism of monoterpenes in spearmint.","['Secondary metabolites', 'Derivatives', 'metabolic engineering', 'terpenes', 'Limonene Synthase', 'Pathway Flux Analyses']","['MsLS', 'Figure', 'lines', 'MsLS RNAi', 'RNAi lines', 'lines expressing', 'showed', 'derivatives', 'Synthase', 'geraniol']","[Line, LS, L13459, pDEST-6His, MsLS, HisPurTM Ni-NTA, kit, MsLS, MsLS, farnesylpyrophosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPP, MsLS RNAi, MsLS, GC-QTOF-MS, LC–, MsLS, PaLinS, PaMyrS, MsLS RNAi4, PaMyrS, CoGerS, PaLinS., MsLS RNAi4, PaLinS, PaMyrS, LC–, malonyl–hexosyl geraniol, S5, PaLinS, GC-QTOF-MS, myrcenyl acetate, dimethyl-3-oxopentane-1-5-diyl dibenzoate, CoGerS, PalinS, PaMyrS lines, PC2 (1.78), CoGerS line, PC2 (1.52), PalinS line, PC2 (1.65), PaMyrS line, PC2 (3.06), PC2]","['TPSs', '(TPSs),', 'TPS.', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs']",[],[],terpene synthase

Cheese was produced every month over a year using nonstandardized milk consisting of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% Jersey milk in Holstein-Friesian milk in a 100-L vat. Actual, theoretical, and moisture-adjusted yield increased linearly with percentage of Jersey milk. This was also associated with increased fat and protein recoveries and lower yield of whey. The composition of whey was also affected by the percentage of Jersey milk, with lower whey protein and higher whey lactose and solids. Cutting time was lower when Jersey milk was used, but the cutting to milling time was higher because of slower acidity development. Hence, overall cheesemaking time was not affected by the use of Jersey milk. Using Jersey milk increased cheese fat content in autumn, winter, and spring and decreased cheese moisture in spring and summer. Cheese protein, salt, and pH levels were not affected. Cheese was analyzed for texture and color, and it was professionally graded at 3 and 8mo. The effect of Jersey on cheese sensory quality was an increase in cheese yellowness during summer and a higher total grading score at 3mo in winter; no other difference in cheese quality was found.

135,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7582308\eupmc_result.json,PMC7582308,"2. Results 2.1. Identification of Candidate GES Genes from the D. officinale Genome From  D. officinale genomic annotation data, three candidate GES sequences with best matches to known GES proteins [ 6, 12, 13, 15] were retrieved by BLASTN, and named DoGES1, DoGES2, and DoGES3 ( Table S1). Multiple sequence alignment demonstrated that three DoGES proteins had highly conserved aspartate-rich motifs (DDxxD) and NSE/DTE motifs at the  C-terminal, and an RRX 8W domain at the  N-terminal ( Figure 2), suggesting that DoGES1-3 were all TPSs. Among them, DDxxD and NSE/DTE were essential for the cofactor Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ to catalyze the synthesis of monoterpenes [ 18, 19], and the RRX 8W domain was also involved in the cyclization of monoterpene synthase [ 20]. 2.2. Phylogenetic Analysis of DoGES Proteins in the D. officinale Genome To investigate the evolutionary relationship of DoGES proteins with other reported GES proteins, a phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method ( Figure 3;  Table S2). All three DoGES proteins clustered in the TPS-b subfamily, which is specific to angiosperms and is responsible for encoding monoterpene synthases [ 21]. Based on the transcription levels in different tissues (roots, stems, leaves, and flowers),  DoGES1 exhibited high expression in flowers, while  DoGES2 and  DoGES3 were mainly expressed in roots and leaves, respectively ( Figure S1). Consequently, DoGES1 was selected for our candidate study gene related to floral scent formation. 2.3. Molecular Cloning and Analysis of DoGES1 from D. officinale Flowers RNA isolated from  D. officinale flowers during the blossoming period were used as template and amplified via nested PCR. Full-length cDNA sequences of  DoGES1 have a 1749-bp long open reading frame (ORF) that encodes 582 amino acids with a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.34 and a molecular weight of 67.99 kDa ( Figure S2). The DoGES1 sequence was submitted to GenBank Data Libraries under accession number MT875214. The DoGES1 secondary structure, which was determined using the SOPMA program ( http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/), shows that it harbors 69.24% α-helixes, 23.37% random coils, 3.78% β-turns, and 3.61% extended strands. The Chlorop 1.1 tool predicted that DoGES1 contains a 34 amino acid long  N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide. To determine the subcellular localization of DoGES1, three subcellular localization tools (AtSubP [ 22], Plant-mPLoc [ 23], and pLoc-mPlant [ 24]) were used. All of them demonstrated that DoGES1 was located in chloroplasts, and was thus likely a mono-TPS in the MEP-pathway, but not in the cytosolic MVA pathway. 2.4. Subcellular Localization of DoGES1 To confirm the intracellular localization of DoGES1, pSAT6-EYFP-DoGES1 was transformed to the mesophyll protoplasts of 4-week-old  Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Yellow fluorescent signals were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The images indicate that DoGES1 was located in chloroplasts ( Figure 4), similar to  LiTPS2, which encodes a mono-TPS in lily ( Lilium longiflorum ‘Siberia’) [ 25], indicating that DoGES1 may be responsible for monoterpene synthesis. 2.5. Functional Characterization of Enzyme Encoded by DoGES1 in Escherichia coli To investigate whether DoGES1 encodes an enzyme that can produce monoterpenes, the full-length ORF sequence of DoGES1 was subcloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a, expressed in  E. coli BL21 (DE3), and induced by 1 mM isopropyl-β- d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Recombinant pET-32a-DoGES1 proteins were purified using affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA agarose column, and were identified and isolated with a single band matching the expected size of DoGES1 in an SDS-PAGE gel ( Figure S3). After incubation with GPP as substrate for the synthesis of monoterpenes, recombinant DoGES1 proteins successfully yielded geraniol with two characteristic fragment  m/ z 69 and  m/ z 41 in mass spectra produced by GC–MS ( Figure 5), which showed the same mass spectral features of the authentic standard, geraniol. In addition, geraniol was not detected among the protein extracts from an empty vector cell mixture ( Figure 5). These results suggest that DoGES1 from  D. officinale had the capacity to specifically catalyze the formation of geraniol. Consequently, DoGES1 was classified as a geraniol synthase. 2.6. Ectopic Expression of DoGES1 in N. benthamiana We ectopically expressed  DoGES1 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in  N. benthamiana leaves. Positive transgenic leaves were screened by PCR for the presence of the  DoGES1 gene.  DoGES1 was not detected in 6-week-old  N. benthamiana leaves transformed with the empty vector pCAMBIA3300, while the positively transformed  N. benthamiana leaves were selected for subsequent analysis as a result of the high transcription levels of  DoGES1. As expected, a large amount of geraniol was produced in  N. benthamiana leaves overexpressing  DoGES1 3 days after treatment, whereas geraniol was not observed in the control group ( Figure 6). Therefore,  DoGES1 seemed to be a single-product enzyme that contributed to the biosynthesis of geraniol. 2.7. Temporal-Spatial Expression Patterns Analysis of DoGES1 in D. officinale To clarify the expression patterns of  DoGES1 in  D. officinale, different tissues (roots, stems, leaves, and flowers), developmental stages of flowers (budding, semi-open flowers, fully open flowers), flower organs (petal, gynostemium, and labellum), and flower harvest times (8:00, 11:00, 14:00, and 17:00) were measured using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qRCR). The results indicate that  DoGES1 exhibited the highest transcription levels in flowers, followed by stems, while the roots and the leaves displayed a relatively low level ( Figure 7A). As flowers developed, the expression levels of  DoGES1 mRNA also varied.  DoGES1 was slightly expressed in the bud stage, expression increased enormously in semi-open flowers where it peaked, and dropped notably in the fully open flowers ( Figure 7B). Among different flower organs,  DoGES1 expression was 4.77- and 12.29-fold higher in petals than in the gynostemium or labellum, respectively ( Figure 7C). A comparison of  DoGES1 expression at specific times of the day showed that  DoGES1 showed higher expression at 11:00 than at 8:00, 14:00, and 17:00 ( Figure 7D). Furthermore, geraniol content fluctuated among the harvest time points (from 8:00 to 17:00), with a trend of first increasing and then decreasing; the highest amount was observed at 14:00 ( Figure S4). Thus,  DoGES1 was upregulated at first, then downregulated and possessed the highest value at 11:00, corresponding to the increase and then decrease in geraniol content at the same harvest time points (from 8:00 to 17:00). These results suggest that floral monoterpenes, such as geraniol encoded by  DoGES1, might originate from petals and are emitted at 14:00, with a considerably high release during the budding stage in  D. officinale flowers. 2.8. Activation of DoGES1 Gene Expression in Response to Methyl Jasmonate Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which is involved in responses to various stresses, regulates terpene metabolism [ 26]. To explore the response of the  DoGES1 gene after the application of MeJA,  DoGES1 transcript levels were quantified by qRT-PCR. Compared to the non-treated control,  DoGES1 was significantly upregulated between 2.41- and 21.49-fold, with the highest expression at 3 h after MeJA treatment ( Figure 8A). Furthermore, a significant increase ( p < 0.05) in geraniol was induced by MeJA, increasing by 243.47% ( Figure 8B). This finding suggests the involvement of  DoGES1 in the MeJA-dependent biosynthesis of geraniol.","Floral scent is a key ornamental trait that determines the quality and commercial value of orchids. Geraniol, an important volatile monoterpene in orchids that attracts pollinators, is also involved in responses to stresses but the geraniol synthase (GES) responsible for its synthesis in the medicinal orchid  Dendrobium officinale  has not yet been identified. In this study, three potential geraniol synthases were mined from the  D. officinale  genome. DoGES1, which was localized in chloroplasts, was characterized as a geraniol synthase.  DoGES1  was highly expressed in flowers, especially in petals.  DoGES1  transcript levels were high in the budding stage of  D. officinale  flowers at 11:00 a.m. DoGES1 catalyzed geraniol in vitro, and transient expression of  DoGES1  in  Nicotiana benthamiana  leaves resulted in the accumulation of geraniol in vivo. These findings on DoGES1 advance our understanding of geraniol biosynthesis in orchids, and lay the basis for genetic modification of floral scent in  D. officinale  or in other ornamental orchids.","['Geraniol', 'Orchids', 'Terpene synthase', 'Mep Pathway', 'Floral Volatiles']","['Figure', 'flowers', 'expression', 'geraniol', 'GES proteins', 'proteins', 'officinale', 'leaves', 'DoGES proteins', 'Candidate GES']","[GES, GES, GES proteins [ 6, DoGES1, DoGES3 ( Table S1, DoGES1-3, TPSs, Mg 2, DoGES Proteins, GES, DoGES proteins, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, MT875214, DoGES1, α-helixes, β-turns, DoGES1, DoGES1, pLoc-mPlant [ 24], DoGES1, MEP-pathway, DoGES1, DoGES1, pSAT6-EYFP-DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, pET-32a, isopropyl-β- d-thiogalactopyranoside, pET-32a-DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, pCAMBIA3300, DoGES1, 4.77-, DoGES1, 21.49-fold]","['TPSs.', 'TPS-b', 'mono-TPS', 'LiTPS2,', 'mono-TPS']",[],[],terpene synthase

Of the common aroma components, β-linalool, dehydrolinalool, linalool oxide I, linalool oxide II, geraniol, nerol, and phytol exhibited higher aroma content. Terpene synthase catalyzation produces β-Linalool and geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate, and β-linalool further produces derivatives such as dehydrolinalool, linalool oxide I and linalool oxide II [ 19]. β-Linalool has a citrus-like aroma with a low threshold. Therefore, it can be sensed by the human sensory organs when the concentration is higher than 0.6μg / L [ 20]. β-Linalool has been detected in various aroma components of oolong tea. For example, Guo [ 21] reported that the content of β-linalool in oolong tea drawn down during the manufacturing process, suggesting it’s application in the preparation of tea. Linalool oxides I and II exhibit a sweet floral and fruity fragrance whereas geraniol exhibits rose fragrance and dehydrolinalool a spicy and lavender-like fragrance [ 22]. These add value to the quality and total aroma of fenghang dancong tea. Among the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea, alcohol accounts for 16.2–43.5% of the total aroma components. The Yelai xiang tea exhibited the highest proportion while Xinren Xiang tea showed the lowest proportion. It is believed that alcohols are the main aroma components of Fenghuang Dancong tea. Chen [ 23] has reported that in several types of oolong teas, the proportion of alcoholic aroma content ranges between 7.2–38.5%, which differs from black tea, green tea, and pu’er tea to a certain extent. Our results were consistent with the above study results. This is one of the reasons why the aroma of Fenghuang Dancong tea is different from other teas. In addition, benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde are the common aroma components common of Fenghuang Dancong tea/oolong tea [ 24]. Both the benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde are produced by cinnamic acid under the catalysis of phenylalanine with related biological enzymes [ 25]. Benzyl alcohol exerts a sweet and fruity flavor, while benzaldehyde has a special almond smell [ 20]. Nerolidol has a sweet orange blossom flavor, slightly woody, and is an important aroma component in oolong tea. It is mainly produced by mevalonate in the cytosol of tea cells under the action of related biological enzymes [ 26]. Ma [ 24] demonstrated that the distribution of nerolidol contents in fresh tea leave is low and is mainly produced during the fermentation stage of tea. In contrast, our research revealed that the nerolidol contents in the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea are relatively high, ranging from 1.24% to 12.99%. Among the nine types of tea, Zhilan Xiang exhibited the lowest nerolidol content while the Qunti Xiang had the highest level. The Moli Xiang tea, Tongtian Xiang Tea and Qilan Xiang also had a higher level of nerolidol reaching to 8.04%, 7.59% and 7.10%, respectively. Indole is an aroma substance of oolong tea in tea produced from the decomposition of tryptophan. At high concentrations, it exhibits an irritating odor and mild floral scent at low concentrations [ 27]. Phenylacetonitrile has a pungent odor and is mainly produced by phenylalanine in tea leaf cells [ 24]. It is also detected in the nine types of tea and is also an important component of the aroma in Fenghuang Dancong tea. Hexanal has the smell of green grass, giving the tea a fresh and elegant taste [ 28]. Among the nine types of tea samples, hexanal showed the highest contents in Zhilang Xiang tea (8.01%), Xinren Xiang tea (5.38%), Yelai Xiang tea (5.18%), and Youhua Xiang tea (4.61%). 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane has an irritating odor, which is often detected in some aroma components of oolong tea [ 23]. In this study, the content of 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane was between 2.30% -20.75%, which revealed that this compound had a greater contribution to the aroma of Fenghuang Dancong tea. Some monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes such as limonene, basilene, γ-terpinene, δ-juniperene, and farnesene, contribute significantly to the aroma of some tea types. Previous studies have found that monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes exhibit rich sweet, floral or woody aromas and their composition and relative content may attribute to the different aroma characteristics of Fenghuang Dancong tea [ 29]. For example, the content of limonene was found to be 4.95%, 3.15% and 2.54% in Xinren Xiang, Zhilan Xiang, and Tongtian Xiang tea, respectively. Limonene has a lemon fresh fragrance, giving the tea a light lemon fragrance. It is reported that limonene is an important aroma component and also often detected in green tea [ 30]. Additionally, the limonene content is high in higher grade of green tea [ 31]. Ocimene exerts a sweet fragrance and is relatively high in Xinren Xiang, Zhilan Xiang, and Yelai Xiang tea contributing to the aroma of these teas. γ-terpinene has citrus and lemon aromas [ 32]and the highest content of 8.47% was found in Qilan Xiang tea, indicating that γ-terpinene has a greater contribution to the aroma components of Qilanxiang tea. Among the nine types of tea, the volatile ester components mainly included ethyl palmitate, methyl linoleate, and methyl oleate. These esters are formed by the dehydration and condensation of some higher fatty acids and lower alcohols. These compounds exert poor volatility, milder flavor, and contribute less to the aroma of tea [ 33]. The similarity analysis and CA on nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea The similarity analysis provided a comprehensive comparison of the volatile aroma and established a relationship between different types of tea. This method provided a theoretical basis for the study of the internal connections between different types of tea [ 1]. The study results revealed a similarity ranging from 46.79% to 95.94% between the volatile aromas of the nine types of teas ( Table 2). The similarity between Qilan Xiang and Zhilan Xiang tea showed the lowest range while the Zhilan Xiang and Xinren Xiang showed the highest similarity. The similarity between Youhua Xiang and Yelai Xiang tea, Zhilan Xiang and Xinren Xiang, Yelai Xiang and Huangzhi Xiang, Moli Xiang and Qunti Xiang, Xinren Xiang and Tongtian Xiang, Tongtian Xiang and Zhilan Xiang exhibited more than 90% similarity, revealing higher similarity between these types. The similarity between Zhilan Xiang and Qilan Xiang, Zhilan Xiang and Xinren Xiang, Xinren Xiang and Qilan Xiang tea showed 50% lower similarity. Cluster analysis is a multivariate statistical analysis that gradually aggregates samples according to the similarity of their quality characteristics and is widely used for the assessment of volatile components of tea [ 34]. Wang [ 35] analyzed the similarity between oolong tea types which revealed that the contents of volatile components in oolong tea types from the same area exhibited the most similarity and could be classified into the same category. It also demonstrated that the application of the cluster analysis method adds value to the classification of tea origin. In this study, the content of the volatile components of the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea were considered as a variable, and the euclidean distance square was considered as a metric to conduct the systematic cluster analysis. The analytical results showed that the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea can be grouped into 4 categories when the ordinate distance is 10 ( Fig 2). The categorises are as follows: (1) Zhilan Xiang, Xinren Xiang and Tongtian Xiang tea; (2) Yelai Xiang, Huangzhi Xiang and Youhua Xiang tea; (3) Moli Xiang and Qunti Xiang tea; (4) Qilan Xiang tea as one category alone. These results revealed that Qilan Xiang tea exhibited less similarity to other types of tea, which is consistent with the results of the similarity analysis. The PCA, OPLS-DA and ROC curves of nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea PCA is a statistical method that converts multiple variables into a few comprehensive variables through dimensional reduction, thereby simplifying the data and interpreting most of the original information. This method is often used to explore the comprehensive variables between samples and explain the information among them [ 13,  36]. PCA has been widely used in the study of volatile components of tea [ 35]. In this study, the contents of 122 kinds of volatile components obtained from the GC-MS analysis of the 9 types of Fenghuang Dancong tea were applying for principal component analysis. The principal component characteristic value, contribution rate and cumulative contribution rate were depicted in  Table 3. The cumulative variance contribution rate of the first five principal components showed 84.31%, indicating that the first five principal components were enough to explain all the variable information of the fragrance in Fenghuang Dancong tea. The first and second principal components showed 38.06% and 17.33% contribution rate, respectively. The results demonstrated that the volatile components which contributed more to PC1 were alkanes, including decane, octadecane, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, undecane, tetradecane and,hexadecane, etc. Volatile components with more floral and fruity fragrances contributing more to PC2 were alcohols which contained dehydrolinalool, geraniol, nerol and 1-octanol, etc. These results proved that decane, octadecane, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, undecane, tetradecane, hexadecane, geraniol, dehydrolinalool, nerol and 1-octanol were the important aroma-contributing ingredients of Fenghuang Dancong tea ( Fig 3). These components played an important role in the volatile components of tea. PC1 and PC2 are the two main components contributing the most to the overall aroma. The score scatter plot of nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea on PC1 and PC2 is depicted in  Fig 4. As illustrated in the figure, the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea can be roughly divided into four categories on PC1 and PC2. The Yelai Xiang, Huangzhi Xiang, Moli Xiang and Qunti Xiang tea are relatively concentrated; hence, they can be classified into one category while Zhilan Xiang, Xinren Xiang and Tongtian Xiang tea belong to the same category. Youhua Xiang and Qilan Xiang tea is far away from other types and can be classified into one category respectively. The principal component analysis can effectively determine the components that have a greater contribution to the volatile aroma of tea. The results of the principal component analysis of 122 aroma components demonstrated that alkanes and alcohols exhibited the greatest influence on the aroma components of the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea. Dehydrolinalool, geraniol, nerol and 1-octanol exhibited rich floral and fruity aromas which are the main source of floral and fruity aromas of Fenghuang Dancong Tea and play an important role in forming the characteristic aroma of Fenghuang Dancong Tea. From the main component analysis of the volatile aroma components of tea, we can grasp the main key components affecting the aroma of tea and provide important evidence for studying the aroma characteristics of tea. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) is widely used in the analysis of metabolome data. Since this analysis method can maximize the difference between groups data, it is used to screen differential metabolites [ 37].  Fig 5 revealed that with the application of OPLS-DA method, the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea can be divided into four categories. The Zhilan Xiang, Xinren Xiang and Tongtian Xiang tea can be classified into one category. The Moli Xiang and Qunti Xiang tea belong to the same category while the other three tea types, Youhua Xiang, Yelai Xiang and Tongtian Xiang are the same category. Similar to the result of PCA, Qilang Xiang is far away from other types and can be classified into one category alone. Variable importance in project (VIP) in OPLS-DA model can indicate the key differential metabolites among the samples. In this experiment, the aroma compounds which VIP value ≥ 1 were considered to be the key differential volatile aroma between the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea. Result presented that VIP values of 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, dehydrolinalool, phenylacetaldehyde, nerolidol, linalool oxide I, hexanal, linalool oxide II,tetradecane, 3,4-dimethyl-o-phenylenediamine and benzaldehyde were all ≥ 1, suggesting these volatile aromas were the key differential compounds between the various types of tea samples ( Fig 6). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) is often used to reflect the performance of the classifier. Area under the curve (AUC) is an important criterion for measuring the quality of the classification model. The AUC value is generally between 0.5 and 1.0, and the larger the value, the better of the classification model [ 38]. Result presented that 2-methy cyclopentanone, o-xylene, linalool oxide II, nonanal decanal, hexyl pivalate, tributyl phosphate, palmitic acid and linoleic acid appeared to be the highest AUC value (AUC = 1.000) among the 122 kinds of tea components, suggesting that these volatile aroma components were suitable to be used for classification model for nine types of tea ( Table 4). The result of volatile components of 9 types of Fenghuang Dancong tea analyzed by GC-MS Table 1 demonstrated the result of volatile components of 9 types of Fenghuang Dancong tea analyzed by GC-MS. The GC-MS analysis detected a total of 122 kinds of volatile aroma components from 56 species of Youhua Xiang tea, 74 species of Qilan Xiang tea, 51 species of Zhilan Xiang tea, 63 species of Yelai Xiang tea, 77 species of Moli Xiang tea, 40 species of Xinren Xiang tea, 61 species of Huangzhi Xiang tea, 44 species of Tongtian Xiang tea, and 69 species of Qunti Xiang tea. Of these volatile aromas, there were 24 kinds of alcohol, 23 kinds of esters, 15 kinds of alkenes, 12 kinds of aldehydes, 12 kinds of ketones, 13 kinds of alkanes, 6 kinds of other compounds. A total of 22 types of volatile aromas were found in all samples with the highest contributing components such as linalool, dehydrolinalool, β-linalool oxide I, linalool oxide II, geraniol, nerolidol, phytol and 2,2, 4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, etc. The total contents of various components including alcohols, ketones, esters, aldehydes, alkanes, alkenes and other compounds in the volatile aromas of 9 types of Fenghuang Dancong tea are depicted in  Fig 1. Of the common aroma components, β-linalool, dehydrolinalool, linalool oxide I, linalool oxide II, geraniol, nerol, and phytol exhibited higher aroma content. Terpene synthase catalyzation produces β-Linalool and geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate, and β-linalool further produces derivatives such as dehydrolinalool, linalool oxide I and linalool oxide II [ 19]. β-Linalool has a citrus-like aroma with a low threshold.

Linalool oxides I and II exhibit a sweet floral and fruity fragrance whereas geraniol exhibits rose fragrance and dehydrolinalool a spicy and lavender-like fragrance [ 22]. These add value to the quality and total aroma of fenghang dancong tea. Among the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea, alcohol accounts for 16.2–43.5% of the total aroma components. The Yelai xiang tea exhibited the highest proportion while Xinren Xiang tea showed the lowest proportion. It is believed that alcohols are the main aroma components of Fenghuang Dancong tea. Chen [ 23] has reported that in several types of oolong teas, the proportion of alcoholic aroma content ranges between 7.2–38.5%, which differs from black tea, green tea, and pu’er tea to a certain extent. Our results were consistent with the above study results. This is one of the reasons why the aroma of Fenghuang Dancong tea is different from other teas. In addition, benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde are the common aroma components common of Fenghuang Dancong tea/oolong tea [ 24].

The Moli Xiang tea, Tongtian Xiang Tea and Qilan Xiang also had a higher level of nerolidol reaching to 8.04%, 7.59% and 7.10%, respectively.

In this study, the content of 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane was between 2.30% -20.75%, which revealed that this compound had a greater contribution to the aroma of Fenghuang Dancong tea.

These esters are formed by the dehydration and condensation of some higher fatty acids and lower alcohols. These compounds exert poor volatility, milder flavor, and contribute less to the aroma of tea [ 33].","Fenghuang Dancong tea covers the oolong tea category and is widely acknowledged for its unique floral and honey flavor. In order to characterize the volatile components in nine different aroma types of Fenghuang Dancong tea, the Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC- MS) were employed. In addition, the similarity analysis and cluster analysis (CA) were performed to compare the aroma characteristics and establish the correlation between the nine types of teas. The principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) method were employed to determine the volatile components with a high contribution to the overall aroma of each type of tea. The results presented a total of 122 volatile aroma components including 24 kinds of alcohol, 23 kinds of esters, 15 kinds of olefins, 12 kinds of aldehydes, 12 kinds of ketones, 13 kinds of alkanes and 23 kinds of other components from the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea. Of these volatile aroma components, 22 types were common with linalool, dehydrolinalool, linalool oxide I, linalool oxide II, etc. The similarity of the nine types of Fenghuang Dancong tea was found between 46.79% and 95.94%.

137,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7791655\eupmc_result.json,PMC7791655,"Results Perillyl alcohol production from limonene It is well established that during ( S)-(−)-perillyl alcohol production, titers can be increased by 100 mg/L using  Escherichia coli [ 32]. Many terpenoids have been produced to high titers through metabolic engineering, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and tetraterpenes. Limonene hydroxylase from  Bacillus stearothermophilus BR 388 (LHBS), was proved to produce ( R)-(+)- perillyl alcohol 0.51 mg/L with the substrate ( R)-(+)-limonene [ 12,  21].  LHBS was ligated into pET28a(+) to create pSC00, meanwhile,  cymAa and  cymAb were created pSC01 in Table  S1. Limonene is toxic to most microorganisms and its concentrations regulate the growth of BL21 (DE3). It was therefore important to assess the optimal concentrations of limonene for fed-batch production. Different ( R)-(+)-limonene concentrations were assessed (0.2 mM to 3.0 mM) in growth assays. With the increasing of ( R)-(+)-limonene concentration, cell growth was inhibited. At ( R)-(+)-limonene concentrations of 1.0 mM, the OD 600 decreased from 2.5 to 2.0 for SC01 (Fig.  2a). When ( R)-(+)-limonene was used at 2 mM, the maximum production was 86.9 mg/L and the conversion yield of perillyl alcohol was 30% for SC01 (Fig.  2b). For another strain SC00, it produced the low concentration of 1.5 mg/L, and cell growth was suppressed (Fig.  2b). In the later study, the strain SC01 was used as the research basis.  Products were identified by GC-MS after organic extraction by ethyl acetate. As shown in Fig.  2c and d, control assays with extracts of  E. coli lacking a cDNA clone did not yield ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, whilst  E. coli carrying  cymAa and  cymAb from  Pseudomonas putida produced ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol to detectable quantities. The biosynthetic pathway for ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol production was successfully constructed using ( R)-(+)-limonene as a substrate. Limonene production from glucose We optimized the yields of limonene to improve the production of perillyl alcohol. pTrcHis2B and pET-28a (+) were assessed. pYJM14 contains  ERG8, ERG19, IDI from  Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 33]. pSC02 contains geranyl pyrophosphate synthase  GPPS from  Abies grandis that converts IPP/DMAPP to GPP, and ( R)-(+)-limonene synthase  CILS from  Citrus limon that converts GPP to limonene [ 34] (Table  S1). SC02 was cultured in fermentation medium under sealed shake-flask conditions. The levels of ( R)-(+) limonene in the culture media were plotted against known concentrations of ( R)-(+)-limonene. The ( R)-(+)-limonene concentration of SC02 reached 38 mg/L and 45 mg/L (mg limonene per liter of culture, the same as follows) with 0.2 mM IPTG and 10% n-dodecane overlay at 24 h and 48 h of induction. When 10% DINP (diisononyl phthalate) was used instead of the n-dodecane overlay, the limonene titers were 29 mg/L and 40 mg/L respectively at 24 h and 48 h (Fig.  3c). The enantiomer forms produced by the strain cultures were analyzed using GC with a Cyclosil-B column, and the production of ( R)-(+)-limonene by SC02 was confirmed (Fig.  3a and b).  Microbial perillyl alcohol production using the MVA pathway CymAa and CymAb catalyze the biosynthesis of ( R)-(+) perillyl alcohol using ( R)-(+) limonene as a direct substrate through a hydroxylated reaction at the 7 position. We cloned  cymAa and  cymAb from  Pseudomonas putida into pSC04&pSC05. Terpenoid synthase is expressed to low levels in  E. coli [ 35], so  cymAa and cymAb were codon optimized (Table  S1). According to the analysis of chirality of the intermediate limonene produced by SC02, we concluded that the configuration of perillyl alcohol was  R-type (Fig.  3b). Expression levels in the perillyl alcohol pathway for SC04 were investigated by qRT-PCR. The results indicated that  ERG8, ERG19 ERG12, and  IDI significantly increase compared to the control. Moreover, changes in the expression of  mvaE, mvaS, CILS, GPPS, cymAa and  cymAb were comparable to the control (Fig.  4a). We used n-dodecane or DINP as the extraction solvent and the organic phase was collected and centrifuged to remove cell contaminants. Samples were then subjected to GC-MS analysis and trace levels of perillyl alcohol were detected. pYJM14 and pSC04&pSC05 were co-transformed into  E. coli BL21 (DE3), resulting in recombinant strain SC04&SC05. SC04 that was cultured in sealed shake flasks to assess perillyl alcohol production. The fermentation broth of the strain SC04 was extracted by ethyl acetate, TLC, product refined and optical rotation detection. The specific rotation value of the product was [α] D20 = + 82 ± 1 (C 1.8, CHCl 3), the standard was [α] D20 = + 84 (C 1.8, CHCl 3) [ 36]. From the above, the fermentation product can be identified as ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol.  The ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol levels for SC04 reached 12.5 mg/L after induction by 0.2 mM IPTG and 10% DINP overlay for 48 h, which was 2.4-fold higher than SC05 (7.2 mg/L for 48 h) (Fig.  4b). In the absence of DINP, SC04 and SC05 produced 3.1 mg/L and 1.5 mg/L of ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol. We included n-dodecane overlays in the cultures, and thus a small amount of perillyl alcohol was detected [ 32]. The production of ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol was 9.3 mg/L in SC04 and 5.6 mg/L in SC05, mainly due to the rapid extraction of limonene to the organic phase, and as n-dodecane overlay could not be used for perillyl alcohol fermentation. In the SC04, the production of ( R)-(+)- perillyl alcohol and mevalonate was 12.5 mg/L and 102 mg/L after 48 h of induction (BL21 (DE3)/pET-28a(+) not detected, Fig.  S1). So, the production of ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol was through the mevalonate pathway from glucose. Fed-batch culture of engineered E.coli strains High cell densities for ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol production were achieved through fed-batch fermentation using SC04 in a 5 L bioreactor. According to the residual glucose concentrations, feeding rates were maintained at ≤1 g/L. Figure  5 shows the time-course of ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol production and cell density during fermentation. ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol biosynthesis was initiated from 5 h of induction and 10% DINP was added during the fed-batch process. After 36 h of induction, the production of ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol peaked at 87 mg/L with DINP overlay and the yield was 1.5 mg/g glucose. The theoretical conversion yield of ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol from glucose is 28.1% (1.5 glucose~ 0.5 ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol) However, the engineered strain achieved a cell-density OD 600 of 108 for two-phase fermentation. In the late fermentation stage, the content of perillyl aldehyde and acetic acid increased to 45 mg/L and 8 g/L respectively, which hindered the production of ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol [ 37]. The accumulation of IPP and DMAPP may have influenced the growth of the engineered strain [ 25,  38,  39]. However, the two-phase fermentation of ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol fermentation eliminated toxic intermediates. ( R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol biosynthesis requires many overexpressed genes, which influence host cell viability and reduce productivity [ 40]. "," Background (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol is a naturally oxygenated monoterpene widely used as the natural flavor additives, insecticides, jet fuels and anti-cancer therapies. It was also readily available monoterpene precursors. However, this natural product is present at low concentrations from plant sources which are not economically viable. Therefore, alternative microbial production methods are rapidly emerging as an attractive alternative to make (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol production more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Results We engineered Escherichia coli to possess a heterologous mevalonate (MVA) pathway, including limonene synthase, P-cymene monoxygenase hydroxylase and P-cymene monoxygenase reductase for the production of (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol. The concentration of (R)-(+)-limonene (the monoterpene precursor to (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol) reached 45 mg/L from glucose. Enhanced (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol production was therefore achieved. The strain produced (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol at a titer of 87 mg/L and a yield of 1.5 mg/g glucose in a 5 L bioreactor fed batch system. Conclusions These datas highlight the efficient production of (R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol through the mevalonate pathway from glucose. This method serves as a platform for the future production of other monoterpenes.","['Escherichia Coli', 'Limonene', 'Mevalonate Pathway', 'Perillyl Alcohol', 'Microbial Production']","['Perillyl alcohol', 'Perillyl', 'alcohol', 'alcohol production', 'limonene', 'production', 'Fig.', 'Escherichia coli', 'fermentation', 'DINP']","[S)-(−)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)- perillyl alcohol, pET28a(+, pSC00, pSC01, BL21, SC01, SC01, SC00, SC01, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, pTrcHis2B, pET-28a (+), pSC02, geranyl pyrophosphate, SC02, R)-(+, SC02, CymAa, CymAb, R)-(+, cymAb, SC02, ERG19 ERG12, mvaS, CILS, GPPS, cymAa, pSC04&pSC05, α] D20, α] D20, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)- perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, ≤1 , R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, glucose~ , R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol [ 37, DMAPP, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol, R)-(+)-perillyl alcohol]",[],[],['Citrus'],NaN
138,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7815096\eupmc_result.json,PMC7815096,"Results Expansion of IDSs in genome of  H.  melpomene We identified candidates potentially involved in terpene synthesis by searching in the genome of  H.  melpomene for enzymes in the mevalonate pathway and IDSs using well-annotated  Drosophila melanogaster orthologs ( S1 Table) [ 30– 32]. We identified reciprocal best basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) hits for all enzymes, except for acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, which showed the closest similarity to 3  Heliconius genes with no reciprocal best BLAST hit ( Fig 1B). There was a clear one-to-one relationship for all enzymes, except for the IDSs which showed evidence for gene duplication. Of these,  Heliconius contains 2 putative FPPSs, 4 putative copies of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase (DPPS) subunit 2, and 7 putative geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases (GGPPSs) ( Fig 1A and 1B). The biggest expansion found was that of the GGPPSs, which are IDSs that catalyse the addition of IPP to farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). One of these,  HMEL015484g1, shows 83% amino acid sequence similarity to the GGPPS of the moth  Choristoneura fumiferana, which has previously been characterised in vitro to catalyse the production of GGPP from FPP and IPP [ 33].  HMEL015484g1 is also the best reciprocal BLAST hit with the GGPPS of  D.  melanogaster ( Fig 1A and 1B). The other 6 annotated GGPPSs show less than 50% similarity to the moth GGPPS, such that their function is less clear. QTL for ( E)-β-ocimene production on chromosome 6 In order to determine which of the genes identified above could be important for ( E)-β-ocimene production in  H.  melpomene, we generated genetic mapping families composed of crosses between 2 closely related species that differ in presence/absence of ( E)-β-ocimene,  H.  melpomene, and  H.  cydno ( Fig 2A). These 2 species can hybridise and, although the F1 females are sterile, F1 males can be used to generate backcross hybrids. We bred interspecific F1 hybrid males and backcrossed these with virgin females of both species to generate a set of backcross mapping families. The ( E)-β-ocimene phenotype segregated in families backcrossed to  H.  cydno, and so we focused on these families ( S1 Fig). Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with 114 individuals, we detected a single significant peak on chromosome 6 associated with ( E)-β-ocimene quantity ( Fig 2B). The QTL peak was at 36.4 cM, and the associated confidence interval spans 16.7 to 45.5 cM, corresponding to a 6.89-Mb region containing hundreds of genes. The percentage of phenotypic variance explained by the peak marker is 16.4%, suggesting that additional loci and/or environmental factors also contribute to the phenotype ( S2 Fig). Patterns of gene expression identify  HMELOS and  HMEL037108g1 as candidates To identify candidate genes for ( E)-β-ocimene production, we searched within the confidence interval of the QTL peak. We found that subunit 1 of DPPS as well as all 7 GGPPSs were found in this region ( Fig 2C). We then compared the expression levels of the 8 genes found within the QTL using published RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data [ 34]. We first analysed data from  H.  melpomene male and female abdomens and heads, mapped to the  H.  melpomene reference genome (v2.5). Since ( E)-β-ocimene is found in male abdomens in  H.  melpomene, we hypothesised that its synthase would be highly expressed in this sex and tissue. Only 1 gene showed male abdomen-biased expression:  HMELOS (previously  HMEL037106g1 from the  H.  melpomene annotation) (tissue * sex, t = −4.18, adjp = 0.0029;  Fig 2D and  S2 Table). All other genes did not show a significant bias in this direction ( S3 Fig and  S2 Table). We next compared gene expression between  H.  cydno and  H.  melpomene abdomens. If HmelOS is synthesising ( E)-β-ocimene, we might expect  HMELOS expression to be higher in  H.  melpomene male abdomens than in  H.  cydno, given that  H.  cydno does not produce the compound. We generated a reference-guided assembly of  H.  cydno by aligning an existing  H.  cydno Illumina trio assembly [ 35] to the  H.  melpomene reference, followed by automated gene annotation. We then manually identified  H.  cydno orthologs for our 7 candidate genes and checked for differential expression between species and sexes.  HMELOS and  HMEL037108g1 were the only genes showing greater male-biased expression in  H.  melpomene abdomens than in  H.  cydno abdomens ( HMELOS, species * sex, t = 3.15, adjp = 0.0445;  HMEL037108g1, species * sex, t = 3.44, adjp = 0.0259;  Fig 2E and  S3 Table). No other genes showed a significant bias in this direction ( S4 Fig and  S3 Table). In summary,  HMELOS and to a lesser extent  HMEL037108g1 are primary candidate genes from within the QTL region. Functional characterisation demonstrates the TPS activity of HmelOS and HMEL037108g1 We cloned  HMELOS and  HMEL037108g1 from  H.  melpomene, as well as the  H.  cydno ortholog of  HMELOS,  HCYDOS, into plasmids and were able to generate heterologous expression of both proteins in  E.  coli ( S5 Fig). We then conducted enzymatic assays with the expressed proteins using precursors from different points in the pathway to characterise their enzymatic function (Figs  1 and  3). First, we carried out assays with DMAPP and IPP, the 2 building blocks at the beginning of the terpene synthesis pathway to test for both IDS and TPS activity, as was seen in  Ips pini ( Fig 1). HmelOS produced trace amounts of ( E)-β-ocimene, linalool (another monoterpene), and nerolidol (a sesquiterpene), in this assay. This presumably occurs via the production of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and FPP; therefore, HmelOS exhibits residual GPPS and FPPS activity, as well as monoterpene synthase and sesquiterpene synthase activity to convert the GPP and FPP to ( E)-β-ocimene, linalool, and nerolidol ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S4 Table). HMEL037108g1 produced trace amounts of linalool ( Fig 3A and  S6 Fig) and nerolidol from DMAPP and IPP. Again, this demonstrates residual GPS and FPPS activity to form the GPP and FPP and then both monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase activity to convert these to linalool and nerolidol ( Fig 3A and  S5 Table). We found no evidence for activity of HcydOS ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S6 Table). We then carried out assays with GPP and IPP, as well as GPP alone to test for monoterpene synthase activity ( Fig 1). Assaying with GPP and IPP together also allows us to test for potential FPPS and sesquiterpene synthase activity which could occur via production of FPP. HmelOS showed monoterpene synthase activity, producing ( E)-β-ocimene when provided with either GPP and IPP, or GPP alone ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S4 Table). Small amounts of ( Z)-β-ocimene were also produced in treatments where ( E)-β-ocimene was produced in large quantities ( S4 Table). In contrast to HmelOS, HMEL037108g1 only produced ( E)-β-ocimene in very small amounts from GPP ( S5 Table). Instead, linalool was produced in large amounts from GPP, suggesting that this enzyme is also acting as a monoterpene synthase but is responsible for production of linalool rather than ( E)-β-ocimene ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S5 Table). HmelOS also produced linalool, albeit in much smaller quantities ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S4 Table). We found no evidence for monoterpene activity of HcydOS ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S6 Table). Finally, we carried out assays with FPP and IPP to test for sesquiterpene synthase activity ( Fig 1). Although HmelOS exhibited small amounts of sesquiterpene synthase activity through the trace production of nerolidol when provided with DMAPP and IPP ( S4 Table), when provided with FPP and IPP, sesquiterpene synthase activity was not demonstrated, suggesting that it is not the primary enzyme function ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig, and  S4 Table). In contrast, HMEL037108g1 did exhibit sesquiterpene synthase activity, producing large amounts of nerolidol when FPP was provided as a precursor ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S5 Table). We found no evidence for sesquiterpene synthase activity of HcydOS ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and S6 Table). Due to the linalool detected in treatments where ( E)-β-ocimene was produced by HmelOS, we tested whether linalool could be a metabolic intermediate between GPP and ( E)-β-ocimene. However, HmelOS did not produce ( E)-β-ocimene from linalool ( S7 Fig and  S7 Table). The 2 stereoisomers of linalool, ( S)-linalool and ( R)-linalool, have different olfactory properties. We confirmed the stereochemistry of linalool produced by both enzymes and found that while HmelOS produced mainly ( S)-linalool, HMEL037108g1 produced a racemic mixture ( S8 Fig). In summary, HmelOS is a monoterpene synthase, catalysing the conversion of GPP to ( E)-β-ocimene in  H.  melpomene ( Fig 3B and 3C and  S8 Table). HMEL037108g1 is a bifunctional monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase catalysing the conversion of GPP to linalool as well as FPP to nerolidol ( Fig 3C and  S8 Table). We found no evidence for TPS activity of HcydOS ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S8 Table). Functional characterisation demonstrates the residual IDS activity of HmelOS, HcydOS, and HMEL037108g1 In order to better understand the origin of TPS activity in these enzymes, we further investigated their residual IDS activity. While the production of terpenes can be tested by direct gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the products of each experiment, this method will not detect isoprenyl diphosphates, potentially missing IDS activity if it is present. In order to test for IDS activity, we repeated the above experiments with DMAPP and IPP, GPP and IPP, and FPP and IPP, followed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase to hydrolyse the isoprenyl diphosphate products to their respective alcohols. These alcohols can then be detected by GC/MS analysis. No further IDS activity was detected in any enzyme, apart from the residual IDS activity of the  H.  melpomene enzymes already determined above due to the trace amounts of terpenes produced from DMAPP and IPP. When either enzyme is provided with GPP, geraniol is produced, and when provided with FPP, large amounts of farnesol is produced, as expected from the dephosphorylation of the provided precursors, and this is seen in control conditions, as well all experiments with HcydOS ( S9– S11 Figs and  S9– S11 Tables). As expected from the previous experiments, ( E)-β-ocimene is also produced when HmelOS is provided with GPP, and linalool and nerolidol are produced when HMEL037108g1 is provided with GPP and FPP, respectively. Geranylgeraniol is not produced in any treatments, demonstrating that neither HmelOS, HMEL037108g1 nor HcydOS is a GGPPS, as suggested by their annotation ( S9– S11 Figs and  S9– S11 Tables). In summary, both HmelOS and HMEL037108g1 only exhibit residual IDS activity, while we did not detect any IDS activity for HcydOS. Evolutionary history of gene family containing  Heliconius TPSs Lineage-specific expansions of gene families are often correlated with functional diversification and the origin of novel biological functions [ 36]. We therefore carried out a phylogenetic analysis of GGPPS in Lepidoptera to investigate whether gene duplication could have played a role in the evolution of the TPSs HmelOS and HMEL037108g1. Orthologs of the  H.  melpomene GGPPSs were identified in  H.  cydno,  Heliconius erato,  Bicyclus anynana,  Danaus plexippus,  Papilio polytes,  Pieris napi,  Manduca sexta,  Bombyx mori, and  Plutella xylostella [ 37]. Expansions of the GGPPS group of enzymes can be seen in  Heliconius and in  Bicyclus, both groups in which terpenes form part of the pheromone blend [ 38] ( S13 Fig). Expansion of gene families is often followed by an acceleration of the nonsynonymous mutation rate facilitated by a relaxation or loss of selectional constraints [ 39]. To further investigate whether gene duplication played a role in the evolution of TPSs, we examined patterns of synonymous to non-synonymous evolution in the  Heliconius GGPPS/TPS family.  Heliconius and  Bicyclus clades show higher relative non-synonymous evolution consistent with relaxed selection constraints (ω = 0.22 and 0.19, respectively) compared to the strong purifying selection on the non-expanded lepidopteran GGPPS genes (ω = 0.027, χ2 = 338.2,  p < 0.00001). To focus on the  Heliconius-specific duplications, we made a phylogeny using the DNA sequence of transcripts from  H.  melpomene,  H.  cydno, and  H.  erato.  H.  melpomene and  H.  cydno belong to the same clade within  Heliconius, with an estimated divergence time around 1.5 million years ago [ 40].  H.  erato is more distantly related, belonging to a different  Heliconius clade which diverged from the  H.  melpomene/ H.  cydno group around 10 million years ago [ 41]. While ( E)-β-ocimene is not found in the genitals of  H.  cydno, it is found in the genitals of  H.  erato, at around one-tenth the amount of  H.  melpomene [ 18]. We hypothesised that duplications between the  H.  melpomene and  H.  erato clades may have resulted in subfunctionalisation and a more efficient  H.  melpomene enzyme facilitating increased ( E)-β-ocimene production. We found that both losses and gene duplications have occurred between the  H.  melpomene and  H.  erato clades, while gene copy number is conserved between closely related  H.  melpomene and  H.  cydno ( S14 Fig). The exact orthology between the  H.  erato and  H.  melpomene/ H.  cydno genes is unclear, but  H.  melpomene/ H.  cydno have more genes in this family than  H.  erato ( S14 Fig), and both clades have more genes than the ancestral lepidopteran state of 1 copy. We also found evidence for the formation of pseudogenes following gene duplication. The amino acid sequences from translations of 1 gene in  H.  cydno, the ortholog of  HMEL037104g1, does not contain a complete functional protein domain. This is also seen for  Herato0606. 241 in  H.  erato. Furthermore, more recent pseudogene formation could be seen in the  H.  cydno ortholog of  HMEL22306g3, which contained multiple stop codons, despite being transcribed ( S4 Fig). We have demonstrated that HmelOS of  H.  melpomene acts as an ocimene synthase, with residual IDS activity, while we find no evidence of these functions in its ortholog in  H.  cydno, HcydOS. To identify likely functional changes between  H.  melpomene and  H.  cydno we first analysed the patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations between these species. The branch leading up to  HMELOS and  HCYDOS is under positive selection (ω = 1.33); this ratio is greater than the background ratio of the  Heliconius GGPPS genes (ω = 0.19) (χ2 = 6.9,  p = 0.012). However, we find no difference between ω ratio for the  HMELOS branch and  HCYDOS branch (χ2 = 0.36,  p = 0.54). We then predicted the sequence of the last common ancestor (LCA) of  H.  melpomene HmelOS and  H.  cydno HcydOS using ancestral sequence reconstruction with a posterior probability of 0.998 ( S15 Fig). Six amino acid changes differentiate HmelOS from the LCA, and 3 amino acid changes differentiate HcydO S from the LCA. To identify which of these residues are conserved within species, we aligned amino acid sequences from a set of 20 sequences from 10 individuals of each species ( S12 Table). Of the sites which differentiate  H.  cydno and  H.  melpomene from the predicted sequence of the LCA, the most intraspecifically conserved sites occur between amino acid residues 100 and 125, suggesting that this region is likely to be important for the function of the enzyme ( S13 Table). All 3 mutations in the  H.  cydno lineage (M109T, V119T, and A123T) and 1 of the mutations in the  H.  melpomene lineage (R122K) occur in this region. Of the amino acid changes in this region, the mutations in the  H.  cydno lineage involve a larger change in amino acid chemistry (from either methionine or small hydrophobic residues to a polar residue) than the mutation between 2 positively charged amino acids in the  H.  melpomene lineage. In order to determine the number of evolutionary origins of insect and plant TPSs, we carried out a broader phylogenetic analysis, including other known insect and plant IDS and TPS proteins. Similar to the other insect TPSs described,  Heliconius TPSs are not found within the same clade as plant ocimene synthases, representing an independent origin of ocimene synthesis in  Heliconius and plants. Furthermore, the  Heliconius TPSs do not group with known insect TPS enzymes in Hemiptera and Coleoptera ( Fig 4). Instead, the  Heliconius TPS enzymes group with GPP and GGPP synthases, rather than FPP synthases. The TPS enzymes of  Heliconius are therefore of an independent evolutionary origin as compared to other insect TPSs. Comparison of the amino acid alignment of known insect TPSs with the  H.  melpomene enzymes ( S16 Fig) demonstrated that residues previously identified as conserved in insect TPSs [ 28] were not found in the  H.  melpomene TPSs. No residues were shared between all insect TPSs (including  H.  melpomene TPS) which were not also shared with the  H.  melpomene GGPPS. This further indicates independent convergent evolution of TPS function in  H.  melpomene.","Plants and insects often use the same compounds for chemical communication, but not much is known about the genetics of convergent evolution of chemical signals. The terpene (E)-β-ocimene is a common component of floral scent and is also used by the butterfly Heliconius melpomene as an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone. While the biosynthesis of terpenes has been described in plants and microorganisms, few terpene synthases (TPSs) have been identified in insects. Here, we study the recent divergence of 2 species, H. melpomene and Heliconius cydno, which differ in the presence of (E)-β-ocimene; combining linkage mapping, gene expression, and functional analyses, we identify 2 novel TPSs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one, HmelOS, is able to synthesise (E)-β-ocimene in vitro. We find no evidence for TPS activity in HcydOS (HmelOS ortholog of H. cydno), suggesting that the loss of (E)-β-ocimene in this species is the result of coding, not regulatory, differences. The TPS enzymes we discovered are unrelated to previously described plant and insect TPSs, demonstrating that chemical convergence has independent evolutionary origins.",NaN,"['Fig', 'Table', 'melpomene', 'HMELOS', 'GPP', 'IDS activity', 'activity', 'FPP', 'cydno', 'synthase activity']","[acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, FPPSs, decaprenyl diphosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPPSs, GGPPSs, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPP, GGPPS, GGPP, GGPPS, GGPPSs, 6.89-Mb, DPPS, GGPPSs, abdomen-biased, HmelOS, HMELOS, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, S5, HmelOS, geranyl diphosphate, HmelOS, GPPS, FPPS, FPPS, HcydOS, FPPS, HmelOS, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, S5, HmelOS, HcydOS, HmelOS, DMAPP, HMEL037108g1, HcydOS, S6 Table), HmelOS, HmelOS, S)-linalool, HmelOS, S)-linalool, HMEL037108g1, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, HcydOS, HmelOS, HcydOS, HMEL037108g1, DMAPP, alkaline phosphatase, HcydOS, S9–, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, HcydOS, GGPPS, S9–, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, HcydOS, GGPPS, HMEL037108g1, GGPPSs, GGPPS, S13, TPSs, GGPPS/TPS, GGPPS, ω, melpomene/ H.  , S14, melpomene/ H.  cydno, melpomene/ H.  , S14, HmelOS, HcydOS, ω, GGPPS, ω, ω, HcydOS, HmelOS, HcydO, S12, S13, GGPP, TPS enzymes, S16, GGPPS]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs,', 'GGPPS/TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPS)', 'TPS']",[],[],terpene synthase
139,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7822537\eupmc_result.json,PMC7822537,"Results Environment red-light is indispensable for betasatellite-encoded βC1 protein to promote host whitefly attraction To detect whether light affects the natural begomoviral transmission process, we performed whitefly two-choice experiments using  Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb) plants and Nb plants infected with TYLCCNV and its associated betasatellite (TYLCCNB) (TA+β) in white light and dark conditions ( Fig 1A). Consistent with our previous report [ 22], whiteflies showed a significant preference for TA+β-infected plants to uninfected Nb plants under white light ( Fig 1B). Interestingly, the whiteflies did not show preference for TA+β-infected plants under darkness ( Fig 1B). We previously demonstrated that βC1 protein encoded by TYLCCNB is involved in host preference of whitefly [ 22]. More whiteflies were attracted to TA+β-infected plants compared with the βC1 betasatellite mutant virus (TA+mβ)-infected plants under white light, but there were no significant changes of whitefly preference between TA+β-infected plants and TA+mβ-infected plants under darkness ( Fig 1B), suggesting that the viral βC1-mediated whitefly preference is light-dependent. We next performed whitefly two-choice assays using  βC1 transgenic Nb plants (βC1/Nb) in various light conditions. Due to the complicity of the tripartite interactions, we applied monochromatic red-light to represent high red: far-red (R:FR) light ratio and also far-red light to represent low R: FR, the latter mimics the poor light condition of plant competition for light. Different monochromatic light sources were used to determine which wavelength of light is essential for whitefly attraction. Whiteflies were more attracted to the βC1/Nb plants compared to wild-type Nb plants only under red light and white light, not in darkness, far-red light and blue light (Figs  1C and  S1A). Moreover, red light-induced whitefly attraction from βC1/Nb plants was disrupted by far-red light. These whitefly preference results under monochromatic lights agree with the field experiments [ 31], which encouraged us to design other experiments for explicit mechanisms of light effect on the tripartite interactions. To further confirm these results with another host plant, transgenic  Arabidopsis plants expressing  βC1 (βC1/At) were used to perform whitefly two-choice assays and the same result as in βC1/Nb plants was observed ( Fig 1D). Moreover, wild-type Col-0 plants under red light conferred stronger repellence to whitefly than that under darkness on wild-type Col-0 plants ( S2A Fig). These results demonstrate that red light plays a crucial role in whitefly preference for  βC1-expressing plants. Hemipterans lack red light photoreceptors, so red light likely cannot directly affect whitefly behaviors [ 32, 33]. We thus hypothesized that signals from the host plant mediate the red light-induced changes in whitefly preference for plants expressing  βC1. Our previous work showed that TYLCCNB βC1 contributes to the suppression of JA-regulated terpene biosynthesis and renders virus-infected plant more attractive to its whitefly vector [ 22]. Therefore, we examined the expression levels of  TPS genes under various monochromatic light conditions in  Arabidopsis. Only red light could induce the βC1-mediated suppression of  AtTPS10,  AtTPS14, and  AtTPS21 expression (Figs  1E,  S1B, and  S1C). We also found that red light induced higher expression of  AtTPS10 than darkness ( S2B Fig). These results reveal that βC1 inhibits the transcription of  TPS genes in a red light-dependent manner. To explore the potential mechanism underlying the interaction between βC1 and plant signaling under various light conditions, we first excluded the possible roles of light on the subcellular localization of βC1 protein or its transcript levels ( S3A and S3B Fig). We found that the fluorescences from YFP-fused βC1 in white light were more than that in darkness, suggesting that light promotes the accumulation of βC1 ( S3A Fig). We further observed that the abundance of βC1 not YFP protein was higher under red light than under darkness, far-red light and blue light (Figs  2A and  S3C). Furthermore, we detected the accumulation of βC1 protein in two stable transgenic  Arabidopsis lines expressing  βC1 ( 35S: myc-βC1 #1 and #2). The results show that compared to darkness, white light or red light promotes the stability of βC1 protein in stable transgenic plants ( Fig 2B). The profile of protein accumulation offered an explanation for the βC1-induced host preference in a red-light dependent manner. βC1 interacts with PIFs To explore how light signal influences βC1-induced whitefly attraction, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen for βC1 interactors in an  Arabidopsis cDNA library. This identified AtPIF3, which was first identified to act in the light transduction pathway and later as multiple signaling integrator [ 34], as a new βC1-targeted host factor. We next confirmed that βC1 interacts with all four of the  Arabidopsis PIF-quartet proteins (AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, or AtPIF5) by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays (Figs  2C and  S4A), further co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) assay confirmed the interaction between βC1 and AtPIF3  in vivo under both dark and light conditions (Figs  2D and  S4B). Taken together, these data suggest that βC1 interacts with PIFs independent of light in plants. PIFs contain a conserved bHLH domain that binds to DNA and mediates dimerization with other bHLH transcription factors to regulate downstream signaling, and another Active Phytochrome A/B-binding domain that interacts with phyA and phyB to sense upstream signaling [ 19]. To localize βC1-interacting domains, we constructed different AtPIF3 deletion derivatives fused with nEYFP and performed BiFC assays with βC1-cEYFP ( S4C Fig). The AtPIF3 fragment that contained the bHLH domain was sufficient to interact with βC1  in vivo ( Fig 2E), indicating that the interaction between βC1 and PIFs may influence the downstream signaling integrator roles of PIFs in cells. The PIFs mediate defense against whitefly in  Arabidopsis To investigate whether PIFs are involved in plant defense against insect vectors, we performed whitefly bioassays using Col-0 and  AtPIF3-overexpressing ( AtPIF3-OE) transgenic plants. Whiteflies laid fewer eggs and exhibited slower pupa development on  AtPIF3-OE transgenic plants than that on Col-0 plants ( Fig 3A and 3B). Conversely, they laid more eggs and exhibited faster pupa development on  pifq ( pif1/3/4/5) quadruple mutant than that on Col-0 plants ( Fig 3C and 3D), an observation is similar to that with  βC1-expressing  Arabidopsis plants [ 22]. These data suggest that PIFs are involved in plant defense against whitefly vector. Since TYLCCNB βC1 involved in whitefly preference in light-dependent ( Fig 1) and interacts with plant PIFs ( Fig 2), we performed whitefly two-choice assays to examine whether the PIFs have the same effects on whitefly preference as βC1. Consistent with the results with  βC1-expressing  Arabidopsis plants, the  pifq quadruple mutants were higher attractive to whiteflies than Col-0 plants under white or red light ( Fig 3E). The transcriptional levels of  TPS genes ( AtTPS10,  AtTPS14 and  AtTPS21) were significantly repressed in the  pifq mutant compared to those in Col-0 plants under white or red light (Figs  3F,  S5A and S5B). Moreover, compared with YFP@βC1-1/Nb plants (normalized to 100%), overexpression of  AtPIF3 or  AtPIF4 approximately decreased whitefly attraction rate to 50% under white light ( Fig 3G and 3H), suggesting the overexpression of  PIFs could partially rescue the susceptibility of  βC1 overexpression plants against whitefly. Taken together, these results imply that PIFs control the plant terpene-based host preference to whitefly in a light-dependent manner. βC1 suppresses PIFs activity by interfering with its dimerization PIFs are bHLH transcription factors that directly regulate gene expression by binding to a core G-box motif (CACGTG) and G-box-like motif (CANNTG) [ 34, 35]. We wondered whether PIFs directly regulate the expression of  TPS genes and involve in the terpene-mediated whitefly defense response. There are some G-box-like elements (CANNTG) in the promoter of  TPS genes, which are distributed in several regions ( Fig 4A, 4C and 4E). We performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using  AtPIF3-OE plants. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that region II (one G-box-like motif 0.7 kb upstream of the transcription start site) of  AtTPS10, region I of  AtTPS14 (one G-box-like motif 1.4 kb upstream of the transcription start site) or region II of  AtTPS21 (two G-box-like motif 0.8 kb upstream of the transcription start site) was significantly enriched in  AtPIF3-OE lines relative to Col-0 plants ( Fig 4B, 4D and 4F). These data indicate that AtPIF3 directly binds to the promoter of  TPS genes and regulates its expression in  Arabidopsis. Next, we examined whether βC1 affects the trans-activity of PIFs via a construct containing the  AtTPS10 promoter with  luciferase ( LUC) as a reporter, and YFP-AtPIFs (AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, or AtPIF5) as effectors ( Fig 4G).  AtTPS10 promoter:  LUC was transiently expressed with the indicated effector plus βC1 in Nb leaf cells.  Fig 4H shows that each of AtPIFs (AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, and AtPIF5) significantly increased the LUC activity, whereas βC1 decreased AtPIFs-induced LUC activity at different degrees. Therefore, the interaction between βC1 and PIFs blocked the ability of PIFs to regulate  TPS genes. PIF3 activates downstream gene expression by forming homodimers and heterodimers with other PIF-related bHLH transcription factors [ 19]. The interaction between βC1 and the bHLH domain of AtPIF3 ( Fig 2E) raised the possibility that βC1 competes with the bHLH domain to interfere with AtPIFs dimerization. A modified BiFC assay was used to test this hypothesis. In cells co-expressing βC1, the interaction signal strength of AtPIF3-AtPIF3 or AtPIF3-AtPIF4 decreased to approximately half of its original intensity (Figs  5A–5C and  S5C), suggesting that βC1 may interfere with PIF dimerization. Moreover,  in vitro competitive pull-down assays showed that βC1 interferes with homodimerization of AtPIF4-AtPIF4 and heterodimerization of AtPIF3-AtPIF4 ( Fig 5D and 5E). These results provide evidences that βC1 blocks PIFs dimerization by competing with the binding bHLH domain and thereby suppresses the trans-activity of PIFs. PIFs interact with MYC2 to integrate light and JA signals and coordinately regulate host preference of whitefly PIF-quartet integrates signals from multiple signaling pathways, including light and JA signals, to respond to the diverse stresses and developmental processes [ 19, 34, 36]. Previous study has reported that AtPIF4 interacts with AtMYC2, and JA inhibits the function of PIF4 partially through MYC2 in  Arabidopsis [ 37]. To confirm that JA and light signaling work cooperatively to regulate plant defense against whitefly, we firstly investigated whether MYC2 associates with PIFs in plants. BiFC assays showed that AtMYC2 interacts with AtPIF3 and AtPIF4 ( S6A Fig). And Co-IP assays confirmed that βC1, AtMYC2 and AtPIF4 proteins are in a complex ( Fig 6A). Thus, we generated a  pifq/myc2-1 mutant by crossing the  pifq mutant with the  myc2-1 mutant. The transcriptional levels of  AtTPS10 in the  pifq/myc2-1 mutant were additively reduced compared to the parental lines under red light conditions ( Fig 6B). And the  pifq/myc2-1 mutant was higher attractive to whiteflies than Col-0 and  pifq mutant under white light ( Fig 6C and 6D). The results suggest that AtPIFs and AtMYC2 coordinately regulate the expression of  AtTPS10 and whitefly attraction. Since the individual AtPIF4 or AtMYC2 could directly bind and promote  AtTPS10 expression, we next tested whether the AtPIF4-AtMYC2 interaction has a synergetic effect on downstream genes expression regulation. Unexpected, we found that the heterdimerazation of AtPIF4-AtMYC2 in fact even reduces the transactivation activity when co-expressed with AtPIF4 and AtMYC2 compared to AtMYC2 alone under white light ( Fig 6E), indicating an antagonistic effect of heterodimer formation of AtPIF4-AtMYC2 on expression of  AtTPS10. Next we tested the effect of viral βC1 on the AtPIF4-AtMYC2 interaction and found that the interaction signal of AtPIF4-AtMYC2 was increased by two-fold when co-expressed with βC1, but not with β-glucuronidase (GUS) ( Fig 7A and 7B). To test whether the function of βC1 as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR) increases the interaction of AtPIF4 and AtMYC2, we used the mimic phosphorylation of Ser-33 of the βC1 protein (serine to aspartate, βC1 S33D) as a negative control to perform competitive BiFC experiments. Because it has been reported that βC1 S33D protein impairs its functions as VSR [ 38]. There are no significant differences between βC1 protein and βC1 S33D protein in effects on the interaction signal of AtPIF4-cEYFP and nEYFP-AtMYC2 (Figs  7C,  7D sand  S6B). These data suggest that βC1 functions as a linker between two bHLH transcription factors AtPIF4 and AtMYC2, which is independent on βC1 known function as VSR. Competitive pull-down assay also supported the idea that βC1 indeed bridges the interaction of AtPIF4-AtMYC2 ( Fig 7E). One hypothesis was then raised that the self-interaction of AtPIFs or AtMYCs promotes their transcriptional activity, but the formation of heterodimer of AtPIF4-AtMYC2 inhibits the MYC2 transcriptional activity. Once plants are infected by begomovirus, the linker-βC1 even exacerbates their activities. For that end, we coexpressed βC1 and found that βC1 could dampen the activator activities either by single AtPIF4 or AtMYC2 or coexpression of these two bHLH transcription factors ( Fig 6E). To further explore the function of JA signals in βC1- or PIFs-mediated whitefly host preference, we performed whitefly two-choice assays using  βC1-expressing and  pifq mutant plants with MeJA treatment in darkness. The loss of whitefly preference for βC1/At and  pifq mutant plants under darkness was rescued by MeJA application ( Fig 8A and 8B). Accordingly, the expression levels of  AtTPS10,  AtTPS14 and  AtTPS21 in two βC1/At lines and  pifq plants were also dramatically decreased by MeJA under darkness ( Fig 8C–8H). These results demonstrate that JA and light signals integrally modify begomovirus-whitefly mutualism.","Environments such as light condition influence the spread of infectious diseases by affecting insect vector behavior. However, whether and how light affects the host defense which further affects insect preference and performance, remains unclear, nor has been demonstrated how pathogens co-adapt light condition to facilitate vector transmission. We previously showed that begomoviral βC1 inhibits MYC2-mediated jasmonate signaling to establish plant-dependent mutualism with its insect vector. Here we show red-light as an environmental catalyzer to promote mutualism of whitefly-begomovirus by stabilizing βC1, which interacts with PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) transcription factors. PIFs positively control plant defenses against whitefly by directly binding to the promoter of terpene synthase genes and promoting their transcription. Moreover, PIFs interact with MYC2 to integrate light and jasmonate signaling and regulate the transcription of terpene synthase genes. However, begomovirus encoded βC1 inhibits PIFs' and MYC2' transcriptional activity via disturbing their dimerization, thereby impairing plant defenses against whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses. Our results thus describe how a viral pathogen hijacks host external and internal signaling to enhance the mutualistic relationship with its insect vector.",NaN,"['Fig', 'light', 'plants', 'whitefly', 'Figs', 'red light', 'whitefly preference', 'PIFs', 'white light', 'red']","[betasatellite-encoded βC1, TA+β-infected, TA+β-infected, βC1, TA+β-infected, βC1 betasatellite, TA+β-infected, TA+mβ-infected, βC1/Nb, FR, βC1/Nb, βC1/Nb, βC1/At, βC1/Nb, S2A, JA-regulated terpene, S2B, βC1, βC1, βC1, S3A, S3B, βC1, βC1, S3A, βC1, YFP, βC1, βC1, βC1-induced, βC1, βC1, AtPIF3, βC1, AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, AtPIF5, BiFC, βC1, AtPIF3  , βC1, Phytochrome A/B-binding, phyA, phyB, AtPIF3, nEYFP, BiFC, βC1-cEYFP, S4C, AtPIF3, βC1  , βC1, PIFs, βC1, S5B, YFP@βC1-1/Nb, βC1, G-box, CACGTG, terpene-mediated whitefly, G-box-like elements, 4F, AtPIF3, βC1, PIFs, LUC, YFP-AtPIFs, AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, AtPIF5, βC1, AtPIFs, AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, AtPIF5, LUC, βC1, βC1, PIF3, heterodimers, PIF-related bHLH, βC1, AtPIF3, βC1, AtPIFs, BiFC, βC1, AtPIF3-AtPIF3, AtPIF3-AtPIF4, βC1, βC1, AtPIF4-AtPIF4, AtPIF3-AtPIF4, βC1, MYC2, AtPIF4, AtMYC2, JA, PIF4, MYC2, MYC2, AtMYC2, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, S6A, βC1, AtMYC2, AtPIF4, pifq/myc2-1, pifq/myc2-1, pifq/myc2-1, AtPIFs, AtMYC2, AtPIF4, AtMYC2, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, AtPIF4, AtMYC2, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, βC1, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, βC1, β-glucuronidase, GUS, 7B, βC1, AtPIF4, AtMYC2, Ser-33, βC1 protein, βC1 S33D, BiFC, βC1 S33D, VSR [ 38, βC1, βC1 S33D, AtPIF4-cEYFP, nEYFP-AtMYC2 (Figs  7C, βC1, AtPIF4, AtMYC2, βC1, βC1, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, AtPIFs, AtMYCs, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, MYC2, linker-βC1, βC1, βC1, AtMYC2, βC1-, βC1/At, βC1/At lines, begomovirus-whitefly]","['TPS', 'AtTPS10,', 'AtTPS14,', 'AtTPS21', 'AtTPS10', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'AtTPS10,', 'AtTPS14', 'AtTPS21)', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'AtTPS10,', 'AtTPS14', 'AtTPS21', 'TPS', 'AtTPS10', 'AtTPS10', 'TPS', 'AtTPS10', 'AtTPS10', 'AtTPS10', 'AtTPS10.', 'AtTPS10,', 'AtTPS14', 'AtTPS21']",[],[],NaN

Evaluation of Production and Identification of Secondary Metabolites from Cultivars of Black Pepper 2.1.1. Volatile Compounds in the Leaves of Black Pepper The chemical analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) resulted in the identification of 114 components (see  Supplementary Material, Table S1), representing an average of 98.7% of the total composition. The predominance of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was observed in the cultivars “Cingapura” (58.48 ± 0.94%), “Equador” (59.35 ± 5.45%), “Guajarina” (71.81 ± 4.47%), “Iaçará” (90.90 ± 1.03%), and “Kottanadan” (74.63 ± 2.38%). On the other hand, the cultivars “Bragantina” (50.55 ± 10.35%), “Clonada” (60.90 ± 3.58%), and “Uthirankota” (75.01 ± 7.89%) presented oxygenated sesquiterpenoids as the majority. The high variability of chemical composition among the cultivars can be attributed to environmental factors such as growth and development, and whether biotic or abiotic, which also directly influence the intensity of the aroma [ 42]. The “Bragantina” cultivar showed a predominance of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (50.55 ± 10.35%), followed by sesquiterpenoid hydrocarbons (34.62 ± 12.97%). The major components were α-muurolol (20.63 ± 2.81%) ( Figure 1A), bicyclogermacrene (7.55 ± 4.95%), cubebol (6.49 ± 2.11%) and δ-cadinene (6.04 ± 1.77%). In another study, the major compounds identified in the cultivar “Bragantina” were cubenol (14.55–21.53%), bicyclogermacrene (6.36–8.16%), and β-selinene (4.10–6.21%) [ 43]. The main component of “Bragantina” cultivar, α-muurolol, can also be found in other  Piper species, such as  P. amalago (5.0–9.3%) [ 44],  P. caldense (9.0%) [ 45],  P. cernuum Vell. (5.8%) [ 46],  P. manausense (7.6%) [ 47], and  P. sp. aff.  aereum (5.8%) [ 48]. In the “Cingapura” cultivar, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (58.48 ± 0.94%) were predominant, followed by oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (20.36 ± 0.80%). The major components identified were δ-elemene (37.17 ± 1.90%) ( Figure 1B), linalool (6.75 ± 0.37%), spathulenol (5.85% ± 0.48%), ( E)-β-caryophyllene (5.72 ± 0.93%), and muurola-4,10(14)-dien-1-β-ol (4.83 ± 0.64%). “Iaçará” and “Kottanadan” cultivars displayed similar chemical profiles with quantitative differences. The main compounds were δ-elemene (50.89 ± 1.64% and 32.1% ± 7.44%), β-elemene (9.92 ± 0.58% and 6.10 ± 1.32%), viridiflorene (8.87 ± 0.84% and 12.42 ± 2.28%), and β-selinene (8.17 ± 0.57% and 7.54 ± 2.59%) for the “Iaçará” and “Kottanadan” cultivars, respectively. In black pepper, δ-elemene (53.3%) was previously reported as the main component in the leaves of “Cingapura” cultivar. The other main constituents identified in the cultivar were ( E)-β-caryophyllene (4.7%), and muurola-4,10(14)-dien-1β-ol (4.9%) [ 49]. Other  Piper species that present δ-elemene as one of the main constituents are  P. aequale (19.0%) [ 50],  P. amalago (6.82%) [ 51],  P. aleyreanum (8.2%) [ 52],  P. artanthe (11.69%) [ 53],  P. dilatatum (7.6%) [ 54], and  P. fimbriulatum (9.4%) [ 48]. The major compounds in the “Clonada” and “Uthirankota” cultivars were oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (60.90 ± 3.58% and 75.01 ± 7.89%, respectively). Elemol (40.55 ± 4.87%) ( Figure 1C) and α-bisabolol (17.97 ± 0.97%) were identified as the main components. In black pepper, α-bisabolol (32.3%) and elemol (11.4%) were identified in the leaves of cultivar “Bragantina” [ 55]. Moreover, elemol is one of the main constituents of  P. cernuum (5.89–12.0%) [ 56, 57, 58],  P. hispidum (7.6%) [ 59], and  P. marginatum (5.9–9.7%) [ 60, 61]. For α-bisabolol,  P. madeiranum (7.1%) [ 62] and  P. molicomum (9.9%) [ 63] showed high contents of this oxygenated sesquiterpenoid. “Equador” and “Guajarina” cultivars presented the same chemical profile, only with quantitative differences. The main compounds were γ-elemene (38.33 ± 3.80% and 44.36 ± 4.06%) ( Figure 1D), curzerene (23.21 ± 4.96% and 23.39 ± 4.45%), and δ-elemene (6.93 ± 0.77% and 13.84 ± 0.80%), respectively. Several  Piper species present γ-elemene as one of the main components in their EOs, such as  P. gaudichaudianum Kunth (5.4%) [ 41],  P. marginatum (3.75%) [ 64],  P. nemorense (6.8%) [ 48], and  P. vicosanum (14.16%) [ 65]. Curzerene was widely found in “Equador” (23.21 ± 4.96%) and “Guajarina” (23.39 ± 4.45%) cultivars, and is considered a derivative of furanodiene, which is produced from a reversible thermal rearrangement known as the Cope rearrangement [ 66]. It is a type of reaction characterized by the substitution of alkenes when the compound is found at high temperatures [ 67], which suggests that curzerene may have been produced during the essential oil extraction as well as during the gas chromatographic analysis [ 68].  In  Piper species, this oxygenated sesquiterpenoid can be found in  P. dilatatum (13.8–28.7%) [ 54] and  P. hispidum (4.9–12.9%) [ 59, 69]. Another well-known species that presents curzerene as one of the main components is  Eugenia uniflora, commonly known as “pitanga”, an arboreous plant widely distributed in Brazil and other South American countries and possesses antifungal activity against  Candida spp., and its EO presents antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects against some cancer strains [ 70, 71]. 2.1.2. Volatile Compounds in the Fruits of Black Pepper GC-MS analysis identified 104 components, representing 99.45% of the total composition (see  Supplementary Material, Table S2). Monoterpene hydrocarbons (average of 76.1%) were predominant in all cultivars, such as α-pinene (6.91–10.67%), β-pinene (22.61–35.05%) and limonene (21.0–31.77%). The presence of α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene ( Figure 2) in the chemical composition can be found in most cultivars of black pepper [ 72]. The literature widely reports the influence of terpene levels on the aroma and flavor of black pepper fruits. Despite different geographical regions, the pungency and flavor of black pepper fruits are related to these compounds, with variations only in their percentages among the cultivars [ 72, 73]. The EO chemical composition of black pepper cultivars can present quantitative and qualitative differences according to their geographic occurrence. For example, in cultivars from India (“Indigenous” and “Kerala”), quantitative variations in amounts of α-pinene (7.3–16.7%), β-pinene (13.2–13.6%) and limonene (15.2–16.2%), δ-3-carene (9.2–32.6%), α-phellandrene (2.9–8.9%), and ( E)-β-caryophyllene (10.7–18.4%) were observed [ 74]. Fruits from “Sreekara”, “Kuching”, and “Vellanamban” cultivars, also found in India, present α-pinene (1.7–5.5%), β-pinene (3.9–11.2%) and limonene (8.3 22.1%) in their EO composition. However, they also display other majorities, such as ( E)-β-caryophyllene (16.8–39.1%), sabinene (4.3–18.8%), myrcene (2.0 9.6%), α-phellandrene (3.0–7.7%, only in “Sreekara” and “Kuching” cultivars), δ-3-carene (5.1–11.1%, only in “Sreekara” and “Vellanamban” cultivars), α-cubebene (4.8–6.1%, only in the “Vellanamban” cultivar), and even the oxygenated sesquiterpene elemol (4.2–10.5, only in the “Vellanamban” cultivar) [ 75]. In Cameroon, the EO of black pepper presented δ-3-carene (18.5%), limonene (14.7%), ( E)-β-caryophyllene (12.8%), sabinene (11.2%), α-pinene (5.6%), and β-pinene (6.7%), while the EO of black pepper from S. Tomé e Príncipe displayed limonene (18.8%), ( E)-β-caryophyllene (15.4%), sabinene (16.5%) and β-pinene (10.7%) as majorities [ 76, 77]. 2.1.3. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)  Multivariate analysis based on the leaf volatiles classified the cultivars into four groups ( Figure 3). Group I exhibited a similarity level of 99.2% between the cultivars “Equador” and “Guajarina”, and presented high levels of γ-elemene (38.33–44.36%), curzerene (23.21–23.39%) and δ-elemene (6.83–13.84%). This group displayed a similarity of 53.6% with group II. High concentrations of δ-elemene (30.11–50.89%) characterized the group II with a similarity level of 92.3% among the cultivars “Iaçará”, “Kottanadan”, and “Cingapura”. In addition, cultivars “Iaçará” and “Kottanadan” presented significant amounts of viridiflorene (8.87–12.42%), β-selinene (7.54–8.17%) and β-elemene (6.10–9.92%). In contrast, the cultivar “Cingapura” exhibited spathulenol (5.85%) and ( E)-β-caryophyllene (5.72%) as the majority. This group showed a similarity of 45.9% with group III. The cultivars “Clonada” and “Uthirankota” were grouped in Group III with a similarity level of 98.1% and high content of elemol (40.55–49.78%), and presented a similarity of 43.9% with group IV. Finally, group IV separated only the “Bragantina” cultivar from the others, due to its composition rich in α-muurolol (20.63%), bicyclogermacrene (7.55%), and cubebol (6.49%). Regarding volatiles from the fruits, two clusters were identified with a high similarity between them (~93.5%), displaying no significant variation among the cultivars. The use of metabolic profiling as a tool for the discrimination of cultivars of several crops has been reported in the literature [ 78, 79]. Principal component analysis (PCA) and HCA techniques classified the EOs from five varieties of  P. betle into three groups. Group I, which englobes “Misti” and “BARI Paan 3” varieties, presented chavicol (3.97–11.95%), ( E)-β-caryophyllene (4.24–4.69%), and valencene (3.02–3.11%). Group II was composed only of the variety “Bangla” due to the presence of eugenyl acetate (1.50%) and α-humulene (1.35%) in its composition. The varieties “Sanchi” and “Khasia” were separated in Group III, which was characterized by γ-muurolene (1.74–4.49%) and ( E)-β-caryophyllene (1.74–4.93%) in their compositions [ 80]. PCA analysis of volatile profiles was able to distinguish fourteen  Citrus varieties as tolerant and moderately tolerant from those susceptible to  Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas). Tolerant and moderately tolerant cultivars showed higher amounts of volatiles than susceptible varieties. These compounds include aldehydes (undecanal, neral, geranial, and citronellal) and some monoterpenes such as linalool (0.1–68.3%), d-limonene (0.3–55.3%), myrcene (0.1–8.5%), α- (0.2–3.1%) and β-phellandrene (0.1–11.4%) [ 81]. Previous studies reported the different degrees of the susceptibility of black pepper cultivars to  F. oxysporum (yellow wilt) [ 24, 82, 83]. Our results indicate a possible correlation between resistance to yellow wilt and the volatile composition of the leaves. “Iaçará”, “Kottanadan”, and “Cingapura” (group II) are highly resistant, while “Bragantina” (group IV) and “Uthirankota” (group III) present medium resistance, and “Guajarina” (group I) are more susceptible. Consequently, the cultivar “Equador” may be classified as susceptible due to its high similarity with the cultivar “Guajarina” (99.2%). Furthermore, the variety “Clonada” may have a medium resistance due to its proximity to the cultivar “Uthirankota” (98.1%) (see  Figure 3).  In comparison to the fruits, the volatile profiles of leaves functioned as suitable biomarkers for the discrimination of cultivars, and their resistance or susceptibility to yellow wilt. However, further experiments with  Fusarium inoculation given to each variety are required to confirm this relationship. Moreover, an antimicrobial assay with the main compounds is recommended for understanding the role of specific compounds in each cultivar’s plant defense mechanism. 2.1.4. Total Phenolics Determination The total phenolic contents in the  P. nigrum extracts showed great variation in the leaves (44.75 ± 1.60 to 140.53 ± 14.01 mg GAE·g −1) ( Figure 4A). However, in the fruits we noticed only small changes in the “Cingapura” and “Uthirankota” cultivars ( Figure 4B). According to the literature, these variations can be occasioned by several factors, biotic and abiotic, such as plant defense, senescence, plant development, and interactions with the environment in which they are inserted [ 84]. The levels of total phenolics were higher in the leaves in comparison to the fruits. These differences can be related to the harvesting and processing steps involved in sun-drying, which alter the interaction between the enzymes related to phenolic production in the black pepper fruits [ 85]. In addition, the content of phenolic compounds can be considered a useful parameter for determining plants’ biological functions [ 86]. Six black pepper varieties (“Sreekara”, “Subhakara”, “IISR Malabar Excel”, “Panniyur-1”, “Panchami” and “IISR Thevam”), and other  Piper species ( P. chaba Hunter,  P. longum L., and  P. colubrinum Link.) were extracted with  n-hexane, chloroform, methanol, and water. Methanol extracts from “IISR Malabar Excel” and “Panchami” varieties, and a chloroform extract of  P. colubrinum displayed higher phenolic contents, with values of 50.85, 38.74, and 100.6 mg GAE·g −1 of the extract [ 87]. Therefore, our findings suggest that black pepper cultivars cultivated in the Pará State, Brazil have high phenolic contents compared to other cultivars from other regions of the world, and the extracts may present several biological activities. Plants that are under biotic or abiotic stresses can exhibit changes in their phenolic contents in the early stages of development [ 88]. Black pepper, after infection with  F. solani f. sp.  piperis, showed a significant variation in total phenolics in the leaves and roots from the “Cingapura” cultivar (tolerant to  Fusarium), which can be attributed to the response to the infection in the early stages, since the first symptoms were noted after two weeks of inoculation [ 49]. Moreover, the association of the “Bragantina” cultivar of black pepper with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) induced an increase in phenolic content, which was correlated to changes in enzymatic activity linked to metabolic pathways related to plant defense. These findings suggest that AMF can induce a better resistance to pathogens [ 43]. 2.1.5. Total Carotenoids The concentration of total carotenoids revealed a great variation among the cultivars (0.21 ± 0.03 to 2.31 ± 0.10 µg·mL −1) ( Figure 5). The literature reports a synergistic effect of carotenoids of great importance for the biological properties of plant extracts, which is linked to the production of different classes of compounds such as phenylpropanoids, terpenes, and alkaloids [ 89]. In plants, the carotenoids are involved in different areas, such as antioxidants, accessory pigments that absorb light, and molecules that act as attractants for pollinators and seed dispersers, in addition to the plant response to environmental stresses [ 90]. Thus, it is possible to measure the impact of the environment on plant metabolism. An increase in carotenoid concentration was observed in the black pepper cultivar “Panniyur 1”, which is tolerant to drought stress, suggesting a relationship between the production of these compounds and the mechanisms of tolerance to stress [ 91]. Another study showed the effect of natural growth promoters on the physiological and biochemical development of the cultivar “Panniyur 1” of black pepper, and displayed an increase of 159% in total carotenoids compared with the control group. Therefore, species that have access to a greater amount of the nutrients essential to plant growth also tend to have a higher concentration of carotenoids [ 92]. 2.2. Comparison of Enzymatic Activity In Vitro in the Leaves of Black Pepper Cultivars Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase (PAL) Activity P. nigrum cultivars exhibited a considerable variation in PAL enzymatic activity, ranging from 20.19 to 57.22 µU·mL −1 ( Figure 6). PAL is a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of phenylpropanoids, which displays an essential role in the production of metabolites related to plant defense, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, lignans, lignins, and coumarins [ 93]. Alkaloids are the main class produced by the shikimic acid pathway present in black pepper, especially the piperamides [ 94]. These metabolites are present in the fruits and seeds of black pepper, and have wide pharmacological applicability, such as in antimetastatic, antidepressant, hepatoprotective and antitumor activities, and they also have neuroprotective effects [ 95, 96]. Alkaloid concentrations and their biological properties are directly related to PAL activity in the plant [ 97, 98]. An increase in PAL activity can result from a sensitive response that occurs in plants when they are infected by pathogens or during an injury [ 99, 100]. Significant changes in PAL activity were observed in the cultivars “Cingapura” and “Trau” of black pepper, two days after infection with  Phytophthora capsici. The results showed that PAL causes an immediate response in the production of defense metabolites when the plant is under stress [ 101]. After 48 h of co-inoculation with two strains of rhizobacteria ( Bacillus subtilis and  Pseudomonas fluorescens) and two strains of endophytic fungi ( Trichoderma viride and  Trichoderma asperellum), an increase in PAL activity induced the systemic resistance of black pepper against  P. capsici [ 102]. Therefore, the quantification of PAL activity can be considered an alternative in the evaluation of plant resistance against infection by pathogens. 2.3. Homology Modeling and Molecular Docking to Fusarium In an attempt to correlate volatile phytoalexins with  Fusarium resistance, we have carried out a molecular docking analysis of the major  P. nigrum volatile components with  Fusarium protein targets that were available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB):  F. oxysporum cutinase (PDB 5AJH),  F. solani cutinase (PDB 1AGY, 1XZL, and 1XZM),  F. oxysporum endoglucanase (PDB 4OVW),  F. oxysporum feruloyl esterase (PDB 6FAT), and  F. oxysporum xylanase (PDB 5JRM). In addition,  F. solani ornithine decarboxylase was prepared by homology modeling using murine ornithine decarboxylase (PDB 7ODC) as a template,  F. oxysporum glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase was prepared from human glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (PDB 6R4E) as a template,  F. odoratissimum β-glucosidase was prepared using  Neurospora crassa β-glucosidase (PDB 5NBS) as the template,  F. oxysporum guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit β was prepared using human guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit α1 (PDB 6CMO) as the template, and  F. vanettenii thiamine thiazole synthase was prepared using  N. crassa thiazole synthase (PDB 3JSK) as the template. Docking energies for the essential oil ligands and 10  Fusarium target proteins are listed in  Supplementary Material, Table S3. The major components found in the  Fusarium-resistant  P. nigrum cultivars (“Cingapura”, “Iaçará”, and “Kottanadan”) were δ-elemene (abundant in all three cultivars), viridiflorene, β-selinene, β-elemene (abundant in “Iaçará” and “Kottanadan”), spathulenol and ( E)-β-caryophyllene (abundant in “Cingapura”). δ-Elemene, viridiflorene, β-elemene, and ( E)-β-caryophyllene, all showed selective docking (most exothermic docking energies) to  F. oxysporum endoglucanase. Furthermore,  F. oxysporum endoglucanase had the lowest docking average energy for the 40 essential oil components, and was the most targeted protein with 13 ligands showing preferential docking to this protein. Endoglucanase is one of the enzymes responsible for breaking down cellulose by hydrolyzing the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in the cellulose polymer [ 103]. Thus, the inhibition of this protein target would protect the plant from cellulose degradation by  Fusarium. Interestingly, the essential oil components all dock into a hydrophobic pocket removed from the site of the co-crystallized ligand (4-(β- D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,2-dihydroxybutyl propanoate) but still in the active canyon of the enzyme ( Figure 7).","This study evaluated the chemical compositions of the leaves and fruits of eight black pepper cultivars cultivated in Pará State (Amazon, Brazil). Hydrodistillation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were employed to extract and analyze the volatile compounds, respectively. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were predominant (58.5-90.9%) in the cultivars ""Cingapura"", ""Equador"", ""Guajarina"", ""Iaçará"", and ""Kottanadan"", and ""Bragantina"", ""Clonada"", and ""Uthirankota"" displayed oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (50.6-75.0%). The multivariate statistical analysis applied using volatile composition grouped the samples into four groups: γ-Elemene, curzerene, and δ-elemene (""Equador""/""Guajarina"", I); δ-elemene (""Iaçará""/""Kottanadan""/""Cingapura"", II); elemol (""Clonada""/""Uthirankota"", III) and α-muurolol, bicyclogermacrene, and cubebol (""Bragantina"", IV). The major compounds in all fruit samples were monoterpene hydrocarbons such as α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene. Among the cultivar leaves, phenolics content (44.75-140.53 mg GAE·g -1  FW), the enzymatic activity of phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (20.19-57.22 µU·mL -1 ), and carotenoids (0.21-2.31 µg·mL -1 ) displayed significant variations. Due to black pepper's susceptibility to  Fusarium  infection, a molecular docking analysis was carried out on  Fusarium  protein targets using each cultivar's volatile components.  F. oxysporum  endoglucanase was identified as the preferential protein target of the compounds. These results can be used to identify chemical markers related to the susceptibility degree of black pepper cultivars to plant diseases prevalent in Pará State.","['Carotenoids', 'Phenolic compounds', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Molecular docking', 'Monoterpenes', 'Pal Activity']","['Black Pepper', 'Cultivars', 'cultivar', 'Black', 'Pepper', 'pepper cultivars', 'Group', 'Figure', 'Cingapura', 'PDB']","[“Cingapura”, “, “Guajarina”, “Iaçará”, “Kottanadan”, “, ”, “Clonada”, “Uthirankota”, “, ”, ”, β-selinene (4.10–6.21, “, ”, α-muurolol, caldense (9.0%, “Cingapura”, ±, ±, muurola-4,10(14)-dien-1-β-ol (4.83 ±, “Iaçará”, “Kottanadan”, ±, ±, ±, “Iaçará”, “Kottanadan”, muurola-4,10(14)-dien-1β-ol (4.9%, aleyreanum, “Uthirankota”, α-bisabolol, α-bisabolol, “, α-bisabolol, madeiranum, molicomum, “, ”, “Guajarina”, ±, ±, ±, δ-elemene (6.93 ±, vicosanum (, “, “Guajarina”, Cope, 4.9–12.9, “pitanga”, α-pinene (6.91–10.67, 22.61–35.05, α-pinene, β-pinene, “, ”, “, ”, α-pinene (, 7.3–16.7, δ-3-carene (, “Sreekara”, “, ”, “Vellanamban”, 1.7–5.5, β-pinene (3.9–11.2, 16.8–39.1, “Sreekara”, “, ”, δ-3-carene, “Sreekara”, “Vellanamban”, “Vellanamban”, 4.2–10.5, “Vellanamban”, α-pinene, “, ”, “Guajarina”, 23.21–23.39, δ-elemene (6.83–13.84, δ-elemene (30.11–50.89, “Iaçará”, “Kottanadan”, “Cingapura”, “Iaçará”, “Kottanadan”, 8.87–12.42, 7.54–8.17, “Clonada”, “Uthirankota”, “, ”, HCA, “Misti”, “BARI Paan 3”, “, ”, “, ”, 0.1–68.3, 0.3–55.3, α-, “Iaçará”, “Kottanadan”, “Cingapura”, “, ”, “Uthirankota”, “Guajarina”, ”, “Clonada”, ±, “Cingapura”, “Uthirankota”, ’, “Sreekara”, “Subhakara”, “, ”, “Panniyur-1”, “Panchami”, “, “, ”, “Panchami”, −1, Pará, “, ”, AMF, AMF, ±, ±, µg·mL −1, Cultivars Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase, µU·mL −1, “Cingapura”, “Trau”, capsici [ 102], PAL, PDB 5AJH, cutinase (PDB 1AGY, 1XZL, PDB 5JRM, ornithine decarboxylase, “Cingapura”, “Iaçará”, “Kottanadan”, “Kottanadan”, “Cingapura”, β-elemene, Endoglucanase, β-1,4-glycosidic, 4-(β- D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,2-dihydroxybutyl]",[],[],['Citrus'],NaN
141,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7861536\eupmc_result.json,PMC7861536,"Results SureSelect target enrichment of carotenoid metabolic genes among the 13 founders In previous studies of QTL and eQTL analyses using bi-parental populations [ 17,  20], each genetic locus for  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP, and  NCED, and eQTL for  PDS and  ZDS in linkage group 8 ( TCL) were shown to have statically effects on carotenoid content and transcription level of carotenoid metabolic genes. In this study, we focused on them and explored an optimum allele associated with high carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits, from a total of 26 alleles present in 13 ancestral species of the Japanese breeding population. Citrus varieties comprised complex mosaic genome structures of a limited number of ancient species via repeated natural cross [ 36]; therefore, the number of independent alleles that were shared by some of the 13 founders was estimated for five target genes based on SNPs. Since the genomic sequences of most founders are not available in the public database, a SureSelect target enrichment system was applied to acquire the SNP information of the target genes except for  TCL. The SNP information was collected from the gene region because sequence variation in promoter region were complicate among 13 founders by the combination of insertion, deletion and point mutation among citrus varieties and it would be unfavorable to extract stably inherited SNPs among citrus varieties and their progenies. Because carotenoid metabolic genes have several isoforms in the genome, genome sequences in the gene region of Ciclev10011841m.g for  PSY, Ciclev10005481m.g for  HYb, Ciclev10025089m.g for  ZEP, and Ciclev10014639m.g for  NCED in the clementine mandarin genome sequence ver 1.0 were utilized to create custom bait libraries that covered the genomic region around target genes. These loci were confirmed to influence the carotenoid content and transcription levels of metabolic genes in previous studies. The constructed captured libraries enriching four metabolic genes were sequenced using a HiSeq2500 system (Illumina), and NGS data were aligned with the reference sequence of clementine mandarin genome sequence ver 1.0 using CLC Genomic Workbench 6.5.1 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Numerous SNPs and indels were found in 4 target genes when overviewing 13 founders. The number of SNPs in  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP, and  NCED with more than readable SNP quality score (>150) according to manufacturer’s description were 107, 31, 54 and 19 respectively, when NGS data of 13 founders were compared with the corresponding reference gene of clementine mandarin. For  TCL, the causative gene that controls the transcription levels of  PDS and  ZDS has not been characterized. Therefore, arbitrary SNPs on  TCL were applied to estimate the number of independent alleles for uncharacterized causative genes on  TCL given that the allele on common haplotype blocks derived from common founders would reveal the same SNP genotypes. The candidate SNPs on  TCL were explored using the TASUKE program in MiGD [ 19]. Based on the SNP information, 17 SNP markers for  PSY, 15 for  HYb, 31 for  ZEP, 8  NCED, and 5 for  TCL were developed for a SNP genotyping assay using the GoldenGate assay system (Illumina) and Fluidigm BioMark™ HD assay system (Fluidigm). PSY catalyzes the first committed condensation step from GGPP to produce the first C40 carotene, phytoene. Carotenoid composition is highly influenced by the transcription balance among carotenoid metabolic genes [ 5]. In previous QTL and eQTL analyses,  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP,  NCED, and eQTL for  PDS and  ZEP have been shown to increase carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits [ 17,  20]. These genes including a causative gene on  TCL (denoted in red font within boxes) are the targets for allele mining in this study. PSY, phytoene synthase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase; LCYe, lycopene ε-cyclase; LCYb, lycopene β-cyclase; HYb, β-carotene hydroxylase; ZEP, zeaxanthin epoxidase; VDE, violaxanthin de-epoxidase; NSY, neoxanthin synthase; CCD, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; NCED, 9- cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase. Independent alleles in 13 founders based on the SNP genotype information of reliable SNP markers A total of 76 SNP markers were applied to the genotyping of 13 founders and 78 offspring that had parent–offspring relationships among them. Modern citrus varieties reveal extensive sharing of haplotypes from ancient species [ 37]. Considering the admixture genomes and long cultivation history of 13 founders, numerous  de novo mutations frequently occur in those sharing haplotypes; these would hamper the identification of a synonymous allele derived from common ancient species, out of the 26 alleles present in the 13 founders. Trio analysis was carried out to remove SNPs of  de novo mutations and obtain reliable SNPs on the basis of inheritance in the lineages. Seventy-eight combinations of parent-offspring varieties were evaluated by the computer software “MARCO”. In total, 57 SNPs passed through the filtering by trio analysis and were valid as trio-tagged SNPs. Schematic diagram to generate 57 trio-tagged SNPs and their detail information are summarized in  S1 Fig and  S1 Table, respectively. Tentatively, each of the 26 alleles calculated in the13 founders was also named according to the style of abbreviation combination for gene, variety, and allele number (1 or 2), i.e.,  PSY alleles in grapefruit were named  PSY-a-gf1 and PSY-a-gf2, and so on. The alleles with identical trio-tagged SNP genotypes were assigned as independent alleles, and 12, 10, 24, and 6 trio-tagged SNPs were used to find an independent allele for  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP, and  NCED alleles, respectively. The numbers of independent alleles in 13 founders were as follows: 7 alleles for  PSY, 7 alleles for  HYb, 11 alleles for  ZEP, 5 alleles for  NCED, and 4 alleles  for TCL. The members of each synonymous allele and their genotypes of trio-tagged SNPs are summarized in  Table 2. For example, the  PSY-independent allele was defined based on the genotype of 12 trio-tagged SNPs, and there were 7 independent alleles from  PSY-a to  PSY-g.  PSY-a-gf2 in grapefruit,  PSY-a-ks1 in Kishu mikan,  PSY-a-hs2 in hassaku,  PSY-a-so2 in sweet orange,  PSY-a-kb1 in Kunenbo mandarin,  PSY-a-wl2 in willow leaf mandarin,  PSY-a-kg2 in King mandarin, and  PSY-a-mch in ‘Murcott’ revealed the same SNP genotype and were assigned to  PSY-a. The trio-tagged SNP genotypes for  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP,  NCED, and  TCL are summarized in  S2 Table. Genotyping of trio-tagged SNPs in breeding populations and the frequency of alleles in the progress of breeding generation SNP genotyping assay was carried out for 275 plant materials, including13 founders, and their allelic composition was characterized based on the SNP genotype data of 57 trio-tagged SNPs. The allelic genotypes of five target genes in major cultivars are summarized in  S3 Table. There was no discrepancy in the transmission of all independent alleles from parents to offspring among the samples in the 78 parent–offspring combinations. Breeding populations have been generated by crossing with one another, and the most advanced breeding generations of the registered cultivars belong to the 4 th generation from 13 founders in the breeding program. The numbers of the registered cultivars and preserved selection lines in each generation were as follows: founder, 13 varieties; zero generation (G0): 2 (Satsuma mandarin and Clementine mandarin), 1 st generation (G1), 14 varieties and lines (i.e. ‘Kiyomi’, ‘Sweet spring’, etc.); 2 nd generation (G2), 23 (i.e. ‘Harumi’, ‘Tamami’, etc.); 3 rd generation (G3), 21 (i.e. ‘Setoka’, ‘Tsunokagayaki’, etc.); 4 th generation (G4), 10 (i.e. ‘Harehime’, ‘Ehime Kashi No. 28’, etc.). In Japanese breeding programs, the enrichment of carotenoids in fruit is one of the most important breeding traits. The allele frequencies of the five target genes were traced during those breeding generations, except for G0 because Satsuma mandarin and clementine mandarin were generated by the natural cross of founders between Kunenbo mandarin and Kishu mikan or between Willowleaf mandarin and King mandarin, respectively (Fujii et al. 2016). Interestingly, several alleles of the five target genes were selected out in progress of breeding generation. For example, out of seven  PSY alleles in founders,  PSY-g and  PSY-f disappeared from G2, and the occupied ratio of  PSY-c decreased from 15.4% in founders to 5% in G4 ( Fig 2A). Of the seven  HYb alleles in founders,  HYb-c,  HYb-e, and  HYb-f disappeared in the G4, and the occupied ratio of  HYb-g increased from 3.8% in founders to 27.8% in G4 ( Fig 2B). Of the 11  ZEP alleles in founders,  ZEP-f,  ZEP-g,  ZEP-h,  ZEP-j, and  ZEP-k disappeared in G4, and the occupied ratio of  ZEP-e increased from 7.7% in founders to 26.3% in G4 ( Fig 2C). Of the five  NCED alleles in founders,  NCED-d and  NCED-e disappeared in G4, and the occupied ratio of  NCED-c reduced from 15.4% in founders to 5.0% in G4 ( Fig 2D). Additionally, out of 4  TCL alleles in founders,  TCL-d disappeared in G4, and the occupied ratio of  TCL-a decreased from 38.5% in founders to 12.1% in G4 ( Fig 2E). Thus, several alleles in founders disappeared during the breeding generation although these disappeared alleles may be revived by crossing with old varieties. Quantification of carotenoid components in juice sac tissues of mature fruits from 263 breeding pedigrees Phytoene, t-violaxanthin, c-violaxanthin, lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, α-carotene, zeaxanthin, and β-carotene in the juice sac tissues of the mature fruits were measured among 263 breeding pedigrees including 11 founders, for which fruits were available, by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The content of total carotenoid, β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin in the major cultivars is summarized in  S3 Table.  Fig 3 shows the carotenoid composition for each breeding generation from G1 to G4. The mean total carotenoid content in the 13 founders was 2.2 mg/100FWG, with a range 0.0 mg/100FWG to 6.0 mg/100FWG. The variance in total carotenoid content was 3.9. The fruits of Kishu mikan, King mandarin and ‘Murcott’ accumulated high concentrations of carotenoids and those of grapefruit, Hassaku and Hyuganatsu accumulated lower concentrations of carotenoids. The major carotenoids present in the 13 founders were either β-cryptoxanthin or violaxanthin, and they comprised more than 67.0% of the total carotenoids. In the breeding population, the mean total carotenoid content was 2.8 mg/100FWG, with a range of 0.2 mg/100FWG to 9.6 mg/100FWG. The variance of total carotenoid content was 2.7, which was less than that of the 13 founders. These results indicated that the variance of total carotenoids became smaller in the breeding population, whereas total carotenoids, β-cryptoxanthin, and VIO became more abundant owing to the removal of unnecessary alleles. For example, ‘Tsunokagayaki’ in G3 and Kuchinotsu 52 gou in G4 revealed a deep orange flesh color ( Fig 4), and β-cryptoxanthin (total carotenoids) content in the juice sac tissues were 2.2 mg/100FWG (4.6 mg/100FWG) and 2.4 mg/100FWG (4.5 mg/100FWG), which were higher than 1.5 mg/100FWG (2.3 mg/100FWG) of Satsuma mandarin in G0. Interestingly, β-cryptoxanthin content and violaxanthin content were highly correlated with the total carotenoid content among breeding populations, and both of their correlation values were 0.85 ( Fig 5). This result implied that the increase in total carotenoids was supported by the accumulation of these xanthophylls in mature fruits. These carotenoid profiles suggest that carotenoid enrichment was achieved by the exchange of allelic composition and by the targeted removal of the unnecessary alleles in conventional crossbreeding. Association between the allelic composition of five target genes and carotenoid composition in juice sac tissues of fruits by Bayesian statistical analysis The association between allelic composition of five target genes and carotenoid composition ( S3 Table) was evaluated by Bayesian statistical analysis using the data obtained from the 263 pedigrees. The five target genes detected some significant associations with the measured eight kinds of carotenoids and total carotenoid content ( Fig 6).  PSY,  ZEP, and  NCED significantly associated with total carotenoid content,  PSY and  ZEP significantly associated with β-cryptoxanthin content, and  PSY,  HYb,  ZEP,  NCED, and  TCL significantly associated with violaxanthin content. Based on the estimated effect size for each allele of the five target genes on the measured carotenoids, the allele with the value of more than one third of the max effect size was defined as the alleles with positive or negative effect ( Fig 7). With respect to the independent alleles of the five target genes,  PSY-a had a strong positive effect ( ζ = 0.82) on increasing the total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits, whereas  PSY-c and  PSY-g had medium negative effects ( ζ = -0.42 and -0.41, respectively) on decreasing the total carotenoid content ( Fig 7A). Among the  ZEP alleles,  ZEP-e had a strong positive effect ( ζ = 0.83) on increasing the total carotenoids in juice sac tissues of fruits, whereas three alleles,  ZEP-a,  ZEP-b, and  ZEP-c, had medium or weak positive effects ( ζ = 0.54, 0.38, and 0.66, respectively) on increasing the total carotenoid content. Four alleles of  ZEP-f,  ZEP-g,  ZEP-h, and  ZEP-k had medium or weak negative effects ( ζ = -0.42, -0.68, -0.59, and -0.31, respectively) on decreasing the total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits. Moreover, among the  NCED alleles,  NCED-a had a weak positive effect ( ζ = 0.34) on increasing the total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits. In contrast to those genes,  HYb and  TCL had unclear effect on the total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits. With regard to the β-cryptoxanthin content,  PSY-a had a medium positive effect ( ζ = 0.38), while  PSY-c and  PSY-g had weak negative effects ( ζ = -0.29 and -0.26, respectively). In contrast,  ZEP-a had a weak positive effect ( ζ = 0.25). Other alleles had unclear effect on β-cryptoxanthin content in juice sac tissues of fruits. Finally, with regard to the violaxanthin content,  PSY-a had a weak positive effect ( ζ = 0.20), while  ZEP-c and  ZEP-e also had weak positive effects ( ζ = 0.24 and 0.34, respectively). Other alleles had unclear effect on violaxanthin content in juice sac tissues of fruits. Regarding the other carotenoids, several alleles in  PSY,  HYb, and  ZEP had a weak effect on increasing their content ( S2 Fig). Notably,  PSY-a had a broad effect on multiple carotenoids, except for lutein. Fig 8 shows the transmission of  PSY and  ZEP alleles in the lineage of ‘Tsunokagayaki’ in G3 and Kuchinotsu 52 gou in G4, which accumulate high concentrations of β-cryptoxanthin in juice sac tissues. The alleles of  PSY and  ZEP come from either allele in five founders of Kishu mikan ( PSY-a/ PSY-d;  ZEP-a/ZEP-b), sweet orange ( PSY-a/ PSY-c;  ZEP-a/ZEP-i), Kunenbo mandarin ( PSY-a/ PSY-d;  ZEP-a/ZEP-c), willow leaf mandarin ( PSY-a/ PSY-b;  ZEP-a/ZEP-a), and King mandarin ( PSY-a/ PSY-b;  ZEP-c/ZEP-e). During breeding selection aiming for enrichment of β-cryptoxanthin,  PSY-a and  ZEP-e (or  ZEP-a) were pyramided in those cultivars and breeding lines, thus confirming that  PSY-a and  ZEP-e had statically strong positive effects on the increase in total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits. These alleles would operate to increase β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin contents, although the effects were smaller compared to those exerted overall on the total carotenoid content. Of note, most alleles with negative effects on carotenoid content were, consistently, those alleles that disappeared during the progress of breeding generation. Verification of the effects of optimum  PSY and  ZEP alleles on increased carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits Box plot analysis was carried out to inspect the ability of  PSY and  ZEP optimum alleles with the strongest positive effects on total carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits.  Fig 9A revealed the distribution of total carotenoid content in six combinations of  PSY allele as follows: condition 1: a pair of negative alleles ( PSY-c or  PSY-g), condition 2: a single of negative alleles without an optimum allele  (PSY-a), condition 3: not including both optimum ( PSY-a) and negative alleles ( PSY-c or  PSY-g), condition 4: a single optimum allele ( PSY-a) and a single negative allele ( PSY-c or  PSY-g), condition 5: a single optimum allele ( PSY-a) without any negative allele ( PSY-c or  PSY-g); and condition 6, 2 optimum alleles ( PSY-a).When the mean values between conditions 2 and 3 were compared, it was clear that  PSY-c and  PSY-g had negative effects on reducing the carotenoid concentration. In contrast, the mean value of condition 6 with two  PSY-a alleles was 4.2 mg/100FWG, which was higher than those of conditions 3, 4, and 5. Interestingly, the allelic interaction between alleles with positive effect and negative effect would be observed in condition 4 In addition, the ability of 4  ZEP alleles ( ZEP-a,  ZEP-b,  ZEP-c, and  ZEP-e), which were identified to exert a positive effect on the total carotenoid content, was examined against the above six conditions of  PSY alleles ( Fig 9B). Under condition 3, which did not include any  PSY-a, the mean values of total carotenoid content increased proportionately with the number of  ZEP alleles. Under conditions 1 and 2, no consistent effect was observed along with an increase in the number of  ZEP alleles, indicating an epistatic interaction between the  PSY allele and  ZEP allele. This result was understandable as  PSY is located upstream of the carotenoid metabolic pathway compared to  ZEP. Consequently,  PSY alleles with negative effects could negate the effectiveness of  ZEP alleles with positive effects. Under condition 5, the mean values of total carotenoid content increased proportionately with the number of optimum  ZEP alleles. Under condition 6, the mean values of total carotenoid content with those  ZEP alleles were higher than those without them. Thus, these results confirmed that the optimum alleles of  PSY and  ZEP possess the capability of increasing carotenoid content in juice sac tissues of fruits. Box plot analysis was also carried out for β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin content ( S3 and  S4 Figs, respectively). With respect to β-cryptoxanthin, a slight effect of  PSY-a was observed on increasing the mean value, while  ZEP alleles with a positive effect clearly indicated that their numerical increase led to an increase in β-cryptoxanthin content. Furthermore, for violaxanthin, the increase in  PSY-a led to an increase in its mean value. In contrast, the numerical increase of  ZEP alleles with positive effects did not correlate with violaxanthin content, except for condition 5. These evaluation test results indicated that the optimum allele of  PSY-a emphatically had the ability to strengthen the flux of carotenoid metabolic pathway and increase total carotenoid content, along with an increase in β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin.  ZEP alleles with a positive effect also confirmed an increase in total carotenoids, and its effect preferentially increased β-cryptoxanthin content over violaxanthin content. It is considered that  ZEP alleles with positive alleles did not have a strong effect on increasing β-cryptoxanthin content by themselves, and they would likely synergistically increase β-cryptoxanthin content in cooperation with  PSY-a by the sandwich effect between upstream and downstream genes in the carotenoid pathway. Minimal set of trio-tagged SNPs to identify the optimum alleles of  PSY-a and  ZEP-e for marker-assisted selection Pyramiding for optimum alleles of  PSY-a and  ZEP-e would be promising for the enrichment of carotenoids, especially β-cryptoxanthin in juice sac tissues of fruits. To efficiently promote molecular breeding by marker-assisted selection (MAS), minimal sets of trio-tagged SNPs were evaluated using MinimalMarker software [ 35] in order to determine the optimum  PSY and  ZEP alleles among the others. For  PSY, MinimalMarker software revealed 45 minimal sets, which comprised different combinations of six trio-tagged SNPs, to discriminate any combination of the seven  PSY alleles. For example, PSY-SNP-05, PSY-SNP06, PSY-07, PSY-SNP08, PSY-SNP09, and PSY-SNP10 were one of the minimal sets to discriminate each other ( Table 3). Fortunately, the optimum  PSY-a allele could be discriminated with the other alleles by a single trio-tagged PSY-SNP06. For  ZEP, MinimalMarker software revealed a single minimal set comprising seven trio-tagged SNPs (ZEP-SNP01, ZEP-SNP03, ZEP-SNP05, ZEP-SNP14, ZEP-SNP17, ZEP-SNP20, and ZEP-SNP21) to discriminate each other ( Table 4). The optimum  ZEP-e allele could be discriminated with the other alleles by two trio-tagged ZEP-SNP17 and ZEP-SNP21. When the allelic genotypes for  PSY and  ZEP alleles in the parent varieties are available, the number of SNPs for MAS in their progenies will be smaller than the above calculated minimal sets. For example, the genotypes of seedlings from the cross between the seed parent with  ZEP-c and  ZEP-e and pollen parent with  ZEP-e and  ZEP-e would reveal homozygous genotypes of  ZEP-e or heterozygous genotypes of  ZEP-c and  ZEP-e. In this case, only one trio-tagged ZEP-SNP17 or ZEP-SNP20 was sufficient to discriminate the seedlings with homozygous genotypes of  ZEP-e ( Fig 10). Other trio-tagged SNPs, which were not included in the above minimal marker sets, are also applicable for MAS when they discriminated parent allelic genotypes. Recently, various SNP detection systems have been developed, such as the TaqMan-MGB SNP genotyping assay, Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR genotyping assay, and so on. SNP markers compatible with those systems could be customized based on the sequence information of trio-tagged SNPs listed in  S1 Table.","To enrich carotenoids, especially β-cryptoxanthin, in juice sac tissues of fruits via molecular breeding in citrus, allele mining was utilized to dissect allelic variation of carotenoid metabolic genes and identify an optimum allele on the target loci characterized by expression quantitative trait (eQTL) analysis. SNPs of target carotenoid metabolic genes in 13 founders of the Japanese citrus breeding population were explored using the SureSelect target enrichment method. An independent allele was determined based on the presence or absence of reliable SNPs, using trio analysis to confirm inheritability between parent and offspring. Among the 13 founders, there were 7 PSY alleles, 7 HYb alleles, 11 ZEP alleles, 5 NCED alleles, and 4 alleles for the eQTL that control the transcription levels of PDS and ZDS among the ancestral species, indicating that some founders acquired those alleles from them. The carotenoid composition data of 263 breeding pedigrees in juice sac tissues revealed that the phenotypic variance of carotenoid composition was similar to that in the 13 founders, whereas the mean of total carotenoid content increased. This increase in total carotenoid content correlated with the increase in either or both β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin in juice sac tissues. Bayesian statistical analysis between allelic composition of target genes and carotenoid composition in 263 breeding pedigrees indicated that PSY-a and ZEP-e alleles at PSY and ZEP loci had strong positive effects on increasing the total carotenoid content, including β-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin, in juice sac tissues. Moreover, the pyramiding of these alleles also increased the β-cryptoxanthin content. Interestingly, the offset interaction between the alleles with increasing and decreasing effects on carotenoid content and the epistatic interaction among carotenoid metabolic genes were observed and these interactions complexed carotenoid profiles in breeding population. These results revealed that allele composition would highly influence the carotenoid composition in citrus fruits. The allelic genotype information for the examined carotenoid metabolic genes in major citrus varieties and the trio-tagged SNPs to discriminate the optimum alleles (PSY-a and ZEP-e) from the rest would promise citrus breeders carotenoid enrichment in fruit via molecular breeding.",NaN,"['ZEP alleles', 'carotenoid content', 'alleles', 'ZEP', 'total carotenoid', 'PSY', 'carotenoid', 'content', 'PSY alleles', 'trio-tagged SNPs']","[SNP, SNP, Ciclev10011841m.g, Ciclev10005481m.g, Ciclev10025089m.g, HiSeq2500, CLC, CLC, SNP, ’s, SNP, TASUKE, MiGD [ 19, SNP, GGPP, ZDS, ζ-carotene desaturase, HYb, β-carotene hydroxylase, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, 9- cis-epoxycarotenoid, “MARCO”, trio-tagged, trio-tagged, PSY-a-gf2, trio-tagged, SNP, trio-tagged, trio-tagged, trio-tagged, ’, ‘, ’, ‘Setoka’, G4, ‘, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, G4, t-violaxanthin, c-violaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, G4, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, β-cryptoxanthin, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, β-cryptoxanthin, Kuchinotsu 52, G4, β-cryptoxanthin, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, mg/100FWG, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, ζ, ζ, ζ, ζ, ζ, -0.59, ζ, β-cryptoxanthin, ζ, ζ, ζ, β-cryptoxanthin, ζ, ζ, Kuchinotsu 52, G4, β-cryptoxanthin, PSY-a/ PSY-d, PSY-a/ PSY-c, PSY-a/ PSY-d, PSY-a/ PSY-b, PSY-a/ PSY-b, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, PSY-c, PSY-a, PSY-a, PSY-c, PSY-a, PSY-c, PSY-a, PSY-c, PSY-a).When, 3, PSY-c, mg/100FWG, ZEP-a, 2, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, trio-tagged, β-cryptoxanthin, trio-tagged, MinimalMarker, MinimalMarker, trio-tagged, PSY-SNP-05, PSY-SNP06, PSY-07, PSY-SNP08, PSY-SNP09, PSY-SNP10, MinimalMarker, trio-tagged, ZEP-SNP01, ZEP-SNP03, ZEP-SNP05, ZEP-SNP14, ZEP-SNP17, ZEP-SNP20, ZEP-SNP21, trio-tagged ZEP-SNP17, ZEP-SNP21, trio-tagged ZEP-SNP17, ZEP-SNP20, trio-tagged, SNP, trio-tagged]",[],[],['Citrus'],NaN

In contrast, the biosynthetic capability of fungi is relatively undervalued. Fungi (>3 million species) have enormous diversity and are rich in biocatalysts and secondary metabolites 15–  17. In particular, fungi produce a large portfolio of volatile terpenoids, including sesquiterpenes (e.g., β-caryophyllene and cubenol 18) and monoterpenes (linalool 14, limonene 14, and 1,8-cineole 19). To our knowledge, to date, there are only a few fungal monoterpene synthases reported in the literature (Hyp3, a 1,8-cineole synthase 19 and the very recently identified PpSTS25, a bifunctional myrcene/linalool synthase 20). Here we address this gap and specifically explored fungal linalool synthases. Identification of linalool synthase in agaric mushroom As  A. aegerita is known to produce linalool and its genome has been recently sequenced 21, we tried to identify the linalool synthase in its genome. In our previous study, we identified 11 putative sesquiterpene synthases and 9 of them are functional and produced various sesquiterpenes but not linalool 3. A re-evaluation of the raw genomic data led to an additional putative TPS sequence (AAE3_109435, accession number MN954676). The gene exists in the Illumina sequencing data, whereas it is absent in the PacBio results. PCR amplification of the AAE3_109435 with subsequent sequencing confirmed the presence of the gene in the genome (Supplementary Fig.  S1). The subsequent expression of AAE3_109435 in a GPP-accumulating  E. coli that co-expressed the native enzymes DXS, IDI, and ispA_S80F mutant (GPPS). The resulting strain (GPPS+9435) produced the acyclic monoterpene linalool as the main product and small amount of nerolidol (Fig.  2 and mass spectra in Supplementary Fig.  S2). Geraniol was detected in GPPS+9435 as well as in its control strain (GPPS_ctrl), indicating that geraniol is not the product of AAE3_109435 but instead that of native  E. coli enzymes (such as PhoA, a phosphatase, and NudB, a Nudix hydrolase 22). Furthermore, AAE3_109435 was expressed in the  E. coli strain that accumulates FPP by overexpressing DXS and IDI (without ispA_S80F), and the strain was named ‘FPPS+9435.’ Its main product (>96% regarding the peak area of all the detected terpenes) was nerolidol and only traces of linalool could be detected (Fig.  2A). The control strain (FPPS_ctrl) with an empty vector produced neither linalool nor nerolidol. The results clearly proved that the TPS coded by AAE3_109435 is a bifunctional LNS, which is able to convert FPP into nerolidol and GPP into linalool. Accordingly, it is named Aa.LNS. Furthermore, the linalool produced by Aa.LNS is mainly ( R)-linalool (95% ee, Fig.  2B). Bioinformatics prediction of other fungal LNSs Aa.LNS was used to probe other potential fungal LNSs. The first focus was on  A. pediades, another sequenced fungal species of the genus  Agrocybe. Linalool was detected in the headspace of  A. pediades cultures grown in malt extract medium in our laboratory. A blast search of Aa.LNS against the  A. pediades genome using the online tool of the Joint Genome Institute ( https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Agrped1/Agrped1.home.html) resulted in 11 TPS homologs (Fig.  2C). To improve the prediction confidence, we combined two strategies: (1) full-sequence alignment (Fig.  2C and protein sequence in Supplementary Data  1) and (2) comparison of predicted active sites (Supplementary Tables  S1 and  S2, the results were analyzed with 4LXW (Epi-isozizaene synthase from  Streptomyces coelicolor) and 5NX5 (PDB ID, the bacterial linalool synthase from  Streptomyces clavuligerus, or Sc.LNS) as templates). Here 4LXW and 5NX5 are chosen based on the two criteria: (1) the higher sequence similarity to Aa.LNS and (2) the availability of large ligands (either substrate or product analogs) in the crystal structures, which can facilitate the identification of the active-site residues. Four TPS homologs (Agrped1_820868, Agrped1_694262, Agrped1_689671, and Agrped1_689675) were found to be closely related to Aa.LNS (Fig.  2C). It was hypothesized that the two enzymes Agrped1_820868 and Agrped1_694262 are more similar to Agr8 (a γ-muurolene/β-cadinene synthase) 3 as all three enzymes share almost identical active sites based on our algorithm (Supplementary Table  S1). Hence, we studied Agrped1_689671 and Agrped1_689675. As predicted, the strain expressing Agrped1_689671 produced linalool and nerolidol (renamed Ap.LNS) similar to Aa.LNS (Fig.  2D). Surprisingly, linalool was the sole terpene product of the  E. coli clone expressing Agrped1_689675, indicating that it is a monofunctional linalool synthase (renamed Ap.LS). This attributes to the high specificity of Ap.LS, which is underpinned by the fact that FPP is more abundant in microbial cells than GPP 13. The high specificity of Ap.LS is very interesting, possibly due to steric hindrance of some amino acid residues surrounding the binding pocket to the larger substrate FPP. And we will look into this in the later section of this article. In addition, Ap.LS produced the enantiopure ( R)-linalool (Fig.  2B). Next, we asked whether we could use Ap.LS to probe other fungal linalool synthases. We carried out a UniProt BLAST search of Ap.LS and collected those hits with the highest alignment score (score >700, Supplementary Fig.  S3): three from  Galerina marginata (Galma_223690, UniProt ID A0A067THX9; Galma_63556, A0A067T8I8; Galma_266794, A0A067T571); two from  Hypholoma sublateritium (Hypsu1_148365, A0A0D2NH86; Hypsu1_148385, A0A0D2NA50), and one from  Hebeloma cylindrosporum (M413_27416, A0A0C2YLE7). Four of them (Galma_223690, Galma_63556, Hypsu1_148365, and Hypsu1_148385) clustered into a branch or subgroup with Ap.LS and Ap.LNS in both analyses using full-sequence and active-site alignment (Fig.  3A, B and protein sequence in Supplementary Data  1). Overall, the six homologs share >90% identity of active-site residues (Supplementary Tables  S1 and  S2). Particularly, the active sites of Hypsu1_148385 and Galma_223690 show 95% (36/38) and 97–100% (37–38/38) identity with that of Ap.LS and Ap.LNS, respectively, indicating that they are potential fungal LNSs. The other two amino acid sequences (Galma_266794 and M413_27416) were more closely related to Agr8, with as high as 95% active-site identity (Supplementary Table  S1). Thus it was hypothesized that they were more likely to produce 1,10 cyclization products of FPP, e.g., muurolene, cadinene. This hypothesis was validated by the expression of Galma_223690, Hypsu1_148385, or Galma_266794 in the FPP-accumulating  E. coli. As predicted, Galma_223690 and Hypsu1_148385 were found to be bifunctional LNSs (Fig.  3C), thus renamed Gm.LNS and Hs.LNS, respectively. Moreover, like Agr8, the strain expressing Galma_266794 produced germacrene D (1,10 cyclization) as the main product and a few minor products (γ-muurolene and (+)-δ-cadinene, Supplementary Fig.  S4), thus validating our hypothesis. Here the synergistic use of BLAST search, full-sequence alignment, and active-site alignment was explored. As such, we achieved a relatively high predictability of hunting for biocatalysts of the same function (e.g., linalool synthases). Such a method can be potentially applied for the identification of all kinds of enzymes. BLAST search helps with identifying overall similar enzymes that form our initial screening candidates. Full-sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree facilitate the classification of enzymes. Different classes often have distinct catalytic functions (e.g., different cyclization positions). Active-site prediction further supplements the prediction with two main roles. One is to filter out those enzyme candidates with incomplete binding pockets (e.g., Agr11 is missing the NSE triad, Supplementary Tables  S1 and  S2). The other is to complement the enzyme classification of full-sequence alignment. This is based on the hypothesis that enzymes of the same function may have overall low similarity but more conserved active sites. For example, the Galma_266794 shares comparable full-sequence similarities with Ap.LS (61%) and Agr8 (62%); however, it has much higher active-site identity with Agr8 (95%) than with Ap.LS (71%, Supplementary Table  S1). Indeed, the products of Galma_266794 are similar to that of Agr8. Purification and characterization of fungal linalool synthases and LNSs To date, a number of plant linalool synthases and LNSs have been identified. However, only one bacterial LNS from  S. clavuligerus was recently identified 11, which only shares 15.2% identity with Ap.LS (Supplementary Fig.  S5). With the fungal enzymes studied in this work, linalool synthases and LNSs in three kingdoms have been identified. Next, we sought to compare their catalytic activities and mechanisms by in vitro, in vivo assays, sequence alignments, and three-dimensional (3D) structural models. Protein purification is the prerequisite to study the in vitro kinetics of the fungal enzymes. Though all the five bacterial strains expressing fungal enzymes produced linalool, their expression levels in  E. coli were largely different. Aa.LNS had the highest expression level, followed by Gm.LNS, Ap.LNS, and Ap.LS. The expression of Hs.LNS (Hypsu_148385) was so low that it was not detectable in a protein gel (Supplementary Fig.  S6A). As Aa.LNS had the highest expression level and Ap.LS is the only specific monoterpene synthase, they were chosen as the representatives of fungal LNS and linalool synthase for further studies. However, none of them was soluble based on solubility analysis with B-PER II reagent (Thermo Scientific™) (Supplementary Fig.  S6A). Many approaches were tested but failed to improve their solubility (such as abiotic condition optimization: lowering incubation temperature, tuning inducer dosages, media additives, and protein fusion). Refolding of insoluble fraction could be another solution which we did not test because it is very time-consuming to optimize the best conditions. The N-terminal fusion of Aa.LNS with a maltose-binding protein or thioredoxin did not help (Supplementary Fig.  S6B). Different chaperone systems (DnaK-dnaJ, GroES-GroEL) and trigger factor (TF) in  E. coli were further tested. It was found that TF chaperone could slightly improve the solubility of the synthases. With the optimal condition (3.3 mM arabinose to induce TF chaperone and 0.1 mM IPTG to induce Aa.LNS, Supplementary Fig.  S7) and further separation by size exclusion chromatography, we managed to purify enough soluble Aa.LNS for in vitro characterization. Yet its purity was quite low with ~16.3% (Fig.  4A and full gel image at Supplementary Fig.  S10). In contrast, relatively high purity of soluble Ap.LS (~71.2%) was obtained with the same experimental conditions (Fig.  4B and full gel image at Supplementary Fig.  S11). Consistent with the  E. coli cultures producing the respective synthase, purified enzymes reconfirmed that Aa.LNS can use FPP and GPP to produce nerolidol and linalool, respectively. However, Ap.LS was only active with GPP but not with FPP (Fig.  4). Based on the data in Fig.  4A, B (Supplementary Data  2 and  3),  Km and  kcat values of Ap.LS and Aa.LNS were calculated. The  Km and  kcat values of Aa.LNS for FPP were 9.0 ± 2.3 μM and 3.3 ± 0.3 min −1, respectively, and slightly lower for GPP with 6.7 ± 4.6 μM and 0.5 ± 0.1 min −1, respectively (Table  1). The  Km value of Ap.LS for GPP with 3.8 ± 0.7 μM was slightly lower than that for Aa.LNS, whereas  kcat was much higher with 6 ± 0.3 min −1. To compare the catalytic efficiencies among the known linalool synthases and LNSs,  kcat/ Km value of Ap.LS was the highest, which is about 21-fold, 29-fold, 3-fold, and 4-fold higher than that of Aa.LNS, La.LS (Q2XSC5) from  Lavandula angustifolia (Lavender) 5, Ma.LS (Q8H2B4) from  Mentha aquatica23, and of the bacterial Sc.LNS 11, respectively. As for Aa.LNS as a nerolidol synthase, although the  kcat value of Aa.LNS for FPP was more than five times lower compared to the bacterial one, the  Km value was similar to that of the bacterial Sc.LNS 11 and about half as that of Zm.LNS from  Zea mays (Maize) (Table  1) 24. In vivo activity comparison of linalool synthases and LNSs from three kingdoms and applications in linalool production Due to potential issues such as poor expression and solubility when expressed in cells and the localization difference (cytosolic/membrane bound in vivo versus a one-pot aqueous reaction), the advantages of in vitro enzyme kinetics (Table  1) may not be readily transferable into cellular applications, such as metabolic engineering, where in vivo activities are more critical than in vitro ones. To test the best candidate for microbial linalool production, our previously engineered  E. coli strain was used to compare linalool synthases from three kingdoms: Ap.LS, Sc.LNS, and Cb.LS from  Clarkia breweri (Q96376) as representatives for fungi, bacteria, and plantae, respectively. They were separately cloned into pET-11a vector (Novagen). Together with a p15A vector carrying the whole mevalonate pathway genes 2, the bacterial strains grown in ZYM media produced linalool at 381.2, 8.7 and 1.3 mg/L for fungal, bacterial, and plant linalool synthases, respectively (Fig.  4C). The linalool yield using Ap.LS (fungal) is about 44- and 287-fold as high as that using Sc.LNS (bacterial) and Cb.LS (plant), respectively. As the bacterial densities for different strains are similar, around 10–12 (Fig.  4D), the high yield of linalool in the Ap.LS strain was because of its relatively high in vivo activity (here we refer to the total activity that is the result of both the specific activity and the amount of active enzyme) but not of biomass. A previous study also supported that the bacterial Sc.LNS is better than plant linalool synthases in linalool production in terrific broth (TB) media 10. In the same TB media, the linalool titers reached 601.2 mg/L for Ap.LS stain, about 65% higher than previously reported using Sc.LNS 10. Our study demonstrated that fungal Ap.LS is even superior to the bacterial one, in both activity and selectivity. Although Sc.LNS has a higher activity than plant Cb.LS, it prefers FPP (lower  Km and higher  kcat) to GPP as the substrate 11. Therefore, Sc.LNS produced a larger amount of nerolidol than linalool in  E. coli whose cytosol contained both FPP and GPP; in contrast, Ap.LS produced 100% linalool. High activity contributes to high titers, rates, and yields (TRYs) of linalool production and low manufacturing cost. High specificity would greatly simplify the downstream purification process and further reduce the overall production cost. The superior activity and selectivity of Ap.LS make it more suitable for microbial production of linalool than its plant and bacterial counterparts. Thus, this study sets up a foundation for future works of linalool bioproduction that is greener, safer, sustainable, and of exceptional enantiopurity (( R)-linalool), as compared to chemical synthesis. However, to translate into commercial applications, more studies are required to further improve the linalool TRYs and to overcome the toxicity issue of linalool, which can be addressed by genetic engineering (e.g., metabolic engineering, efflux transporter engineering 25), directed evolution, and bioprocess developments (e.g., in situ product remove fermentation using suitable liquid solvents and/or solid absorbents) 26. Structural comparison of linalool synthases and LNSs from three kingdoms (plants, fungi, and bacteria) Next, we generated a phylogenetic tree with 35 plant enzymes (including 4 nerolidol synthases, 9 linalool synthases and 22 LNSs), 1 bacterial LNS (D5SL78), and 9 fungal enzymes (Supplementary Table  S3). The enzymes were clearly separated into two major clades (one is plant, clade 1, and the other is microbial, clade 2, Fig.  5). The bacterial LNS was closer to the fungal ones, in clade 2. Specifically, the sequence identity among fungal, bacterial, and plant LNSs or linalool synthases are only 8–15%, which includes those metal-binding sites (Supplementary Fig.  S5). Overall, plant linalool synthases/LNSs are larger with 500–900 amino acids than microbial ones with 300–400 amino acids. One particular enzyme D8RNZ9, which is a LNS isolated from the nonseed plant  Selaginella moellendorffii (Spikemoss) 27, is more closely related to the bacterial LNS than plant LNSs. It was hypothesized that it could stem from horizontal gene transfer from microbes to plants or that seed plants lost these LNS enzymes during evolution from nonseed plants 27. The phylogenetic tree indicates the evolutionary divergence of fungal, bacterial, and plant linalool synthases and LNSs. Subsequently, we compared the protein structures of the linalool synthases from the fungus ( A. pediades), the bacterium ( S. clavuligerus), and the plant ( M. aquatica). The crystal structure of Sc.LNS is 5NX5 (PDB ID) 10. The homolog models of Ap.LS and Ma.LS (Q8H2B4) were built based on the crystal structure of (+)-bornyl diphosphate synthase from  Salvia officinalis (1N1B/1N21) 28 and 1,8-cineole synthase from  S. clavuligerus (5NX7) 10, respectively. As the sequence similarity between Ap.LS and 1,8-cineole is only 20.3% (and active-site identity is 49%), the Ap.LS model may have some deviations from its real structure. Nevertheless, their active-site regions are highly conserved (Fig.  6A). Fungal linalool synthase and bacterial linalool synthase are much more similar to each other than to plant linalool synthase in both active-site regions (Supplementary Table  S4) and overall structures (Fig.  6B–D). As a typical plant monoterpene synthase, Ma.LS has two domains (α and β domains) and thus is noticeably larger than the other two synthases with active site residing only in the α domain (catalytic domain, Supplementary Fig.  S8). In contrast, microbial linalool synthases, Sc.LNS and Ap.LS, are similar to typical class I terpene cyclases with a single domain, despite with acyclic products (Supplementary Fig.  S9). Both GPP (its analog, 2-fluorogeranyl diphosphate) and FPP were docked into the three models. We mainly analyzed the interactions of the three linalool synthases with GPP. With 9 hydrophobic interactions with GPP, Ap.LS had the highest amount, as compared to 7 of Sc.LNS and 6 of Ma.LS (Fig.  6B–D). Except for the negatively charged pyrophosphate (Ppi) head, GPP is largely hydrophobic, thus these hydrophobic interactions may contribute to the high activity of Ap.LS. The number of hydrogen bonds identified for the three enzymes was similar. In addition, Ap.LS had the highest binding affinity (−7.6 kcal/mol) to GPP, followed by Sc.LNS (−7 kcal/mol) and Ma.LS (−6.4 kcal/mol). The binding affinity inversely correlated with the  Km values of the three enzymes (Table  1), where higher binding affinity contributed to a lower  Km value. As compared for Ap.LS and Ap.LNS, Ap.LS has higher binding affinity to GPP than Ap.LNS (−7.3 kcal/mol) but lower binding affinity (−8.5 kcal/mol) to FPP than Ap.LNS (−9.0 kcal/mol). The binding affinity data are nicely correlated with their difference in monoterpene and sesquiterpene activities. Furthermore, we superimposed the 3D structures of the active sites of the three enzymes (Fig.  7A and Supplementary Table  S4). Residues in the binding pocket of plant linalool synthase showed the greatest divergence (green regions, Fig.  7A), although structure folding remains conserved. Overall, as shown in the gray regions (Fig.  7A) and highlighted in Supplementary Table  S4, there were 8 conserved residues among the three enzymes, including the aspartate-rich motif, D(D/E)XXD, responsible for Mg 2+ cofactor and substrate binding 1 and NSE triad, (N/D)Dxx(S/T)xxxE, responsible for the substrate binding and coordination of the diphosphate and trinuclear Mg 2+ [PPi-(Mg 2+) 3] cluster 1. All these structural analyses partially explain the activity difference among the three linalool synthases from different kingdoms. Nevertheless, there are other factors that might also contribute to the high in vivo activity of Ap.LS in  E. coli, such as the non-active-site residues, protein expression, and solubility (Supplementary Fig.  S6). Through the structural comparison of linalool synthases from different species, we have observed that the binding affinities of enzymes to the substrates (GPP or FPP) nicely correlated with their activities, especially the  Km values, where higher binding affinity typically contributes to a lower  Km value. However, it is much more complex to explain the difference in  kcat values, due to the large structural difference among these enzymes. To address these, molecular dynamics simulation is advantageous in evaluating the dynamic interactions between enzyme and substrates, intermediates, and products. To do that, it is more appropriate to use the accurate crystal structures of these enzymes, which is one of our future works. Mechanism study on the Ap.LS selectivity Lastly, we attempted to understand the specificity of Ap.LS as compared to other fungal LNSs. Particularly, Ap.LNS and Ap.LS share the highest identity 77.9%; hence, we compared their difference of residues surrounding the substrate-binding pocket. In total, five residues were found to be different (Fig.  7B and Supplementary Table  S5): (1) in the Ppi head region (A59:S58, E316:Q315, I153:V152, here, the former and latter residues refer to that of Ap.LS and Ap.LNS, respectively, especially that E316 is expected to have charged interactions with the Ppi group of GPP/FPP); (2) in the FPP tail region (L60:M59, which could affect the interaction with FPP); and (3) in GPP tail region (G181:A180, which might affect flexibility of helix where the tail end of GPP resides). A series of single mutants were constructed for Ap.LS, A59S, L60M, G181A, and E316Q. However, none of these single mutants had effect on the selectivity of Ap.LS (Fig.  7E). We speculated that the specificity might be the synergistic result of multiple residues. The region A59–L60 was particularly interesting, as A59 and L60 are in close proximity to both the Ppi head and hydrocarbon tail of FPP (Fig.  7D). Indeed, the combination of A59S and L60M mutations resulted in the production of a trace amount of nerolidol, ~2% of total amount of linalool and nerolidol produced (Fig.  7C, E), which indicated that the two mutations are sufficient to convert Ap.LS from a monofunctional linalool synthase to a bifunctional LNS. Adjacent to A59–L60, another residue is also different between Ap.LS (V61) and Ap.LNS (I60). Although single mutation V61I had no effect on the selectivity of the wild-type Ap.LS, the introduction of V61I enhanced the nerolidol production by 12-fold (~40% of total linalool and nerolidol produced) and decreased linalool production by 45% on the basis of the double mutant A59S–L60M (Fig.  7C, E). It seems that the mutation L60M–A59S favors sesquiterpene activity (nerolidol formation) by stabilizing the ligand in a favorable position (A59S) and by promoting the easier leave of the Ppi group from the binding pocket (L60M, Fig.  7D). The third mutation V61I further enhances the effect by pushing M60 and S59 closer to FPP (Fig.  7D). In addition, we also combined the mutations of two regions and obtained the quadruple mutant A59S–L60M–V61I–E316Q; however, it did not further increase nerolidol production. Furthermore, we observed that the wild-type Gm.LNS, whose corresponding residues are more similar to those 59–61 of Ap.LS (S59:A59, L60:L60, V61:V61, Supplementary Fig.  S9), produced the highest amount of linalool (15%) among all the wild-type fungal LNSs (Fig.  3C). As such, we concluded that the region residues (A59–V61) play an essential role for the high specificity of Ap.LS. Lastly, we further tested whether the mutation of the same region could change the selectivity of Ap.LNS to produce only linalool. By introducing 5 mutations (S58A+M59L+I60V+T62P+V63L, or “58–63” mutant in Fig.  7F) or 6 mutations (S58A+M59L+I60V+T62P+V63L+E64G, or “58–64” mutant), linalool percentage was increased from 11% (wild type) to 86% (“58–64” mutant). However, none of the mutation could completely eliminate the nerolidol production, indicating that additional residues are also playing roles in regulating the selectivity. Here, aided by structural comparison of Ap.LS and Ap.LNS, we managed to identify the key residues that alter the selectivity of Ap.LS. The success here has two broad meanings. First, such a structure-based method is of general application in understanding the catalytic mechanism. Our method works even without protein crystal structures but using homology model. And recent achievement by the Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2 ( https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology) can further support our method. Second, the identification of key residues inspires future studies, such as the rational design and engineering of linalool synthases, nerolidol synthases, or bifunctional linalool and nerolidol synthases. More broadly, it might also encourage studies in understanding the selectivities of various TPSs. It was known that some are highly specific and have only a single product, whereas others have multiple products, particularly, the γ-humulene synthase from  Abies grandis, which generates 52 different sesquiterpenes 29. The underlying catalytic mechanism is fascinating but not fully understood. Our study here provides some insights, and further research is required.","Enzymes empower chemical industries and are the keystone for metabolic engineering. For example, linalool synthases are indispensable for the biosynthesis of linalool, an important fragrance used in 60-80% cosmetic and personal care products. However, plant linalool synthases have low activities while expressed in microbes. Aided by bioinformatics analysis, four linalool/nerolidol synthases (LNSs) from various Agaricomycetes were accurately predicted and validated experimentally. Furthermore, we discovered a linalool synthase (Ap.LS) with exceptionally high levels of selectivity and activity from Agrocybe pediades, ideal for linalool bioproduction. It effectively converted glucose into enantiopure (R)-linalool in Escherichia coli, 44-fold and 287-fold more efficient than its bacterial and plant counterparts, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the divergent evolution paths for plant, bacterial and fungal linalool synthases. More critically, structural comparison provided catalytic insights into Ap.LS superior specificity and activity, and mutational experiments validated the key residues responsible for the specificity.",NaN,"['Supplementary Fig.', 'Fig.', 'linalool synthases', 'linalool', 'Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary', 'Ap.LS', 'synthases', 'FPP', 'GPP']","[β-caryophyllene, PpSTS25, AAE3_109435, MN954676, AAE3_109435, AAE3_109435, ispA_S80F mutant, GPPS, GPPS+9435, GPPS+9435, GPPS_ctrl, AAE3_109435, PhoA, NudB, AAE3_109435, ’ Its, FPPS_ctrl, AAE3_109435, https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Agrped1/Agrped1.home.html, 4LXW (Epi-isozizaene synthase, 5NX5 (PDB ID, 4LXW, 5NX5, Agrped1_820868, Agrped1_694262, Agrped1_689671, Agrped1_689675, Agrped1_694262, Agr8, Agrped1_689671, Agrped1_689675, Agrped1_689671, Ap, Agrped1_689675, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, Galma_223690, A0A067THX9, Galma_63556, A0A067T8I8, Galma_266794, A0A067T571, Hypsu1_148365, A0A0D2NH86, Hypsu1_148385, A0A0D2NA50, M413_27416, A0A0C2YLE7, Galma_223690, Galma_63556, Hypsu1_148365, Ap, Ap, B, Hypsu1_148385, Galma_223690 show 95, 97–100, Ap, Ap, Galma_266794, M413_27416, Agr8, Galma_223690, Hypsu1_148385, Galma_266794, Galma_223690, Hypsu1_148385, Agr8, Galma_266794, Agr11, NSE, Ap, Agr8, Agr8, Ap, Agr8, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, B-PER II reagent, thioredoxin, DnaK-dnaJ, TF chaperone, TF chaperone, Ap, ~71.2, Ap, B (Supplementary Data  2, Ap, 3.3 ± , −1, −1, Ap, −1, Ap, Q8H2B4, cytosolic/membrane, Ap, Novagen, Ap, 10–12, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, TRYs, Ap, 8–15, 500–900 amino, Ap, Q8H2B4, Ap, Ap, α, β, α domain, Ap, class I terpene cyclases, Ap, Ap, Ap, −7.6 , −7, −6.4 , Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, −7.3 , −8.5 , Ap, −9.0 , D(D/E)XXD, Mg 2+, NSE, (N/D)Dxx(S/T)xxxE, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, A59:S58, E316:Q315, I153:V152, Ap, Ap, Ppi, L60:M59, G181:A180, Ap, A59S, G181A, Ap, A59–L60, FPP (, A59S, Ap, A59–L60, Ap, Ap, V61I, Ap, V61I, L60M–A59S, Ppi, V61I, M60, S59, A59S–L60M–V61I–E316Q, 59–61, Ap, S59:A59, L60:L60, V61:V61, Ap, Ap, S58A+M59L+I60V+T62P+V63L, “58–63”, S58A+M59L+I60V+T62P+V63L+E64G, “58–64”, “58–64”, Ap, Ap, Ap, DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs.']",[],[],terpene synthase

Terpenoid Metabolites of Red and Green Prickly Ash at Three Developmental Stages To study the synthesis and accumulation of terpenoids in fruits, the total terpenoid contents of fruits from different developmental stages of green and red prickly ash ( Figure 1a) were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Sixty-one terpenoids were identified from red prickly ash and 41 from green prickly ash ( Table S1). Sixteen terpenoids were also detected in prickly ash fruit using LC-MS ( Table S2). In the early stage of fruit development (R1), the total terpenoid content of red prickly ash was 193.34 mg/100 g ( Figure 1b). In the middle stage (R2), it rose to 297.93 mg/100 g, and at the mature stage, it dropped to 238.51 mg/100 g. The total terpenoid content of green prickly ash fruit rose from the early stage of development (G1) to 419.39 mg/100 g at the mature stage (G3). The total terpenoid content was significantly higher (1.73-fold) in green prickly ash than in red prickly ash. Piperitone was the most abundant terpenoid in green prickly ash fruit, whereas limonene was the most abundant in red prickly ash. Twenty-two monoterpenoids, 34 sesquiterpenes, four diterpenes, and one tetraterpene were detected in red prickly ash; 12 monoterpenes, 23 sesquiterpenes, two diterpenes, two triterpenes, and two tetraterpenes were detected in green prickly ash ( Figure 1c and  Figure 2a). Twenty-seven terpenoids were unique to red prickly ash, including limonene, nerol, and neral. Seven terpenoids were unique to green prickly ash, including (-)-myrtenol and caryophyllene oxide. Orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed on all samples. The abscissa represents the difference between groups, and the ordinate represents the difference within groups ( Figure S2). OPLS-DA results showed that the differences between the sample groups were large, whereas the differences within the groups were small. The percentage of variation explained by PC1 and PC2 in the principal components analysis (PCA) was 90.20% (PC1 + PC2), and these two PCs therefore represented the main characteristics of the sample ( Figure S1). Green and red prickly ash could be divided into two groups based on the terpenoid index, indicating that the two prickly ash types differed significantly in terpenoid composition and content. Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were the main terpenoid components of green and red prickly ash fruit, accounting for more than 99.9% of the total terpenoid content ( Figure 2b,c). By contrast, diterpenoids, triterpenoids, and tetraterpenoids accounted for less than 0.01% of the total content. The proportion of different terpenoids changed over the course of fruit development. During the development of green prickly ash fruit, the percentage of monoterpenoids rose from 44% to 58%, and that of sesquiterpenes dropped from 56% to 42%. The percentage of monoterpenoids in red prickly ash rose from 67% to 73%, and that of sesquiterpenes dropped from 33% to 27%. In general, the number of different terpenoids was higher in red than in green prickly ash fruit, but the total terpenoid content was significantly higher in green than in red fruit. Monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids were the main aroma components of prickly ash; the proportion of monoterpenoids increased and that of sesquiterpenes declined over the course of fruit development. Different terpenoid components and differences in relative terpenoid abundance were the main reasons for the difference in aroma between green and red prickly ash. 3.2. Differentially Expressed Genes in Red and Green Prickly Ash Fruit at Three Developmental Stages To study the molecular regulatory mechanisms of aroma substances during prickly ash fruit development, we performed transcriptome sequencing on green and red fruits at three developmental stages. Together, the 18 transcriptome samples produced 117.42 Gb of clean data, more than 5.71 Gb per sample, with a percentage of Q30 bases above 91.88%. The clean reads were compared and annotated, and 64,999 genes were obtained, 8036 of which were newly discovered. There were 2569 DEGs between different developmental stages of green prickly ash fruit, 135 of which were differentially expressed among all stages ( Figure 3a). There were 11,349 DEGs between different developmental stages of red prickly ash fruit, 359 of which were differentially expressed among all stages ( Figure 3b). To analyze the functions of DEGs during fruit development, KEGG enrichment analysis was performed on DEGs between the early (G1 and R1) and ripe fruit stage (G3 and R3) of the two species ( Figure 3c). The DEGs between early and ripe green fruits were enriched mainly in starch and sucrose metabolism (ko00500), phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (ko00940), flavonoid biosynthesis (ko00941), phenylalanine metabolism (ko00360), and ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis (ko00130). The DEGs between early and ripe red fruits were enriched mainly in starch and sucrose metabolism (ko00500), biosynthesis of amino acids (ko01230), carbon metabolism (ko01200), phenylalanine metabolism (ko00360), and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (ko00900) ( Figure 3d). We also performed KEGG enrichment analysis on DEGs between G3 and R3 to study differences in gene expression between the two varieties at the mature stage ( Figure 3e). These DEGs were enriched mainly in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. It should be noted that glyceraldehyde-3P, synthesized by the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, is the initial substrate of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway [ 40]. Many physiological processes are involved in the development of prickly ash fruit, including the synthesis of starch, sucrose, and amino acids. A large number of DEGs were related to terpenoid synthesis, which is the metabolic pathway that underlies the aroma difference between green and red prickly ash fruits. Furthermore, the difference in color between green and red prickly ash fruits is due mainly to differences in gene expression in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. 3.3. Identification of a WGCNA Module Related to Aroma Substances during Fruit Development of Green and Red Prickly Ash To investigate the molecular mechanism of aroma synthesis during fruit development in green and red prickly ash, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules with high gene co-expression. WGCNA divided the genes into 25 modules ( Figure 4a,b). There were over 1000 genes in the darkseagreen3, antiquewhite4, firebrick2, paleturquoise, and brown modules, whereas there were fewer than 100 genes in the sienna1, whitesmoke, antiquewhite2, lightslateblue, and deeppink1 modules. The darkseagreen3 module contained genes related to amino acid synthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, and carbon metabolism. These genes were negatively correlated with green prickly ash and positively correlated with red prickly ash. The brown module contained genes related to genetic information processing, including ribosome, RNA transport, spliceosome, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Genes from these pathways were positively correlated with green prickly ash and negatively correlated with red prickly ash ( Figure 4c). The antiquewhite4 and firebrick2 modules were negatively correlated with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and starch and sucrose metabolism. Genes related to terpenoid synthesis were concentrated mainly in the paleturquoise (14 genes), coral3 (13), and navajowhite1 (7) modules. These three modules had a high positive correlation with the early stage of fruit development in red prickly ash (R1) and a negative correlation with the early stage of fruit development in green prickly ash (G1) ( Figure 4d). The results showed that there were differences in the synthesis of secondary metabolites and plant hormone-related signal transduction between green and red prickly ash. Moreover, differences in the expression patterns of genes related to terpene synthesis in green and red fruits may be the main reason for the differences in their aroma components and contents. 3.4. Expression Patterns of Genes Related to the Terpene Synthesis Pathway The synthesis of terpenes occurs primarily through the mevalonate (MVA) and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathways [ 41]. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying aroma differences between green and red prickly ash, we analyzed the expression patterns of 41 genes related to terpene synthesis in the MVA and MEP pathways ( Figure 5,  Table S3). Reactions of the MVA pathway occur mainly in the cytoplasm, beginning with the condensation of acetyl CoA. Two acetyl CoA are condensed in a reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (ACAT) to form acetoacetyl CoA, and acetoacetyl CoA and acetyl CoA are then condensed by 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS) to produce 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA). HMG-CoA is reduced to mevalonic acid in a reaction catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR). Mevalonate is acted upon successively by mevalonate kinase (MVK), phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), and mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase (MVD) to form isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) can be interconverted through the action of isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase (IDI). Two IPP and one DMAPP undergo a two-step condensation reaction to produce farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). FPP can be used to synthesize sesquiterpenoids and triterpenoids through the activities of various enzymes. For example, germacrene D synthase (GDS) catalyzes the production of germacrene (a sesquiterpene) from FPP, and lupeol synthase (LUP) catalyzes the formation of lupeol (a triterpenoid) from FPP. The MEP pathway takes place in the plastids, including chloroplasts, chromoplasts, and leucoplasts. Pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate are the initial precursors of the MEP pathway. They are acted upon by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) to form 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP). DXP is converted to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR). MEP is acted upon by 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (MCT) to form 4-diphosphocytidyl-methylerythritol (CDP-ME), and CDP-ME is transformed into 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl-4-diphosphate (HMBPP) by 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (CMK) and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (HDS). Finally, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase (HDR) catalyzes the formation of IPP and DMAPP from HMBPP. IPP and DMAPP are condensed to form geranyl diphosphate (GPP) by farnesyl diphosphate synthase/geranyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS/GPS), and GPP is the biosynthetic precursor of monoterpenoids, ubiquinone, and other terpene quinones. For example, linalool synthase (LIS) uses GPP to form linalool (a monoterpenoid), and monoterpenes are the main components of prickly ash terpenoids. GPP is used to produce geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) through multiple reactions, and GGPP is the precursor of diterpenoids, tetraterpenoids, ubiquinone, and other terpenoid quinones. We measured the expression of 41 genes in the terpene biosynthesis pathway throughout the development of green and red prickly ash fruit and found that their expression patterns were quite different ( Figure 5). Some genes had low expression in green prickly ash and high expression in red prickly ash (e.g.,  HMGR2,  IPI/IDI2, and  IPI/IDI2), whereas others showed the opposite pattern (e.g.,  MVK1 and  MVK2). During the development of green prickly ash, most terpene synthesis genes had the highest expression levels at the middle stage of fruit development (G2), suggesting that this is the key stage for terpenoid synthesis in green prickly ash. In mature red prickly ash fruit (R3), all terpene-related genes were downregulated except for LIS, suggesting that the rate of terpenoid synthesis is lower during the mature period in red fruit. 3.5. Correlations Between Terpenoid Contents and Expression of Terpenoid Synthesis Genes We conducted intergroup correlation analysis and RDA analysis on terpenoid content and terpene synthesis-related gene expression during the development of prickly ash fruit to identify key genes in terpenoid synthesis ( Figure 6). The intergroup correlation heat map showed differences in the correlations between specific genes and terpenoids, indicating that individual genes have different functions in terpenoid synthesis. Piperitone, the terpenoid with the highest content in green prickly ash fruits, had the highest correlations with  HDS2,  MVK2, and  MVD, followed by  HMGR1,  DXS1, and  GDS2. α-Pinene, which had the second highest content, also had high correlations with the same genes. Limonene, the terpenoid with the highest content in red prickly ash fruit, had the highest correlations with  FDPS2 and  FDPS3. To further investigate key genes involved in terpenoid synthesis, we performed RDA on Piperitone and α-pinene, the main monoterpenoid components of green prickly ash, had a significant positive correlation with the expression of  HDS2,  MVK2,  DXS1,  DXR2, and  MVD, indicating that these genes play an active role in the synthesis of green prickly ash monoterpenes ( Figure 7). β-Elemene is the main sesquiterpene in green prickly ash, and it had a significant positive correlation with the expression of  MVD,  HMGR1, and  GDS1, indicating that these genes are important for sesquiterpene synthesis. In red prickly ash,  FDPS2,  FDPS3, and  DXS2 had the highest correlations with the most abundant terpenoid, limonene, indicating that they may be the key genes for terpenoid synthesis. Differences in terpenoid composition and content are the main factor underlying aroma differences between green and red prickly ash, and differences in terpenoid synthesis-related gene expression are the molecular basis for these aroma differences. In green prickly ash, genes whose expression was highly correlated with the main terpenoids were found in the MVA and MEP pathways (e.g.,  HMGR1,  MVK2,  DXS1,  HDS2, etc.). By contrast, genes whose expression was highly correlated with the main terpenoids in red prickly ash came mainly from the MEP pathway (e.g.,  HDS1,  FDPS, etc.). These results suggest that terpenoid synthesis occurs through both the MVA and MEP pathways in green prickly ash but primarily through the MEP pathway in red prickly ash.","Green prickly ash ( Zanthoxylum   armatum ) and red prickly ash ( Zanthoxylum   bungeanum ) fruit have unique flavor and aroma characteristics that affect consumers' purchasing preferences. However, differences in aroma components and relevant biosynthesis genes have not been systematically investigated in green and red prickly ash. Here, through the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially abundant metabolites, and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, we characterize the different aroma components of green and red prickly ash fruits and identify key genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify 41 terpenoids from green prickly ash and 61 terpenoids from red prickly ash. Piperitone was the most abundant terpenoid in green prickly ash fruit, whereas limonene was most abundant in red prickly ash. Intergroup correlation analysis and redundancy analysis showed that  HDS2 ,  MVK2 , and  MVD  are key genes for terpenoid synthesis in green prickly ash, whereas  FDPS2  and  FDPS3  play an important role in the terpenoid synthesis of red prickly ash. In summary, differences in the composition and content of terpenoids are the main factors that cause differences in the aromas of green and red prickly ash, and these differences reflect contrasting expression patterns of terpenoid synthesis genes.","['Zanthoxylum bungeanum', 'Mep Pathway', 'Mva Pathway', 'Terpenoid Synthesis', 'Fruit Aroma']","['Prickly Ash', 'red prickly', 'Green Prickly', 'Prickly', 'Ash', 'ash fruit', 'Green', 'Red', 'Terpenoid', 'Figure']","[Green Prickly Ash, green and, green prickly ash, green prickly ash, green prickly ash, green prickly ash, green prickly ash, green prickly ash, (-)-myrtenol, PC2, PC2, green prickly ash, green prickly ash, green and red prickly ash, Green Prickly Ash, green and, Q30, 64,999, green prickly ash, glyceraldehyde-3P, green and red prickly ash, green and, green and, darkseagreen3, antiquewhite4, firebrick2, paleturquoise, sienna1, whitesmoke, antiquewhite2, lightslateblue, deeppink1, darkseagreen3, green prickly ash, green prickly ash, antiquewhite4, firebrick2, paleturquoise (14, coral3 (13), navajowhite1 (7, green prickly ash, green and red prickly ash, green and, green and red prickly ash, C-acetyltransferase, ACAT, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA synthase, HMGS, HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase, dimethylallyl diphosphate, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase, farnesyl diphosphate, lupeol synthase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, MCT, 4-diphosphocytidyl-methylerythritol, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (HDS), geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate synthase/geranyl diphosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPP, GGPP, green and, green prickly ash, green prickly ash, green prickly ash, terpene-related, green prickly ash, α-pinene, green prickly ash, green prickly ash, green prickly ash, green and red prickly ash, green prickly ash, green prickly ash]",[],[],[],NaN

To examine that the identified HcMYB regulators directly bind or not to the promoters of key volatile floral scent biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2) in  H. coronarium, a Y1H assay was conducted. It was observed that the bait strains harboring  proHcTPS1 and  proHcTPS3 grow well on gained aureobasidin A antibiotic SD-Leu medium co-expression with HcMYB7, HcMYB8, and HcMYB145. Moreover, bait strains harboring  proHcTPS10 gained aureobasidin A antibiotic resistance upon expression of HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB79, and HcMYB238. Furthermore, bait strains harboring  proHcBSMT2 gained aureobasidin A antibiotic resistance upon expression of HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB79, HcMYB145, and HcMYB248 ( Figure 7A). HcMYBs Interacts With JAZ1 Protein To further unravel the molecular mechanism of the involvement of HcMYBs in the regulation of floral aroma biosynthesis, a yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assay was performed.

On the other hand, yeast cells harboring pGBKT7-Lam + pGADT7-T (negative control), pGADT7-HcMYB79 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, and pGADT7-HcMYB238 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1 did not grow ( Figure 7B). These results indicated that HcJAZ1 may interact with five HcMYBs (HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB145, and HcMYB248) in yeast. Identification of the  HcMYB Genes in  Hedychium coronarium A total of 253 potential candidate  HcMYB genes were identified in  H. coronarium genome data. All genes were designated as  HcMYB1-HcMYB253 based on the chromosomal location. Among them, 27 HcMYB genes belong to 1R, six 3R, one 4R, and the rest are all R2R3 type. The HcMYB protein size and molecular mass range from 100 aa/11.37 kDa (HcMYB100) to 1,749 aa/192.53 kDa (HcMYB10). Similarly, the  pI also varies greatly from 4.51 (HcMYB170) to 12.2 (HcMYB252), indicating their functional diversity in microenvironments. A similar pattern was observed in  Prunus persica and  Phyllostachys edulis ( Zhang C. et al., 2018;  Yang et al., 2019b). Moreover,  in silico analysis revealed that HcMYB proteins were predicted to localize in the nucleus. The detailed information of  HcMYB genes is provided in  Supplementary Table 1. Phylogenetic Divergence of  HcMYB Genes The domain structure analysis showed that all  HcMYB genes contain highly conserved typical SANT DNA-binding domains in their sequences, which is essential for their different regulatory interaction mechanism. The multiple sequence alignment of mostly  HcMYB genes revealed that they possess 2R and 3R repeat signatures at the N-terminus, and seven candidate  HcMYB genes were selected for multiple sequence alignment ( Supplementary Figure 1). The seven candidate HcMYB proteins were selected for further characterization based on their expression pattern with flower scent emission. To assess the phylogenetic relationship among  MYB genes in  H. coronarium (253  HcMYBs), rice (66  OsMYBs),  Arabidopsis (125  AtMYBs), and tomato (127  SlMYBs), an unrooted NJ phylogenetic tree was generated. All MYB proteins were divided into 15 distinct clades designed as G1–G15. Among them, subgroup G13 constitutes the largest group containing 64 MYB members of four different species followed by G15 (63), G1 (56), G7 (54), G8 (48), G6 (48), G7 (40), G11 (39), G5 (30), G12 (28), G2 (26), G10 (26), G4 (25), G14 (8), and G3 (6), respectively. Similarly, the maximum number of  HcMYB genes were clustered into subgroup G15 (29) followed by G11 (27), G8 (27), G1 (25), G7 (23), G8 (23), G13 (20), G2, (15), G10 (15), G5 (13), G9 (12), G12 (10), G14 (7), G4 (5), and G3 (2), respectively. Interestingly, subgroup G14 contains eight MYBs from which seven belong to  H. coronarium ( Figure 1). Overall, all HcMYBs with AtMYB, OsMYB, and SlMYBs were unevenly clustered into all groups indicating their evolutionary divergence. The group of MYB genes in the same subclade may have a similar function. The phylogenetic tree analysis of only MYB proteins from  H. coronarium revealed that 253 HcMYB proteins were distinctly grouped into 12 different clades ( Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, three groups (G3, G13, and G15) from four genome phylogeny, were missing. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree of 253 HcMYBs was also constructing with the previously identified scent-related MYB TFs ( Supplementary Figure 3). The data showed that all HcMYBs along with previously identified scent-related MYBs were clustered into five distinct clades (G I-G V). The maximum number of scent-related MYB proteins were clustered in G II (11) followed by G V (5), G III (2), and G I (1), respectively. Furthermore, the selected seven-candidate HcMYB proteins were also grouped in different clades. HcMYB79 was clustered in G I, which included AtMYBL2, and HcMYB75/145/238 was found in G II, which contains the majority of scent-related MYBs (AtMYB2/21/24, FaEOBII, PhEOBI, PhEOBII, FvEOBII, PsMYB26, AmMYB305/340, and NiMYB3005). Similarly, HcMYB248 was found in G III, which includes AtMYB42 and PhODOI, while HcMYB7/8 was clustered in G V which includes AtMYB4/7, FaMYB1/10, PhMYB4, and PtMYB14 ( Supplementary Figure 3). Gene Structure and Motif Analysis of  HcMYB Genes To investigate the functional diversification of HcMYB proteins, 10 conserved motifs (motifs 1–10) were identified in the MEME server ( Supplementary Figure 4). The majority of the HcMYB proteins within the subclade had a similar composition of motifs, while variation was observed among different subclades. The motifs 1, 2, and 3 were the most conserved and appear in most of the HcMYB proteins. All the HcMYB proteins contain two or more than two motifs except HcMYB185 which only has motif 2 ( Supplementary Figure 5). HcMYB23, HcMYB40, HcMYB47, HcMYB55, HcMYB110, HcMYB126, HcMYB168, and HcMYB253 proteins contained motif 3 and motif 8; HcMYB31, HcMYB67, HcMYB91, HcMYB121, and HcMYB179 proteins contained motif 1 and motif 2. HcMYB proteins containing motif 9 and motif 10 belong to subgroup G10 and G9, respectively. Interestingly, some HcMYB proteins contain the repetition of motif 3 and motif 8 and fall into subgroup G2 indicating their involvement in a specific function ( Supplementary Figures 2,  5B). Gene structure analysis was performed to better understand the expansion of  HcMYB genes in  H. coronarium. The number of exon/intron ranges from 0 to 21. Gene structure analysis revealed that five  HcMYB ( HcMYB27,  HcMYB87,  HcMYB185,  HcMYB217, and  HcMYB249) genes were intron-less, while  HcMYB10 have a maximum of 21 introns ( Supplementary Figure 5C). Moreover,  HcMYB89 has the longest intron, and the majority of them (82%) were disrupted by two or three introns. In General, the  HcMYB genes with the same number of introns were grouped into a similar subclade. Chromosomal Distribution and Duplication Events Among  HcMYB Genes The chromosomal location of  HcMYBs was performed to investigate the genomic distribution of the MYB gene family in  H. coronarium. The results revealed an uneven distribution of  HcMYB genes in the chromosomes ( Figure 2A). In total, 6  HcMYB genes were found on chromosomes 1 and 13, 7 on chromosomes 8 and 16, 9 on chromosomes 3 and 15, 11 on chromosomes 10 and 12, 12 on chromosome 6, 14 on chromosomes 7 and 11, 15 on chromosomes 5 and 9, 16 on chromosome 17, 18 on chromosome 14, and 19 on chromosome 2. The maximum number of  HcMYB genes (20) were presented on chromosome 4. The majority of  HcMYB genes were observed on the top and bottom of the chromosomes, while rarely found in the middle of the chromosome. Gene duplications play a crucial role in the evolution and expansion of gene families in plants. It was found that  H. coronarium genome contained 62 HcMYB segmental duplications ( Figure 2A). The maximum number of segmental duplication events was observed on chromosomes 14 and 17, while a low number of duplication events were found on chromosome 3. Moreover, three tandem duplication pairs were also identified on chromosome 17 in  H. coronarium genome. The  Ka/Ks (synonymous/non-synonymous) values of all segmentally and tandemly duplicated  HcMYB gene pairs had less than 1, indicating that they evolved under the pressure of purifying selection ( Figure 2A and  Supplementary Table 3). The average  Ka/Ks value of tandem duplication genes (0.57) was higher than that segmented duplication genes (0.27). Moreover, the segmental and tandem duplication gene events occurred about 47 Mya (million years ago), implying that duplication events play a crucial role in functional and evolutional divergence. To determine the evolutionary mechanism of  HcMYB genes, comparative synteny maps of  H. coronarium associated with rice, pineapple, Arabidopsis, and banana were constructed ( Figure 2B). A total of 7 ortholog MYB gene pairs between  H. coronarium and  Arabidopsis, 19 orthologs between  H. coronarium and rice, 44 orthologs between  H. coronarium and pineapple, and 193 orthologs between  H. coronarium and banana were identified ( Figure 2B and  Supplementary Tables 4– 7). The number of HcMYB-MaMYB was greater than HcMYB-AtMYB, HcMYB-OsMYB, and HcMYB-AcMYB, indicating the closer evolutionary relationship between  H. coronarium and  Musa accuminata and their divergence from the common monocot ancestor. Interestingly, HcMYB29 and HcMYB194 collinear gene pairs were present among four species. HcMYB29 was homologous pair of AT5G65230.1 ( A. thaliana), LOC_Os02g51799.1 ( O. sativa), Aco002802.1 ( A. comosus), and GSMUA_Achr10T24560 ( M. acuminata). Similarly, HcMYB194 was collinear gene pair of AT4G37780.1, LOC_Os03g56090.1, Aco004978.1, and GSMUA_Achr5T01930. In short, the aforementioned two collinear gene pairs were found among four species genomes, implying their evolutionary mechanism and specific function in  H. coronarium. Cis-Regulatory Elements and  HcMYB Targeting miRNAs A 2-kb upstream promoter region of  HcMYB genes was scanned for  cis-regulatory elements analysis. The data showed that MeJA responsiveness elements are the most common ones, which were found in 210  HcMYB gene promoters. Other  cis-acting regulatory elements found in the promoter region of HcMYB genes were ABARE (208), ERE (180), GARE (144), MBS (128), Auxin responsive (120), SARE (99), and low-temperature responsiveness elements (96) ( Supplementary Figure 6). The detailed information regarding the  cis-elements present in the promoter region of  HcMYB genes is given in  Supplementary Table 8. Previous studies showed that miRNA play key roles in plant secondary metabolism. In  A. thaliana, miR858 encodes regulatory peptides and controls flavonoid biosynthesis and development ( Sharma et al., 2020). Similarly, miR156 was involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in poplar ( Wang et al., 2020). The miRNA prediction analysis showed that  HcMYB genes were targeted by different families of miRNA. About 37  HcMYB genes were mainly targeted by miR156, miR157, miR158, miR160, miR167, miR168, miR169, miR172, miR319, miR854, and miR858. The  HcMYB genes were commonly targeted by miR156, miR167, and miR319 ( Supplementary Table 9). Interestingly,  HcMYB187,  HcMYB166, and  HcMYB157 were targeted by both miR167 and miR319. The majority of  HcMYB genes (42) were targeted by miR858. Expression of  HcMYB Genes at Different Organs and Flower Developmental Stages The differential expression patterns of  HcMYB genes in different organs and flower developmental stages were analyzed using the RNA sequencing data ( Yue et al., 2015;  Supplementary Figure 7). The expression pattern of  HcMYB genes was grouped into three clusters. The cluster I showed a group of  HcMYB genes, which had preferential expression pattern in flowers. Similarly, cluster II and cluster III represent the member of  HcMYBs, which showed their high expression levels in rhizome and leaves, respectively ( Supplementary Figure 7A). Interestingly,  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB75,  HcMYB145,  HcMYB238, and  HcMYB248 from cluster I had the highest expression level in the flower. Some members of the cluster I also showed their spatial expression both in flower and rhizome including  HcMYB79,  HcMYB128,  HcMYB162,  HcMYB130,  HcMYB108,  HcMYB199, and  HcMYB208. The members of  HcMYB genes in cluster II showed high expression in the rhizome, while a few genes from cluster III showed high expression both in flowers and leaves and some in leaves and rhizomes. However, the majority of genes from cluster III showed their high expression in leaves. The amount of volatile contents released from flowers was maximum, while less quantity was observed in leaves and rhizomes ( Figure 3A). Previous studies showed that tissue-specific expression is important for gene functioning ( Sonawane et al., 2017). The data indicate the group of  HcMYBs present in cluster I might be involved in floral scent formation, while cluster II and cluster III in the functioning of vegetative organs (rhizome and leaves). In  H. coronarium, the process of floral scent formation is associated with flower development. The emission quantity of floral volatiles was low at the bud stage and substantially increase with the flower development peak at the blooming period and declined at the senescence stage ( Figure 3B). To clarify the functioning of  HcMYBs during flower development stages, their expression level at three stages was divided into three clades via a heat map ( Supplementary Figure 7B). Several  HcMYB genes showed high expression levels at the D1 stage followed by D4 and D6, respectively. However, some  HcMYBs ( HcMYB34,  HcMYB51,  HcMYB181, and  HcMYB232), which belong to cluster I, showed a substantial increase in expression level with the developmental stages. The members of  HcMYB genes from cluster II showed diverse expression levels. The majority of genes showed a high expression level at the D4 stage only, although  HcMYB5,  HcMYB62,  HcMYB106,  HcMYB111,  HcMYB240, and  HcMYB245 from cluster II showed high expression both at D1 and D4 stage. Likewise, within-cluster II, some  HcMYBs ( HcMYB16,  HcMYB94,  HcMYB203,  HcMYB208,  HcMYB218, and  HcMYB221) showed specific high expression both at D4 and D6 stage only ( Supplementary Figure 7B). Interestingly,  HcMYB22,  HcMYB55, and  HcMYB112, within-cluster III, showed a high expression at the D1 stage, with no expression at the D4 stage and dramatically peak at the D6 stage. Based on transcriptome data, seven  HcMYB genes were selected and their spatial expression pattern was validated via RT-qPCR at four different flower development stages ( Figure 3C). The expression level of  HcMYB79 increased with the flower development and peak at the senescence stage, while  HcMYB8 and  HcMYB75 showed a high expression level at the D2 stage (half-open). However,  HcMYB7,  HcMYB145,  HcMYB238, and  HcMYB248 showed a dramatic increase in the expression level from D2 to D3 stage. Moreover, the expression of candidate  HcMYB genes correlates with the emission of total volatile contents ( Supplementary Figure 8). The expression level of  HcMYB genes significantly altered with the flower developmental process, suggesting their potential role during the development of flower and floral scent emission. Expression of  HcMYBs in Response to Hormone Stresses Plant hormones play several functions in growth and development and are involved in different signaling pathways. Auxin, abscisic acid, ethylene, and jasmonates are the key hormones playing an essential role in flower development and senescence. The amount of floral volatile contents was increased by 27.6, 23.9, 25.5, and 33.1% under IAA, ABA, ethylene, and MeJA treatment, respectively ( Figure 4A). The expression levels of selected  HcMYBs were analyzed via RT-qPCR under the abovementioned treatments. The data showed that mRNA levels of  HcMYB75,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB238 were upregulated under auxin treatments, while  HcMYB248 was downregulated ( Figure 4C). Under ABA treatment,  HcMYB145 expression level was increased by 19-fold followed by  HcMYB75,  HcMYB79, and  HcMYB238, respectively. However, the expression level of  HcMYB248 was reduced ( Figure 4D). For ethylene treatment,  HcMYB79 and  HcMYB145 were significantly upregulated; however,  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8, and  HcMYB248 were downregulated ( Figure 4E). The expression levels of  HcMYB75,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB238 were upregulated when treated with MeJA, while  HcMYB248 was downregulated ( Figure 4F). Moreover, mRNA levels of key structural biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2) were also upregulated upon phytohormones stresses ( Figure 4B). These results indicate that  HcMYB genes respond to various stresses and play crucial roles through crosstalk with different hormones. Subcellular Localization of HcMYB Proteins In silico subcellular localization of  HcMYB genes revealed that all  H. corornarium MYB genes are predicted to localize in the nucleus except HcMYB126, which is predicted to localize in the chloroplast ( Supplementary Table 1). To experimentally validate the predicted localization, four  HcMYB genes ( HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248) were selected for analysis in  Arabidopsis protoplast. The NLS-mCherry was applied in each transformed design to act as a marker for nuclear localization. The results revealed that HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, and HcMYB248 proteins were localized to the nucleus ( Figure 5). Suppression of  HcMYB Genes Altered the Emission of Main Floral Volatile Compounds To understand the potential involvement of  HcMYB genes in the floral scent formation, a virus-induced gene silencing system was performed for  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248. The data showed that the mRNA expression level of  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248 was decreased 41.4, 47.8, 78.7, 75.8, and 85.3%, respectively ( Figure 6A), relative to the control flowers. The silencing of  HcMYB genes in flowers also downregulated the expression level of key structural volatile biosynthesis genes. In the  HcMYB7-silenced flower, the expression level of  HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2 was downregulated up to 59.7, 23.1, 65.7, and 58.3%, respectively, compared to control. The silencing of  HcMYB8 in  H. coronarium flowers, downregulated the expression level of  HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2 by 76.5, 54.5, 82.8, and 87.7%, respectively. Alike, silencing of  HcMYB79 significantly downregulated the expression levels of  HcTPS1 (74.4%),  HcTPS10 (87.6%), and  HcBSMT2 (87.4%). The expression level of  HcTPS1 (68.3%),  HcTPS3 (57.7%),  HcTPS10 (52.6%), and  HcBSMT2 (48.3%) was significantly suppressed in the  HcMYB145-silenced flowers. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of  HcTPS1 (66.5%),  HcTPS3 (38.8%),  HcTPS10 (72.1%), and  HcBSMT2 (81.4%) were significantly changed in the  HcMYB248-silenced flowers ( Figure 6B). The effect of silencing of  HcMYB genes on the floral volatile profile of  H. coronarium was assessed. It was observed that eucalyptol contents were decreased 42.2, 40.8, 22.6, 34.6, and 39.8% in the  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers, respectively ( Figure 6C). Similarly, the silencing of  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8, and  HcMYB79 significantly decreased the accumulation of ocimene by 23.3, 24.4, and 27.1%, respectively. However, no significant change in volatile contents was found in the  HcMYB145 and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers ( Figure 6D). The volatile contents of methyl benzoate were significantly decreased by 27.6 and 31.9% in the  HcMYB8 and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers, respectively, while silencing of  HcMYB145 did not affect the level of methyl benzoate ( Figure 6E). Furthermore, the contents of linalool were decreased by 16.9, 26, 13.9, 26.2, and 15.1% in the  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers, respectively ( Figure 6F). The data showed that these  HcMYB genes play a crucial role in the floral scent formation in  H. coronarium.","The MYB gene family is one of the largest groups of transcription factors (TFs) playing diverse roles in several biological processes.  Hedychium coronarium  (white ginger lily) is a renowned ornamental plant both in tropical and subtropical regions due to its flower shape and strong floral scent mainly composed of terpenes and benzenoids. However, there is no information available regarding the role of the MYB gene family in  H. coronarium . In the current study, the MYB gene family was identified and extensively analyzed. The identified 253  HcMYB  genes were unevenly mapped on 17 chromosomes at a different density. Promoter sequence analysis showed numerous phytohormones related to  cis -regulatory elements. The majority of  HcMYB  genes contain two to three introns and motif composition analysis showed their functional conservation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HcMYBs could be classified into 15 distinct clades, and the segmental duplication events played an essential role in the expansion of the  HcMYB  gene family. Tissue-specific expression patterns of  HcMYB  genes displayed spatial and temporal expression. Furthermore, seven  HcMYB  ( HcMYB7/8/75/79/145/238/248 ) were selected for further investigation. Through RT-qPCR, the response of candidates  HcMYB  genes toward jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and auxin was examined. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays revealed that candidate genes directly bind to the promoter of bottom structural volatile synthesis genes ( HcTPS1 ,  HcTPS3 ,  HcTPS10 , and  HcBSMT2 ). Moreover, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay showed that HcMYB7/8/75/145/248 interact with HcJAZ1 protein. In  HcMYB7/8/79/145/248 -silenced flowers, the floral volatile contents were decreased and downregulated the expression of key structural genes, suggesting that these genes might play crucial roles in floral scent formation in  H. coronarium  by regulating the expression of floral scent biosynthesis genes. Collectively, these findings indicate that  HcMYB  genes might be involved in the regulatory mechanism of terpenoids and benzenoid biosynthesis in  H. coronarium .","['Structural genes', 'terpenes', 'Floral Scent', 'Myb', 'Hedychium Coronarium']","['HcMYB Genes', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Figure', 'HcMYB', 'Genes', 'HcMYB proteins', 'expression', 'expression level', 'Supplementary', 'Supplementary Table']","[HcMYBs, MYB-core, HcTPS1, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB238, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, HcMYB248, JAZ1, HcMYBs, yeast-two-hybrid, Y2H, pGADT7-T, pGBKT7-53, pGADT7-HcMYB7 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB8 +, pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB75 +, pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB145 +, pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB7248 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, Trp, pGBKT7-Lam, pGADT7-HcMYB79 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB238 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, HcJAZ1, HcMYBs, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB145, HcMYB248, 1R, 3R, 4R, HcMYB100, HcMYB170, HcMYB252, 2019b, HcMYB proteins, NJ, MYB, G1–G15, G13, MYB, G15 (63), G8 (48), G7 (40, G11 (39), G5 (30), G12 (28, G10 (26), G4, G14 (8), G3 (6), G11 (27, G8 (27, G7 (23, G8 (23, G13 (20), G10 (15), G5 (13), G9 (12), G12 (10, G14 (7, G4, G3 (2, G14, HcMYBs, SlMYBs, MYB, MYB, G13, G15, HcMYBs, MYB TFs, HcMYBs, G I-G V, MYB, G II, G V, G III (2, G I (1, seven-candidate HcMYB proteins, G I, AtMYBL2, HcMYB75/145/238, G II, AtMYB2/21/24, FaEOBII, PhEOBI, PhEOBII, AmMYB305/340, NiMYB3005, HcMYB248, AtMYB42, PhODOI, HcMYB7/8, G V, AtMYB4/7, FaMYB1/10, PhMYB4, HcMYB proteins, HcMYB185, HcMYB23, HcMYB40, HcMYB47, HcMYB55, HcMYB110, HcMYB126, HcMYB168, HcMYB253, HcMYB31, HcMYB67, HcMYB91, HcMYB121, HcMYB179, G10, G9, MYB, 12, 12, 9, MYB, HcMYB-MaMYB, HcMYB-AtMYB, HcMYB-OsMYB, HcMYB-AcMYB, HcMYB194, AT5G65230.1, LOC_Os02g51799.1 (, Aco002802.1, GSMUA_Achr10T24560 ( M. acuminata, HcMYB194, AT4G37780.1, LOC_Os03g56090.1, Aco004978.1, GSMUA_Achr5T01930, HcMYB, ABARE, ERE (180), GARE (144), MBS (128), Auxin, SARE (99, miR156, miR156, miR160, miR167, miR168, miR169, miR172, miR319, miR156, miR167, miR319, miR167, miR319, D4, HcMYB34, D1, D4, within-cluster II, HcMYB16, D4, D1, D2, Auxin, abscisic acid, ABA, auxin, ABA, HcTPS1, HcMYB Proteins, MYB, HcMYB126, HcMYB7, NLS-mCherry, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, HcMYB248]","['HcTPS1', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS10', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,', 'proHcTPS1', 'proHcTPS3', 'proHcTPS10', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,', 'HcTPS1', 'HcTPS10', 'HcTPS1', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS10', 'HcTPS1', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS10']",['C.'],[],NaN

Mite populations were evaluated according to the adult and juvenile pest life cycle stages (eggs were excluded). The average numbers of adult and juvenile mites on two sampling dates, 5 and 8 weeks after TSSM infestation, are presented in  Figure 1. A comparison of the two sampling dates indicated that Shiran had more mites than Ofir in the juvenile stages, while only on the 5 weeks the adult stage had significantly higher on Shiran than on Ofir. In the 8 weeks, the adult mite population on Shiran had reduced, and in Ofir, it was not changed, which might be the outcome of severe plant damage.  Supplementary Figure 3 shows the total number of adult and juvenile mites on the two tomato cultivars along 2 months of scouting for mites. These results also show a higher number of both adults and juveniles on Shiran vs. Ofir. Overall, they suggest that in net house growth conditions, Shiran is more mite susceptible than Ofir. Additionally, plant morphology was scored at a single time point (5 weeks after TSSM infestation;  Figure 2A), 3 months from the beginning of the experiment.  Figure 2B presents the distribution of the plant damage in the two tomato cultivars in the net house. Most Shiran plants were mildly damaged and more damaged than most of the Ofir plants. These results suggest that the plant damage was related to the intensity of mite infestation, and that the Ofir cultivar is more resistant to mites. Evaluating TSSM Performance and Fecundity Under Controlled Growth Conditions To validate whether Ofir was more resistant to TSSMs than Shiran in a controlled environment, two complementary experiments were conducted: (i) mite reproduction, in which the number of mobile mites was evaluated on whole mite-infested plants for 13 days; and (ii) mite oviposition, in which the number of eggs was counted for 5 days during mite infestation using leaf disks. As shown in  Figure 3A, mite reproduction was significantly higher on Shiran (386.5) than on Ofir (306.2) plants, suggesting that Shiran is more susceptible to TSSMs under laboratory conditions. We determined the oviposition rate of TSSMs on the cultivars by applying females and counting new eggs each day, as shown in  Figure 3B. The two-way ANOVA indicated a significant difference in the number of eggs between sampling days ( df = 4;  F = 6.3;  p < 0.0001), while no significant difference was detected between the cultivars ( df = 1;  F = 1.1;  p = 0.29). Therefore, we conducted a one-way-ANOVA comparing the number of eggs on each cultivar separately. On Ofir, the highest number of eggs was counted on the 3rd day (9.4 eggs per female), then it declined to 8.3 eggs per female on the 5th day, while on Shiran, the highest numbers of eggs were counted on days 3–5 (9.1–9.9 eggs per female). These results revealed the different time responses of the two cultivars, possibly driven by variations in the molecular mechanisms. Pathway Analysis and Identification of Relevant Metabolic Pathways Mediating the Tomato Responses Against TSSMs To investigate the global transcriptional changes of the tomato cultivars, leaves from 5-week-old plants were infested with 60 TSSMs for 3 days, and then samples from TSSM-infested and untreated controls were collected. The total transcript levels (22,592 genes with no zero values) were used to construct a principal component analysis (PCA) plot. As presented in  Figure 4A, the PCA plot indicates that each cultivar's samples were clustered with one another. The samples were separated into infestation treatments, which explained 92% of the variance (PC1), and into cultivars, which explained 4% of the variance (PC2). This analysis suggests strong inducible responses of both cultivars following TSSM infestation, as well as distinct constitutively expressed sets of genes between the two cultivars. The DESeq2 tool was used to detect differentially expressed genes in the transcriptomic dataset (Love et al.,  2014), which generated two sets of transcriptional variations: (i) between the two cultivars and (ii) between treatments (TSSM-infested vs. untreated control). A list of the gene sets is presented in  Supplementary Table 3. The analysis of differentially expressed genes resulted in a total number of 7,099 differentially expressed genes, and the distribution of these genes was calculated and is presented in a Venn diagram ( Figure 4B). Many genes were altered in response to mite attack (6,632), while only a small number of genes (252) were differentially expressed between the two cultivars. Additionally, 215 genes varied between both cultivar and treatment. This result indicates that the major transcriptomic effects are induced by TSSM infestation. To reveal the biological processes involved in each group of the Venn diagram, an over-representation pathway enrichment analysis was performed, and the results were compared using the LycoCyc database ( http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/). In this analysis, the differentially expressed genes were included (both up- and downregulated in each group). In  Table 1, the significantly enriched pathways of cultivars, TSSM-induced treatment, and overlap group genes are presented ( Tables 1A–C, respectively). The pathways significantly enriched by the cultivars alone were mainly associated with the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids (flavonol, syringetin, luteolin, and leucopelargonidin and leucocyanidin) and terpenoids (monoterpenes). A large number of over-represented pathways were enriched upon mite infestation, including the following central metabolic pathways: amino acid biosynthesis (Phe, Tyr, Trp, Asp, and Glu), fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis (phospholipids), photosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism ( Table 1B). Additionally, several pathways associated with secondary compound biosynthesis were enriched: cofactor, prosthetic group, electron carrier, and vitamin (folate and chlorophyll cycle), nitrogen-containing compounds (hydroxycinnamic acid tyramine amides), and terpenoid (antheraxanthin and violaxanthin, and phaseic acid). Notably, another over-represented pathway was the biosynthesis of volatile benzenoid esters (i.e., MeSA and methylbenzoate), which result from the degradation of aromatic compounds (Tzin and Galili,  2010). As presented in  Table 1C, only a few pathways within the overlap group were significantly enriched, including the initial reaction of phenylpropanoids toward flavonols and suberin biosynthesis, as well as the biosynthesis of the phytohormone, SA. Together, these observations revealed the contribution of cultivars to the variation, which was mainly associated with secondary metabolism. In contrast, the mite-inducible changes were related to both primary and secondary metabolism. The overlap group, which represents genes that differ by both cultivar type and infestation treatment, is related to secondary metabolism. GO enrichment for each of these groups showed similar results to  Table 1, with a few additional categories. The GO enrichment summary of biological process, molecular function, and cellular component is presented in the  Supplementary Table 4. There was at least one pathway in all the groups involved in the metabolism of volatile compounds, including monoterpenes, salicylate (and MeSA), and volatile benzenoid ester biosynthesis. Therefore, we further explored these two pathways, looking at gene expression and measuring volatile composition changes. Comparing the Expression of Genes Associated With the Terpene Pathway and Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis The terpene biosynthesis gene list was generated according to a recently published study characterizing the tomato  Terpene synthase (TPS) gene family by Zhou and Pichersky ( 2020) and  Apocarotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) by Ilg et al. ( 2014). Out of 51 genes, 23 were detected in our dataset. As shown in  Table 2A, five  Terpene synthase (TPS) genes were highly expressed in untreated Ofir vs. Shiran, including  TPS5 (Solyc01g105890),  TPS7 (Solyc01g105920), and  TPS19/20 (Solyc08g005665) involved in monoterpene biosynthesis,  TPS9 (Solyc06g059885) involved in monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis, and  TPS18 (Solyc08g005720) involved in diterpene biosynthesis. This revealed the constitutive transcriptomic difference between the two tomato cultivars. Upon mite-infestation in the Ofir cultivar, the expression levels of six genes were reduced, including  TPS4 (Solyc01g105880),  TPS12 (Solyc06g059930),  Geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases (GGPPSs; Solyc04g079960 and Solyc02g085700),  Solanesyl diphosphate synthase (SPPS; Solyc07g061990), and  Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD2; Solyc01g087260), while  TPS46 (Solyc03g006550) was significantly overexpressed. In Shiran cultivar, three genes were underexpressed ( TPS35, Solyc01g101210;  GGPPS2, Solyc04g079960 and  CCD2, Solyc01g087260), and two genes were overexpressed ( TPS5, Solyc01g105890; and  TPS46, Solyc03g006550). Notably, the gene ID of  TPS20 and  TPS19 was Solyc08g005665.1, Solyc08g005670.2, and then Solyc08g005665.1 again in  S. lycopersicum annotation versions 2.4, 3.2, and 4.0, respectively. Both gene IDs have been used in the literature (Xu et al.,  2018; Zhou and Pichersky,  2020). The current annotation suggests that  TPS19 and  TPS20 are two coding sequences on the same transcript and are likely splice variants. However, their high sequence similarity prevented the distinction between the two during the mapping phase. Therefore, to separate them in the current RNAseq data, their amino acid variation from the reference genome (Heinz. cv) was used to infer their presence in the raw sequencing reads. A few reads that showed amino acid profiles congruent with both proteins, were excluded. The quantification of the reads revealed that both isoforms are present in Ofir and Shiran ( Supplementary Figure 4). In all four groups,  TPS20 had more reads than  TPS19. Unlike the TMM analysis, where  TPS19/20 was not detected in control samples of Shiran cultivar ( Supplementary Table 5), a few reads were detected in these samples. Salicylic acid (SA) is synthesized via two pathways: (i) chorismate through  Isochorismate synthase (ICS) and (ii) from Phe via  Phe ammonia-lyase (PAL) (Lefevere et al.,  2020). The gene list was generated from LycoCyc ( http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/) and MetaCyc databases (Caspi et al.,  2018). The results of the genes involved in SA and volatile benzenoid ester biosynthesis are shown in  Table 2A. In Ofir, the expression levels of 11 genes from the Phe pathway were altered upon mite infestation, including  PALs (Solyc03g042560, Solyc05g056170, Solyc09g007900, and Solyc09g007910),  Benzoate-CoA ligase (BCLA; Solyc12g044300),  Benzyl alcohol benzoyl transferase (BEBT; Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, and Solyc07g049670),  Cinnamate:CoA ligase (CNL; Solyc02g081360), and  Salicylate 1-O-methyltransferase (SAMT; Solyc01g081340 and Solyc09g091550), and the expression of  ICS (Solyc06g071030) from the chorismate pathway was significantly decreased. In Shiran, the expression levels of 9 genes from the Phe pathway were altered, including  PALs (Solyc10g011920, Solyc03g036470, and Solyc09g007900),  BEBTs (Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, Solyc07g049670, and Solyc08g005760), and  CNLs (Solyc02g081360 and Solyc03g031870), while the level of  ICS did not change. While several genes were significantly modified in response to mite-infestation, none of these genes were significantly different between the two cultivars' untreated samples (constitutive differences), suggesting that the SA pathway is mostly involved in the inducible defense mechanisms. Altogether, the results indicate a dramatic change in the gene expression levels of SA and volatile benzenoid ester biosynthesis, mostly affected by mite treatment (inducible manner). Additionally, only a slight effect on the terpene biosynthesis pathway was seen, which was enriched more in the Ofir than the Shiran cultivar (constitutive manner). Content of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) The transcriptome analysis suggested that one of the major differences between these cultivars was related to the metabolism of VOCs. The two cultivars' volatile content was determined under both mite-infested and untreated control conditions using the HS-SPME-GC-MS technique to link the transcriptomic to the metabolic changes. A total of 54 metabolites were identified across all different treatments, including 12 monoterpenes, 7 sesquiterpenes, 8 irregular terpenes, 7 phenylpropanoids and benzenoids, and 20 aliphatics ( Supplementary Table 6). In a principal component analysis, the majority of variance in volatiles content was due to the cultivar factor (PC1, 68.7% of total variation). The TSSM infestation factor (PC2) explained another 10% of the total variation in the data, reflecting the induced change in the volatiles content ( Supplementary Figure 5). To compare the relative levels of VOCs, Student's  t-tests were conducted. The values in log2 fold change, separated into five volatile biosynthetic classes, are presented in  Table 3. This analysis revealed that nine compounds from the mono-, and irregular terpenes differed between the two cultivars in both conditions (mite-infested and untreated control), including 4-carene, limonene, p-cymene, p-cymenene, terpinolene, α-terpinene, β-phellandrene, β-pinene, and crypton. However, only two compounds, α-pinene and o-guaiacol, were modified in the untreated Ofir vs. untreated Shian, and three compounds, 1-nonanol, 1-Octanol, and methyl salicylate, were altered in mite-infested Ofir vs. mite-infested Shiran. Methyl benzoate was the only compound that increased upon mite infestation in Shiran cultivar, while none of the metabolites changed upon mite infestation in the Ofir cultivar. Notably, two monoterpenes 3,7,7-trimethyl-1,3,5-cycloheptatriene and β-myrcene were detected only in the Ofir cultivar. These comparisons suggested that monoterpenes are the main VOCs that differ between cultivars (constitutive levels), while only minor changes occur upon TSSM attack. To compare the amount of VOCs in each cultivar and condition, we measured all compounds produced on day 3 dpi, and the change in each VOC was tested by a one-way ANOVA. Overall, 29 out of 54 VOCs varied significantly ( df = 4; Fisher's LSD;  p ≤ 0.05), indicating unique volatile content between the cultivars and treatments ( Supplementary Table 7A). The most pronounced differences between the cultivars were in the levels of monoterpenes, of which 3,7,7-trimethyl-1,3,5-cycloheptatriene and β-myrcene were only detected in Ofir, and seven other monoterpenes were over-represented in Ofir relative to Shiran. Additionally, the most pronounced difference in response to TSSM infestation was in the level of the benzenoid compound methyl benzoate, which increased in response to TSSM infestation in both cultivars. Overall, MeSA was the most abundant molecule, followed by β-phellandrene in Ofir and methyl benzoate in Shiran ( Supplementary Table 7B). To compare the total amount of VOCs in each cultivar and condition, we measured all 54 compounds produced. The total VOC content extracted from the Ofir control plants was approximately twice that of the Shiran plants. Upon infestation, both Ofir and Shiran plants produced ~1.5 times more VOCs ( Supplementary Table 7B). In this dataset, Ofir and Shiran seemed to produce different volatile patterns, both in quality and quantity. The question was whether differences in these patterns were due to changes in specific classes of metabolites. To that end, the use of hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward's linkage) resulted in a heatmap, presented in  Supplementary Figure 6. Overall, the VOC dataset was divided into six clusters, and volatiles mostly grouped by classes (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and irregular terpenes). Six groups of metabolites were further selected, and their average levels were present in infested and untreated plants at different times (1, 3, 5, and 7 dpi) shown in  Figure 5. The sum of 9 monoterpenes was more than 10 times higher in Ofir than in Shiran. Notably, the only monoterpenes in greater quantity in Shiran were α-pinene and β-pinene ( Figures 5A,B, respectively). Both sesquiterpene and the irregular terpenes presented similar patterns between the groups and were higher in Ofir than in Shiran. However, irregular terpenes varied more between the Shiran control and infested treatments ( Figures 5C,D, respectively). The volatile phytohormone MeSA was significantly higher in Ofir than in Shiran and increased in the infested treatments ( Figure 5E). Methyl benzoate was the most prominent compounds that increased in response to TSSM infestation in both cultivars and was the only compound that increased over time ( Figure 5F). VOCs associated with the aliphatic class did not show a clear pattern, and most of them were more abundant in Ofir than Shiran, except 1-nonanol, and 1-octanol, which presented the opposite trend ( Table 3 and  Supplementary Figure 6). Further evidence for volatile differences between the two cultivars was discovered by measuring the VOC profile of tomatoes grown in the net house. Leaf samples were collected over 3 months, and volatiles were detected using GC-MS liquid extraction. The results suggested that Ofir accumulated higher amounts of volatiles during this time than in Shiran ( Supplementary Figure 7). These findings supported our laboratory experiments, wherein the total amount of VOCs was higher in Ofir than Shiran ( Supplementary Table 7B). Furthermore, 1 week after TSSM infestation, the amount of volatiles increased until 2 weeks after infestation. Subsequently, it declined during the establishment of the mite population ( Figure 1 and  Supplementary Figure 5, respectively). The VOC list is presented in  Supplementary Table 8. Olfactometry Bioassay of TSSM and  Phytoseiulus persimilis Upon Exposure to Shiran and Ofir Odors A Y-shape olfactometry bioassay was designed ( Figure 6) to understand the effect of different VOC emissions on mite behavior. The TSSMs showed no preference for the odor source emitted by intact Shiran-control and Ofir-control plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577). Similarly, TSSMs had no preference when given a choice between Ofir-control and Ofir-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577), Shiran-control and Shiran-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.13;  p = 0.715), and Shiran-infested and Ofir-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.78;  p = 0.376;  Figure 6A).  Phytoseiulus persimilis predatory mite is known to respond to unique VOC compositions (Takabayashi et al.,  2000). Therefore, we tested the indirect effect of the VOCs blend of the two cultivars on these mites by exposing them to either TSSM-infested or untreated (control) Ofir and Shiran volatile emissions. The  P. persimilis clearly chose Ofir-infested over Shiran-infested plants (χ 2 = 4.94;  p = 0.0263;  Figure 6B).  Phytoseiulus persimilis did not show a significant preference when given a choice between Shiran-control and Ofir-control plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577), Ofir-control and Ofir-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577), and Shiran-control and Shiran-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.13;  p = 0.715). The results indicated that the predator mite could distinguish between infested Ofir and Shiran, but the TSSM could not.","The two-spotted spider mite (TSSM;  Tetranychus urticae ) is a ubiquitous polyphagous arthropod pest that has a major economic impact on the tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) industry. Tomato plants have evolved broad defense mechanisms regulated by the expression of defense genes, phytohormones, and secondary metabolites present constitutively and/or induced upon infestation. Although tomato defense mechanisms have been studied for more than three decades, only a few studies have compared domesticated cultivars' natural mite resistance at the molecular level. The main goal of our research was to reveal the molecular differences between two tomato cultivars with similar physical (trichome morphology and density) and agronomic traits (fruit size, shape, color, cluster architecture), but with contrasting TSSM susceptibility. A net house experiment indicated a mite-resistance difference between the cultivars, and a climate-controlled performance and oviposition bioassay supported these findings. A transcriptome analysis of the two cultivars after 3 days of TSSM infestation, revealed changes in the genes associated with primary and secondary metabolism, including salicylic acid and volatile biosynthesis (volatile benzenoid ester and monoterpenes). The  Terpene synthase  genes,  TPS5, TPS7 , and  TPS19/20 , encoding enzymes that synthesize the monoterpenes linalool, β-myrcene, limonene, and β-phellandrene were highly expressed in the resistant cultivar. The volatile profile of these cultivars upon mite infestation for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days, revealed substantial differences in monoterpenoid and phenylpropanoid volatiles, results consistent with the transcriptomic data. Comparing the metabolic changes that occurred in each cultivar and upon mite-infestation indicated that monoterpenes are the main metabolites that differ between cultivars (constitutive levels), while only minor changes occurred upon TSSM attack. To test the effect of these volatile variations on mites, we subjected both the TSSM and its corresponding predator,  Phytoseiulus persimilis , to an olfactory choice bioassay. The predator mites were only significantly attracted to the TSSM pre-infested resistant cultivar and not to the susceptible cultivar, while the TSSM itself showed no preference. Overall, our findings revealed the contribution of constitutive and inducible levels of volatiles on mite performance. This study highlights monoterpenoids' function in plant resistance to pests and may inform the development of new resistant tomato cultivars.","['Salicylic acid', 'Tetranychus urticae (Koch)', 'Terpene synthase', 'volatile organic compounds', 'Solanum Lycopersicum', 'Phytoseiulus Persimilis']","['Ofir', 'Shiran', 'Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Agriculture Extension', 'Extension Service', 'Figure', 'Ofir cultivar', 'Shiran cultivar', 'TSSM infestation']","[Ofir, Rimi, Ofir, TSSM, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, TSSM, Ofir, Ofir, TSSMs, mite-infested, TSSMs, TSSMs, Ofir, TSSMs, TSSMs, TSSM-infested, 22,592, PC2, DESeq2, TSSM, Venn, http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/, TSSM-induced, Trp, Asp, SA, mite-inducible, 2A, Ofir, Solyc01g105890, Solyc01g105920, Solyc08g005665, Solyc06g059885, Solyc08g005720, Solyc01g105880, Solyc06g059930, GGPPSs, Solyc04g079960, Solyc02g085700, Solyc07g061990, Solyc01g087260, Solyc03g006550, TPS35, Solyc01g101210, Solyc04g079960, Solyc01g087260, TPS5, Solyc01g105890, Solyc03g006550, Solyc08g005665.1, Solyc08g005670.2, Solyc08g005665.1, IDs, TPS19, RNAseq, Ofir, http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/, 2A, Ofir, Solyc03g042560, Solyc05g056170, Solyc09g007900, Solyc09g007910, BCLA, Solyc12g044300, BEBT, Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, Solyc07g049670, CoA ligase, Solyc02g081360, SAMT, Solyc01g081340, Solyc09g091550, Solyc06g071030, chorismate, 9, Solyc10g011920, Solyc03g036470, Solyc09g007900, Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, Solyc07g049670, Solyc08g005760, Solyc02g081360, Solyc03g031870, SA, Ofir, mite-infested, TSSM infestation factor, PC2, mite-infested, β-pinene, α-pinene, Ofir, TSSM, ≤, Ofir, Ofir, TSSM, TSSM, MeSA, β-phellandrene, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, α-pinene, β-pinene ( Figures 5A, B, Ofir, D, Ofir, TSSM, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, TSSM, TSSM, Ofir Odors A Y-shape, TSSMs, Shiran-control, Ofir-control plants, χ 2, TSSMs, Ofir-control, Ofir-infested plants, χ 2, Shiran-control, Shiran-infested plants, χ 2, Shiran-infested, Ofir-infested plants, χ 2, TSSM-infested, Ofir-infested, Shiran-infested, χ 2, Shiran-control, Ofir-control plants, χ 2, Ofir-control, Ofir-infested plants, χ 2, Shiran-control, Shiran-infested plants, χ 2, Ofir]","['(TPS)', '(TPS)', 'TPS5', 'TPS7', 'TPS19/20', 'TPS9', 'TPS18', 'TPS4', 'TPS12', 'TPS46', 'TPS35,', 'TPS5,', 'TPS46,', 'TPS20', 'TPS19', 'TPS19', 'TPS20', 'TPS20', 'TPS19.', 'TPS19/20']",[],[],terpene synthase
146,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7982956\eupmc_result.json,PMC7982956,"Results Obtainment of Transgenic Sweet Orange Plants Overexpressing  AtCS To obtain constitutive synthesis of ( E)-β-caryophyllene, a T-DNA harboring the genomic sequence of  A. thaliana ( E)-β -CARYOPHYLLENE SYNTHASE TPS21 ( AtCS) under the control of the 35S promoter plus the  nptII selectable marker gene cassette was constructed. This T-DNA was transferred into the genome of Valencia sweet orange ( Citrus X sinensis L. Osb.) via  Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the cut ends of internodal stem tissues. A total of 10 putatively transgenic ( E)-β -CARYOPHYLLENE SYNTHASE overexpressing lines (CS lines) were produced by regeneration on kanamycin-containing medium. Seven independent transgenic lines harboring a full-length single copy of the transgene in Southern blots were selected for further analysis ( Supplementary Figure 1).  AtCS expression was evaluated in leaves from young shoots, the most attractive leaf stage to  D. citri and thus the most interesting target tissue to induce ( E)-β-caryophyllene emission. Transcripts of the transgene were detected in all the CS orange lines analyzed, while they were absent in flushes from EV control lines ( Figure 1). Lines CS-5, -14, and -17 showed comparable intermediate expression levels, while CS-2, -6, and -15 presented lower transcript amounts. Line CS-16 exhibited the highest level of  AtCS expression, over eightfold higher than that of CS-6, and approximately doubled that of intermediate lines. Overexpression of  AtCS Did Not Induce Detrimental Effects in CS Transgenic Sweet Orange Plants Selected CS lines were grafted on “Rangpur” lime ( Citrus X limonia Osb.) and propagated under greenhouse conditions without observing any detrimental effect on plant growth. The plants also showed no alteration of color or morphology, being indistinguishable at a first glance from the empty-vector (EV) control plants ( Figure 2A). After 18 months, basic phenotypic characteristics, such as internode length, stem diameter, and leaf area, were evaluated. No significant differences between engineered CS- and EV-transformed lines were found ( Figure 2B). To investigate whether  AtCS heterologous overexpression induces any detrimental effect in citrus, some key fruit quality parameters were evaluated in fruits from three selected greenhouse-grown engineered lines. Visually, CS and EV fruits and juices were indistinguishable ( Figure 3A). Accordingly, obtained results indicated that size, weight, number of segments, and peel color of CS fruits were statistically equal to those of EV ( Figure 3B). Similarly, quality characteristics were comparable in CS and EV juices ( Figure 3C). However, these results are just preliminary. Fruit setting should be evaluated for several productive seasons in the orchard to be able to get reliable results on fruit quality. Nevertheless, our first fruit evaluation was enough to claim that  AtCS overexpression does not induce any aberrant phenotype in the GM fruits. Analysis of Volatile Terpene Compounds Accumulated in the Leaves of Engineered CS Sweet Orange Lines Terpene volatiles accumulated in young flushes of CS and EV control lines were extracted and analyzed by GC-MS. The total amount of volatile terpene compounds accumulated in the flushes of the CS lines analyzed was, in general, similar to that detected in EV controls ( Figure 4). Only in CS-15 and -17, mono- and sesquiterpene content was significantly altered in relation to EVs. In these lines, monoterpene accumulation was between 4.6- and 5.1-fold higher than in EV lines, while the sesquiterpene amount was more than twofold higher than in the controls. The changes in the monoterpene profile were analyzed in more detail ( Figure 5A). Lines CS-15 and -17 had a higher content of all the monoterpenes identified, especially α-terpineol (more than 10 times higher than EVs). The other monoterpenes, except β-citronellal, increased at least 3.5-fold relative to the controls. In CS-16, a slight decrease in the content of all the monoterpenes was detected, but to a significant extent only for α-phellandrene, β-citronellal, β-citronellol, and geranial. Lines CS-2 and -14 displayed a reduced accumulation of many monoterpene alcohols and aldehydes, of at least 50% for citronellal, citronellol, and geranial. Regarding the sesquiterpene profiles, lines CS-2 and -14 showed no significant differences when compared with EV lines ( Figure 5B), while in lines CS-5 and -16,  Z-β-farnesene content was reduced by about 60%. The largest changes were again identified in lines CS-15 and -17, which had between 1.9 (β-elemene) and four times [( E)-β-caryophyllene and β-sinensal] higher sesquiterpene concentrations than the EVs. Diaphorina citri Is Less Attracted to CS Than to Control Lines in Four-Arm Olfactometer Assays The response of  D. citri to volatiles emitted from the transgenic orange lines was assessed in a four-arm olfactometer ( Figure 6). Psyllids spent significantly less time in odor fields corresponding to volatiles from all CS lines than in clean air fields ( Figure 6A). Highest significant effect was observed for odor field from line CS-15, in which the psyllids spent about 36% less time in CS fields in relation to EV, while the lowest effect was recorded for CS-6 odor field, in which psyllids expended a bit more than 18% less time than in that of EV. In the remaining CS lines, the reduction of time spent vs. EV was between 24 and 29%. To find out whether  CLas-infected psyllids were also deterred by CS volatiles, new behavioral assays were performed with three selected engineered lines showing different terpene accumulation profiles. A line with increased amount of ( E)-β-caryophyllene (CS-15), a line with reduced content of orange leaf characteristic aroma monoterpenes (CS-16), and a line without changes in the accumulation of terpenes with respect to the controls (CS-5) were selected. Regardless of their volatile accumulation profile, infected psyllids spent significantly less time in odor fields from CS selected lines than in EV ones ( Figure 6B), with reductions between 15% (CS-5 and -15) and 22% (CS-16). It is interesting to note that time spent by psyllids in CS odor fields was lower than in EV fields ( Figure 6), but percentages varied from one set of experiments (healthy psyllids) vs. the other ( CLas-infected psyllids), which were performed along different months and then using different plant propagations. Then to ensure that CS lines are consistently less attractive to the psyllids and the effect of  CLas infection on  D. citri behavior, new statistical analysis was performed. When comparing the data from both experiments ( Supplementary Figure 2), results indicated that just the genotype of the assayed lines was influencing  D. citri response ( F = 5.97,  p = 0.0005), regardless of whether it was  CLas infected or not ( F = 2.24,  p = 0.1348) and without interaction between these two factors ( F = 1.22,  p = 0.2999). Volatile Terpene Emission Profile of CS Leaves Is Highly Disturbed As  D. citri,  CLas infected or not, showed different responses to CS and EV lines that could not be directly related to variations in their volatile terpene content, the emission of these compounds by flushes of selected lines was analyzed. Again, lines CS-5, -15, and -16, plus one control EV line, were chosen. Total monoterpene emission of the CS lines did not differ much from EV lines with the exception of CS-5, which did not emit terpinolene and linalool ( Figure 7A). However, the emission of terpinolene was more than 200-fold higher in CS-17 than in the other lines. Regarding sesquiterpenes, the only ones detected in our emission analyses were those produced by AtCS activity, namely, α-copaene, ( E)-β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene ( Figure 7B). The first one was not detected in EV volatile profiles, while the other two were emitted at a rate of 2 ng/h or lower. Emission rates of all three compounds were much higher in the CS engineered lines, at least 5, 279, and 15 ng/h for α-copaene, ( E)-β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene, respectively. In CS lines, this boosts the emission of sesquiterpene compounds, which was between 100 and 300 times higher than that of controls, leading to an increase in total terpene emission ( Figure 7C). Monoterpene emission was slightly reduced, although not to a significant extent. As a result, there was a radical shift in the profile of volatiles emitted by the CS lines: monoterpenes constituted 99% of the total emitted volatiles in EV lines, and this decreased to 36% in CS-16 and even to 7% in CS-5 ( Figure 7C). Diaphorina citri Is Less Attracted to CS Engineered Sweet Orange Lines in No-Choice Assays To further evaluate the effect of the volatiles emitted by selected CS-lines on  D. citri behavior, no-choice assays were performed. This kind of experiment may give a more realistic view of the response of psyllids, as they can move more freely than inside the olfactometer arena, and visual cues of the orange tree flushes can be added as an attractive parameter to the insect or avoided (with a kaolin spray). At least 99 responsive psyllids were evaluated (at 10 different days) for each genotype, thus circumventing any bias due to uncontrollable factors (atmospheric pressure, air relative humidity, light, etc.). Based on olfactometric and chemical results ( Figures 6,  7), lines CS-5 and -15 (highly repellent and showing the most altered emission profile) and healthy psyllids (easier to culture and not-requiring qPCR to test  CLas infection) were selected for these experiments. In order to avoid the effect of visual cues on this kind of assays, the plants were sprayed with kaolin. Each line was evaluated releasing 10 psyllids each day and scoring their location 1, 4, 8, and 24 h afterward. Eight hours after their release, the EV line contained at least 21% more insects than CS-lines, although the effect was not statistically significant ( Figure 8A). At 24 h, the two tested CS-lines still harbored less  D. citri individuals than the EV control line, with significant reductions of 14 and 23% (for CS-5 and -15, respectively). Finally, the response of  D. citri to a selected CS engineered line (CS-15, highest repellent effect,  Figure 8A) was evaluated in a no-choice assay, but this time, the plants were not treated with kaolin, to take into account the attractiveness promoted by visual cues too. As before, 10 psyllids per plant were evaluated at 10 different days, and the number of psyllids that settled on the different lines was evaluated over 24 h ( Figure 8B). At short time intervals (<8 h), only a slight non-significant reduction in the number of psyllids on CS lines was observed. After 24 h, however, the proportion of psyllids on the flushes was about 16% lower for CS than for EV line.","Huanglongbing (HLB) is a destructive disease, associated with psyllid-transmitted phloem-restricted pathogenic bacteria, which is seriously endangering citriculture worldwide. It affects all citrus species and cultivars regardless of the rootstock used, and despite intensive research in the last decades, there is no effective cure to control either the bacterial species ( Candidatus  Liberibacter spp.) or their insect vectors ( Diaphorina citri  and  Trioza erytreae ). Currently, the best attempts to manage HLB are based on three approaches: (i) reducing the psyllid population by intensive insecticide treatments; (ii) reducing inoculum sources by removing infected trees, and (iii) using nursery-certified healthy plants for replanting. The economic losses caused by HLB (decreased fruit quality, reduced yield, and tree destruction) and the huge environmental costs of disease management seriously threaten the sustainability of the citrus industry in affected regions. Here, we have generated genetically modified sweet orange lines to constitutively emit ( E )-β-caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene repellent to  D. citri , the main HLB psyllid vector. We demonstrate that this alteration in volatile emission affects behavioral responses of the psyllid in olfactometric and no-choice assays, making them repellent/less attractant to the HLB vector, opening a new alternative for possible HLB control in the field.","['Biotechnology', 'Transgenic', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Volatiles', 'Chemical ecology', 'Hlb', 'Asian Citrus Psyllid']","['lines', 'Figure', 'CARYOPHYLLENE SYNTHASE', 'Sweet Orange', 'orange lines', 'Line', 'Psyllids', 'Supplementary Figure', 'control lines', 'Orange']","[E)-β -CARYOPHYLLENE, TPS21, AtCS, -14, -6, Line CS-16, CS-6, “Rangpur” lime, EV-transformed lines, CS, Orange Lines, CS, CS-15, α-terpineol, β-citronellal, CS-16, β-citronellal, β-citronellol, -14, -14, β-sinensal], CS-6, CS-15, CS-16, CS-16, CLas-infected psyllids, CS, CS-17, AtCS, CS engineered lines, CS-16, CS-5 ( Figure 7C, CS-lines, CS-lines, CS engineered line, CS-15]",['TPS21'],[],"['Citrus', 'Citrus']",NaN

Movione Tomato Plants Harbouring the I Resistance Gene Are Immune to Fol Infection To characterize the establishment of the ETI, a symptomatology analysis of  Fol-inoculated Movione (MOV) tomato plants carrying the  I resistance gene was performed. Concurrently, Momor (MOM) tomato plants lacking the  I resistance gene were used to compare the fusarium wilt symptoms. As  Figure 1 shows, evident differences in symptom severity were observed between both isogenic lines at 14 days post-inoculation (dpi). As  Figure 1C,D show, MOV displayed no phenotypical differences between mock- and  Fol-inoculated plants, confirming the establishment of ETI. On the contrary,  Fol-infected MOM plants were characterized by a height and weight reduction, yellowing of the leaves, browning of the xylem vessels, and even a total collapse of most plants, therefore confirming their susceptibility to  Fol ( Figure 1B). Finally, no differences between both non-inoculated isogenic lines were observed ( Figure 1A,C). To better quantify the differences between infected MOV and MOM plants, several morphological parameters were measured such as height, weight, the ratio between the hypocotyl length and the epicotyl length in reference to the height, as well as the water consumption per plant ( Table S1, Supplementary Materials). Infected tomato plants were classified according to their disease index [ 17] as a medium value out of the score of the symptoms from mild (1) to very severe (4) along the infection (see Materials and Methods). As expected, a statistically significant reduction of height, weight, hypocotyl elongation, and symptom severity was observed between both isogenic lines, confirming the resistance of MOV tomato plants to  Fol infection. To study the possible relationship between the observed symptoms and the presence of the pathogen,  Fol levels were analyzed in the hypocotyl of both infected isogenic lines at 7 and 14 dpi by qPCR, being statistically higher in MOM than in MOV plants at any time ( Figure S1), and correlating with the symptoms observed in  Figure 1. 2.2. Movione Tomato Plants Activate an Early JA-and ABA-Mediated Defense Response after Fol Infection To better characterize the infection in both isogenic lines, the activation of the main signaling defensive routes was studied. The expression levels of different marker genes corresponding to the pathways mediated by SA, JA, ET, or ABA, which are the most important phytohormones involved in plant defense, were analyzed by using RT-qPCR ( Figure 2) both in susceptible Momor (MOM) and resistant Movione (MOV) tomato plants after 3, 7, and 14 days of  Fol inoculation. To avoid possible differences between the Moneymaker isogenic lines, logarithm of the ratios (log(ratio)) of the relative expression levels between  Fol-infected and mock-inoculated plants were calculated; log(ratio) above 0 indicating a  Fol-provoked induction of the marker gene. The expression of  PR1 (pathogenesis-related 1), which is the marker gene for SA-mediated plant response [ 18], showed a statistically significant increase in the log(ratio) of the susceptible isogenic line when compared to the resistant plants, in accordance with the symptom development ( Figure 2A). Specifically, the log(ratio) of the induction of  Fol-infected MOM plants with respect to the mock MOM plants was 1-, 1.8-, and 2.2-fold at 3 dpi, 7 dpi, and 14 dpi, respectively. In contrast, MOV plants showed a log(ratio) below 0 at 3 dpi (−1.9) and 14 dpi (−0.8), thus indicating a  Fol-mediated downregulation of  PR1 in this resistant isogenic line. The analysis of  JAZ7 (jasmonate ZIM-domain 7) ( Figure 2B), a gene related to the JA pathway [ 19], showed similar results at the end of the fungal infection, while a statistically significant increase in the log(ratio) was found at 3 dpi (0.2) in the resistant MOV plants with respect to the susceptible MOM. ACS2 (aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 2) expression was chosen to follow the ethylene-mediated signalling [ 20]. No relevant induction was found in the resistant MOV tomato plants upon fungal inoculation at any time point since the log(ratio) was negative (–0.8 at 3 dpi) or around 0 (0.1 at both 7 and 14 dpi) ( Figure 2C). However,  ACS2 was significantly induced in the  Fol-infected MOM plants during the pathogenic interaction, displaying a log(ratio) of 1.2, 0.9, and 2.2 at 3, 7, and 14 dpi, respectively. Differences between the log(ratio) of MOM and MOV plants were observed for  LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) ( Figure 2D), a gene related to ABA [ 21], with these differences being statistically significant at any time point. It should be noted that there was a significant induction of  LEA (0.5) at 3 dpi in the resistant MOV plants compared to the susceptible MOM. Nevertheless, a decrease in the expression pattern for these genes was found in MOV plants along the infection process. Our results suggest that the susceptible MOM plants activated all the main defense pathways along the infection, this response being late and insufficient to stop the disease progression in accordance with the symptom development. However, MOV plants were characterized by an early induction of the JA and ABA pathways, with an antagonistic effect on the SA and ET mediated response at 3 dpi, suggesting that the JA-and ABA-mediated responses could be effective enough to prevent the symptom development and to establish ETI. 2.3. Levels of Salicylic Acid and Abcisic Acid Are Enhanced in the Susceptible MOM Tomato Plants Infected by Fol Levels of the main defense phytohormones SA, ABA, and JA were analyzed in the MOM (susceptible) and MOV (resistant) tomato plants infected with  Fol in a time-course study.  Figure 3 represents the log(ratio) of the phytohormone accumulation between  Fol-infected and mock-inoculated plants in both MOM and MOV isogenic lines. A statistically significant accumulation of SA ( Figure 3A) and ABA ( Figure 3C) was observed in the compatible interaction at 7 dpi. At this time point, the SA and ABA log(ratio) in susceptible tomato plants was around 2.2 and 0.2, respectively, indicating that these phytohormones are involved in the plant response against  Fol. Besides, SA levels were significantly higher in the susceptible plants at the end of the fungal infection (14 dpi). According to the higher expression of  LEA observed at 3 dpi ( Figure 2D), a lower reduction of ABA levels was detected in resistant MOV plants at that time point. In contrast, an inverted pattern was detected for JA ( Figure 3B) in this interaction, observing a trend of JA accumulation at 3 dpi in the resistant MOV plants when compared to susceptible MOM. Although no statistical differences were detected in JA levels due to the high variability displayed, these results entirely agree with the  JAZ7 induction ( Figure 2B), therefore reinforcing the idea that an early activation of the JA pathway occurs in the resistant plants. On the contrary, SA accumulation is a distinctive feature of the susceptibility to  Fol, perfectly correlating with the  PR1 expression. 2.4. Susceptible MOM and Resistant MOV Tomato Plants Display Different Volatile Chemical Composition upon Fol Infection To identify the VOCs involved in the establishment of ETI, changes in the levels of these metabolites in mock-inoculated and  Fol-infected MOV and MOM tomato leaves were analyzed by GC-MS at 7 and 14 dpi. Based on the massive dataset obtained (11,505 detected peaks) from the chromatographic study, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. The first analysis revealed that both mock-inoculated isogenic lines constitutively emitted a different profile of VOCs ( Figure S2). These results could be due to the differences among both isogenic lines caused by the integration of the  I resistance gene in MOV plants. Consequently, the data set was normalized by the mean of the height ions from each mock-inoculated isogenic line to eliminate this metabolic difference, and a new analysis containing the normalized infected plants was performed ( Figure 4). The score plot of PCA clearly showed that the first component (PC1) explained changes in the chemical composition of the susceptible and resistant infected tomato plants (21% of variance), while the metabolic alteration during the time course of the experiment was clearly distinguished by the second component (PC2, 13% of variance). The analysis supported that different metabolites seem to be involved in the compatible and incompatible interaction and depending on time of infection. Analyzing the PC1 of the loading plot, the specific VOCs that strongly contributed to the separation of samples according to the interaction type were identified. The statistical volatiles differentially released during ETI establishment in resistant MOV tomato plants infected by  Fol were extracted from the positive part of PC1 and are listed in  Table S2 (MOV/MOM ratio > 1). Among them, some terpenoids were significantly emitted by resistant plants after 7 days of fungal inoculation: the monoterpene 3-carene, along with two aldehydic monoterpenoids and ( Z)-linalool oxide, two nor-isoprenoids (dihydroactinidiolide and β-ionone), and four sesquiterpenes (α-caryophyllene and three isoforms of elemene). In addition, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, 2,2-dimethyldecane, and three unknown compounds (unk 1–3) were the volatiles significantly over-emitted by the resistant tomato plants at the beginning of the infection. Interestingly, the volatile profile at 14 dpi was characterized by the emission of benzenoids and C5-fatty acid derivatives such as isobutylbenzene, benzeneacetaldehyde, methylbenzene, 5-ethyl-2-furanone, and ( E)-2-pentenal. Only the sesquiterpenes α- and β-caryophyllene were also significantly induced in the incompatible interaction together with the apocarotenoid geranylacetone, an unknown nitrogen compound (unk 2), the hydrocarbon 2,2-dimethyldecane, and the sulfur compound 2-ethylthiophene ( Figure 4). Particularly, α-caryophyllene, 2,2-dimethyldecane, and unk 2 were significantly over-emitted by MOV plants during all of the experiment. Similarly, the analysis of the negative side of the PC1 loading plot allowed for identifying the VOCs emitted by the susceptible MOM tomato plants upon  Fol infection, showing the metabolites detailed in  Table S3 (MOV/MOM ratio < 1) and summarized in  Figure 4. Benzenoids and fatty acid derivatives were differentially over-emitted by the vulnerable plants. In the first group, methyl salicylate (MeSA) and ethyl salicylate (EtSA) were over-emitted at 7 and 14 dpi, respectively. On the other hand, the production of some aldehydes and ketones derived from the fatty acid degradation as 2-nonenal, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone, and 3-heptanone was induced during all of the infection process. However, 3-buten-2-one, butanal, and 2-butanone were emitted exclusively at the beginning of the infection process, and 2-pentanone at the end. The statistically significant and most over-emitted discriminant VOCs from the resistant MOV (MOV/MOM ratio ≥ 1.7) and the susceptible MOM (MOV/MOM ratio ≤ 0.8) tomato plants are summarized in  Figure 4. 2.5. Fungal Infection Induces the Specific Expression of Genes Involved in VOC Biosynthesis To relate the differential volatile production with the transcriptional activation, the expression levels of several key genes involved in VOC biosynthesis were analyzed by RT-qPCR ( Figure 5). To study the genes involved in aldehydes, esters, and alcohols of 9-, 6-, and 5-carbons, and jasmonate biosynthesis, the possible activation pathway of fatty acid derivatives was analyzed. In this sense, the lipoxygenases (LOX) are a group of enzymes responsible for converting both linoleic and linolenic acids into 9- and 13-hydroperoxides which are cleaved by hydroperoxidelyases (HPL) to form the corresponding short-chain aldehydes and oxo-acids. Besides, the allene oxide synthase (AOS) produces jasmonate derivatives from 13-hydroperoxide [ 22]. Six genes which codify for lipoxygenases were described in tomatoes [ 23].  TomloxA,  TomloxB, and  TomloxE codify for 9-LOX, which catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of 9C compounds, while  TomloxC,  TomloxD, and  TomloxF codify for 13-LOX involved in the formation of oxylipins. Specifically,  TomloxD is responsible for JA emission in the wound response, and  TomloxC and  TomloxF take part in the production of 5-carbon and 6-carbon volatiles, respectively. In addition to genes involved in fatty acid derivatives,  MTS1 and  SAMT1 were studied as marker genes for the biosynthesis pathways of terpenoids like monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, and benzenoids, respectively [ 22]. Log(ratio) of the relative expression levels of these genes between  Fol-infected and mock-inoculated plants in both MOM and MOV isogenic lines is represented in  Figure 5. A significant induction of the relative expression levels was observed for  TomloxA at 3 dpi ( Figure 5B), as well as for  TomloxF ( Figure 5D) and HPL ( Figure 5A) at 7 dpi in susceptible MOM with respect to resistant MOV plants, correlating with 2-nonenal and 2-hexanone emission in the compatible interaction at any time. Moreover, statistically significant differences between the log(ratio) of  TomloxC induction were measured at 7 dpi in the resistant MOV with respect to the susceptible MOM ( Figure 5A), in agreement with the further over-emission of ( E)-2-pentenal during ETI establishment at 14 dpi ( Figure 4), while no differences were found between both interactions at 3 dpi. Interestingly, the significantly higher log(ratio) of  TomloxD ( Figure 5C) and  AOS ( Figure 5F) in MOV at 3 dpi could explain the levels of JA accumulation at 3 dpi ( Figure 3B), as well as the overexpression of  JAZ7 ( Figure 2B) in this resistant isogenic line. Additionally, the differential terpene emission in the MOV immune plants was in accordance with the statistically significant higher levels of  MTS1 analyzed at 3 dpi and 7 dpi ( Figure 5G). A repression in both lines and times was observed for  SAMT1 gene, implicated in SA methylation, the downregulation being significantly lower in MOV than in MOM.","New strategies of control need to be developed with the aim of economic and environmental sustainability in plant and crop protection. Metabolomics is an excellent platform for both understanding the complex plant-pathogen interactions and unraveling new chemical control strategies. GC-MS-based metabolomics, along with a phytohormone analysis of a compatible and incompatible interaction between tomato plants and  Fusarium oxysporum  f. sp.  lycopersici,  revealed the specific volatile chemical composition and the plant signals associated with them. The susceptible tomato plants were characterized by the over-emission of methyl- and ethyl-salicylate as well as some fatty acid derivatives, along with an activation of salicylic acid and abscisic acid signaling. In contrast, terpenoids, benzenoids, and 2-ethylhexanoic acid were differentially emitted by plants undergoing an incompatible interaction, together with the activation of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway. In accordance with this response, a higher expression of several genes participating in the biosynthesis of these volatiles, such as  MTS1 ,  TomloxC,  TomloxD,  and  AOS , as well as  JAZ7 , a JA marker gene, was found to be induced by the fungus in these resistant plants. The characterized metabolome of the immune tomato plants could lead to the development of new resistance inducers against  Fusarium  wilt treatment.","['Fusarium', 'Tomato', 'GC-MS', 'Volatiles', 'Natural products', 'Metabolomics', 'Biotic Interaction']","['MOV plants', 'Figure', 'Tomato Plants', 'MOV', 'resistant MOV', 'MOM plants', 'Plants', 'MOM', 'susceptible MOM', 'MOV tomato']","[Momor (MOM) tomato, D, C, SA, ABA, Momor (MOM), Movione (MOV) tomato, log(ratio, pathogenesis-related 1, log(ratio, log(ratio, log(ratio, −0.8, jasmonate ZIM-domain 7, log(ratio, aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 2, log(ratio, –0.8, log(ratio, log(ratio, ABA, ABA, Abcisic Acid, ABA, JA, log(ratio, ABA, SA, ABA log(ratio, SA, ABA, JA, SA, PC2, β-ionone, 2,2-dimethyldecane, C5-fatty acid, 5-ethyl-2-furanone, β-caryophyllene, 2,2-dimethyldecane, 2,2-dimethyldecane, MOV (MOV/MOM ratio, ≤, 9-, 5-carbons, LOX, 9-, hydroperoxidelyases (, Log(ratio, log(ratio, log(ratio, JA]",[],[],[],NaN
148,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC8051600\eupmc_result.json,PMC8051600,"Results Genome sequencing and assembly We sequenced the genome of the guava cultivar, ‘New Age’ (2 n = 2 x = 22) (Figure  1a), which is commonly grown in Guangdong Province, China. We sequenced it using a combination of short‐read sequencing from Illumina NovaSeq with the PE 150 bp protocol and SMRT from PacBio Sequel platform. The sequencing generated ~53.2 Gb of high‐quality short‐read sequences and ~53.6 Gb of PacBio sequences, both representing over 115× coverage for the genome, which has an estimated size of 463.8 Mb based on the 17‐mer depth distribution analysis of the sequenced reads (Figure  S1) and previous flow cytometry analysis by Coser  et al. ( 2012). The final assembled sequence was 443.8 Mb, representing 95.7% of the guava genome. The assembly consisted of 44 scaffolds with an N50 of 40.4 Mb and 73 contigs with an N50 of 15.8 Mb (Table  1; Table  S1). We used the Hi‐C technology to reorder and anchor the total 99.44 % (441.27 Mb) of the genome onto 11 pseudochromosomes (Figure  S2). The GC content of the assembled guava genome was 39.5%, which is similar to those of  E. grandis (Myburg  et al.,  2014) and  L. scoparium (Thrimawithana  et al.,  2019), the two most closely related species to guava with sequenced genomes. We used BWA v0.7.17 (Li,  2014) to align Illumina short reads to the assembly, and obtained the mapping rate of 96.75%. We then assessed the quality of the guava genome assembly through the Conserved Core Eukaryotic Gene Mapping Approach (CEGMA) (Parra  et al.,  2007). The analysis revealed that 94.4% of the core protein‐coding genes were recovered in our assembled genome (Table  S2). In addition, we found 1352 (93.9%) complete gene models and 28 (1.9%) fragmented gene models out of 1440 Benchmarking Universal Single‐Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) genes (Simão  et al.,  2015; Table  S3). Furthermore, 97.7% of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were covered by the assembly, with >50% sequence identity (Table  S4). Moreover, we successfully mapped 91.6%–94.1% of RNA‐Seq datasets generated from different tissues and developmental stages to the assembled genome of guava (Table  S5). Taken together, these results suggest a high‐quality genome assembly of guava. Repeat annotation and gene prediction We analysed repetitive sequences by combining  de novo prediction and a homology‐based search at both the DNA and protein levels, and found that repetitive sequences occupy 43.55% (193.2 Mb) of the genome of guava (Figure  1b; Table  S6). We performed an annotation pipeline combining  de novo, homolog‐based search and RNA‐Seq methods to predict gene models from the repeat‐masked guava genome sequence (Table  S5; Figure  S3). These analyses predicted a total of 25 601 protein‐coding genes, representing 23.56% of the genome assembly (Table  S7). This is a much smaller number of genes than in the sequenced genomes of the myrtaceous species,  L. scoparium and  E. grandis (Myburg  et al.,  2014; Thrimawithana  et al.,  2019). Among the 25 601 genes, 25 428 (99.3%) were functionally annotated (Table  S8). There were 25 498 genes (99.59%) present on chromosomally anchored contigs. In a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, 9724 (37.98%), 12 866 (50.26%) and 13 400 (52.3%) of annotated genes were assigned to the GO terms cellular component, molecular function and biological process, respectively (Figure  S4). In addition to the protein‐coding genes, we also identified 330 miRNA genes, 405 tRNA genes and 844 rRNA genes in the guava genome (Table  S9; Figure  S5a). We also detected a total of 22 334 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) across the whole genome (Figure  S5b). Gene family analysis Compared with ten other genomes of angiosperms, we found a total of 4310 species‐specific single‐copy genes in guava (Tables  S10 and S11). We conducted an analysis of GO annotations for these genes and found they were enriched in GO terms including regulation of cell death, receptor regulator activity and chromatin (Table  S12). The shared gene families among guava and ten other angiosperm species are summarized in Table  S11. We found that guava shared more gene families with  L. scoparium and  E. grandis than with  Punica granatum (pomegranate; Myrtales, Lythraceae; Figure  S6). In total, we found that 22 gene families were expanded in guava, while 140 gene families experienced losses compared to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of guava and  L. scoparium (Figure  2a). Guava showed fewer gene family expansions and more gene family contractions than the other species in Myrtaceae (Figure  2a), and this is consistent with the smaller number of genes we detected in guava compared to the other myrtaceous species. The expanded gene families are enriched in biological processes, especially stimulus response and phosphorelay signal transduction and in several molecular functions, particularly ADP binding and ribosyltransferase activity (Figures  S7 and S8; Table  S13). Functional analysis of contracted gene families indicated enrichment of GO terms such as response to auxin and terpene synthase activity (Figures  S9 and S10; Table  S14), suggesting possible function losses in the xylem formation (Soler  et al.,  2015) and essential oil producing (Myburg  et al.,  2014) pathways. We examined the evolutionary relationships among guava and ten other plant species with sequenced genomes using phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic analysis, based on alignments of 487 single‐copy genes, supported the placement of  P. guajava,  E. grandis, and  L. scoparium in Myrtaceae and  P. granatum in the Myrtales order (Figure  2a). Interestingly,  P. guajava and  L. scoparium comprised a monophyletic group, which is inconsistent with phylogenetic analyses reported by Biffin  et al. ( 2010) and Thornhill  et al. ( 2015). To improve phylogenetic resolution among species of Myrtaceae, we reconstructed species trees using protein and DNA sequences of 3454 single‐copy orthologs with  P. granatum as the outgroup. In these analyses, both the DNA and protein sequences yielded the topology of ( P. guajava,  L. scoparium,  E. grandis,  P. granatum) with high support (bootstrap values = 100%; Figure  S11). Whole‐genome duplication Distributions of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ( Ks) for paralogous genes of guava showed a peak at  Ks ≈ 1.3 (Figure  2b; Figure  S12), and similar peaks were identified in  L. scoparium and  E. grandis (Figure  2b; Figure  S12). In addition, collinearity patterns between  Vitis vinifera L. (common wine grape; Vitales, Vitaceae),  P. guajava, and  E. grandis (Figure  3) and synteny analyses among species of Myrtaceae (Figure  1; Figure  S13) indicated that Myrtaceae underwent a whole‐genome duplication (WGD) event after the well‐known paleo‐hexaploidization event, γ, in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all eudicots (Jiao  et al.,  2012; Myburg  et al.,  2014). Qin  et al. ( 2017) inferred that the MRCA of Myrtales underwent a WGD event after the γ event based on analysis of synteny patterns between  E. grandis and  P. granatum. However, the  Ks distributions for paralogous genes in our analyses revealed a little higher peak value in  P. granatum than species of Myrtaceae (Figure  2b; Figure  S12). Peak values of the  Ks distributions for orthologous genes between Myrtaceae and Lythraceae were a little larger than those within Myrtaceae (Figure  2b, c; Figure  S12). However, differences in the distribution of  Ks between Myrtaceae and Lythraceae, represented by  P. granatum, were too small to determine if they underwent a shared WGD event or independent ones. In order to precisely locate the phylogenetic position of WGDs in Myrtales, we conducted a Multi‐tAxon Paleopolyploidy Search (MAPS) analysis (Li  et al.,  2015) with seven species:  P. guajava,  L. scoparium,  E. grandis,  P. granatum of Myrtales and  Arabidopsis thaliana,  V. vinifera, and  Solanum lycopersicum of Brassicales, Vitales and Solanales, respectively. We recovered 8587 phylogenies of gene families with at least one gene copy from each taxon. Based on MAPS, we identified 7572 trees representing these gene families that included the MRCA of Myrtaceae, and among these, 60% showed a WGD for the MRCA of Myrtaceae (Figure  S14; Table  S15). In contrast, only 5.8% supported a gene duplication shared between Myrtaceae and  P. granatum (i.e. for Myrtales). (Figure  S14; Table  S15). These results support that WGD events in Myrtaceae occurred separately from those in Lythraceae, which is consistent with the finding of inferring putative ancient whole‐genome duplications in the 1000 Plants (Li and Barker,  2020; One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative,  2019). We further determined the age of WGD events in Myrtales plants according to their distributions of  Ks (Badouin  et al.,  2017; Vanneste  et al.,  2013). Synonymous substitutions are putatively evolutionarily neutral and accumulate changes at a constant rate, which can be used to infer the age of WGDs. We inferred an average  Ks/year rate of 1.14 × 10 −8 in Myrtales. Based on this, we inferred that the independent WGD events in Myrtaceae and Lythraceae occurred 50.1–61.2 million years ago (MYA) and 55.8–61.7 MYA with a confidence interval of 95%. Collectively, our results indicate that the WGD events in Myrtaceae and Lythraceae are family‐specific but occurred within similar timeframes. Ascorbic acid metabolism We measured ascorbic acid content in three different fruit developmental stages (young, expanding and mature). We found that ascorbic acid content increased along with fruit development (Figure  4a; Table  S16). We investigated genes encoding key enzymes involved in all four known ascorbic acid biosynthesis pathways and the regeneration pathway (Figure  S15) during guava fruit development. All genes associated with the L‐galactose pathway were found in guava genome, but Alase (aldonolactonase), which produces precursors of ascorbic acid in the galacturonate pathway, GlcUR (D‐galacturonate reductase) in the  myo‐Inositol pathway, and a series of genes in the L‐gulose pathway were absent (Figure  S15; Table  S17). Comparisons with two other sequenced species of Myrtales,  E. grandis and  P. granatum, and with  A. thaliana revealed no expansion of genes in the ascorbic acid biosynthesis pathways, but gene families responsible for regenerating ascorbic acid [AO (L‐ascorbate oxidase) and MDHAR (monodehydroascorbate reductase)] expanded in guava (Table  S17). Expression profiling analysis revealed that most genes involved in L‐galactose and recycling pathways were more highly expressed in fruits compared to other tissues, except one and two members of the MDHAR and AO families, respectively (Figure  5; Table  S18). Genes encoding downstream biosynthesis enzymes exhibited a positive correlation between expression level and ascorbic acid content in fruits (Figure  5). This result is similar to a previous report in a closely related species,  Myrciaria dubia (Myrtaceae) (Castro  et al.,  2015a). In other pathways, however, only one member of GalUR (D‐galacturonate reductase) and two of MIOX (myo‐inositol oxygenase) had detectable expression (Figure  S16a). Taken together, these results indicate that the L‐galactose pathway is the major route for ascorbic acid biosynthesis in guava. In particular, MDHAR, rather than DHAR (dehydroascorbate reductase), contributes to ascorbic acid regeneration in guava. In a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), we found that three of the 20 coexpression modules (Figure  4b) were positively correlated with ascorbic acid content (Figure  4c: tan, 0.91; yellow, 0.81; and light yellow, 0.74). Within these modules, we found six genes involved in ascorbic acid biosynthesis and regeneration pathways (Figure  S17a, b, c; Table  S19), indicating that these genes play key roles in ascorbic acid accumulation. Expression of these genes showed positive correlation with the stages of fruit development. Five of the six key genes (except the one in the regeneration pathway) also showed high expression levels in the stem which, therefore, may also have the capacity for ascorbic acid biosynthesis (De Tullio and Arrigoni,  2003). Fruit softening related metabolism Guava fruit loses its firmness during ripening (Ali  et al.,  2004). In comparison with woody‐fruited species (e.g.  L. scoparium and  E. grandis), ripening of fleshy fruits is often associated with starch degradation or cell wall metabolism (Cordenunsi‐Lysenko  et al.,  2019; Wang  et al.,  2018). Here, we investigated genes involved in these two pathways. In the genome sequences of guava, we found that 44 members of seven gene families involved in the starch degradation pathway (Figure  6; Table  S20). Compared with  E. grandis,  P. granatum and  A. thaliana (Table  S20), guava has the greatest number of genes in gene families related to starch degradation. The main degradation genes in guava are  AMY (α‐amylase) and  BAM (β‐amylase) genes, which account for 61.4% of these starch degradation genes in guava. We detected more members of  AMY and  BAM in guava than in any other plant that we surveyed. Within guava, we also detected α‐glucosidase (AGL), 4‐α‐glucanotransferase (DPE) and isoamylase (ISA), which are additional key enzymes in the starch degradation pathway, and these were not present in  E. grandis or  P. granatum. We evaluated starch content in fruits at different developmental stages (Figure  4a; Table  S16). Gene expression in 21 samples of  P. guajava was clustered into 20 coexpression modules (Figure  4b), of which, two were significantly negatively correlated with starch content (Figure  4c: tan, −0.92; light yellow, −0.70). Within these two, we found four and one starch degradation genes, respectively (Figure  S17a, b; Table  S19). Most genes involved in starch degradation showed increased expression with fruit development in guava (Figure  6; Figure  S18), indicating that starch degradation plays an important role in fruit softening during the ripening process. We also identified a total of 192 genes encoding five key enzymes related to cell wall degradation (Table  S21). Guava possesses more gene members of  β‐galactosidase than other plants. We found many genes related to cell wall degradation with high expression levels in fruits, even though they did not show consistent trends during ripening (Figure  S19). Some genes encoding β‐galactosidase, polygalacturonase and pectate lyase had increasingly higher expression during fruit ripening (Figure  S19). This is in accord with prior work showing that the content of soluble pectin (i.e. galacturonic acid) increased with a reduction of guava fruits firmness (Braga  et al.,  2017). Together, these results indicate that cell wall degradation may also contribute to fruit softening in guava. Positive selection in guava,  L. scoparium and  E. grandis In order to investigate the evolutionary footprint of natural selection on candidate genes associated with the ascorbic acid pathway and fruit softening, we conducted positive selection analyses for guava,  L. scoparium and  E. grandis using orthologs from  P. granatum as the outgroup. Among the 15 681 orthogroups, 3627 contained single‐copy orthologous genes. In guava, we identified 285 positively selected genes (PSGs) ( P < 0.01; Table  S22). A GO functional classification of significant PSGs in guava revealed several categories associated with proteolysis (Figures  S20 and S21). Among the 285 genes, we found two (Pgu12819 and Pgu22300) encoding  AMY and two genes involved in starch biosynthesis (Pgu05347 and Pgu03782). Furthermore, three of these positively selected genes (Pgu03782, Pgu12819 and Pgu22300) were expressed increasingly during fruit ripening (Figures  S16b and S18). There were 859 and 313 genes possibly under positive selection in  L. scoparium and  E. grandis ( P < 0.01), respectively. We found that four and three genes, which were involved in lignin biosynthesis pathways, were PSGs of  L. scoparium and  E. grandis, respectively (Table  S23). These results are consistent with the hypotheses that woody‐fruit formation occurs via secondary cell wall synthesis and lignification (Dardick and Callahan,  2014). Together with the analyses of gene expression during fruit softening, these results support that fleshy‐fruited species in Myrtaceae underwent positive selection on starch metabolic genes, and the starch degradation may be the main contributor to fruit softening.","Guava (Psidium guajava) is an important fleshy-fruited tree of the Myrtaceae family that is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas of the world and has attracted considerable attention for the richness of ascorbic acid in its fruits. However, studies on the evolution and genetic breeding potential of guava are hindered by the lack of a reference genome. Here, we present a chromosome-level genomic assembly of guava using PacBio sequencing and Hi-C technology. We found that the genome assembly size was 443.8 Mb with a contig N50 of ~15.8 Mb. We annotated a total of 25 601 genes and 193.2 Mb of repetitive sequences for this genome. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that guava has undergone a recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) event shared by all species in Myrtaceae. In addition, through metabolic analysis, we determined that the L-galactose pathway plays a major role in ascorbic acid biosynthesis in guava fruits. Moreover, the softening of fruits of guava may result from both starch and cell wall degradation according to analyses of gene expression profiles and positively selected genes. Our data provide a foundational resource to support molecular breeding of guava and represent new insights into the evolution of soft, fleshy fruits in Myrtaceae.","['Myrtaceae', 'Ascorbic acid', 'Starch degradation', 'Hi-c', 'Pacbio Sequencing', 'Fleshy Fruit']","['Figure', 'Table', 'Guangdong Province', 'genes', 'guava', 'Myrtaceae', 'Gene', 'gene families', 'Ascorbic acid', 'guava genome']","[‘New, short‐read, NovaSeq, PE 150 , SMRT, ~53.2 , ~53.6 , 17‐mer, Hi‐C, 441.27 Mb, Thrimawithana  , v0.7.17, Single‐Copy, BUSCO, Simão  , 91.6%–94.1, RNA‐Seq, homology‐based, RNA‐Seq, Thrimawithana  , 12 , SSRs, auxin, S10, single‐copy, whole‐genome, WGD, γ, WGD, γ, c, WGD, WGDs, WGD, WGD, whole‐genome, WGD, Badouin  , WGDs, WGD, 50.1–61.2, 55.8–61.7, WGD, family‐specific, L‐galactose, Alase (aldonolactonase, galacturonate, GlcUR (D‐galacturonate reductase, L‐gulose, Myrtales, L‐ascorbate oxidase, MDHAR (, monodehydroascorbate reductase, L‐galactose, MDHAR, AO, GalUR (D‐galacturonate reductase, MIOX (, myo‐inositol oxygenase, L‐galactose, MDHAR, DHAR, b, c, woody‐fruited species, Cordenunsi‐Lysenko  , α‐amylase, β‐amylase, 4‐α‐glucanotransferase (DPE, isoamylase (ISA), −0.92, −0.70, β‐galactosidase, polygalacturonase, pectate lyase, pectin, S21, Pgu12819, Pgu22300, Pgu05347, Pgu03782, Pgu03782, Pgu12819, Pgu22300, S18, woody‐fruit]",[],[],[],terpene synthase

The cutoff Cq value between HLB+ and HLB− for Li primers has been determined to be 32 ( Zhao et al., 2018). Because the  CLas titer in orange juice is much lower than in leaf tissue, we used another pair of primers targeting at  CLas hyv1, which has more copies in the genome than that of rDNA ( Morgan et al., 2012). With these primers, a cutoff Cq value of 29 was determined to differentiate between HLB+ and HLB− ( Zhao et al., 2018). Similar to healthy leaf tissue, healthy juice had Cq values higher than the cutoff value, with N4 HLB− right at the cusp (Cq = 29.03) ( Table 1). For HLB+ juice, N1 treatment resulted in a higher Cq value (29.63) than N2 (27.24) and N3 (27.90) treatments and slightly higher than cutoff value, indicating that N1 may have some effects on reducing  CLas titer in juice ( Table 2). The Effect of Huanglongbing on the Volatile Profile of “Valencia” Citrus Peel Oil A total of 53 volatile compounds were identified in peel oil samples ( Table 3), including seven monoterpenes, 14 sesquiterpenes, 13 terpene oxides, 10 aldehydes, 8 alcohols, and 1 ketone. Monoterpenes were predominant in all the “Valencia” citrus peel oil samples with limonene accounting for the major constituent (89.74–90.48%,  Table 3). In general, there were more differences among all the treatments within HLB+ fruits (23 volatile compounds total) than among all the treatment within HLB− fruits (hexanal only). Huanglongbing disease dramatically affected the volatile profile of citrus fruits ( Figures 1,  2). Cluster analysis ( Figure 1) showed which compounds were more abundant in HLB− (in red) versus HLB+ (in green) and how the various treatments affected the profile. Hierarchical clustering shows that all the HLB+ N1 samples (dark pink/green) are clustered with the HLB− samples (red) ( Figure 2) along with one replicate of HLB+ N4 sample (light purple/green). Analysis by PCA discriminated HLB+ from HLB− samples in both PC1 and PC2 ( Figure 3B), explaining 52.8% of the variation in the first two components ( Figure 3A). Most of peel oil volatiles from HLB+ samples were on the negative side of PC1 and positive side of PC2 ( Figures 3A,B). The Effect of Nutritional Spray Treatments on the Volatile Profile of “Valencia” Citrus Peel Oil The treatment N1 showed the strongest impact on the volatile profile, especially for the HLB+ samples ( Table 3 and  Figures 1,  2). Treatment N1, for example, reduced (less green) compounds prevalent in HLB+ (e.g., sabinene) and enhanced (more red) some compounds prevalent in HLB− (e.g., α-terpinyl acetate), thus resulting in a profile more closely resembling peel oil from HLB− than oil from HLB+ trees subjected to other treatments. The N1 treatment, which had the highest fruit juice Cq values in both HLB+ and HLB− fruit tissue ( Table 2), significantly reduced the concentration of hexanol, sabinene, δ-3-carene, ( E)-limonene oxide, citronellal,  p-menth-1-en-9-al, ( Z)-carvone, and ( E)-β-farnesene but significantly increased the concentration of ( Z)- p-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol, decanal, ( E, E)-2,4-decadienal, α-terpinyl acetate, α-copaene, ( E)-caryophyllene, valencene, α-selinene, δ-cadinene, and caryophyllene oxide ( Table 3 and  Figure 3B) for HLB+ samples compared with the HLB+ control. Comparing HLB+ with HLB− within N1 treatment showed widespread similarity, with the noticeable exceptions of octadecanal, δ-3-carene, and β-phellandrene, which were more abundant in HLB− than in HLB+ peel oil. All four replicate samples of HLB+ N1 and one replicate sample of HLB+ N4 were positioned on the negative side of PC2, together with most of HLB− samples ( Figure 3A).","Florida orange trees have been affected by huanglongbing (HLB) for more than a decade. To alleviate disease-caused tree decline, maintain fruit productivity, and reduce disease transmission, enhanced foliar spray programs combining vector control and nutritional supplementation have been applied to healthy and diseased trees. The aim of this research was to discover if the various foliar sprays affect fruit peel oil chemical components. In this study, ""Valencia"" orange trees, with or without HLB (HLB±), were treated with the grower standard program (control, C) or one of four proprietary enhanced foliar spray programs (N1, N2, N3, and N4) over 16 months. Compared with HLB-, HLB+ samples had lower concentrations of typical peel oil components, including valencene, octanal, and decanal, and were abundant in oxidative/dehydrogenated terpenes, such as carvone and limonene oxide. However, limonene, the dominant component, was not affected by any treatment. Control and three out of four enhanced foliar spray programs, N2, N3, and N4, had very little influence on the chemical profiles of both HLB- and HLB+ samples, while N1 treatment greatly altered the chemical profile of HLB+ samples, resulting in peel oil similar to that of HLB- samples.","['volatile organic compounds', 'Citrus Greening Disease', 'Insect Vector Control', 'Nutritional Spray', 'Cold Pressed Oil']","['HLB', 'Candidatus Liberibacter', 'Infection Severity', 'Table', 'Results Candidatus', 'Peel Oil', 'Liberibacter asiaticus', 'asiaticus Infection', 'leaves confirmed', 'Figure']","[“, ”, HLB−, HLB+, HLB−, hyv1, HLB+, HLB−, N4 HLB−, N1, N2 (27.24), N3 (27.90), N1, HLB− fruits, HLB−, HLB−, HLB−, PC2, PC2, N1, N1, HLB−, α-terpinyl acetate, HLB−, N1, HLB+, HLB− fruit tissue ( Table 2, Z)-carvone, Z)-, E)-2,4-decadienal, α-terpinyl acetate, HLB−, N1, β-phellandrene, HLB−, HLB+ N4, PC2, HLB−]",[],[],"['Citrus', 'Citrus']",NaN

Secondary Metabolites Alkaloid profiles showed obvious differences between the mature fruit of PGW and SRW. A total of seven alkaloids were detected. Of which alkaloids betain and 4beta-hydroxy-11-O-(2′-pyrolylcarboxy) epilupinine showed a significant increase of 2.32- and 2.01-folds, while but theobromine exhibited a significant decline of 0.78-fold in PGW. Most of the hormones detected showed greater abundances in PGW. Among hormones, trans-zeatin-o-glucoside was significantly abundant (1.27-folds) in PGW, while trans-zeatin-riboside and ABA showed significantly higher amounts 0.82- and 0.72-folds, respectively, in SRW. Similarly, all the vitamins were relatively higher in PGW, while only one vitamin d-pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) was significantly higher by 2.35-folds in PGW. Metabolites that were classified as others showed striking differences between PGW and SRW. Seven metabolites accumulated in a significantly higher amount, whereas five declined in response to grafting ( Supplementary Materials). 3.1. Metabolome Comparison between Pumpkin-Grafted (PGW) and Self-Rooted Watermelon (SRW) To compare the metabolomics profiles of fully mature fruit from pumpkin-grafted watermelon (PGW) and a self-rooted watermelon (SRW) were analyzed based on LC-ESI-MS/MS high-throughput technology. In total, 339 metabolites were detected, of which 304 (90%) metabolites were classified into different classes while 33 (10%) were grouped into others. The percentage share of metabolite classes between treatments showed little variation, but the share percentage of different classes in the same treatment was markedly different. Of which lipids showing the highest percentage (28–32%), followed by secondary metabolites (17–19%), nucleotides and derivatives (16–18%), others (10–12%), organic acids (10–11%), amino acid and derivatives (9%), carbohydrates (2–3%), and nucleic acid and derivatives (2%) ( Figure 1). 3.2. Major Metabolites In total, 339 metabolites were identified with either high or low abundance between PGW and SRW. In each class, dominant metabolites were calculated regardless of grafting. It was found that delta-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, sucrose, mannose-6- phosphate (carbohydrates), homocysteine, 2-phenylglycine, s-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (amino acids and derivatives), malic, azelaic, H-butanoic acid ethylester-hexoside isomer 1, (organic acids MAG (18:3) isomer1, LysoPC 16:0, LysoPC 18:2 (2n isomer) (lipids), trans-zeatin N-glucoside, salicylic acid, ABA (hormones), pyridoxine O-glucoside, D-pantothenic acid, pyridoxine (vitamins), piperidine, trigonelline, isoquinoline (alkaloids), sorbitol (polyols), triterpenes-cucurbitacin (terpene), salicylic acid-O-glycoside, cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid (phenylpropanoids,) 3-indoleacetonitrile, indole, 5-hydroxytryptophol (indole derivatives), nicotinic acid-hexoside (nicotinic acid derivatives), uracil, 1-methyladenosine, 2-methyladenosine (nucleic acid and derivative), adenosine, 6-methylmercaptopurine, guanosine (nucleotide and its derivates), genistin (isoflavone), agmatine (phenolamide), 4-pyridoxic acid (pyridine derivatives), campesterol, soyasapogenol B, cycloartenol (sterol), N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (tryptamine derivatives), aminopurine, viscumamide, trans-2-hexenal (others) were among the dominant metabolites. ( Supplementary Materials). 3.3. Carbon Metabolism Carbohydrates are metabolized during glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycles to provide a carbon skeleton for other metabolites. Glucose is converted into pyruvate through series of enzymatic reactions in the glycolysis pathway, which further produce either acetyl-CoA or OAA through oxidation or carboxylation, respectively. TCA cycle starts with the condensation of acetyl-CoA and OAA to yield citrate, followed by conversion of citrate into iso-citrate through aconitase enzyme. In the next step, iso-citrate is dehydrogenized into α-ketoglutarate, which is further converted into succinyl-CoA by the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme. Oxaloacetate is produced from succinyl-CoA via the synthesis of succinate, fumarate, and malate [ 52]. Clear differences among the metabolites of the gluconeogenesis pathway, sugar metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) were observed on comparing mature fruit of PGW and SRW ( Figure 2). Glucose-6-phosphate, an intermediate of gluconeogenesis pathway, was significantly ( p < 0.05) greater by 1.75-fold in PGW. Relative contents of two trehalose and sucrose were 1.03- and 1.82-folds higher in PGW, respectively, but the difference was not significant statistically. Glucose is an essential sugar of watermelon, which was almost similar in PGW and SRW fruits. Intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle such as citrate, cis-aconitate, α-ketoglutaric acid, succinate, malic acid, and fumaric acid changed in response to grafting. Malic and fumaric acid showed a 1.40- ( p < 0.05) and 1.32-folds ( p > 0.05) increase in PGW, while the relative abundance of citrate and succinate were higher by 0.75- and 0.88-folds in SRW. Notably, α-ketoglutaric acid displayed 2.51-folds increase ( p < 0.05) in PGW, while the relative content of cis-aconitate was 1.87-folds ( p > 0.05) greater in PGW. 3.4. Carbohydrate Metabolism Among the carbohydrates, threose and delta-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride exhibited 2.63- and 1.21-folds higher contents ( p < 0.05) in mature fruit of PGW. In contrast, galacturonic acid (gala), galacturonic acid, and glucopyranuronate showed a significant ( p < 0.05) decline of 0.17-, 0.15-, and 0.16-folds as a consequence of grafting in PGW, respectively. Polyols are a distinct group of carbohydrates with their role in fruit quality and texture. Fruits from the grafted plant contained a significantly ( p < 0.05) higher amount of dulcitol, but the relative levels of inositol and sorbitol were more ( p > 0.05) in ungrafted watermelon ( Figure 3). 3.5. Arginine Metabolism Nitrogen is assimilated during the arginine pathway through a series of enzymatic reactions to convert glutamate into citrulline. In the last step, citrulline changes to arginine, which is required for development and stress conditions [ 53]. Nitrogen is recycled and distributed in the plant via arginine metabolism. Organic nitrogen is stored and transported in the plants in the form of arginine and citrulline because of their high carbon and nitrogen ratio [ 54]. The catabolism of citrulline starts with acetylation of glutamate [ 55] followed by phosphorylation, reduction, and transamination, yielding ornithine in a cyclic pathway by several enzymes. Subsequently, citrulline and arginine are synthesized from ornithine in a linear pathway by several coordinated enzymatic reactions [ 55, 56, 57]. Several nitrogen-rich amino acids of the arginine pathway such as ornithine, citrulline, and asparagines increased by 1.09-, 1.09-, and 1.03-folds in PGW, respectively, while the amount of glutamate, glutamine, arginine, and N-acetyl glutamate decreased by 0.66-, 0.65-, 0.94-, and 0.76-folds, respectively ( Figure 4). Interestingly, the grafting effect was only significant on glutamate. 3.6. Amino Acid Metabolism In total, 51 amino acids and amino acid derivatives were detected, of which 21 amino acids and their derivatives showed significantly higher levels either in PGW or SRW. Grafting significantly elevated the contents of 18 amino acids and their derivatives ( Supplementary Materials). Aromatic amino acids and their derivatives, including phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, N-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, N-acetyl-L-tyrosine, and hexose-phenylalanine, displayed significantly ( p < 0.05) greater abundance in PGW. Alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid involved in the GABA shunt pathway were observed to be increased by 0.80-fold in SRW ( Supplementary Materials). Several other amino acids, namely homoglutamic acid, cysteine, leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and valine, exhibited significantly greater abundance in PGW. Among the sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine increased significantly ( p < 0.05) by 1.64-folds, whereas the content of threonine decreased significantly ( p < 0.05) by 0.5-folds in PGW ( Figure 5). 3.7. Glutathione Metabolism GSH is synthesized from glutamate, cysteine, and glycine by the action of two enzymes (γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-ECS) and glutathione synthase (GSHS)). γ-carboxyl group of Glu and an α-amino group of Cys are combined in the first step to form γ glutamyl-cysteine by a γ-ECS enzyme. In the next step, the GSHS enzyme carried out reaction by creating an amide bond with the α-carboxyl group of the cysteine moiety in γ-glutamylcysteine and the α-amino group of glycine to yield GSH. Then this reduced GSH is converted in oxidized GSSH form under particular circumstances such as stress or other stimuli. GSH can be directly or converted into other forms to be consumed in other chemical reactions. In the following step, cys-glyc is released, and GSH combines with a free amino acid, forming γ-glutamyl amino acid. With the removal of amino acid from γ-glutamyl amino acid 5-oxoproline is produced, and the cycle continues [ 58, 59]. Several intermediates were detected in the metabolic pathway of glutathione and showed obvious differences between PGW and SRW. All the intermediates of this pathway were accumulated in greater abundances in PGW than SRW, including oxidized glutathione (GSSG), glutathione reduced form (GSG), 5-oxoproline, cysteine, γ-glutamyl-AA. Specifically, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and cysteine were 1.37- and 1.26-folds ( p < 0.05) greater in PGW than SRW. One intermediate glutamate was found significantly higher in SRW, while cys-glyc was stable in PGW and SRW ( Figure 6). 3.8. Phenylpropanoid Metabolism Phenylpropanoid constitutes a large group of secondary metabolites that play a central role against stresses, provide structural support to plants, and are implicated in plant survival. Range of metabolites such as flavonoids, coumarins, hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates, and lignans are produced in the metabolic pathway of phenylpropanoid. The pathway begins with phenylalanine, which undergoes a series of reactions to produce lignans, hydroxycinnamics, ferulic and sinapic acids and their corresponding esters, benzoic acid derivatives, and pigments such as chalcones, flavonoids, and anthocyanin [ 7, 60]. Some secondary metabolites, such as phenols, flavonoids, flavanones, flavonols, etc. that are produced during the phenylpropanoid pathway showed slight differences with the exception of p-coumaric acid between PGW and SRW. Two flavanones (naringenin chalcone, neohesperidin), one amino acid (phenylalanine), two hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives (ferulic acid, confiryl alcohol), two flavone (luteolin 7-O-glucoside and cosmosin), one quinate derivative (chlorogenic acid), and one flavanole (nicotiflorin) were present in higher abundance in PGW as compared to SRW ( Figure 7). In addition, some phenylpropanoids compounds such as cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, p-Coumaraldehyde, coniferylaldehyde, sinapyl alcohol, flavones-c-glycosides, vitexin, isovitexin, flavones, and chrysoeriol showed substantially higher abundances in SRW than PGW. However, few hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives showed significant variation in PGW, of which one derivative was higher, and three were shown to have lower content in PGW. Two flavone-c-glucoside and benzoid derivatives were abundant ( p < 0.05.) in PGW compared to SRW. Grafting caused a significant decline ( p < 0.05) in the content of one flavone and two polyphenols ( Supplementary Materials). 3.9. Linolenic Acid Metabolism and Fatty Acids Linolenic acid is produced from fatty acid metabolism, which is further catalyzed into diverse classes of compounds, including ketones, alcohols, volatiles, esters, aroma compounds, aldehydes, alkenes, acids, and other compounds [ 61, 62]. The first step is the oxidation of linolenic acid followed by dehydration of 13-hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic acid carried out by lipoxygenases (LOXs) and allene oxide synthase, respectively [ 63]. The unstable epoxide generated in the above step is then cyclized stereospecifically and converted into 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) by allene oxide cyclase (AOC) followed by reduction and removal of side carbon chain in series of reactions that lead to the formation of jasmonic acid [ 64, 65]. Lipids measured in this study belong to fatty acid, lipids, glycerolipids, and glycerophospholipids classes, most of the lipids accumulated in a higher amount in mature fruit of PGW than SRW. Most of the linolenic pathway intermediates showed a greater abundance in PGW than SRW, with the exception of 13-HpOTrE(r) ( Figure 8). Lipids such as 13-HPODE (1.23-fold), MAG (18:3) isomer5 (1.58-fold), MAG (18:3) isomer3 (1.50-fold), MAG (18:3) isomer2 (1.49-fold), LysoPC (18:1) 2n isomer (2.39-fold), LysoPC 18:1 (2.83-fold), LysoPC 18:0 (2.59-fold), and LysoPC 20:4 (3.46-fold) were significantly abundant in mature fruit of PGW ( Figure 9).","Grafting has been reported as a factor regulating the metabolome of a plant. Therefore, a comprehensive metabolic profile and comparative analysis of metabolites were conducted from fully mature fruit of pumpkin-grafted watermelon (PGW) and a self-rooted watermelon (SRW). Widely targeted LC-ESI-MS/MS metabolomics approach facilitated the simultaneous identification and quantification of 339 metabolites across PGW and SRW. Regardless of grafting, delta-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, sucrose, mannose-6-phosphate (carbohydrates), homocystine, 2-phenylglycine, s-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (amino acids and derivatives), malic, azelaic, H-butanoic acid ethyl ester-hexoside isomer 1, (organic acids), MAG (18:3) isomer1, LysoPC 16:0, LysoPC 18:2 2n isomer (lipids) p-coumaric acid, piperidine, and salicylic acid-o-glycoside (secondary metabolites) were among the dominant metabolite. Dulcitol, mono-, and disaccharide sugars were higher in PGW, while polysaccharides showed complex behavior. In PGW, most aromatic and nitrogen-rich amino acids accumulated greater than 1.5- and 1-fold, respectively. Intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), stress-related metabolites, vitamin B5, and several flavonoids were significantly more abundant in PGW. Most lipids were also significantly higher in grafted watermelon. This is the first report providing a comprehensive picture of watermelon metabolic profile and changes induced by grafting. Hence, the untargeted high-throughput LC-ESI-MS/MS metabolomics approach could be suitable to provide significant differences in metabolite contents between grafted and ungrafted plants.","['Metabolites', 'Watermelon', 'Grafting']","['PGW', 'acid', 'SRW', 'amino acid', 'acids', 'Metabolites', 'Supplementary Materials', 'derivatives', 'amino', 'Figure']","[2.32-, 2.01-folds, trans-zeatin-o-glucoside, 1.27-folds, trans-zeatin-riboside, ABA, 2.35-folds, Self-Rooted Watermelon, 28–32, 10–12, nucleic acid, SRW, mannose-6- phosphate, s-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, H-butanoic acid ethylester-hexoside isomer 1, ABA, triterpenes-cucurbitacin, sterol), aconitase, α-ketoglutarate, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, Glucose-6-phosphate, 1.82-folds, α-ketoglutaric acid, 1.32-folds, 0.88-folds, α-ketoglutaric acid, 2.51-folds, 1.87-folds, glucopyranuronate, 0.16-folds, glutamate, glutamate [, ornithine, 1.03-folds, glutamate, glutamate, SRW, N-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, hexose-phenylalanine, Alanine, GABA, 1.64-folds, 0.5-folds, glutamate, γ-ECS, glutathione synthase, γ-carboxyl, Glu, α-amino, γ glutamyl-cysteine, γ-ECS, α-carboxyl, γ-glutamylcysteine, α-amino, cys-glyc, γ-glutamyl amino, γ-glutamyl amino acid, SRW, γ-glutamyl-AA, glutamate, cys-glyc, hydroxycinnamics, anthocyanin [ 7, quinate derivative, p-Coumaraldehyde, flavones-c-glycosides, flavone-c-glucoside, LOXs, SRW, 13-HpOTrE(r, MAG, MAG, MAG]",[],[],[],NaN
151,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC8170412\eupmc_result.json,PMC8170412,"Results Strawberry Fruit Flavor and Aroma QTL Volatile aroma QTL were discovered for methyl anthranilate (CAS 134-20-3), methyl 2-methylbutyrate (CAS 868-57-5), methyl 2-hexenoate (CAS 2396-77-2) ( Figures 1,  2), mesifurane (CAS 4077-47-8) ( Figure 3), and nine mono- and sesquiterpene compounds ( Figures 4,  5). These terpenes include linalool (CAS 78-70-6), 3-carene (CAS 498-15-7), β-phellandrene (CAS 555-10-2), α-limonene (CAS 5989-27-5), linalool oxide (CAS 60047-17-8), nerolidol (CAS 7212-44-4), α-caryophellene (CAS 6753-98-6), α-farnesene (CAS 502-61-4), and β-farnesene (CAS 77129-48-7). Many of these compounds are consensus determinants of preferred strawberry flavor in human sensory trials, including grape-like methyl anthranilate ( Ulrich et al., 1997), fruity-sweet methyl 2-methylbutanoate ( Schieberle and Hofmann, 1997), fruity linalool ( Larsen and Poll, 1992;  Schieberle and Hofmann, 1997;  Ulrich et al., 1997;  Schwieterman, 2013), and sherry/caramel-like mesifurane ( Larsen and Poll, 1992;  Schieberle and Hofmann, 1997;  Ulrich et al., 1997;  Schwieterman, 2013). Population-wide fruit transcript-level data for all candidate genes in the following analysis are provided in  Supplementary Table 1, and transcript levels throughout the “Camarosa” plant are provided in  Supplementary Table 2. Methyl Anthranilate and Methyl Ester QTL and Candidate Genes Methyl anthranilate ( h  2 = 0.59) QTL were identified on octoploid linkage groups (LGs) 2A and 5A of the FL_08-10 × 12.115-10 map ( Figure 1A and  Table 1). The LG 2A QTL is shared with methyl 2-hexenoate ( h2 = 0.43) and methyl 2-methylbutyrate ( h2 = 0.79) ( Figure 1A and  Table 1). This shared methyl ester QTL accounts for 11.7% of methyl anthranilate variance ( p = 5.1e−5), 22.8% of methyl 2-hexenoate variance ( p = 7.6e−5), and 18.1% of methyl 2-methylbutyrate variance  (p = 4.7e−7) (AX-123540849, single-marker analysis) ( Figure 1B). The QTL on LG 5D explains 19.7% of methyl anthranilate variance (AX-123358624,  p = 6.324e–07). A diagram of known and hypothesized methyl anthranilate pathway components is provided in  Supplementary Figure 2. The QTL on LG 2A broadly corresponds to the  F. vesca-like Chr 2-2 of the “Camarosa” octoploid genome, based on chromosome-wide genetic–genomic connections ( Hardigan et al., 2020). However, nucleotide BLAST of IStraw35 methyl anthranilate marker sequences align non-specifically to all “Camarosa” Chr 2 homoeologs except Chr 2-2 ( Table 1). The corresponding syntenic regions of Chr 2-1 and Chr 2-3 each contain an  ANTHRANILIC ACID METHYL TRANSFERASE-like homoeolog. The most-correlated QTL marker (AX-123540849) aligns 10 kb (two genes) from the  AAMT-like gene on Chr 2-1 (maker-Fvb2-1-snap-gene-255.58) and 14.6 kb (four genes) from the  AAMT-like gene on Chr 2-3 (maker-Fvb2-3-snap-gene-33.59) ( Figures 2A,B and  Table 1). These two  FanAAMT- like genes have the highest sequence identity to the published Chr 4  FanAAMT gene except the highly expressed  FanAAMT gene on Chr 4-1 and its non-expressed homoeologs ( Figure 2). Reference-based RNA-seq shows that both candidate  FanAAMT-like transcripts are highly abundant in some fruit transcriptomes, but relatively low or almost absent in others (Chr 2-1, 3-278 TPM; Chr 2-3, 15-1324 TPM) ( Supplementary Table 1). The RNA-seq read alignments for both gene models show atypically high degrees of sequence disagreement with the “Camarosa” reference, which suggests these transcript reads could be derived from an alternative locus, such as a hypothesized deletion on Chr 2-2 ( Supplementary Figure 3). In the LG 5D/Chr 5-4 QTL region, no candidate genes were found, which correspond to known or hypothesized strawberry methyl anthranilate pathway components. However, a co-segregating transcript eQTL on Chr 5-4 was identified for a putative glutathione peroxidase gene (maker-Fvb5-4-augustus-gene-12.41) (transcript level  h  2 = 1.0) ( Table 1). Single-marker analysis explains 51.1% of the transcript variations observed (AX-123358624,  p = 2.8-e9) ( Supplementary Figure 4A). Accumulation of this transcript positively correlates with methyl anthranilate production ( Supplementary Figure 4B). A possible third methyl anthranilate signal on Chr 7 corresponds with the position of two  ANTHRANILATE SYNTHASE ALPHA ( FanAS-α) homoeologs ( Supplementary Figure 5A and  Supplementary Table 3). Both genes represent the only  FanAS-α transcripts abundant in the fruit ( Supplementary Figure 5B), and presence/absence variation of the Chr 7-4  FanAS-α transcript is governed by a  cis-eQTL, which co-segregates with the methyl anthranilate signal ( Supplementary Figures 5C,D). Mesifurane QTL and Candidate Genes Two mesifurane ( h  2 = 0.72) QTLs were identified on LGs 1A and 7B of the FL_08-10 × 12.115-10 map ( Figures 3A,B and  Table 2). The mesifurane volatile QTL on LG 7B co-segregates with a transcript eQTL for the published mesifurane biosynthesis gene  O-METHYL TRANSFERASE 1 ( FanOMT1; maker-Fvb7-4-augustus-gene-6.44 ) ( h2 of transcript accumulation = 0.80) ( Figure 3B). Homozygosity of the mesifurane LG 7B minor allele (AX-123363184) eliminates both  FanOMT1 transcript and mesifurane production ( Figure 3C). The  FanOMT1 allelic states correspond with stepwise increases in transcript abundance ( Figure 3C). A novel mesifurane QTL was detected on LG 1A of the FL_08-10 × 12.115-10 genetic map ( Figure 3A and  Table 2). Alignments of probe nucleotide sequences to the “Camarosa” genome are not subgenome specific ( Table 2). An epistatic interaction was detected between the two QTLs [ F(6,173) = 13.78,  p = 9.0e−13] ( Figure 3D). Homozygosity of the Chr 1-group QTL (AA genotype) strongly diminishes mesifurane abundance even when the competent Chr 7-4  FanOMT1 allele is homozygous (BB genotype), and transcript abundance is highest (AA/BB vs. AB/BB Tukey HSD  p = 2.4e−7). At least one competent allele at each locus is required for robust mesifurane production ( Figure 3D). Mesifurane abundance is somewhat higher when both alleles are homozygous [BB/BB vs. AB/AB, AB/BB, and BB/AB ANOVA  F(1,149) = 4.38,  p = 0.038]. Because the mesifurane Chr 1 QTL probe sequences align equally well to multiple subgenomes, all Chr 1 homoeologous regions were considered for candidate gene identification. The published furaneol biosynthesis gene  FanQR (maker-Fvb6-3-augustus-gene-21.50) is not located in Chr group 1 nor were genes of similar function found in the region. The published  F. ×  ananassa furaneol glucosyltransferase gene from  Yamada et al. (2019) (UGT85K16) has two putative homologs located in the “Camarosa” Chr 1 group; however, they are over 10 Mb from the mesifurane Chr 1 QTL (100% nucleotide identity, maker-Fvb1-4-augustus-gene-115.43; 97% nucleotide identity, maker-Fvb1-2-augustus-gene-137.19) ( Table 2). The two most active  F. ×  ananassa furaneol glucosyltransferases from  Song et al. (2016) (UGT71K3a/b and UGT73B23/4) have putative orthologs outside of the Chr 1 group (98% nucleotide identity, augustus_masked-Fvb3-4-processed-gene-50.19; 100% nucleotide identity; augustus_masked-Fvb2-2-processed-gene-195.2). However, UGT73B23/4 has a highly identical second homolog in Chr 1-2 (augustus_masked-Fvb1-2-processed-gene-35.18; 96% nucleotide identity, 100% coverage) located 164 genes (0.9 Mb) from the most significant mesifurane marker (AX-166520175,  p = 2.4e−6) and 49 genes (0.2 Mb) from the marker AX-166510720 ( p = 5.6e−05) ( Figure 3A and  Table 2). In diverse tissues of the “Camarosa” plant (AX-166520175 = BB), the candidate Chr 1-2 furaneol glucosyltransferase transcript levels are high in roots but low in the ripe fruit, with fruit expression somewhat increasing with ripening series ( Supplementary Table 3). In the mature fruit RNA-seq populations, the Chr 1-2 candidate is modestly expressed in the fruit (5.3 ± 2.2 TPM). Using a high-resolution melting (HRM) assay in two separate crosses ( n = 72), two HRM markers targeting SNPs in the mesifurane Chr 1-2 QTL (AX-166520175 and AX-166502845) were tested for association with mesifurane abundance in marker-assisted seedling selection. Both Chr 1 markers were confirmed to predict the segregation of mesifurane abundance [ F(1,71) = 8.25823,  p = 0.0006] ( Supplementary Figure 6). Terpene QTL and Candidate Genes A shared QTL for the production of nine terpene compounds was discovered corresponding to Chr 3 of the  F. vesca physical map. Only two shared terpene markers are positioned in an octoploid genetic map (AX-166504318, AX-166521725), both of which correspond to LG 3B in “Holiday” × “Korona” ( Figure 4A and  Table 3), which represents Chr 3-3 in the “Camarosa” genome ( Hardigan et al., 2020). For linalool ( h  2 = 0.749), the most-correlated QTL marker (AX-166513106,  p = 4.2e−11) explains 14.8% of the observed variance in linalool abundance. This represents a large absolute difference as linalool is among the most abundant volatiles in strawberry fruit, commonly exceeding 100 ng 1 gFW –1 h –1 in the cultivars used as parental lines for these populations ( Schwieterman, 2013). The linalool QTL is shared with the monoterpenes 3-carene ( R2 = 0.09,  p = 1.2e−8), β-phellandrene ( R2 = 0.21,  p = 7.0e−7), α-limonene ( R2 = 0.06,  p = 7.0e−7), and linalool oxide ( R2 = 0.08,  p = 4.4e−6), and the sesquiterpenes nerolidol ( R2 = 0.09,  p = 4.3e−6), α-caryophellene ( R2 = 0.10,  p = 8.9e−6), α-farnesene ( R2 = 0.16,  p = 1.6e−6), and β-farnesene ( R2 = 0.12,  p = 2.4e−7) ( Figures 4A,B and  Table 4). The four sesquiterpene QTL are comprised of two shared significant markers, which are also common to the monoterpenes ( Table 4). Mono- and sesquiterpene volatile abundances are very strongly correlated within group, and moderately correlated between groups ( Figure 5). The LG 3B terpene QTL IStraw35 probe sequences align non-specifically to all four Chr 3 homoeologs ( Table 3). These corresponding genomic regions contain putative terpenoid biosynthesis gene clusters, which together contain three annotated copies of  (3S,6E)-NEROLIDOL SYNTHASE, three copies of  (E,E)-ALPHA-FARNESENE SYNTHASE, and three copies of  SOLANESYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE ( Table 3). The characterized  FanNES1 deletion responsible for linalool biosynthesis in octoploids was not detected among the “Camarosa”  FanNES1-like gene sequences; however, this gene appears on Chr 3-3 in the updated “Camarosa” v2 genome (Hardigan, personal communication). To assess terpenoid-related transcript levels in fruit, the published  FanNES1 gene sequence was added  ad hoc to the “Camarosa” v1 genome as an independent contig prior to reference-based RNA-seq re-assembly. The resulting  FanNES1 transcript was the only  NES1-like transcript abundant in fruit ( Table 3). Two eQTL signals co-segregated with terpene QTL markers ( Table 4). These eQTL correspond to the ambiguously located  FanNES1 gene and to a  cis-eQTL for a novel  SOLANESYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE ( FanSPS) gene on Chr 3-3 (maker-Fvb3-3-augustus-gene-10.48). Linalool abundance ( n = 61) is statistically correlated with  FanNES1 transcript levels ( R2 = 0.31,  p = 0.017), but a significant relationship was not detected with  FanSPS ( R2 = 0.20,  p = 0.14). An additional  cis-eQTL was detected for an  (E,E)-ALPHA-FARNESENE SYNTHASE gene on Chr 3-2 (maker-Fvb3-2-augustus-gene-19.46) (AX-166522353;  R2 = 0.50,  p = 1.9e−7). While this terpene biosynthesis gene is positioned closely with potential IStraw35 physical positions ( Table 3), these markers do not genetically co-segregate with the terpene QTL, and transcript levels are not correlated with linalool abundance ( R2 = 0.004,  p = 0.98).","The cultivated strawberry ( Fragaria  ×  ananassa ) is an economically important fruit crop that is intensively bred for improved sensory qualities. The diversity of fruit flavors and aromas in strawberry results mainly from the interactions of sugars, acids, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are derived from diverse biochemical pathways influenced by the expression of many genes. This study integrates multiomic analyses to identify QTL and candidate genes for multiple aroma compounds in a complex strawberry breeding population. Novel fruit volatile QTL was discovered for methyl anthranilate, methyl 2-hexenoate, methyl 2-methylbutyrate, mesifurane, and a shared QTL on Chr 3 was found for nine monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds, including linalool, 3-carene, β-phellandrene, α-limonene, linalool oxide, nerolidol, α-caryophellene, α-farnesene, and β-farnesene. Fruit transcriptomes from a subset of 64 individuals were used to support candidate gene identification. For methyl esters including the grape-like methyl anthranilate, a novel  ANTHANILIC ACID METHYL TRANSFERASE -like gene was identified. Two mesifurane QTL correspond with the known biosynthesis gene  O-METHYL TRANSFERASE 1  and a novel  FURANEOL GLUCOSYLTRANSFERASE . The shared terpene QTL contains multiple fruit-expressed terpenoid pathway-related genes including  NEROLIDOL SYNTHASE 1  ( FanNES1 ). The abundance of linalool and other monoterpenes is partially governed by a co-segregating expression-QTL (eQTL) for  FanNES1  transcript variation, and there is additional evidence for quantitative effects from other terpenoid-pathway genes in this narrow genomic region. These QTLs present new opportunities in breeding for improved flavor in commercial strawberry.","['QTL analysis', 'terpenes', 'Transcriptomics', 'Eqtl Analysis', 'Aromas', 'Fruit Volatiles']","['Supplementary Figure', 'CAS', 'Chr', 'Supplementary Table', 'Figure', 'Table', 'QTL', 'methyl anthranilate', 'Aroma QTL', 'methyl']","[anthranilate (CAS 134, anthranilate, fruity-sweet methyl 2-methylbutanoate, sherry/caramel-like mesifurane, FL_08-10 ×, LG 2A, AX-123540849, LG, AX-123358624, anthranilate, “Camarosa” Chr 2, Chr 2-2, Chr 2-1, Chr 2-3, Chr 2-1, maker-Fvb2-1-snap-gene-255.58, Chr 2-3, maker-Fvb2-3-snap-gene-33.59, Chr 4, Chr 4-1, Chr 2-1, Chr 2-3, RNA-seq, Chr 2-2, LG 5D/Chr 5-4, Chr 5-4, glutathione peroxidase, maker-Fvb5-4-augustus-gene-12.41, AX-123358624, 2.8-e9, anthranilate signal, FanAS-α, Chr 7-4, anthranilate signal ( Supplementary Figures, Mesifurane, LGs 1A, 7B, FL_08-10 ×, LG 7B, FanOMT1, maker-Fvb7-4-augustus-gene-6.44, AX-123363184, LG 1A, FL_08-10 ×, 9.0e−13], Chr 7-4, AB/BB Tukey HSD  , Mesifurane, BB/BB, AB/BB, BB/AB, Chr 1, maker-Fvb6-3-augustus-gene-21.50, Chr group 1, glucosyltransferase, maker-Fvb1-4-augustus-gene-115.43, maker-Fvb1-2-augustus-gene-137.19, UGT71K3a/b, Chr 1, augustus_masked-Fvb3-4-processed-gene-50.19, augustus_masked-Fvb2-2-processed-gene-195.2, UGT73B23/4, Chr 1-2, augustus_masked-Fvb1-2-processed-gene-35.18, AX-166520175, 2.4e−6, AX-166510720, Chr 1-2, Chr 1-2, AX-166520175, AX-166502845, Chr 1, Chr 3, AX-166504318, AX-166521725, LG 3B, “Holiday”, Chr 3-3, AX-166513106, 4.2e−11, –1, Schwieterman, 7.0e−7, 7.0e−7, 4.4e−6, 1.6e−6, LG 3B, Chr 3, E)-ALPHA-FARNESENE, Chr 3-3, RNA-seq, Chr 3-3, maker-Fvb3-3-augustus-gene-10.48, Chr 3-2, maker-Fvb3-2-augustus-gene-19.46]",[],[],[],NaN
152,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC8214791\eupmc_result.json,PMC8214791,"Results Identification and evolutionary analysis of  VvHMGRs genes in grape We predicted  VvHMGR in the genome sequence scaffolds of Pinot noir grape and used HMMER 3.0 and Pfam protein family databases to search sequence homologs in grape genomes. SMAT and INTERPROSCAN programs were used to verify the predicted genes, which were three  VvHMGRs in grape,  VvHMGR1 (XM_002283147),  VvHMGR2 (XM_002265602),  VvHMGR3 (XM_002275791). Three  VvHMGRs are located on chromosomes 3, 4, and 18, respectively (Fig.  1C), and the length of the coding region is between 1710 and 1930 bp, which is the same as  Arabidopsis thaliana, Citrus sinensis, Glycine max, Populus trichocarpa, and  Solanum lycopersicum. The information of  HMGRs genes of 7 species is listed in Table S 2. The secondary structure of all  HMGRs genes is dominated by α helix and random coils, accounting for 80% (Table S 3), and all are located at the endoplasmic reticulum (Table S 4). According to the analysis of the evolutionary relationship (Fig.  1A),  VvHMGR1 is closely related to  CsHMGR2, PtHMGR3 and  PtHMGR5, and  VvHMGR2 closest to  PtHMGR1 and  PtHMGR6, while  VvHMGR3 closest to  CsHMGR1 and  GmHMGR9, which has collinearity with  CsHMGR2 and  GmHMGR4 (Fig.  1B). HMGR is highly conserved among different species (Fig.  1A, Fig. S 1). It contains 14 common motifs (Fig. S 2). The structures of VvHMGR1 and VvHMGR2 are consistent. Compared with other members, VvHMGR3 has motif16. All  HMGR genes from selected species contain no introns, and at least one UTR region except for  GmHMGR6 (Fig.  1D). The gene structure of  VvHMGRs is consistent, with the same number and different lengths of UTRs. Tissue expression of HMGR family in ‘Kyoho’ grape We detected the expression levels of 3 HMGRs family members in the bud, root, stem, leaf, flower, tendril, exocarp, pulp, and xylem sap of 'Kyoho' grape. The results showed that the expression of  VvHMGRs in 'Kyoho' had obvious organization specificity. As shown in Fig.  2A,  VvHMGR1 has always been highly expressed, and its expression levels in leaves, flowers, and exocarp was much higher than in other tissues. The expression level of  VvHMGR2 was the lowest among the three members, and expression level in stems, flowers and exocarp were higher than in other tissues. The expression level of  VvHMGR3 was low in peel and pulp and higher in other tissues. As the fruit develops, the expression level of  VvHMGR3 was getting lower gradually. By measuring the enzyme activity of HMGR during the fruit development process, as a whole, the enzyme activity in peel and pulp showed a decreasing trend, and higher in pulp than peel (Fig.  2B). This phenomenon indicates that  VvHMGR3 is more directly related to the enzymatic activity of HMGR, and its expression greatly affects the enzymatic activity. Therefore, the enzyme activity in the peel is lower than that in pulp. Expression patterns of  VvHMGRs during different developmental stages in different types of grapes Through the detection of expression levels of  VvHMGRs in ten grape varieties, we found that  VvHMGR1 has always maintained a relatively high expression level during the fruit development of all varieties, especially in yellow rose fragrance varieties (Fig.  3). The expression level of  VvHMGR2 was always low, not affected by the fruit development stage in ‘Summer Black’ ‘Fujiminori’ ‘Jing Zaojing’ and ‘Centennial seedless’, while decreased gradually in other varieties. The expression level of  VvHMGR3 in rose fragrance varieties (‘Shine Muscat’ and ‘Yellow Italia’) was higher than that of other varieties, and it showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing during fruit development, which was related to the enlargement of early fruit and strong terpenoid metabolism as aroma formation in the later fruit. However, this phenomenon did not exist in strawberry fragrance fruits. Overall, the expression levels of  VvHMGRs in different color fruits were different, and the expression level in red fruits was low, especially in ‘Summer Black’ and ‘Fujiminori’. In the yellow varieties with rose fragrance, the expression level of  VvHMGRs was the highest, and in the red varieties with strawberry fragrance was the lowest. The expression level of  VvHMGR3 in yellow fruit was overall high, especially deep yellow color variety ‘Shine Muscat’ and ‘Yellow Italia’, while ‘Jingzaojing’ and ‘Centennial seedless’, which are mainly green, showed relatively low expression. In the sampling process, we found that the yellow color of ‘Red Italian’ was deepening in the early stage of fruit development, and it was pale pink when mature. The expression pattern of  VvHMGR3 was similar to the yellow variety, which also confirmed this phenomenon. Aroma components in different types of grapes The aroma components of 10 varieties in berry skin and berry flesh were measured at the mature stage, and results showed that the aroma components in the berry skin were more abundant than that in berry flesh (Fig. S 3, Table S 5). There were 18, 20, 20, 26, 33 types of aroma in berry skin more than that in berry flesh in rose-scented varieties, 29, 37, 39 types in strawberry-scented varieties, and 20, 26 in non-fragrant varieties. The main terpene aromas in grapes included linalool and geraniol, of which geraniol was mainly in the rose-scented varieties. We found that β-pinene and α-pinene were mainly volatile aroma components in strawberry-scented varieties (Fig.  4). Linalool is the key component of terpene aroma in grapes, found in different scented varieties and occupied a large proportion. ‘Red Italia’ was a red rose-scented variety with many unique ingredients, different from red strawberry-scented varieties, red non-fragrant and green rose-scented varieties. D-limonene was rich in berry skin and berry flesh of ‘Red Italia’, cis-linaloloxide and trans-rose oxide were also specifically detected in ‘Red Italia’. In addition, we also detected germacrene D,which belong to the sesquiterpene aroma in ‘Jing Zaojing’ and ‘Summer Black’. Changes of terpenoids and anthocyanin metabolism associated genes expression and their correlation with  VvHMGRs The gene expression levels of aroma formation and color-related pathways were tested in skins from ten grape varieties at the mature stage. After gene-level clustering (Fig.  5A), we found that  VvHMGR3 had similar trends in expression with  VvCRTISO1, VvZDS, VvCYP97A, VvDXR, and  VvCMK.  VvHMGR1 was similar with the changes of  VvMCT, VvNCED6, and  VvLCYB.  VvHMGR2 was similar with  VvGGPPS-SS and  VvCCD8, which means that  VvHMGRs might be linked to the carotenoid biosynthesis and MEP pathways. Because of the high expressed genes concealing the changes of other genes, we have carried out the normalization of genes to show each gene to the greatest extent. Through sample-level clustering (Fig.  5B), the MVA pathway genes expression patterns of typical yellow rose-scented varieties ‘Shine-Muscat’ were the same with ‘Centennial Seedless’, and clustered together with ‘Yellow Italia’. The MEP pathway gene expression pattern of ‘Shine-Muscat’ were different from others, and its anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway was consistent with the changes in ‘Yellow Italia’, carotenoid biosynthesis was similar to ‘Centennial Seedless’, but carotenoid catabolism and xanthophyll biosynthesis were different from others. The typical red cultivars ‘Wink’ and ‘Fujiminori’ were clustered together in all six pathways, suggesting that these two cultivars were very similar in terms of terpenoid synthesis and metabolism and anthocyanin biosynthesis. HMGR plays an important role in grape growth and development By analyzing the transmembrane structure, VvHMGRs protein exhibited transmembrane properties. VvHMGR1 had 9 inside to outside (i-o) helices, 9 outside to inside helices (o-i), VvHMGR2 had 7 i-o and 8 o-i, and VvHMGR3 had 6 i-o and 5 o-i (Fig. S 4A). The secondary structures of VvHMGRs were quite different, composed of alpha-helix, extended strand, and random coil, and distributed throughout the protein (Fig. S 4B). The tertiary structure was highly conserved, and its catalytic region contains L, N, and S three binding domains. The L domain is the largest, with two HMG-CoA binding domains and one NADP(H) binding domain, while the small spiral S domain contains another NADP(H) binding domain (Fig. S 4C). The computational predictions for cis elements in the promoter of the  VvHMGRs genes suggest that they are in a complex network of environmental and phytohormone regulation (Fig. S 4D). Through the interaction protein prediction based on protein structure, VvHMGRs possibly interact with HMG-CoA synthase, MVA kinase, FPP/GGPP synthase, and diphosphate mevalonate decarboxylase confirming that the most important effect of HMGR was to take part in the synthesize and metabolize of terpenoids based on MVA pathways (Fig. S 4E). Combined with evolutionary bioinformatics analysis (Fig.  1, S 4), tissue expression pattern (Fig.  2), and expression pattern of  VvHMGRs in different types of fruits (Fig.  3,  5), we predicted  VvHMGR3 play an important role in the growth and development process of grape. VvHMGR3 responds to external conditions We can see the variation of  VvHMGR3 under different pH, osmotic stress, NaCl concentration, temperature, and UV treatment time from Fig.  6. On the whole,  VvHMGR3 was regulated by salt stress, temperature stress, and ultraviolet radiation, and it also had different responses to four hormones. The final expression of  VvHMGR3 was up-regulated under Eth, MeJA, SA and IAA treatment, and the response time was different, Eth was 48 h, AA was 24 h, MeJA and SA were 12 h, respectively. For the concentration of treatment,  VvHMGR3 was affected by the high concentration of MeJA and medium concentration of SA, the expression of VvHMGR3 was proportional to the hormone concentration except for SA. In osmotic stress treatment, the response of  VvHMGR3 to pH and PEG was lower than that of NaCl, which was manifested as a relatively alkaline environment, high osmotic value, and high salt content. The expression of  VvHMGR3increased sharply at 24 h and then decreased slowly under normal conditions, while under UV treatment, the expression of  VvHMGR3 was much higher than normal grapes at 24 h, indicating that UV promoted the expression of  VvHMGR3. During the postharvest storage, ultra-low temperature treatment (-20 °C) slowed down the high expression of  VvHMGR3, while high temperature (25 °C and 37 °C) and ordinary low temperature (4 °C) decreased the expression of  VvHMGR3. In summary,  VvHMGR3 was regulated by hormone, osmotic stress, light and temperature stress, especially salt stress, and UV treatment."," Background 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) is a key enzyme in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, which regulates the metabolism of terpenoids in the cytoplasm and determines the type and content of downstream terpenoid metabolites. Results Results showed that grapevine HMGR family has three members, such as VvHMGR1, VvHMGR2, and VvHMGR3. The expression of VvHMGRs in 'Kyoho' has tissue specificity, for example, VvHMGR1 keeps a higher expression, VvHMGR2 is the lowest, and VvHMGR3 gradually decreases as the fruit development. VvHMGR3 is closely related to CsHMGR1 and GmHMGR9 and has collinearity with CsHMGR2 and GmHMGR4. By the prediction of interaction protein, it can interact with HMG-CoA synthase, MVA kinase, FPP/GGPP synthase, diphosphate mevalonate decarboxylase, and participates in the synthesis and metabolism of terpenoids. VvHMGR3 have similar trends in expression with some of the genes of carotenoid biosynthesis and MEP pathways. VvHMGR3 responds to various environmental and phytohormone stimuli, especially salt stress and ultraviolet (UV) treatment. The expression level of VvHMGRs is diverse in grapes of different colors and aroma. VvHMGRs are significantly higher in yellow varieties than that in red varieties, whereas rose-scented varieties showed significantly higher expression than that of strawberry aroma. The expression level is highest in yellow rose-scented varieties, and the lowest in red strawberry scent varieties, especially 'Summer Black' and 'Fujiminori'. Conclusion This study confirms the important role of VvHMGR3 in the process of grape fruit coloring and aroma formation, and provided a new idea to explain the loss of grape aroma and poor coloring during production. There may be an additive effect between color and aroma in the HMGR expression aspect.","['Grape', 'Terpenoids', 'Color', 'Aroma', 'Hmgr']","['expression', 'Fig.', 'expression level', 'varieties', 'VvHMGRs', 'Yellow Italia’', 'Pinot noir', 'yellow', 'genes', 'level']","[XM_002283147, XM_002265602, Glycine, α, PtHMGR3, HMGR, Fig. S 1, VvHMGR1, VvHMGR2, VvHMGR3, motif16, UTRs, HMGR, HMGR, HMGR, ‘, ‘Centennial, ‘Yellow, ’, ‘, ’, ‘Fujiminori’, ‘, ‘Yellow, ’, ‘Jingzaojing, ’, ‘Centennial, ‘Red, ’, α-pinene, ‘Red, ’, ’, ’, ‘, ‘, ’, VvZDS, VvCYP97A, VvDXR, VvNCED6, ‘, ‘Yellow, ’, ‘Yellow, ’, ‘, ’, ‘Fujiminori’, HMGR, VvHMGRs, VvHMGR2, VvHMGR3 had, VvHMGRs, Fig. S 4D, VvHMGRs, HMG-CoA synthase, FPP/GGPP synthase, HMGR, S 4, VvHMGR3, Eth, SA, Eth, SA were 12 , SA, VvHMGR3, alkaline]",[],[],['Citrus'],NaN

The major chemical constituent of anise EO was identified as trans-anethole (88.9%) ( Table 1) by comparison of mass spectral data, retention times (RT), and retention index (RI). The main constituents of cinnamon and clove EOs were cinnamaldehyde (73.3%) and eugenol (61.3%), respectively; for cumin, the main constituent was cuminaldehyde (41.3%), while for the laurel, it was eucalyptol (70.7%). Lemon EO presented limonene (92.3%) as a major compound, and oregano EO presented thymol (58.3%). A total of 49 compounds were identified, with the EOs of cinnamon and cumin having the largest number of constituents. For the anise EO, only five compounds were found; however, these five components compromised 97% of the essential oil. 3.2. Antibacterial Activity Seven EOs and eight pure compounds were evaluated against three Gram-positive bacteria and three Gram-negative bacteria. The results show that oregano EO has higher antibacterial activity for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, among which  Escherichia coli and  Salmonella Typhimurium are the most susceptible bacteria with an MIC value of 66 µg/mL. Thymol, the major compound of oregano EO, was the compound with the highest antibacterial activity, exerting its highest activity against  Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC of 23 µg/mL. Carvacrol, an isomer of thymol, showed less antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of EOs and their major constituents are presented in  Table 2. In general, the EO with less antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria was the EO of clove, while the EO of cumin was the one that presented the lowest activity against Gram-negative bacteria (600 µg/mL). Anethole was the pure compound with less antibacterial activity. 3.3. Antifungal Activity Antifungal activity was evaluated against four filamentous fungi, which proved to be susceptible to EO of cinnamon and its main compound, cinnamaldehyde. At 66 µg/mL, cinnamon EO was able to inhibit the growth of  Aspergillus niger and  Alternaria alternata; cinnamaldehyde inhibited these microorganisms at 75 and 41 µg/mL, respectively. At 58 µg/mL concentration, cinnamaldehyde also inhibited  Aspergillus ochraceus and  Fusarium oxysporum ( Table 3). EOs of laurel and lemon and their major constituents presented the lower antifungal activities. 3.4. Antiparasitic Activity The most relevant antiparasitic activity against  Trypanosoma cruzi and  Leishmania mexicana was presented by cinnamon EO and cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamon EO presented an IC 50 of 23 µg/mL against  T. cruzi and 21 µg/mL against  L. mexicana, while cinnamaldehyde showed activity at 10.4 and 8.6 µg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, oregano EO showed the highest activity against  Giardia lamblia with an LD 50 of 60 µg/mL, while thymol and carvacrol showed activity against this microorganism at 21.4 and 31.9 µg/mL, respectively ( Table 4). EO of laurel and eucalyptol, its main compound, did not present relevant biological activity. 3.5. Analysis of Overall Biological Activity To evaluate the overall effect of EOs and major components on the different organisms studied, they were grouped according to the characteristic of their external cell structures. The organisms were classified as Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, filamentous fungi, and protozoans. The differences in the membrane and cell wall structure of bacteria are well characterized, with Gram-negative bacteria displaying an external cell membrane compared with Gram-positive bacteria. This difference has been related to their susceptibility to plant-derived antimicrobials [ 23]. The lime EO was not included for the statistical analysis, since it was tested only against the protozoan group. The analysis of the effect of the EOs on the microbial groups demonstrated a significant difference among them, where the lowest concentration of the EO for CMI/LC 50/LD 50 activity was considered with the most antimicrobial activity. The differences are as follows: Oregano > Cinnamon, Clove, Anise > Laurel, Cumin.  The differences among the microbial groups are shown in  Figure 1, where it is observed that the EOs are most effective against protozoans, followed by fungi and Gram-positive bacteria, while they are less effective against Gram-negative bacteria. As observed in  Table 2,  Table 3 and  Table 4, the effect of each EO is different against the microorganisms studied, and this was also observed in the statistical analysis, with a highly significant statistical difference for the cross-interaction of EOs and microbial groups (data not shown). Regarding the major components, the statistical analysis showed that there was a difference between the microbial groups and the compounds tested (data not shown). According to the proposed mechanisms of action of the main chemical components in EOs, the chemical structure and physicochemical properties are the predominant factors on their antimicrobial capacity. Therefore, the chemical structure of the major components was identified as terpene (one compound included), phenylpropanoids, or terpenoids ( Figure 2). Then, the chemical structure was used as a variable for the ANOVA analysis, and the results showed that the terpenoid and phenylpropane structures were more effective as antimicrobial compounds than the terpene. Regarding the microbial groups, they were separated based on their susceptibility to the compounds studied, as follows: Protozoan > Gram positive, Gram negative > Fungi. Therefore, the most resistant microbial group to the chemical compounds studied was molds. In contrast with the EOs, fungi were more resistant to the pure components. It has been proposed that the mixture of components in the EOs can show synergistic effects, with differential activity as the pure compounds alone [ 24]. The differential effect of the compounds grouped according to their chemical structure against the microbial groups studied is presented in  Figure 3, where it is observed that the phenylpropanoids are more effective against fungi and protozoans, and the terpenoids are more effective against bacteria and protozoans. 3.6. Principal Component Analysis of the Biological Activity To identify relationships between the biological activity of the EOs and their major components with the different groups of microorganisms included in this study, data were also analyzed by principal component analysis, as shown in  Figure 4 and  Figure 5. The relationship of the biological activity of the different microorganisms, identified by their microbial group, with the first three components identified by PCA, is shown in  Figure 4. The three first components accounted for 94.3% of data variation; PC1 explained 60.8% of the variation, while PC2 considered 28.7% and PC3 4.7% of the data variation. PC1 component has negative scores related to protozoans (−0.96 to −1.91 coefficient values), as well as for fungi (−0.59 to −2.18), while scores were positive for bacteria, with a higher positive load for Gram-negative bacteria (1.6 to 2.9). Regarding PC2, protozoans had a high positive and homogeneous load for this component (1.55 to 2.00), while fungi showed a negative load (−1.0 to −2.1) and bacteria has a wider score distribution (−0.8 to 1.6). Finally, PC3 had a positive load for protozoans (0.04 to 0.40). The analysis demonstrated that data were tightly grouped for anti-protozoan activity, while fungi were also grouped all together, and Gram-negative bacteria were also closely grouped. In order to compare the effect of the major components present in the EOs studied regarding their biological activity, a PCA analysis using the chemical structure of the major components as an independent variable was also carried out.  Figure 5 shows the scores for the first three components, considering the chemical structure of the compounds tested. The first three components accounted for 91.9% of data variability. PC1 explained 58.1% of variations, while PC2 explained 25.6% and PC3 8.2% of the total variation. Regarding the scores for the compounds, the terpene was separated from the other two groups, with a high positive load for PC1 (4.4 to 5.1 coefficient values) and negative loads for PC2 (−1.0 to −1.3) and PC3 (−1.4 to −1.7). Terpenoids had a wide distribution of scores for PC1 (−2.3 to 4.6) and PC2 (−3.0 to 1.4) and a positive load for PC3 (0.03 to 1.9). Finally, phenylpropanoids had a negative load in PC1 (−0.44 to −2.44) and a positive load in PC2 (0.14 to 3.6). PCA analysis was able to group the biological activity of the major components based on their chemical structure.","The biological activity of essential oils and their major components is well documented. Essential oils such as oregano and cinnamon are known for their effect against bacteria, fungi, and even viruses. The mechanism of action is proposed to be related to membrane and external cell structures, including cell walls. This study aimed to evaluate the biological activity of seven essential oils and eight of their major components against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, filamentous fungi, and protozoans. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by determination of the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration for  Bacillus cereus ,  Staphylococcus aureus ,  Listeria monocytogenes ,  Escherichia coli ,  Salmonella  Typhimurium,  Shigella sonnei ,  Aspergillus niger ,  Aspergillus ochraceus ,  Alternaria alternata,  and  Fusarium oxysporium , the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) for  Trypanosoma cruzi  and  Leishmania mexicana , and the median lethal dose (LD 50 ) for  Giardia lamblia . Results showed that oregano essential oil showed the best antibacterial activity (66-100 µg/mL), while cinnamon essential oil had the best fungicidal activity (66-116 µg/mL), and both showed excellent antiprotozoal activity (22-108 µg/mL). Regarding the major components, thymol and carvacrol were also good antimicrobials (23-200 µg/mL), and cinnamaldehyde was an antifungal compound (41-75 µg/mL). The major components were grouped according to their chemical structure as phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, and terpinenes. The statistical analysis of the grouped data demonstrated that protozoans were more susceptible to the essential oils, followed by fungi, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The analysis for the major components showed that the most resistant microbial group was fungi, which was followed by bacteria, and protozoans were also more susceptible. Principal Component Analysis for the essential oils demonstrated the relationship between the biological activity and the microbial group tested, with the first three components explaining 94.3% of the data variability. The chemical structure of the major components was also related to the biological activity presented against the microbial groups tested, where the three first principal components accounted for 91.9% of the variability. The external structures and the characteristics of the cell membranes in the different microbial groups are determinant for their susceptibility to essential oils and their major components.","['Cell membranes', 'Essential oils', 'Antimicrobial', 'Terpenoids', 'Mechanism of action', 'Phenylpropanoids']","['Activity', 'Gram-negative bacteria', 'biological activity', 'Antibacterial Activity', 'bacteria', 'Gram-positive bacteria', 'components', 'major components', 'EOs', 'Gram-negative']","[Oils, filamentous fungi, µg/mL, LD, CMI/LC 50/LD, Cumin, Gram, Gram, PC2, −1.91, −0.59, PC2, −2.1, −0.8, anti-protozoan, PC2, PC2, −1.3, −1.4, −1.7, PC2, −3.0, PC2]",[],[],[],NaN
154,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC8255067\eupmc_result.json,PMC8255067,"Results Mechanical damage (MD) increased the production of terpenes Higher contents of terpenes in MD-treated plants relative to the CK group were evidenced except for one monoterpene and one sesquiterpene. Specifically, from  BCC leaves we detected a total of 21 terpenes induced by MD treatment, including 14 monoterpenes (accounting for 88%, of which 63% was D-borneol) and 7 sesquiterpenes (accounting for 11%), using GC/MS ( Fig. 1A,  1B,  Table S2). Seventeen terpenes (11 monoterpenes, 6 sesquiterpenes) had the highest content 6 h after the MD treatment, and for 2 monoterpenes their content peaked after 2 h and then declined by 6 h post-MD. Furthermore, the carene, pseudolimonene, camphene, sabinene, eucalyptol, D-borneol, terpineol, elemene, and germacrene B contents were all prominently enhanced in the MD_6h samples compared with the CK group, while their levels in the MD_2h samples also tended to surpass those of CK, albeit not significantly ( Fig. 1C). Transcriptome sequencing and annotation, expression analysis of unigenes Based on the ability of MD to increase D-borneol and other monoterpenes’ production, deep transcriptome sequencing of the induced  BCC collected at different hours was performed, as well as the CK group. In total, 67.66 Gb of high-quality base pair data (at least 7.51G per sample and 22.55 G for each group), with a GC content of 48.62%, were obtained ( Table 1). Our PCA analysis of the resulting transcription data revealed a clear separation of the MD_6 h group from both MD_2 h and CK groups, suggesting a high repeatability of the sequencing data ( Fig. 2A). A total of 86,452 unigenes were assembled  de novo, these having a mean length of 837 bp and an N 50 of 1,300 bp ( Table 2). Most of the unigenes (65,483; 75.74%) were shorter than 1,000 bp, while only a few genes (7,308; 8.4%) were longer than 2,000 bp ( Fig. 2B). We then evaluated the quality of the assembled sequences by examining the mapped ratio of the clean data to the assembled unigenes of each sample using RSEM. The result showed that 81.05% of the clean reads could be perfectly mapped to the reference unigenes, indicating the throughputs and sequencing quality were sufficient to ensure the reliability of further analyses ( Table 1). Moreover, the ‘TransRate’ assembly score, which aims to assess the accuracy and completeness of transcriptome assembly, reached 31.45% for  C. campora, a value higher than that of many of other assemblies ( Smith-Unna et al., 2016). We also assessed the assembly completeness using BUSCO, this lent further support to the high quality of the assemblies, in which 80.70% of single-copy orthologs were successfully captured ( Table 2). All RNA-Seq raw data was submitted to CNGBdb (accession number  CNP0000956) and NCBI (accession number  PRJNA679978). And the the de novo transcript assemblies was submitted to CNGBdb (accession number  CNA0020891,  https://db.cngb.org/search/project/CNP0000956/). Using the BLAST algorithm, sequence annotations were performed against the NR, Swiss-Prot, Pfam, COG, GO, and KEGG databases. From this, 27,727 unigenes (32.07%) were annotated by the KEGG database, 25,714 unigenes (29.74%) were identified in the GO database, 13,356 unigenes (15.45%) were annotated against the COG database, and 34,072 unigenes (39.41%) had significant matches to the NR database. In addition, 41,035 (47.47%) and 41,466 (47.96%) of the unigenes displayed significant similarities to known proteins in the Pfam and Swiss-Prot database, respectively ( Fig. 2C). When summed, we found 15,578, 22,906, and 26,732 of the unigenes expressed in the CK, MD_2h, and MD_6h groups, respectively ( Fig. 2D). Among those, 1,582 unigenes were expressed only in the CK group, 5,441 specifically in the MD_2h group, and 9,472 unigenes uniquely so in the MD_6h group ( Fig. 2E), indicating that the MD treatment was able to significantly induce the expression of genes in  BCC. These results provided a general overview of the assembled transcriptome that we then used in our further analysis of DEGs. Comparing the DEGs induced by MD treatment to the enrichment analysis To fully explore potential DEGs induced by the MD treatment, we compared three groups of  C. camphora plants. The DEGs were designated according to an expression level of —log 2 (fold-change) —>1 and FDR <0.05 in each pairwise comparison. This revealed 12,180 (9,643 upregulated, 2,537 downregulated) and 13,466 (9,222 upregulated, 4,244 downregulated) unigenes that were significantly differentially expressed relative to the control samples in the MD-treated samples at 2 h and 6 h post-treatment, respectively. Between MD_2h and MD_6h, we identified 10,477 unigenes significantly expressed (4,570 upregulated, 5,907 downregulated) ( Figs. S1A– S1C). Among the three pairwise comparisons, 2,539 genes were commonly regulated. Finally, a total of 19,149 DEGs were screened among the three comparison groups ( Fig. S1D). To exhaustively explore the presumed functions of the above DEGs, we then performed KEGG and GO enrichment analyses to uncover overrepresented pathways and biological functions in the BCC leaves as induced by their mechanical damaging. Based on the GO analysis, within the main molecular function (MF), cellular component (CC), and biological process (BP) categories the most enriched GO terms of the upregulated DEGs in the CK vs. MD_2 h comparison were protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity, recognition of pollen, and intrinsic component of membrane ( Table S3); in the CK vs. MD_6 h comparison, the over-presented GO terms contained genes were related to transcription, the DNA-templated extracellular region, and heme binding activity ( Table S4). For the MD_2 h vs. MD_6 h comparison, the largest percentages of unigenes identified within the CC, BP, and MF categories were extracellular region, reactive oxygen species metabolic process, and monooxygenase activity ( Table S5). Additionally, KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that the upregulated DEGs from the CK vs. MD_2h comparison could be assigned to 128 pathways, while the top 3 enriched pathways were “plant-pathogen interaction”, “plant hormone signal transduction”, and “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” ( Fig. S1E,  Table S6). In comparing the CK with the MD_6 h group, the most overrepresented pathways for the upregulated DEGs were “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”, “alpha-linolenic acid metabolism”, “plant-pathogen interaction”, “phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis”, and “selenocompound metabolism” ( Fig. S1F,  Table S7). Regarding the MD_2h vs. MD_6h comparison, the KEGG pathways of “ribosome”, “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”, “plant-pathogen interaction”, “MAPK signaling pathway-plant”, and “flavonoid biosynthesis” were the five most enriched ( Fig. 3S1G,  Table S8). Identifying the DEGs related to terpene biosynthesis induced by MD To further assess the effect of MD induction on volatile terpene biosynthesis, we next focused on the expression pattern of genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes. A total of 20 genes participating in the terpene backbone synthesis pathway had their activities significantly altered by MD. These 20 DEGs consisted of 3 homologues of HMGR, 3 homologues of HMGS, 5 homologues of DXS, 2 homologues of IDI, 1 homologues of GPPS, 2 homologues of FPPSs, and 4 homologues of GGPPSs. The expression of each DEGs was substantially increased in MD_2h or MD_6h when compared with the CK group, except for one putative DXS (CcDXS1) and one GGPPS (CcGGPPS2) ( Fig. 3,  Table S9). We spotted 13 TPS-encoding unigenes ( Table 3). According to our phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences in combination with well-characterized terpene synthase genes, the 13  BCC TPSs could be divided into five subfamilies ( Fig. 4A). The  CcTPS1 (TRINITY_DN14566_c0_g1),  CcTPS2 (TRINITY_DN50688_c1_g1),  CcTPS3 (TRINITY_DN43620_c0_g4), and  CcTPS5 (TRINITY_DN39759_c0_g1) all belong to the TPS-b subfamily, which are responsible for the synthesis of cyclic monoterpenes and contain the RR (X) 8W motif in their N-terminal region. Both  CcTPS4 (TRINITY_DN45508_c0_g2) and  CcTPS6 (TRINITY_DN49732_c0_g3) could be assigned to the TPS-g subfamily, which produces acyclic monterpenes and lacks the RRX8W motif in their N-terminal region. Another three,  CcTPS7 (TRINITY_DN34440_c0_g1),  CcTPS8 (TRINITY_DN40799_c0_g1), and  CcTPS9 (TRINITY_DN46911_c0_g1), are members of the TPS-a subfamily clade, which may encode a sesquiterpene synthase. Next,  CcTPS10 (TRINITY_DN47476_c0_g1),  CcTPS11 (TRINITY_DN47476_c0_g2), and  CcTPS13 (TRINITY_DN51000_c1_g1) belong to the TPS-e/f subfamily, while only  CcTPS12 (TRINITY_DN49635_c3_g3) belongs to the TPS-c subfamily that is responsible for the synthesis of diterpenes. Using the MEME program, the conserved motif analysis revealed that those TPS members clustering in the same subfamily showed similar motif characteristics ( Figs. 4B– 4C). Of these 14 TPSs, 10 were defined as differentially expressed TPS genes, whose expression pattern were shown  Fig. 3. We used these 10 putative TPSs, comprising 5 putative monoterpenoid synthase, 1 sesquiterpenoid synthase, and 4 diterpenoid synthase genes, in the further analyses. The FPKM values of the 10 candidate TPS genes and the content of terpenes were integrated and a correlation analysis was performed to clarify the relationship between them. According to the ensuing correlation networks ( Fig. 4D,  Table S10),  CcTPS1 was positively associated with six monoterpenes (carene, pseudolimonene, camphene, sabinene, L-limonene, D-limonene) as was  CcTPS3 and  CcTPS4 with four monoterpenes (borneol, bornyl acetate, camphor, terpineol). Presumably, CcTPS1 might directly influence the biosynthesis of carene, pseudolimonene, camphene, sabinene, L-limonene, and D-limonene in  BCC leaf tissue, while CcTPS3 may partake in the biosynthesis of borneol, camphor, and terpineol, with CcTPS4 perhaps participating in the biosynthesis of borneol, terpineol, and bornyl acetate. Identifying candidate transcription factor in response to MD Since transcriptional reprogramming is primarily controlled by TFs, we further identified the differentially expressed TFs among the three treatment comparison groups. In this study, 673 differential expressed putative TFs belonging to 30 families were identified in  BCC among the three group comparisons. There are about 58 TF families in higher plants, for which the major TF families, such as AP2/ERF, bHLH, MYB, WRKY, and bZIP, are linked with responses to biotic and abiotic stresses ( Karanja et al., 2019;  Lin et al., 2013;  Liu & Liu, 2020;  Pandey et al., 2017;  Zhao et al., 2011). In line with other published findings, we found many TFs of the MYB family (127 genes), along with those of the AP2/ERF family (81 genes), BHLH family (55 genes), WRKY family (37 genes), and bZIP family (35 genes) ( Table S13). The expression patterns of these five TF families were depicted in  Figs. 5A– 5E and conveyed in  Table S14, which indicated that most of the unigenes in these five TF families (82/127 for MYB, 70/81 for AP2/ERF, 38/55 for BHLH, 31/37 for WRKY, and 29/37 for bZIP) were upregulated in the MD-treated samples at either 2 h or 6 h vis-à-vis the control samples. These screened TFs offered a pool of candidates that can be harnessed to potentially enhance plant resistance to MD. Mining of candidate transcription factors related to monoterpenoid biosynthesis Recently, the MYB-, bHLH-, ERF-, WRKY-, and bZIP-type TFs were shown capable of regulating the expression of plant monoterpene synthase genes ( Sarker, Adal & Mahmoud, 2019). To select candidate TFs able to regulate the expression of monoterpene synthase in  BCC, the abovementioned 335 DEGs belonging to these five TF families were submitted to a gene co-expression network analysis with the three selected candidate monoterpene synthase genes ( CcTPS1, CcTPS3, CcTPS4). The results showed that three homologues of the BHLH family, six homologues of the bZIP family, five homologues of the WRKY family, 12 homologues of the ERF family, and 16 homologues of the MYB family all had strong, positive correlation coefficient values (R 2-values > 0.8) with  CcTPS1 and  CcTPS4. In stark contrast, no TFs were found positively related to  CcPTS3. Based on these results, interaction networks between the two monoterpene synthase and 42 transcription factors were organized ( Fig. 6A,  Table S15). Building on this, we carried out a more in-depth analysis of the sequences of these candidate TFs. First, by using the ORF finder, 37 of the TFs corresponding to 5 WRKY genes, 15 MYB genes, 10 ERF/AP2 genes, 5 bZIP genes, and 2 BHLH genes were discovered to contain a complete ORF. Next, the deduced amino acid sequences of each of these 37 TFs were submitted to the PfamScan, to determine whether a given sequence contained the conserved domains of the corresponding gene family. As a result, the 5 WRKY all contained complete WRKY domains (PF03106.15) and likewise, the 15 MYB genes all harbored a MYB DNA-binding domain with a Pfam ID of PF00249.31. The 10 ERF/AP2 genes, five bZIP genes, and two BHLH genes were confirmed to belong to their corresponding gene families since their respective AP2 (PF00847.20), bZIP_1 (PF00170.21), and HLH (PF00010.26) domains were identified. Taken together, these 37 TFs may play important roles in regulating monoterpene synthase expression to affect monoterpene biosynthesis in  BCC. Therefore, this promising pool of candidate TFs is the focus of our future research. qRT-PCR validation of DEGs from the RNA-Seq analysis To validate the reliability of the RNA-Seq data, we chose 15 genes (nine monoterpene biosynthesis related genes, six transcription factors) to conduct the qRT-PCR analysis. These results basically agreed with the above transcriptome results; hence, our original analysis of the  C. camphora transcriptome is robust ( Fig. 6B)."," Background The borneol chemotype of  Cinnamomum camphora  ( BCC ), a monoterpene-rich woody plant species, is the sole source prescribed by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia for the production of natural D-borneol, a major monoterpene in  BCC  used for millennia as a topical analgesic in China. Nevertheless, the possible gene-regulatory roles of transcription factors (TFs) in  BCC 's monoterpenoid biosynthesis remained unknown. Here, a joint analysis of the transcriptome and terpenoid metabolome of  BCC  induced by mechanical damage (MD) was used to comprehensively explore the interaction between TFs and terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes that might participate in monoterpene biosynthesis in  BCC . Results Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis detected 14 monoterpenes and seven sesquiterpenes. All but two monoterpenes underwent a significantly increased accumulation after the MD treatment. RNA sequencing data revealed that 10 TPS, 82 MYB, 70 AP2/ERF, 38 BHLH, 31 WRKY, and 29 bZIP unigenes responded to the MD treatment. A correlation analysis revealed that three monoterpene synthase genes (CcTPS1, CcTPS3, CcTPS4) highly correlated with multiple monoterpenes, namely D-borneol, camphor, and bornyl acetate, which could be responsible for monoterpenoid biosynthesis in  BCC . Furthermore, five WRKY, 15 MYB, 10 ERF/AP2, five bZIP, and two BHLH genes had strong, positive correlations with  CcTPS1  or  CcTPS4 , judging by their high coefficient values (R 2  > 0.8). The bioinformatics results were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. Conclusion This study provides insight into the genes involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of monoterpene in  BCC  and thus provides a pool of candidate genes for future mechanistic analyses of how monoterpenes accumulate in  BCC .","['Metabolism', 'Transcription factor', 'Transcriptome', 'Monoterpene Biosynthesis', 'Borneol Chemotype Of Cinnamomum Camphora']","['Fig.', 'genes', 'Table', 'TRINITY', 'unigenes', 'DEGs', 'biosynthesis', 'BCC', 'group', 'analysis']","[CK, D-borneol, D-borneol, MD_6h, CK, MD_2h, CK, D-borneol, CK, MD_6, CK, 86,452, 65,483, BUSCO, single-copy, CNGBdb (accession, CNGBdb (accession, Swiss-Prot, 34,072 unigenes, 41,035 (, Swiss-Prot, 22,906, 26,732, CK, MD_2h, MD_6h, CK, MD_2h, MD_6h, —log 2, MD_2h, MD_6h, 2,539, CK, protein serine/threonine, CK, MD_6, MD_6, MF, S5, CK, MD_2h, “, ”, “plant hormone, ”, ”, CK, MD_6, ”, “alpha-linolenic acid, ”, “, ”, “phenylalanine, ”, ”, S1F, MD_2h, MD_6h, “ribosome”, ”, “, ”, “MAPK, pathway-plant”, “flavonoid, ”, HMGR,, HMGS, GPPS, FPPSs, GGPPSs, MD_2h, MD_6h, CK, GGPPS, CcGGPPS2, TRINITY_DN14566_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN50688_c1_g1, TRINITY_DN43620_c0_g4, TRINITY_DN39759_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN45508_c0_g2, TRINITY_DN34440_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN40799_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN46911_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN47476_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN47476_c0_g2, TRINITY_DN51000_c1_g1, TRINITY_DN49635_c3_g3, TPSs, CcTPS1, CcTPS3, CcTPS4, AP2/ERF, MYB, WRKY, bZIP, Liu, MYB, AP2/ERF, BHLH, WRKY, bZIP, S14, MYB, AP2/ERF, WRKY, bZIP, vis-à-vis, MYB-, bHLH-, ERF-, WRKY-, bZIP-type TFs, Adal, CcTPS1, CcTPS3, CcTPS4, BHLH, bZIP, WRKY, MYB, S15, WRKY, MYB, ERF/AP2, bZIP, PfamScan, WRKY, WRKY, PF03106.15, MYB, MYB, ERF/AP2, bZIP, BHLH, AP2, PF00847.20, bZIP_1, PF00170.21]","['TPS-encoding', 'TPSs', 'CcTPS1', 'CcTPS2', 'CcTPS3', 'CcTPS5', 'TPS-b', 'CcTPS4', 'CcTPS6', 'TPS-g', 'CcTPS7', 'CcTPS8', 'CcTPS9', 'TPS-a', 'CcTPS10', 'CcTPS11', 'CcTPS13', 'TPS-e/f', 'CcTPS12', 'TPS-c', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'CcTPS1', 'CcTPS3', 'CcTPS4', 'CcTPS1', 'CcTPS3', 'CcTPS4', 'CcTPS1,', 'CcTPS3,', 'CcTPS4).', 'CcTPS1', 'CcTPS4.']","['C.\xa0campora,', 'BCC.', 'C.\xa0camphora', 'BCC.', 'C.\xa0camphora']",[],terpene synthase
155,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC8301071\eupmc_result.json,PMC8301071,"Results Endophyte Isolation In total, 63 endophyte strains were isolated from  Ginkgo root tissues, as listed in  Supplementary Table 1. Then, after the suspected same species were selectively abandoned according to the colonies’ morphology ( Supplementary Figure 1) and the blast results of the 16s rDNA and ITS sequences ( Supplementary File 1), 23 bacterial strains and 2 fungal strains were chosen to be used for the subsequent genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The phylum Actinobacteria included seven strains of four genera, while Firmicutes included nine strains of four genera; both occupied the most of all classified isolates in terms of quantity ( Table 1). Of note, the Phylum Proteobacteria screened five genera, which may contain the most considerable phylogenetic diversity. Sequencing, Assembly, and Annotation As the detailed information listed in  Table 1, a total of 207,584,048 clean reads (BGISEQ-500, 2 × PE150) was obtained to include 31,137,607,200 clean bases for bacteria isolates. Their average Q20 was 94.59%, ranging from 91.20 to 97.55%, indicating the high accuracy guarantee for assembly. As to the two fungi, 848,064 and 1,791,961 sequence entries were collected with a total bases of 9,678,732,196 and 4,017,770,803 bp. As expected, the average sequence lengths were above 1K bases (11,412 and 2,242 bp, respectively). Influenced by splicing and assembly parameters, and the species characteristics, 23 bacterial draft genomes were built with various scaffolds (from 370 to 2854). The N50 sizes varied from 58,194 to 2,312,843 bp. Meanwhile, the draft genomes sizes were from 2,604,457 to 12,471,597 bp. Comparing with the GeneBank genome database, all these draft genomes had similar genome sizes to their neighborhood species. All the sequencing depths we calculated were far more than 50×, which was enough for assembling high-quality genomes in most software ( Desai et al., 2013). Undoubtedly, the overall G + C content of draft genomes varied with the phylogenetic relationship. The Phylum Actinobacteria species had higher G + C content than others, up to 75.09%, while the Firmicutes species own comparatively lower G + C content. Besides, the Proteobacteria species also possessed high G + C content.  Deinococcus sp. Gbtc 1 (ID: B9, 68.85% G + C) seemed to verify the fact that the genus  Deinococcus may have high G + C content ( McDonald, 2001) as reported. Moreover, it is reasonable to confirm that most genes are included in the current draft genomes because the completeness estimates were all above 98.7%, while the contamination was all less than 0.16%. Considering that fungi generally have a larger genome than bacteria, the introduction of the Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) Sequencing technology is necessary to improve the assembly results, especially for eukaryotes. Here, coupled with the pair-ended PE150 reads, the Pacbio output was assembled into two high-quality draft genomes of the  Aspergillus (16 and 18 contigs).  Aspergillus sp. Gbtc 1 (ID: F1) possessed a 29,114,197 bp genome with a N50 of 3,752,118 bp, while  Aspergillus sp. Gbtc 2 (ID: F2) had a genome of 37,929,866 bp with a 4,075,796 bp N50. Both had a G + C content of less than 50%, similar to these existed strains in the GeneBank database. On the other side, the BUSCO completeness was 74.9 and 74.5%, which was as large as three strains of the closest phylogeny ( Supplementary Figure 2), showing the assemblies’ acceptability. Phylogenetic Analysis Generally, the thread of 97% 16s rRNA similarity was proposed as a golden criterion in bacterial classification for many years ( Stackebrandt and Goebel, 1994). However, the dataset is becoming broader and broader, reducing the discrimination of 16s rRNA with high conservation significantly. Whereafter, a series of other genes were chosen as the variable markers in succession, such as gyrB ( Yamamoto and Harayama, 1995), recA/B ( Pascual et al., 2010), and  rpoD ( Parkinson et al., 2011). Nevertheless, different organisms are not consistent in the heterogeneity of these housekeeping genes ( Yamamoto and Harayama, 1998;  Wang et al., 2007). In this research, CVTree3 used the whole genomes of all isolates and the items from the open-access database to infer a more accurate phylogenetic tree. Unlike a single marker gene, namely 16s rRNA etc., simultaneous analyzing all bacterial and fungal genomes exhibits another advantage that all results can be presented in a phylogenetic tree ( Figure 2). Due to 16s rRNA and ITS pre-classification, almost all strains were assigned into diverse clades properly, for instance, in fungi,  Aspergillus sp. Gbtc_1 was likely to be phylogenetically affiliated to the species  Aspergillus fumigatus, while  Aspergillus sp. Gbtc_2 might be a member of the species  Aspergillus flavus or  Aspergillus parasiticus alternatively. Additionally, a similar situation was observed in the bacterial Kingdom: 13 strains were severally affiliated to multiple species seemingly, including  Cellulomonas hominis,  Streptomyces hyaluromycini,  Chitinophaga rupis,  Bacillus cereus,  Bacillus megaterium,  Bacillus paralicheniformis,  Bacillus velezensis,  Lysinibacillus fusiformis,  Paenibacillus chitinolyticus,  Achromobacter mucicolens,  Burkholderia pyrrocinia, and  Stenotrophomonas rhizophila. In fact, species identification and classification are not absolutely unique, but only reflect relative phylogenetic relationships, as we all know. Functional Annotation and Classification These indicators aforementioned suggested that the 25 draft genomes we assembled here were suitable for further bioinformatics analysis. The two fungi own significantly more CDSs, rRNAs, and tRNAs than most bacteria ( Supplementary Table 2). Two  Streptomyces ( B6 and  B7) strains expressed much larger genomes with ≥ 10,000 CDSs than other bacteria. The genus  Burkholderia also appeared to be a large genome (∼8 Mb with 7126 CDSs) owner in the Bacteria Kingdom. Of all the databases used in this study, the Nr database had the highest percentage of similar entries. It is noteworthy that high gene annotation ratios were obtained in function prediction, which were all above 97%. However, as the host, the  Ginkgo genome’s annotation rate is only 68.12% ( Guan et al., 2016), revealing unknown species-specific genes in the  Ginkgo genome. Here, we performed the COG classification to survey the functional profile. The annotation rate varied from 76.82 to 91.13%, and all annotated genes were separated into 26 groups ( Figure 3). Overall, irrespective of the category “Function unknown (S),” relatively more genes belonged to “Transcription (K),” “Amino acid transport and metabolism (E)” and “Carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G)” for most bacteria. Signally,  Cohnella sp. Gbtc 1 possessed 16.8% annotated genes belonging to the category “Carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G),” seemingly revealing its more robust carbon metabolism. However, the situation of the fungi was significantly different. The RNA process (A) and the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolites (Q) was much more prosperous. For  Ginkgo, the categories “Signal transduction mechanisms (T)” and “Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones (O)” exhibited higher gene portion, as well as “Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism (Q).” Summarily, within this regional  Ginkgo roots (we can regard it as a host-parasite community), bacteria tended to pay more attention to primary metabolism. Simultaneously, fungi and the host  Ginkgo have stronger secondary metabolism, which may be closely related to the host’s environmental tolerance. Secondary Metabolism Generally, microorganisms may promote the secondary metabolism by participating directly or indirectly in their hosts ( Hassan and Mathesius, 2012;  Gluck-Thaler and Slot, 2015), even if some secondary metabolic processes only occur in the eukaryotic field. In detail, elicitors and metabolic precursors are the primary forms for plant endophytes. So, in  Ginkgo, not only its secondary metabolites contribute to its tolerance to the abiotic and biotic stresses, mainly containing flavonoids and terpenoid lactones ( Guan et al., 2016), but also there may be a series of endophytes playing critical roles in these processes through multiple synergistic effects. Therefore, a variety of secondary metabolic pathways in the  Ginkgo root community are analyzed in this study. Flavonoid Biosynthesis The whole pathway of flavonoid biosynthesis is relatively complete in the  Ginkgo genome ( Figure 4A). The first regulatory step of flavonoid biosynthesis was cinnamoyl-CoA’s transformation to pinocembrin chalcone by chalcone synthase (CHS), which can also catalyze  p-coumaroyl-CoA to naringenin chalcone, caffeoyl-CoA to eriodictyol chalcone, and feruloyl-CoA to homoeriodictyol chalcone. A total of 17 genes were putatively annotated as CHS genes, including one belonged to Sample  B6, two belonged to Sample  F2, and the rest belonged to the  Ginkgo host. However, no putative genes were identified to code chalcone isomerase (CHI) and flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) in all endophytes. Herein, CHI is responsible for converting various chalcones into flavonoid monomers (pinocembrin, liquiritigenin, butin, and naringenin), while F3H catalyzes these flavonoid monomers into dihydroflavonols. Notably, both  Ginkgo and the fungi  F1 potentially possess the ability to reduce dihydroflavonols to the precursors of anthocyanin synthesis (viz.  cis-3,4-leucopelargonidin, leucocyanidin, and leucodelphinidin), as 17 and 1 copy of dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) genes were identified in their genomes, respectively. After dehydrogenation and dehydration by anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), these precursors were catalyzed into the colorful anthocyanin class of flavonoids (cyanidin, delphinidin, pelargonidin). The functional annotation indicated that only  Ginkgo involved 8 ANS genes in the genome. Additionally, 5  Ginkgo genes and 1  F1 gene were defined as anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) encoders. More prominently, up to 54 genes (47 of  Ginkgo, 3 of F1, and 4 of F2) encode the flavonoid 3′-monooxygenase (F3M), indicating potential frequent collaborative transformation among various flavonoids like kaempferol and quercetin. So, the host  Ginkgo may play a major role in the synthesis of flavonoids in this root community, under the assist of several putative genes originated from bacteria ( B6 and  B8) and these two fungi. Non-flavonoid Polyphenolics Biosynthesis More and more polyphenolic compounds are being investigated for their potential application in the pharmaceutical industry. They are always constructed from cinnamic acids via a series of condensation reactions in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. As a major precursor, the cinnamic acid is derived from the phenylalanine and leading into flavonoids, monolignols, lignins, and lignans, while it also branch off into hydroxycinnamates ( Zou et al., 2019). Therefore, these polyphenolics’ biosynthesis is based on the shared substrates, e.g.,  p-coumaroyl-CoA and feruloyl-CoA, inevitably leading to the existence of competition. In addition to the flavonoid metabolism, other genes encoding crucial enzymes were observed in several bacterial and fungal strains, putatively participating in the biosynthesis of non-flavonoid phenolic substances in this  Ginkgo root community. In the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, the cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) hydroxylates the cinnamic acid or cinnamoyl-CoA into  p-coumaric acid or  p-coumaroyl-CoA, herein 13 and 1 copy of its encoder genes were located in  Ginkgo and  F1 genomes. Then, the synthesis of caffeic acid and caffeoyl-CoA is accomplished through the coordination of shikimate  O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT), coumaroylquinate 3′-monooxygenase (C3’H) and caffeoylshikimate esterase (CSE) from their precursor  p-coumaroyl-CoA. Three C3’H genes were observed in Sample  F2, potentially assisting the host to complete this critical process. Two kinds of methyltransferase, namely caffeic acid 3- O-methyltransferase (COMT) and caffeoyl-CoA  O-methyltransferase (CCOMT), were responsible for the transformation of caffeic acid (or caffeoyl-CoA, caffeic aldehyde, caffeyl alcohol) to ferulic acid (feruloyl-CoA, coniferyl aldehyde, coniferyl alcohol), as well as from 5-hydroxyferulic acid (or 5-hydroxyferuloyl-CoA, 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde, 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol) to sinapic acid (or sinapoyl-CoA, sinapoyl aldehyde, sinapyl alcohol) in the downstream of metabolism. In this course, 19 COMT (CCOMT) isoforms were identified in the bacteria and fungi. Meanwhile, 23 genes were predicted to code ferulate-5-hydroxylase (F5H), with one belonged to bacterial strain  B6. In the other direction, the downstream derivatization of these precursor acids is accomplished by 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), and cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) in turn, to produce  p-coumaryl alcohol, caffeyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol. These three enzymes were all putatively encoded in the  Ginkgo host, while only five 4CL genes from three bacteria strains were annotated, and the two fungi strains involved both 4CL and CAD isoforms. The current favored viewpoint endorses that  p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol are the direct precursors of the lignins ( p-hydroxyphenyl lignin, guaiacyl lignin, 5-hydroxy-guaiacyl lignin, and syringyl lignin). These monolignol oxidation occurs through peroxidase (PRD), peroxiredoxin (PRDX), or catalase-peroxidase (CPRD), thereof  Ginkgo genome containing all annotated PRD genes and two PRDX genes while several bacterial and fungal strains affording 9 CPRD genes and one PRDX gene. As for the lignans biosynthesis, a pivotal branchpoint enzyme named pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductase (PLR) were detected in  Ginkgo and Fungus  F1; nevertheless, the ones involved in the downstream derivation, like secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase (SIRD), pluviatolide synthase, pluviatolide 4- O-methyltransferase, bursehernin 5′-monooxygenase, 5′-demethylyatein 5′- O-methyltransferase, and deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase, have not been observed in all organisms. Terpenoid Backbone and Their Derivatives Biosynthesis Terpenoid is a class of the most abundant secondary metabolites in nature, wildly produced in the bacteria, fungi, and higher plants. More than 50 thousands of terpenoids have been discovered to be biologically active ingredients, comprising monoterpenes, sesquiterpene, diterpene, triterpene, and tetraterpenes ( Zhang et al., 2017a). As a good model for diterpene research in higher plants,  Ginkgo is well known for its wealthy diterpenoids of ginkgolides and bilobalide ( Maclennan et al., 2002), and markedly recommended as the therapeutic usage to antagonize platelet-activating factor (PAF). Therefore, it is meaningful to thoroughly excavate the genes related to terpene synthesis to study all species’ mutual evolution and synergy in this community. In general, all terpenoids are derived from two isomeric precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). IPP and DMAPP are synthesized in the mevalonic acid (MEV) pathway and the 2- C-methyl- D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway ( Lichtenthaler, 1999;  Lange et al., 2000). In the MEV pathway ( Figure 4B), three acetyl-CoA molecules are condensed and transformed into MEV and then subjected to multiple steps of phosphorylation and decarboxylation reactions to produce IPP. The MEP pathway is started with the combination of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate into 1-deoxy- D-xylulose 5-phosphate, and then further catalyzed to MEP. It is then formed into 2- C-methyl- D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MEC) through three successive reactions before MEC is further catalyzed to obtain a mixture of IPP and DMAPP of 5:1. Besides, IPP and DMAPP can be isomerized to each other with isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI). As basic C 5 units, alternative assembly of two, three, or four these units via prenyltransferases may yield geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), which serve as the immediate precursors for diverse monoterpenoids (C 10), sesquiterpenoids (C 15), diterpenoids (C 20), triterpenoids (C 30), and tetraterpenoids (C 40). In this study, a nearly integrated pathway of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis was observed in the root community. As well as the  Ginkgo host, almost all bacterial strains were capable of producing IPP and DMAPP through the MEP pathway via 1-deoxy- D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS), 1-deoxy- D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), 2- C-methyl- D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (MCT), 4-diphosphocytidyl-2- C-methyl- D-erythritol kinase (CDPMEK), 2- C-methyl- D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (ME), ( E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase (HDS) and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase (HDR). Although a widely accepted view indicates that the plant host may inherit genes in the MEP pathway from a prokaryote endosymbiont ( Vranova et al., 2013), more evidence needs to be investigated in this community. The MEP pathway may probably take place in the plastids of  Ginkgo. It is worth noting that  Aspergillus sp. Gbtc_2 ( F2) was discovered to hold a contiguous gene unit of CDPMEK and MECPS gene in its genome. On the other side, the MVA pathway reconstruction indicated that strains  B1,  F1,  F2 and  Ginkgo presumably facilitated the synthesis from acetyl-CoA to IPP cooperatively. Excluding errors in gene prediction and functional annotation, the  Ginkgo host may lose the capacity to produce mevalonate-5P due to a lack of mevalonate kinase (MVK); only  B1,  F1, and  F2 each possessed one copy of the MVK gene. Intriguingly,  B1 (putatively affiliated to gram-positive  Cellulomonas hominis) became the unique strain in all endophytes to retain both MEP and MVA pathways to produce IPP and DMAPP. Additionally, 99 copies of the acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (ACAT) gene were observed, most belonging to bacterial strains ( Supplementary File 2). The genes of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), phosphomevalonate kinase (PMVK), and diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase (MVD) were mainly discovered in  Ginkgo and fungal genomes. A series of GPPS, FPPS, and GGPPS genes were identified in the downstream pathway, encoding synthases to transform IPP and DMAPP into GPP, FPP, and GGPP. Only one GPPS gene from  Ginkgo was scanned out, while 47 and 10 CDSs were annotated to be GGPPS and FPPS genes, respectively. Remarkably, the KEGG results depicted that FPPS genes were classified into two groups (K00787 and K00795), and GGPPS genes were classified into three groups (K00804, K13787, K13789). These sequences were significantly different between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and K13789 contained the genes from  Ginkgo and endophytic bacteria, in which there may be close homology. However, the pathway regeneration exhibited an incomplete biosynthesis of monoterpenoid with only three enzyme genes [K15095 (+)-neomenthol dehydrogenase, K12467 myrcene/ocimene synthase, K07385 1,8-cineole synthase]. As to the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid, one and two CDSs were found closest to the (+)-alpha-barbatene/beta-chamigrene/thujopsene synthase and NAD+-dependent farnesol dehydrogenase genes, which are responsible for changing FPP to sesquiterpenoids, like (+)-alpha-barbatene, (+)-beta-chamigrene, and (+)-thujopsene. Moreover, farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase and squalene monooxygenase were discovered to retain genes in both  Ginkgo and the two fungi, to transfer the farnesyl of FPP to the triterpenoid precursors, squalene and (S)-squalene-2,3-epoxide. Meanwhile, one alarm was the presence of squalene-hopene/tetraprenyl-beta-curcumene cyclase genes in bacteria and fungi rather than  Ginkgo, which made us concerned with the derived bridge of the endophytes. Considering the predominance of ginkgolides in  Ginkgo, we interestedly discussed the diterpenoid biosynthesis here. Initiated by the protonation from GGPP under the copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), the copalyl diphosphate (CPP) was further catalyzed into levopimaradiene after allylic diphosphate ionization, cyclization, hydride shift, methyl migration, and deprotonation ( Schwarz and Arigoni, 1999). Nevertheless, there were no CPS or levopimaradiene synthase (LPS) genes found in all genomes. Reciprocally, acting as a critical kind of hormones throughout the plant life-cycle, gibberellins (GA) harbored a continuing pathway in the host, which is a matter of course. Thereof, the genes of ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase and ent-kaurene oxidase occupied the largest number of isoforms in  Ginkgo’s genome. Intriguingly, one ent-kaurenoic acid monooxygenase gene from  F1, one gibberellin 2beta-dioxygenase gene from B6, and three gibberellin-44 dioxygenase genes from  F2 were also involved in this community, potentially facilitating and regulating the biosynthesis of GAs. Carotenoids are 40-carbon tetraterpenoids condensed and derived from two GGPP molecules by diverse critical enzymes, including phytoene synthase (PSY), phytoene desaturase (PDS), zeta-carotene desaturase (ZDS), and others. Herein, we observed a two-approach process from phytoene to lycopene in this community: (1) cPDS/PDS - ZDS; (2) cPDS – C-ISO – ZDS – P-ISO. Subsequently, the lycopene is always converted into two branches in the downstream. One is that lycopene β-cyclase (LCY-B) transformed the parent molecule to γ-carotene and then to β-carotene in a two-step reaction, whereas the other is that lycopene ε-cyclase (LCY-E) catalyzed it into δ-carotene and ε-carotene, in which the δ-carotene is further catalyzed to α-carotene and lutein ( Hirschberg, 2001). However, from an overall perspective, gene annotation depicted a carotene transformation way pointing to the xanthophyll cycle in this community. Although LCY-B, beta-carotene 3-hydroxylase (CHY), and beta-ring hydroxylase (rHY) each were capable of acting on these two branches, and one carotenoid epsilon hydroxylase (CEH) gene was harbored in the  Ginkgo genome, the lack of LCY-E may lead to the failure in downstream biosynthesis of δ-carotene ε-cyclase, α- carotene and even lutein. Isoquinoline Alkaloid Backbone Biosynthesis As a group of nitrogen-containing natural products, alkaloids exist in approximately 20% of plant species, like Opium poppy and Madagascar periwinkle ( Facchini and De Luca, 2008). In another aspect, a remarkable number of endophytes were speculated to produce distinct classes of alkaloids to exert effects on pathogenic fungi, insects, and birds ( Schardl et al., 2004;  Fuchs et al., 2017). Not coinciding with other secondary metabolites, various alkaloid categories are unrelated in terms of synthesis and derivation. However, common patterns have become apparent in indole alkaloid or isoquinoline alkaloid (morphine, sanguinarine, etc.). As aromatic- L-amino-acid/ L-tryptophan decarboxylase (K01593) became the sole enzyme we identified in the indole alkaloid biosynthesis of this root community; detailed insight was excavated to the biosynthesis of isoquinoline alkaloid. Notoriously, isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis begins with the transformation from tyrosine to dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4HPAA) through decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and deamination ( Sato et al., 2007). The norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) condenses dopamine and 4HPAA to yield ( S)-norcoclaurine ( Facchini, 2001). Then, the norcoclaurine is converted to coclaurine by norcoclaurine 6- O-methyltransferase (NC6OMT), sequentially followed by a series of reactions to  N-methylcoclaurine, 3′-hydroxy- N-methyl coclaurine and reticuline by coclaurine  N-methyltransferase (CNMT),  N-methylcoclaurine 3′-monooxygenase (NM3H), and 3′-hydroxy  N-methylcoclaurine 4′- O-methyltransferase (3HMC4OMT). Available data suggested strict reaction specificities of NC6OMT, 3HMC4OMT, and CNMT ( Morishige et al., 2000), suggesting that the pathway is optional between the norcoclaurine branch and the norlaudanosoline branch before the central intermediate reticuline is ready for the next biosynthesis of isoquinoline alkaloid. In this study, we only observed the early part of the backbone biosynthesis ( Figure 4C). A lack of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate decarboxylase and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde synthase may lead to the deficiency of 4HPAA in this root tissue, although a few aspartate aminotransferases or the monofunctional tyrosine aminotransferase (K00815) were annotated to potentially catalyze  L-tyrosine to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. On the other branch, the process from tyrosine to dopamine is relatively integrated in this unit.  Ginkgo genome was constructive to harbor 6 CDSs of tryptophan decarboxylase (TRDC) and 13 CDSs of primary-amine oxidase (AO); these two proteins were also found in bacteria and fungi. The tyrosine 3-hydroxylase (T3H) in  B21 and  B23 were responsible for converting  L-tyrosine into  L-dopa, while the tyrosinase (TYR) in  B6,  B7,  B8,  B12, and  F2 catalyze both  L-tyrosine into  L-dopa and tyramine to dopamine. Additionally, as well as TRDC, the tyrosine decarboxylase (TYDC) was putatively included in the genomes of  B7,  B8,  F1, and  F2, to accomplish the transmission from  L-tyrosine to tyramine and  L-dopa to dopamine. Noteworthily, the manufacture of dopamine is likely dependent more on endophytes rather than the  Ginkgo host, especially the strains  B7 (named as  Streptomyces sp. Gbtc_2) and  F2 (named as  Aspergillus sp. Gbtc_2). So, it can be inferred that the synthesis of dopamine is achieved through the cooperation of endophytes and the  Ginkgo host to a certain extent, although it is impossible to put together all genomes to compose an entire metabolic pathway of isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis. Repetitive Sequences and Transposable Element The endophytes’ genomes were estimated to comprise various repetitive sequences ( Supplementary Table 3). Using the  de novo method, from 2.15 to 17.14% of the assembled genomes were masked as transposable elements and tandem repeats. Visibly, most bacterial strains seemed to comprise a larger proportion of repetitive sequences than the fungal ones. Numerically,  Aspergillus sp. Gbtc 2 ( F2) covered a lower repeating sequence ratio than  Aspergillus sp. Gbtc 1 ( F1), although it had a much larger genome, which may be derived from its colossal gene content. Apart from the common simple repeats, the retroelements and the DNA transposons accounted for the central part of repetitive sequences.  Streptomyces sp. Gbtc 1, Gbtc2 and  Mesorhizobium sp. Gbtc 1 ( B6,  B7, B19) harbored more DNA transposons (≥450 sequences) than other bacterial endophytes. Of the retroelements, the LTR elements revealed a majority against the SINEs and LINEs. Noteworthily,  Bacillus sp. Gbtc 2, Gbtc 3, Gbtc 5, and  Aspergillus sp. Gbtc 2 ( B11,  B12,  B14,  F2) embraced relatively more prosperous SINEs than others. Further on, of the LTR elements, the  Ty3/Gypsy superfamily was ubiquitous in all isolated individuals, while the  Ty1/Copia superfamily was only detected in  Aspergillus sp. Gbtc 1. To verify whether these two abundant superfamilies have undergone lateral gene transfer (LGT) between  Ginkgo and the endophytes, the conserved transcriptase domains were carried out further multiple alignment. The phylogenetic tree of the  Ty3/Gypsy superfamily ( Figure 5A) inferred eight potential clades, four (Clade 2, 4, 7, 8) of which were notably observed as  Ginkgo-specific clusters. Clade 1 and 2 displayed substantially higher diversity than other clades, possibly indicating the ancient origins of these subfamilies with diversification. Based on the  E-value of 1E-5, six sequences exhibited high homology to these included in the  Ginkgo host, though divided into different subfamilies. Two  Ty3/Gypsy-like sequences from  Microbacterium sp. Gbtc 2 and  Streptomyces sp. Gbtc 2 ( B3 and  B7) were clustered to Clade 1, during one of  Cohnella sp. Gbtc 1 ( B17) in Clade 3 and another of  Deinococcus sp. Gbtc 1 ( B9) in Clade 6. It is worth mentioning that  Microbacterium sp. Gbtc 1 (B2),  Aspergillus sp. Gbtc 2 (F2), and the  Ginkgo host shared almost one remarkably similar sequence snippet to form a separate superfamily (Clade 5), indicating a potentially common ancestor. In the phylogenetic tree of the  Ty1/Copia superfamily ( Figure 5B), LTR-RTs from several endophytes and the  Ginkgo host depicted a slightly different pattern that no clades were clustered to be easily distinguished. Three homologies of  Ty1/Copia were observed in  Microbacterium sp. Gbtc 1 (B2) within different branches, while two excerpts involved in  Bacillus sp. Gbtc 2 (B11) emanated relatively longer evolutionary distance. Additionally, two sequences from  Bacillus sp. Gbtc 1 (B10) and  Burkholderia sp. Gbtc 1 (B21) overlapped well to reveal their conservatism. Furthermore, gene exchange potential between endophytes and the  Ginkgo host through LTR-RTs was estimated in  Figure 5C. A total of 57 CDS (detail listed in  Supplementary File 3) predicted from endophytes’ LTR-RTs were homologous to  Ginkgo sequences. Generally speaking, the lower  E-value and the higher query coverage indicate a higher potential for gene cross-species communication. Here, 16 pieces with the desired  E-value (<1E-100) and >75% query coverage in the comparison coincided with the unique  Ginkgo CDS (Gb_09036); nevertheless, it was annotated as a hypothetical protein. So, in terms of these manifestations, the genetic communication was probably widespread between endophytes and the host  Ginkgo, and retrotransposons may be one form of the cross-species gene exchange."," Ginkgo biloba  is a pharmaceutical resource for terpenes and flavonoids. However, few insights discussed endophytes' role in  Ginkgo , and whether genetic exchange happens between  Ginkgo  and endophytes remains unclear. Herein, functional gene profiles and repetitive sequences were analyzed to focus on these issues. A total of 25 endophyte strains were isolated from the  Ginkgo  root and distributed in 16 genera of 6 phyla. Significant morphological diversities lead to the diversity in the COG functional classification. KEGG mapping revealed that endophytic bacteria and fungi potentially synthesize chalcone, while endophytic fungi might also promote flavonoid derivatization. Both bacteria and fungi may facilitate the lignin synthesis.  Aspergillus  sp. Gbtc_1 exhibited the feasibility of regulating alcohols to lignans. Although  Ginkgo  and the endophytes have not observed the critical levopimaradiene synthase in ginkgolides synthesis, the upstream pathways of terpenoid precursors are likely intact. The MVK genes in  Ginkgo  may have alternative non-homologous copies or be compensated by endophytes in long-term symbiosis.  Cellulomonas  sp. Gbtc_1 became the only bacteria to harbor both MEP and MVA pathways. Endophytes may perform the mutual transformation of IPP and DMAPP in the root.  Ginkgo  and bacteria may lead to the synthesis and derivatization of the carotenoid pathway. The isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis seemed lost in the  Ginkgo  root community, but L-dopa is more probably converted into dopamine as an essential signal-transduction substance. So, endophytes may participate in the secondary metabolism of the  Ginkgo  in a shared or complementary manner. Moreover, a few endophytic sequences predicted as  Ty3/Gypsy  and  Ty1/Copia  superfamilies exhibited extremely high similarity to those of  Ginkgo . CDSs in such endophytic LTR-RT sequences were also highly homologous to one  Ginkgo  CDS. Therefore, LTR-RTs may be a rare unit flowing between the  Ginkgo  host and endophytes to exchange genetic information. Collectively, this research effectively expanded the insight on the symbiotic relationship between the  Ginkgo  host and the endophytes in the root.","['Ginkgo biloba', 'Endophyte', 'secondary metabolism', 'Lateral Gene Transfer', 'Ltr-rt']","['Ginkgo', 'Ginkgo host', 'Ginkgo genome', 'genes', 'Gbtc', 'gene', 'biosynthesis', 'host Ginkgo', 'genomes', 'genome']","[BGISEQ-500, 31,137,607,200, 848,064, 1,791,961, 9,678,732,196, 58,194, 2,312,843, 2,604,457, ×, G + C, G + C, G + C, G + C, Gbtc 1, B9, G + C, high G + C, SMRT, Gbtc 1, 29,114,197, 3,752,118, Gbtc 2, 37,929,866, 4,075,796, G + C, GeneBank, BUSCO, ’, gyrB, CVTree3, hyaluromycini, paralicheniformis, ≥, ∼8 Mb, ’s, “, ”, “, ” “Amino acid, “Carbohydrate, Gbtc 1, “Carbohydrate, ”, “Signal, “Posttranslational, chaperones (O), “, ”, Slot, cinnamoyl-CoA’s, chalcone synthase, CHS, CHS, chalcone isomerase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, anthocyanidin synthase, anthocyanin class, anthocyanidin reductase, F3M, C4H, cinnamoyl-CoA, shikimate  O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, coumaroylquinate 3′-monooxygenase, caffeoylshikimate esterase, CSE, C3’H, methyltransferase, COMT, caffeoyl-CoA  O-methyltransferase, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase, 4CL, guaiacyl lignin, 5-hydroxy-guaiacyl lignin, peroxidase (, peroxiredoxin (, PRDX, catalase-peroxidase, PRDX, PRDX, pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductase, secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase, pluviatolide synthase, pluviatolide 4-, O-methyltransferase, bursehernin 5′-monooxygenase, 5′-demethylyatein 5′- O-methyltransferase, 2017a, platelet-activating factor, dimethylallyl diphosphate, C-methyl- D-erythritol-4-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, C-methyl- D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate, DMAPP, basic C 5, geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPP, DMAPP, D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, C-methyl- D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, MCT, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2- C-methyl- D-erythritol kinase, CDPMEK, C-methyl- D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase, E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase, Gbtc_2 ( F2, CDPMEK, MECPS, mevalonate-5P, mevalonate kinase, DMAPP, C-acetyltransferase, ACAT, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, HMGS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, HMGCR, phosphomevalonate kinase, PMVK, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, GPPS, FPPS, GGPPS, GGPP, GPPS, GGPPS, FPPS, FPPS, K00787, K00795, GGPPS, K00804, K13787, K13789, K13789, K15095 (+)-neomenthol dehydrogenase, K12467 myrcene/ocimene, K07385 1,8-cineole synthase, NAD+-dependent farnesol dehydrogenase, farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase, GGPP, copalyl diphosphate synthase, CPS, CPS, levopimaradiene synthase, LPS, GA, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, ent-kaurene oxidase, gibberellin 2beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin-44 dioxygenase, GGPP, phytoene desaturase (PDS), zeta-carotene desaturase, ZDS, ZDS – P-ISO, δ-carotene, δ-carotene, CHY, beta-ring hydroxylase, rHY, carotenoid epsilon hydroxylase, δ-carotene ε-cyclase, α- carotene, Luca, K01593, Sato, norcoclaurine synthase, S)-norcoclaurine, O-methyltransferase, NC6OMT, 3′-hydroxy- N-methyl, NM3H, 3′-hydroxy  N-methylcoclaurine 4′- O-methyltransferase (3HMC4OMT, NC6OMT, 3HMC4OMT, CNMT (, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate decarboxylase, monofunctional tyrosine aminotransferase, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, tryptophan decarboxylase, primary-amine oxidase, T3H, tyrosinase (, TYDC, Noteworthily, Gbtc 2, Gbtc 1, Gbtc 1, Gbtc2, Gbtc 1, LINEs, Noteworthily, Gbtc 3, Gbtc, Gbtc 2, B11, Gbtc 1, 8), 2, Gbtc 2, Gbtc 2, Gbtc 1, B17, Gbtc 1, B9, Gbtc 1, Gbtc 2, Gbtc 1, Gbtc 2, B11, Gbtc 1, B21, LTR-RTs, cross-species]",[],['5C.'],[],NaN

Among these genes,  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 are specifically expressed in flowers. The full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 contain open reading frames (ORFs) of 618 and 693 bp, encoding polypeptides of 205 and 230 amino acid residues with molecular masses of 23.26 and 24.68 kDa, respectively. Analysis of the predicted protein sequences of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 revealed the presence of 2R and 3R repeat signatures at the N-termini: these features of R2R3 DNA-binding MYB proteins ( Figure 1A) are essential for their interactions with regulatory sequences in the promoters of their target genes ( Kranz et al., 1998;  Dubos et al., 2010;  Medina-Puche et al., 2014). We performed a phylogenetic analysis of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 compared to R2R3-MYBs involved in secondary metabolism in other plant species. HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 clustered into different groups ( Figure 1B). HcMYB1 belongs to Group III and shares high amino acid homology with AtMYB77 and AtMYB44 ( Aharoni et al., 2001;  Shin et al., 2007;  Jaradat et al., 2013). In contrast, HcMYB2 belongs to Group I, whose members include AmMYB305, AmMYB340 ( A. majus), AtMYB24 ( A. thaliana), AtMYB21 ( A. thaliana), PhEOBII ( Petunia ×  hybrida), FaEOBII ( Fragaria ×  ananassa) NlMYB305 ( Nicotiana langsdorffii), and PsMYB26 ( Pisum sativum) ( Uimari and Strommer, 1997;  Shin et al., 2002;  Li et al., 2006b;  Liu et al., 2009;  Spitzer-Rimon et al., 2010;  Medina-Puche et al., 2015). The two proteins clustered into different groups and may have different functions and/or operate through different pathways to take part in floral volatile production. Furthermore, to interrogate the evolutionary relationship of six HcMYB family members with Arabidopsis MYBs, a phylogenetic tree was built. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all MYB proteins can be clustered into five different groups (G A–G F). HcMYB1 was clustered into group G B, HcMYB2/6/5 belongs to group G D, while HcMYB3/4 was grouped into G A ( Supplementary Figure 1). HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 Are Expressed During Flower Development and in Response to Auxin The accumulation of floral volatiles increases as flower development proceeds ( Yue et al., 2015;  Abbas et al., 2019). To study this process, we divided the flower development process into six stages ( Figure 2A). The emission of floral volatiles was low during the bud period (F1 and F2), substantially increased beginning at the initial flowering stage (F3), peaked during the full-bloom stage (F4 and F5), and declined at the senescence stage (F6) ( Figure 2B). To examine the relationship between  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 and key volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2) involved in floral volatile contents, we measured the expression levels of these genes.  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 transcript levels were low during early flower development and substantially increased thereafter.  HcMYB1 expression peaked at the full-bloom stage (F4–F5) and decreased at the senescence stage (F6), whereas  HcMYB2 was most strongly expressed at F6 ( Figure 2C). We detected similar expression patterns for  HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2 during flower development ( Figure 2D). Moreover, the expression levels of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 were positively correlated with the emissions of floral volatiles; this correlation was highly significant for  HcMYB1 ( Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, HcMYB1 showed a highly significant correlation with the emission of linalool contents ( Supplementary Figure 3). These results suggest that these genes play important roles in floral scent formation in  H. coronarium. Auxin plays a crucial role throughout flower development ( Krizek, 2011;  Ke et al., 2018). We, therefore measured total auxin levels in  H. coronarium during flower development (F1–F6). The total auxin contents were low during F1 and F2, peaked at F3–F5, dropped slightly at F4, and declined further at F6 ( Figure 2E). The emission of total floral volatiles was correlated with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) contents, suggesting that auxin might play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of these compounds. Under IAA treatment, the contents of the major floral volatiles ocimene, linalool, and methyl benzoate increased by 16, 17, and 20%, respectively, compared to those in control flowers not treated with IAA (CK) ( Figure 3A). Moreover, the expression of key structural volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS5,  HcTPS8,  HcPAL, and  HcBSMT2) was upregulated by this treatment ( Figure 3B). To characterize the expression levels of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 in response to IAA treatment, we performed qRT-PCR analysis.  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 transcript levels strongly increased after IAA treatment, reaching their highest levels at 12 h after treatment. In contrast, a rapid increase in  HcMYB2 and  HcTPS5 expression was observed at 2 h after treatment ( Figure 3C). Volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2) were also upregulated at 12 h after IAA treatment ( Figure 3D). The results suggest that the biosynthesis of floral volatiles is spatially and temporally regulated by HcMYB1 and HcMYB2, which are strongly associated with auxin-induced volatile emissions in  H. coronarium. We also examined the effect of p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB) (inhibit auxin action) on the floral volatile compounds ( Figure 4). In contrast to auxin, the emission of floral volatile compounds decreases. Under PCIB treatment, the contents of eucalyptol, allo-ocimene, β-ocimene, methyl benzoate, and linalool were decreased by 57, 81, 89, 100, and 42%, respectively, compared to those in control flowers not treated with PCIB ( Figure 4A). As expected, similar to IAA, the volatile contents of caryophyllene do not change significantly. We perform qRT-PCR analysis to characterize the expression level of key genes under PCIB treatment. The expression level of key volatile biosynthesis genes  HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS5,  HcTPS8,  HcPAL,  HcBSMT1,  HcBSMT2,  HcMYB1, and  HcMYB2 were downregulated by 79, 93, 64, 89, 33, 97, 96, 75, and 72%, respectively, relative to control ( Figure 4B). The data endorse the aforementioned findings that auxin plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of floral volatile compounds. Furthermore, we quantify the total hormone contents under IAA and PCIB treatment using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). The data showed that under IAA treatment, the total IAA and jasmonic acid (JA) contents were increased by 42 and 35% compared to control. Likewise, the total IAA and JA contents were decreased by 31 and 51%, respectively, while abscisic acid (ABA) contents were increased by 45% under PCIB treatment ( Figure 4C). However, the ABA contents do not change significantly under IAA treatment, suggesting that auxin might play a key role in the biosynthesis of floral volatile compounds via crosstalk with the abovementioned hormones. HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 Localize to the Nucleus and Exhibit Transactivation Activity Most MYB TFs specifically localize to the nucleus ( Zou et al., 2008;  Zhu et al., 2015;  Zhou et al., 2017). However, some MYB TFs localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm ( Li et al., 2006a). The nuclear localization prediction server WoLF PSORT 1 predicted that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 localize to the nucleus. To assess this prediction, we generated HcMYB1-GFP and HcMYB2-GFP constructs in which these genes were driven by the CaMV  35S promoter and used them to transform  Arabidopsis protoplasts. In HcMYB1-GFP- and HcMYB2-GFP-transformed protoplasts, observed green fluorescent protein (GFP) signals specifically in the nuclei, whereas control (GFP) protoplasts showed a ubiquitous distribution of GFP throughout the protoplasts ( Figure 5A). We included nuclear localization signal (NLS)-mCherry in each transformation as a marker for nuclear localization. These results demonstrate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 are nucleus-localized proteins, which is in keeping with their expected roles as transcription factors. Transcription factors regulate their target genes via transactivation activity. To investigate the transactivation activities of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2, we performed transient expression analysis in  Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We fused five copies of the GAL4 DNA-binding element (GAL4BD) and the minimal TATA region (5′-TATAAA-3′) of the  35S promoter to the firefly luciferase ( LUC) reporter; the Renilla luciferase ( REN) reporter gene driven by the  35S promoter as the reporter vector. The LUC/REN ratio from the reporter vector was used as an internal control. We constructed effector plasmids harboring the ORFs of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 ( Figure 5B). Unlike the GAL4BD negative control (empty vector, pBD), HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 activated the  LUC reporter gene. The LUC/REN ratios of HcMYB1, HcMYB2, and GAL4BD-VP16 were 3. 1-, 3. 7-, and 11.1-fold higher, respectively, compared to the negative control ( Figure 5C). These results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 function as transcriptional activators. Virus-Induced Gene Silencing of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 in Flowers Modifies the Emission Levels of Volatiles To investigate the potential involvement of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 in floral scent formation, we suppressed their expression through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in flowers ( Renner et al., 2009;  Yuan et al., 2011). We confirmed that this led to significant decreases in  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 transcript levels compared to those in unsilenced control flowers ( Figures 6A,B). The contents of the volatiles methyl benzoate and linalool in flowers decreased by approximately 57 and 21%, respectively, in response to  HcMYB1 silencing, whereas the eucalyptol and ocimene contents did not change significantly ( Figure 6C). In  HcMYB2-silenced flowers, the contents of methyl benzoate, linalool, ocimene, and eucalyptol decreased by 68, 37, 18, and 17%, respectively, compared to the control ( Figure 6C). We also analyzed the expression levels of key volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS3,  HcTPS5, and  HcBSMT2) in  H. coronarium. In  HcMYB1-silenced flowers,  HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2 were significantly downregulated, whereas  HcTPS3 did not exhibit any significant changes in expression, compared to the control. Furthermore, in  HcMYB2-silenced flowers,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS5, and  HcBSMT2 were all significantly downregulated compared to the control ( Figure 6D). These results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 play important and overlapping roles in the formation of floral volatiles in  H. coronarium. HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 Activate Structural Genes Involved in the Volatile Biosynthetic Pathway MYB TFs transcriptionally regulate several genes by binding to the MEB [(T)(T)TGAC(C/T)] sequences in their promoters ( Rushton et al., 2010).  In silico cis-element analysis revealed the presence of MYB-binding motifs in  HcBSMTs and  HcTPSs sequences. MYB-core binding motifs were present in ten out of twelve  HcBSMTs. The number of MYB-binding motifs varies from one to thirteen. Interestingly, the number of MYB-bindings motifs in  HcBSMT2 was highest compared to other  HcBSMTs ( Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, MYB-core binding motifs were found in sixty out of sixty-two  HcTPSs. The promoter sequence analysis of  HcBSMT2 (1131 bp) and  HcTPS5 (1555 bp) revealed the presence of MYB-core binding motifs in their sequences. There were 13 and 5 copies of MYB-binding motifs in the sequences of  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5, respectively, suggesting that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 might target these genes. To determine whether HcMYB1 and/or HcMYB2 bind to the promoters of  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5, we performed a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay. Bait strains co-expressing HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 and harboring  proHcBSMT2 grew well in SD-Leu medium containing the antibiotic aureobasidin A (AbA), whereas bait strains harboring  proHcTPS5 grew well only when they expressed HcMYB2 ( Figures 7A,B). These results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 bind to the  HcBSMT2 promoter, while HcMYB2 binds to the  HcTPS5 promoter. To confirm the binding ability of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 to the  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 promoters, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using GST-HcMYB1 and GST-HcMYB2 in  Escherichia coli. The probes used for  proHcTPS5 and  proHcBSMT2 were 49 bp, which start from (+)1168 to (+)1216 and (+)291 to (+)339, respectively. The sequences of the probes are listed in  Supplementary Table 2. Purified recombinant GST-HcMYB1 and GST-HcMYB2 fusion proteins bound to biotin-labeled probes derived from the  HcBSMT2 promoter, leading to a mobility shift, whereas no mobility shift occurred in the presence of GST alone ( Figure 7C). Next, we performed a competition assay, which showed that adding a 100-fold amount of unlabeled probe molecules (as compared to the labeled molecules) to the binding reaction reduced the intensity of the protein-DNA complex signal, and adding 500-fold unlabeled probes prevented any protein-DNA complex from being detected ( Figure 7C). We also observed binding between HcMYB2 and a biotin-labeled probe from the  HcTPS5 promoter ( Figure 7D). These results endorse the aforementioned data that HcMYB1 binds to the  HcBSMT2 promoter and HcMYB2 binds to the  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 promoters. To test the ability of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 to activate the  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 promoters, we performed a dual-luciferase assay. We individually cloned the promoter regions of  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 into reporter plasmids and the ORFs of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 into effector plasmids ( Figure 7E). HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 significantly enhanced  HcBSMT2 promoter activity (by 4.8-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively) compared to the control ( Figure 7D). Meanwhile, HcMYB2 significantly enhanced  HcTPS5 promoter activity (by 2.4-fold) compared to the control ( Figure 7F). Therefore, HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 activate the  HcBSMT2 promoter and HcMYB2 activates the  HcTPS5 promoter, indicating that these TFs have different target genes in  N. benthamiana leaves. These findings indicate that both HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 are transcriptional activators of volatile biosynthesis genes in flowers. HcMYB1 Interacts With the Auxin-Responsive Protein HcIAA4 by Y2H and BiFC Assays MYB proteins interact with many other proteins involved in hormone signal transduction, such as the jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive repressor proteins of the JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) family and the ABA signal receptor protein PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE LIKE (PYL) ( Qi et al., 2014;  Zhao et al., 2014). In a Y2H assay, HcMYB1 interacted with the auxin-responsive protein HcIAA4, whereas HcMYB2 did not ( Figure 8A). To verify the interaction between HcMYB1 and HcIAA4, we performed a BiFC assay. Expressing the N-terminal half of YFP fused to HcMYB1 (HcMYB1-YFP N) and the C-terminal half of YFP fused to HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP C) in  N. benthamiana leaves resulted in fluorescence. Moreover, the reciprocal experiment with the C-terminal half of YFP fused to HcMYB1 (HcMYB1-YFP C) and the N-terminal half of YFP fused to HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP N) also resulted in fluorescence and the control combinations of YFP C + HcMYB1-YFP N and HcIAA4-YFP C + YFP N did not result in fluorescence ( Figure 8B). To elucidate the functional significance of the interaction between HcMYB1 and HcIAA4, we co-transformed  N. benthamiana leaves with the same amounts of effectors carrying HcMYB1 and/or HcIAA4 in combination with the  HcBSMT2pro-LUC reporter constructs. The effect of HcMYB1 on  HcBSMT2pro expression was repressed in the presence of HcIAA4 ( Figure 8C). These results demonstrate that HcMYB1 directly activates  HcBSMT2 expression, which is modulated by its interacting partner HcIAA4.","Auxin, an important plant hormone, induces the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites by modulating the expression of auxin-responsive genes. In the ornamental plant  Hedychium coronarium , linalool and methyl benzoate are biosynthesized by the terpene synthase (TPS) HcTPS5 and the benzoic/salicylic acid methyltransferase (BSMT) HcBSMT2, respectively. However, the transcriptional regulation of this process remains unclear. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the R2R3-MYB transcription factors HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 in regulating the biosynthesis of these floral aroma compounds.  HcMYB1  and  HcMYB2  are specifically expressed in flowers, their expression is correlated with the emission of volatile compounds in flowers, and is induced by auxin. Moreover, HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 interact with the  HcBSMT2  promoter region. HcMYB2 activates the expression of the linalool synthase gene  HcTPS5 . In flowers with  HcMYB1  or  HcMYB2  silenced, the levels of floral scent compounds were significantly reduced, and  HcBSMT2  and  HcTPS5  were downregulated compared with the wild type. Moreover, HcMYB1 form protein-protein interaction with key scent-related HcIAA4 protein to regulate floral aroma production. Taken together, these results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 play crucial roles in regulating the formation of scent compounds in  Hedychium coronarium (H. coronarium)  flowers in response to auxin signaling.","['Biosynthesis', 'MYB transcription factors', 'auxin', 'Floral Scent', 'Hedychium Coronarium']","['Figure', 'Supplementary Figure', 'floral volatiles', 'IAA', 'IAA treatment', 'genes', 'flower development', 'volatile', 'floral', 'expression']","[Scent-Related, R2R3, MYB, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, R2R3-MYBs, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, AtMYB77, AtMYB44, HcMYB2, AmMYB305, AmMYB340, A. majus, AtMYB24, AtMYB21, Petunia ×, FaEOBII, Pisum sativum, MYB, G A–G F, HcMYB1, G B, HcMYB2/6/5, G D, HcMYB3/4, G A, HcMYB1, Auxin, F2, F5, HcTPS5, F4–F5, F6 ( Figure 2C, HcMYB1, Auxin, auxin, F2, F3–F5, F4, F6 ( Figure 2E, auxin, CK, HcTPS1, HcTPS5, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, auxin-induced, auxin, auxin, Figure 4A, auxin, JA, abscisic acid, ABA, ABA, auxin, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, MYB, MYB TFs, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1-GFP, HcMYB2-GFP, HcMYB1-GFP-, HcMYB2-GFP-transformed protoplasts, green fluorescent protein, GFP, GFP, GFP, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, GAL4, GAL4BD, firefly luciferase, LUC, LUC/REN, GAL4BD, pBD, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, LUC, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, GAL4BD-VP16, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, unsilenced, HcTPS3, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, MYB, MYB-bindings, MYB-core, MYB-core, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, Y1H, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, GST-HcMYB1, GST-HcMYB2, (+)1216, (+)291, (+)339, GST-HcMYB1, GST-HcMYB2, GST, protein-DNA complex, protein-DNA, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, dual-luciferase, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, Y2H, BiFC, MYB, JAZ, ABA signal receptor, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, YFP, HcMYB1, HcMYB1-YFP N, YFP, HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP C, YFP, HcMYB1, HcMYB1-YFP C, YFP, HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP N), YFP C + HcMYB1-YFP, HcIAA4-YFP C, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB1, HcIAA4]","['HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS8,', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS8,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPSs', 'HcTPSs.', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS5,', 'proHcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'proHcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5']",[],[],NaN
157,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC8385045\eupmc_result.json,PMC8385045,"Results and discussion Effects of pH and temperature on  PamTps1 activity The  PamTps1 activity was investigated using GPP as a substrate over a pH range of 5.5 to 9.0. At pH 6.5, the maximum catalytic activity was observed but was reduced to less than 10% of the maximum activity at pH 5.5 and pH 9 (Fig.  1A). This result was similar to the  3R-linalool synthase of  Mentha citrate which exhibited an optimum pH close to pH 6.5 and a half maximum velocity at pH 7.5 25. Typically, the optimal pH for terpene synthases is within a unit of neutrality as reviewed by Bohlmann et al. 4. Previously characterized plant linalool synthases showed an optimal pH range of 6.0–8.0 23,  26–  29. It was also noted that monoterpene synthases had a pH optima of 6–7 that correlated with the pH of the chloroplast in plants 30–  32, which corroborated the findings of  PamTps1. Solvolytic decomposition of GPP to linalool in the presence of divalent cation was reported to occur under acidic condition 33. As a result, the effect of pH below 5.5 could not be determined accurately due to an increase of substrate decomposition to linalool, which was also observed by Crowell et al. 25. The enzymatic activity of  PamTps1 was conducted at temperatures ranging from 25 to 50 °C. Optimal catalytic activity was observed at 30 °C, with only half of the maximal activity noted at 25 °C and 37 °C (Fig.  1B). The observed result was similar to the temperature range (30–40 °C) reported for plant terpene synthases such as ocimene synthase of  Lilium26, linalool synthase of coriander 34 and  Hedychium coronarium23, cineole synthase of lavender 35 and β-sesquiphellandrane synthase of  Persicaria minor36. The catalytic activity of  PamTps1 dropped drastically beyond the optimum temperature, with only less than 10% of the full velocity retained at 50 °C. This could probably be linked to the destabilization of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme at higher temperatures and ultimately contributed to denaturation and irreversible loss of activity 37. Effects of divalent metals on  PamTps1 activity Terpene synthases have an absolute requirement for a divalent metal ion such as Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ as a cofactor. The role of divalent metal ion in terpene synthases catalysis has been widely discussed and presumably involved in both substrate binding and catalysis 8,  17. Chelation of metal ion such as Mg 2+, neutralizes two of the three negative charges of the diphosphate moiety of the substrate, thereby assisting the ionization of the allylic substrate into highly reactive carbocation intermediates 38. Thus, divalent metal ions preferences of  PamTps1 and their influence on the catalytic activity were evaluated at different concentrations of Mg 2+ (0–250 mM) and Mn 2+ (0–10 mM). In the absence of a divalent metal ion, the  PamTps1 activity was negligent. However, the activity was restored by the provision of either Mg 2+ or Mn 2+, which suggested an absolute requirement for a metal ion cofactor for catalytic activity (Fig.  1C,D). A maximal activity was obtained with Mn 2+ at 0.5 mM, but was inhibited as Mn 2+ concentration increased to 10 mM (Fig.  1D). Other characterized plant terpene synthases demonstrated maximum activity with manganese concentrations at less than 1.0 mM 28,  39,  40. On the other hand, in the presence of Mg 2+, the catalytic activity of  PamTps1 increased steadily from 2 mM to a maximum activity at 20 mM, but was inhibited at 250 mM (Fig.  1C). This optimal concentration of Mg 2+ finding was also observed in  M. citrata linalool synthase 25,  Citrus sinensis limonene synthase 40 and Japanese pepper terpene synthases 39. In this study,  PamTps1 showed a preference for Mg 2+ for catalysis with 2.1 folds increase in activity compared to Mn 2+. Likewise, other characterized plant terpene synthases that favored Mg 2+ over Mn 2+ included linalool/nerolidol synthase 1 and 2 13,  Artemisia annua monoterpene synthases 41,  Lilium ‘Siberia’ terpene synthase 26 and  Santalum album terpene synthases 42. In contrast, linalool synthase of lavender 28 and  C. sinensis limonene synthase 40 showed preferences for Mn 2+ as a cofactor with high terpene yields when 1–5 mM of Mn 2+ were used. Kinetic parameters of  PamTps1 In this study,  PamTps1 activity was inhibited when Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ concentrations beyond 50 mM and 5 mM, respectively, were used. Therefore, the  Km value was estimated by a non-linear Michaelis–Menten curve using lower concentrations of Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ (Fig.  1E,F) which gave 1.74 ± 0.35 mM and 0.05 ± 0.001 mM, respectively, (Table  1). These values were comparable to those obtained with kiwi terpene synthases 43, snapdragon linalool/nerolidol synthase 13 and sweet basil geraniol synthase 44. Nevertheless, in some reported metal ions studies, there are other terpene synthases that recorded  Km values of less than 1 mM 23,  27,  45 while higher  Km values were also noted in some terpene synthases including  A. annua linalool synthase 46 and γ-terpinene synthases 10,  47. Although  Km value for  PamTps1 was substantially lower when using Mn 2+, its  Vmax value was only 43% of that with Mg 2+. It is presumed that  PamTps1 is more likely to operate with Mg 2+ cofactor in planta due to the higher concentration of Mg 2+ in plant cells as compared to the Mn 2+48,  49. Kinetic characterization of  PamTps1 for GPP and FPP was performed below 100 µM since higher concentrations inhibited its catalytic activity (Fig.  1G,H). The apparent  Km value of  PamTps1 for GPP was 16.72 ± 1.32 µM, which was well within the range of  Km values reported in other plant monoterpene synthases (Table  1) 40,  41, but lower compared to linalool synthases from  H. coronarium (20.54 ± 4.52 µM) 23,  Cinnamomum osmophloeum (54.19 µM) 50,  L. angustifolia (55.8 ± 4.1 µM) 28 and  M. citrata (25 ± 6.00 µM) 25. Nonetheless, linalool synthases from snapdragon 13,  A. arguta27 and  A. chinensis51 exhibited  Km values below 10 µM which suggested that these enzymes have a higher affinity for GPP. On the other hand,  PamTps1  Km value of 40.47 ± 3.83 µM for FPP was 2.4 folds higher than that for GPP, which signified that  PamTps1 had a higher binding affinity for GPP. From the abovementioned results, it can be inferred that  PamTps1 has a lower affinity for FPP and become saturated at a higher substrate concentration to reach its maximal velocity ( Vmax = 14.85 ± 2.80 µmol mg −1).  PamTps1 has a greater affinity for GPP than FPP as anticipated for a monoterpene synthase, where a lower concentration of GPP was required to achieve  Vmax of 24.16 ± 3.75 µmol mg −1. Similar observation was noted in the snapdragon linalool/nerolidol synthases that exhibited higher substrate affinity towards GPP than to FPP 13. The turnover rate ( kcat) for both substrates in the current study were 0.16 s −1 and 0.10 s −1 for GPP and FPP, respectively, which was within the range of monoterpene (0.01–1.0 s −1) and sesquiterpene (0.03–0.5 s −1) synthases recorded 52,  53, and the low  kcat values reflected that  PamTps1 is a relatively slow enzyme. Terpene synthases are typically slow enzymes, which is a general feature of the enzymes involved in secondary metabolism and is approximately 30 folds slower than those involved in central metabolism 54. The catalytic efficiency ( kcat/ Km) of GPP was 3.9 folds higher than FPP, further suggesting that  PamTps1 recognized GPP more efficiently, which was in accordance with the abovementioned expectations. This may also be linked to the fact that  PamTps1 was a plastid-targeted enzyme, where the GPP pool was located. Parallel observations were seen in lavender 28 and  Freesia55. Secondary structure prediction The secondary structure of  PamTps1 was predicted using PSIPRED server 56 followed by identification and annotation of the protein domain using MOTIF and SMART 57. The PSIPRED tool predicted that the secondary structure of  PamTps1 would consist entirely of α-helices (24 α-helices) connected by coils, with no strands or β-sheets observed except for the two extended strands located at the N-terminal signal peptide region (Fig.  S1). Through domain analysis, it was revealed that these α-helices were organized into two structural domains of N-terminal (residues: 66–245) (Pfam: PF01397) and C-terminal metal binding domain (residues: 277–540) (Pfam: PF03936) with domain boundary located at residue M271 as determined by DomPRED. These predictions are in agreement with general features of most plant terpene synthases that adopt an α-helical architecture, which are organized into two domains of N-terminal region that has structural similarity to glycosylhydrolases 58 and the C-terminal domain containing the catalytic site 5. Protein homology modelling of the  PamTps1 The  PamTps1 was modeled on the crystal structure of  Salvia officinalis (+)-bornyl diphosphate synthase (BPPS) (1N24) 5 using residues that correspond to the complete amino acid sequence in accordance to the RRx 8W motif. The chosen BPPS template featured a closed active site conformation with Mg 2+ and its product, and shared 67.04% sequence identity. The residue numbers described hereafter corresponded to the numbering of amino acids immediately following the RRx 8W motif (Fig.  S2). The predicted  PamTps1 structure as shown in Fig.  2, revealed that the enzyme comprised of two structural domains of N- and C-terminal, connecting with short loops and turns. The N-terminal domain (residues 1–214) of  PamTps1 consisted of 14 α-helices arranged in an α-barrel with minor structural differences to that of BPPS 5. Although there was no established catalytic function for this N-terminal domain, it was reported that this domain was involved in capping the active site pocket upon substrate binding, and presumably shielded the reactive carbocation intermediates from water as observed in the crystal structure of BPPS,  Taxus brevifolia taxadiene synthase (PDB ID: 3P5R) and  Gossypium arboretum δ-cadinene synthase (PDB ID: 3G4F) 5,  9,  59. The presence of this apparently non-functional N-terminal domain in terpene synthases may have been due to an evolutionary vestige from copalyl diphosphate synthase-kaurene synthase, which was the ancestor of all modern terpene synthases that possess both functional catalytic domains 6,  8,  60. The N-terminal domain contained two conserved motifs that were present in typical plant terpene synthases, namely the RRx 8W and LQLYEASFLL motifs. The tandem arginine motif was found in many plant monoterpene synthases and was thought to mark the approximate cleavage site of the plastid-targeting sequence 6. A previous truncation study of this motif from a limonene synthase suggested that the RR motif was required for initial isomerization of GPP to linalyl diphosphate (LPP), owing to the inability of the truncated limonene synthase to accept GPP as a substrate, while still functioning with LPP as a substrate for the cyclization step 6,  61. These arginine residues may also contribute to the stabilization of the closed active site while still allowing flexibility that was necessary for the binding of two structurally different prenyl diphosphates (GPP and LPP) as observed in limonene synthase 6. Since  PamTps1 did not undergo a cyclisation reaction, it was likely that the RRx 8W motif might only be involved in the capping of the  PamTps1 active site and not in the catalysis reaction. The InterProScan analysis also predicted that the RRx 8W region acted as an active site lid in the  PamTps1. Besides that, the LQLYEASFLL motif that was assumed to be part of the active site 62,  63 occurred as LQLYEASFLE in  PamTps1, and there were no observable differences in the overall structure of the enzyme for amino acid substitution from leucine to glutamic acid. The larger C-terminal domain (residues 215–542) adopted an α-helical architecture known as class I terpene synthase fold which consisted of 16 α-helices, where the hydrophobic pocket of the active site cavity was formed by six α-helices (C, D, F, G, H and J) (Fig.  2). This domain was well conserved with an RMSD value of 0.190 Å as compared to the BPPS. The C-terminal domain contained two metal binding motifs of the aspartate-rich DDxxD and NSE/DTE (evolved from a second aspartate-rich region) to form a consensus sequence of (L,V)(V,L,A)( N, D)D(L,I,V)x(S, T)xxx E. The NSE/DTE motif appeared to be less well conserved amongst the plant terpene synthases as compared to the DDxxD motif. Both the DDxxD and NSE/DTE motifs were reported to bind to a trinuclear magnesium cluster involved in the fixation of the diphosphate substrate 5,  64,  65. The  PamTps1 also contained other motifs that were thought to be part of the terpene synthases active site, such as RxR and GTLxEL 63,  66 which occurred as RDR and GTLDEL in  PamTps1 and were located 35 amino acids upstream and two amino acids downstream of the DDxxD, respectively. Protein structural alignment or superimposition allows homology establishment between template and protein model based on the 3D protein conformation as a protein structure was more conserved than its sequence during evolution. Superimposition of the  PamTps1 model with BPPS template using Chimera with α-carbon RMSD fitted to 0.203 Å showed that the two structures were exceptionally similar (Fig.  3). Validation of the  PamTps1 model The reliability of the model was first evaluated by the GMQE and Qualitative Model Energy Analysis (QMEAN) scores provided by the SWISS-MODEL tool. The GMQE score is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where higher numbers indicate higher reliability of the model 68. The QMEAN Z-score provides an estimate degree of structural features similarity observed in the model with scores around 0 indicate good agreement between model structure and template 69. The  PamTps1 model scores of 0.82 and − 1.32 for respective GMQE and QMEAN showed that the built model was reliable and satisfactory. Further validation by PROCHECK to assess the stereochemical quality of generated model showed that 92.8% of  PamTps1 residues fall in most favored regions, 6.6% residues in additional allowed regions, 0.2% residues in generously allowed regions and only 0.4% residues in the disallowed regions suggesting the acceptability of the modeled structure (Fig.  S2, Table  S3). PROVE analysis revealed that the quality of the predicted 3D structure of  PamTps1 model was good and reliable with the respective Z-score mean and Z-score RMS for the entire structure of 0.487 and 1.421, respectively. The ERRAT analyses statistic of non-bonded interactions between different atom types based on characteristic atomic interactions 97. The overall ERRAT quality factor value is expressed as the percentage of the protein for which the calculated value is less than the 95% rejection limit. A good high-resolution structure typically yields values of 95% or higher, and the  PamTps1 model yielded an overall quality factor of 95.88%, which was very satisfactory. Another program used for validation of protein structure was the Verify3D, which determines compatibility of an atomic model (3D) with its own amino acid sequence (1D) by assigning structural class based on its location and environment 98. The Verify3D analysis of  PamTps1 model revealed that 95.73% of the residues had an average 3D–1D score ≥ 0.2. As the cut-off score ≥ 0, this implies that the predicted model was valid. ProSA was used to check the 3D model of  PamTps1 for potential errors where positive value of the z-score corresponded to problematic or erroneous region of a model. The Z-score of − 12 for  PamTps1 model was within the acceptable range of X-ray studies and this value was close to the value of the template (− 10.92) suggesting that the predicted model was reliable and close enough to experimentally determine structure (Fig.  S2, Table  S3). Molecular docking of  PamTps1 with prenyl diphosphate substrates To gain further insight into the active site of the enzyme investigated here, the model structure of  PamTps1 was carried out with molecular docking using GPP (C 10) and FPP (C 15) substrates. Docking of the prenyl diphosphate substrates yielded multiple docking positions. The criteria for choosing the best docking position were based on the lowest docking score and the number of hydrogen bonds between the substrate and the amino acid residues. A docking position with the least docking score has the highest affinity towards the ligand, and hence is the best docked conformation. Hydrogen bonds contribute to the stability of proteins and specificity of protein–ligand interactions, which is also an important consideration for selection of the docking position 70. The docking results were further analyzed using Chimera and LigPlot + to generate 2D and 3D ligand–protein interaction diagrams, respectively. Docking of GPP and FPP substrates confirmed that the active site of  PamTps1 was located at the C-terminal domain, proximate to the location of the Mg 2+ cofactor (Fig.  4). A two-dimensional representation of Mg 2+ interaction with the amino acid residues and substrate (ligand) was displayed in Fig.  4C,D. This concurred with earlier observations using SWISS-MODEL and InterProscan that the diphosphate (PPi) moiety of the prenyl substrates interacted with the highly conserved aspartate-rich ( D296DVY D300) and NSE/DTE (LA D440DLG T444APF E448) motifs via complexed Mg 2+, in which the boldface residues were coordinated to the metal ions. The first and third aspartate residues in the aspartate-rich motif, D296 and D300, were coordinated to Mg 2+A and Mg 2+C, which were identical to the BPPS, avian FPP synthase 67, taxadiene synthase 9, and  M. spicata limonene synthase 6. The second metal-binding region comprised of D440, T444 and E448 of the helix H coordinated to the Mg 2+B. Similar metal ion coordination by the corresponding residues was also observed in trichodiene synthase 71, 5- epi-aristolochene synthase 72 and taxadiene synthase 9. The distances between Mg 2+ cofactor and the corresponding residues were summarized in Table  S1. The ideal distance for metal ion coordination was between 2.0 and 2.2 Å, which was more typically observed in higher-resolution structures 73. It was revealed that the coordination distance with the metal ion for  PamTps1 was within the range of 2.0–2.75 Å, which was longer than what was expected for Mg 2+ coordination. Shorter metal–ligand distances resulted in tighter first coordination sphere ligands, resulting in less wiggle room in the first coordination sphere, and therefore less deviation from the ideal octahedral geometry 74. Magnesium has the tightest initial coordination sphere closest to ideal octahedral geometry, with a typical Mg—O distance of around 2.1 Å 74. Validation of metal-binding sites of  PamTps1 revealed that two of the three metal ions exhibited octahedral geometry, while the third had an outlier geometry (Table  2). The gRMSD measures overall deviation of the observed geometry angle from the ideal geometry angle 75, and  PamTps1 model showed acceptable gRMSD values for the trinuclear magnesium cluster binding sites. The vacancy calculates percentage of vacant coordination sites for a given geometry 75. This analysis, however, revealed borderline and outlier vacancy values, which probably explained the longer metal coordination distances between magnesium ion and binding sites as discussed previously (Table  S1). In addition to metal coordination interactions, the PPi moiety of GPP and FPP were also predicted to accept hydrogen bonds from R259, R437 and K456 residues (Fig.  4; Table  S2). Similarly, this finding was observed in other reported plant terpene synthases where PPi binding was accommodated by hydrogen bonds donated from two arginine and one lysine residues 5,  8,  72. The R259 of  PamTps1 derived from the R259DR motif may serve as a proton donor to thermodynamically support the PPi cleavage by protonation after the first reaction step 76–  78. Mutational analysis of this residue showed a loss of catalytic activity suggesting the important role of this arginine residue in restricting the PPi 79. The R437 derived from the extended second metal binding motif (LR437LADDLGTAPFE) in  PamTps1 was also reported to donate hydrogen bond to the PPi of the substrate as observed with the bornyl diphosphate synthase 5. The K456 residue of the  PamTps1 that was a part of the conserved lysine residue amongst  Tpsb terpene synthases was located at the H-α1 loop and hydrogen bonded with the PPi of the substrate. The H-α1 loop lysine residue was also observed to donate hydrogen bond to the PPi in the BPPS crystal structure 5 and limonene synthase 6. The coordination of three metal ions and hydrogen bond interactions with basic residues of lysine and/or arginine presumably triggered the ionization of the substrate to yield carbocation intermediates that led to the production of terpenoids 80,  81. The substrate coordination and distance with  PamTps1 residues and Mg 2+ are summarized in Table  S2. Based on the proposed mechanism of 5- epi-aristolochene synthase 72 and  Abies grandis α-bisabolene synthase 82, the metal-dependent ionization of the substrate resulted in the generation of a negatively charged PPi that was stabilized by Mg 2+ ions and three basic residues, and which created a positively charged region that drew the PPi away from the carbocations in the hydrophobic active pocket. Thus, the three Mg 2+ ions and the three basic residues served as the PPi recognition motif in the active site, allowing proper orientation of the substrate while activating the PPi to initiate ionization and catalysis 8. The active site of terpene synthases was also characterized by the presence of several aromatic residues crucial for the stabilization of the carbocation intermediates 5,  8,  9,  79. The docking results revealed that the non-polar hydrocarbon groups of GPP and FPP were buried in the hydrophobic area of the active site surrounded by aliphatic and aromatic residues (Fig.  4C,D). The C 10 tail of the GPP formed hydrophobic interactions with W268, Y272, V289, T293, I397, T517 and Y523 residues. Meanwhile the W268, Y272, V289, V292, T293, I397, A398, A399, A402, L436 and Y523 residues participated in non-bonded interactions with the C 15 group of the FPP. Among the active site residues, the non-polar hydrocarbon group of GPP and FPP were located in the aromatic pair’s area surrounded by residues Y523 of the J-K loop and W268 of the helix C at the bottom of the  PamTps1 active site (Fig.  4A,B). Sequences comparison against other terpene synthases suggested that the W268 was a conserved residue, whereas the position equivalent to Y523 could be occupied by aromatic residues of histidine, phenylalanine or tyrosine as mutation of these residues resulted in catalytically impaired catalyst 6,  8,  79,  83. According to Brandt et al. 76, the nature and position of these aromatic amino acid residues at the active site of terpene synthases determined the docking orientation of the intermediate prenyl cation and therefore product specificity. In amorphadiene synthase, the aromatic phenylalanine residue (residue in the same position of Y523 of  PamTps1) was similarly involved in positioning of the FPP substrate in the active site, which subsequently stabilized the carbocation intermediates 84. A similar observation was also reported by Zhang et al. 85 with  Nicotiana tabacum 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (TEAS) that catalyzed the cyclisation of FPP into bicyclic 5- epi-aristolochene. Mutational analysis of the aromatic amino acids proved the essential role of these residues in the active site for stabilization of the carbocation intermediates 79,  85. Positioning of GPP and FPP in the  PamTps1 active site surrounded by these aromatic residues suggested that this docking analysis was rational and compatible with other crystal structures of terpene synthases. Insights into the  PamTps1 active site pocket Not all terpene synthases have the ability to use multi-substrate. Steric limitations and configuration of the active site center and the overall protein stability contributed by the tertiary protein structure might rule out the use of multi-substrate 12. The ability of terpene synthases to catalyze multiple substrates has been reported to be contributed by both size and residues of the active site pockets. In general, the active site pocket is slightly larger than the corresponding substrate and product, and size of the cavity is increasingly deeper and wider for increasingly longer chain products 9,  86. The active site of  Streptomyces clavuligens linalool/nerolidol synthase (bLinS) has been shown to be large enough to accommodate sesquiterpene, which explained the fact that this enzyme recognized FPP as a substrate 64. It was predicted that the active site pocket of  PamTps1 was also large enough and unconstrained to accommodate FPP, resulting in nerolidol formation. Using CASTp server and InterProScan analysis, the topographic features of the  PamTps1 active site pocket containing the docked substrate was illustrated in Fig.  5 and amino acids that lined the pocket cavity were also identified (Table  3). Both substrates were appropriately docked in the  PamTps1 active site cavity, thus enlightened the multi-substrate use ability of  PamTps1. The active site cavity of  PamTps1 was a deep hydrophobic pocket with a contour defined by numerous aliphatic and aromatic side chains made of six helices of C, D, F, G, H and J (Table  3; Fig.  5) similarly as described for the BPPS structure 5. Nine aromatic residues (W268, Y272, Y299, F371, Y378, Y379, F447, Y517 and Y523) outlined the hydrophobic walls of the active site cavity. This result was also supported by structural studies of other plant terpene synthases 5,  9,  25,  72. It was reported that arginine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, valine, tryptophan and isoleucine were the commonly observed amino acid residues at the catalytic site of the terpene synthases 87, which was also observed in the  PamTps1 active site. The presence of aromatic residue pairs (Y523 and W268) at the bottom of the active site did not appear to restrict the size of the active site, and the hydrocarbon group of FPP appeared to fit perfectly into the catalytic pocket, which may shed light on the possibility of  PamTps1 accepting FPP as a substrate (Fig.  5). By analogy with the previous characterized enzymes, it was believed that the active site of  PamTps1 was reasonably large and deep enough to accommodate both the GPP and FPP, resulting in the formation of linalool and nerolidol, respectively. Residues from the RRx 8W motif, RDR motif, H-α1 and J-K loops were observed to act as a catalytic lid that closed the active site entrance upon substrate binding (Table  3). Structural comparison with BPPS showed that the J-K loop of  PamTps1 was longer than the equivalent loop in BPPS. Sugiura et al. 88 reported that the  Backhousia citriodora linalool synthase had a long J-K loop and bulky amino acids around the active site that could partially inhibit water access to the active site, leading to the production of (−) linalool and minor amounts of myrcene and (−) limonene. Alignment of amino acids indicated that most Lamiaceae linalool synthases differed from other terpene synthases by a three-amino acid deletion at the –-K loop region, thereby resulting in a more open structure, allowing easier access of water during substrate ionization 25,  89. However, no amino acid deletions at the J-K loop region were observed in the  PamTps1 and it was assumed that the longer J-K loop could lead to the more open structure of the enzyme. The crystal structure of bLinS was also reported to be relatively open, allowing the carbocation intermediate to attack nearby water and led to linalool production 64. Although the crystal structures  PamTps1’s open and closed active site conformations are not yet available, it is thought that  PamTps1 does not undergo significant conformational changes between open and closed states, as observed with other linalool synthases 25,  64. As a result, the active site was more susceptible to water access, resulting in the premature released of the carbocationic intermediates and the production of acyclic linalool and nerolidol 25,  64,  89. Besides that, other conserved motifs considered to be part of the active site were LQLYEASFLL and GTLxEL 63,  66. However, there was no computational evidence that both motifs were involved in the formation of the  PamTps1 active site or in the catalysis reaction, as exhibited by the active site pocket analysis and protein docking studies.","Linalool and nerolidol are terpene alcohols that occur naturally in many aromatic plants and are commonly used in food and cosmetic industries as flavors and fragrances. In plants, linalool and nerolidol are biosynthesized as a result of respective linalool synthase and nerolidol synthase, or a single linalool/nerolidol synthase. In our previous work, we have isolated a linalool/nerolidol synthase (designated as PamTps1) from a local herbal plant, Plectranthus amboinicus, and successfully demonstrated the production of linalool and nerolidol in an Escherichia coli system. In this work, the biochemical properties of PamTps1 were analyzed, and its 3D homology model with the docking positions of its substrates, geranyl pyrophosphate (C 10 ) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (C 15 ) in the active site were constructed. PamTps1 exhibited the highest enzymatic activity at an optimal pH and temperature of 6.5 and 30 °C, respectively, and in the presence of 20 mM magnesium as a cofactor. The Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) and catalytic efficiency (k cat /K m ) values of 16.72 ± 1.32 µM and 9.57 × 10 -3  µM -1  s -1 , respectively, showed that PamTps1 had a higher binding affinity and specificity for GPP instead of FPP as expected for a monoterpene synthase. The PamTps1 exhibits feature of a class I terpene synthase fold that made up of α-helices architecture with N-terminal domain and catalytic C-terminal domain. Nine aromatic residues (W268, Y272, Y299, F371, Y378, Y379, F447, Y517 and Y523) outlined the hydrophobic walls of the active site cavity, whilst residues from the RRx 8 W motif, RxR motif, H-α1 and J-K loops formed the active site lid that shielded the highly reactive carbocationic intermediates from the solvents. The dual substrates use by PamTps1 was hypothesized to be possible due to the architecture and residues lining the catalytic site that can accommodate larger substrate (FPP) as demonstrated by the protein modelling and docking analysis. This model serves as a first glimpse into the structural insights of the PamTps1 catalytic active site as a multi-substrate linalool/nerolidol synthase.",NaN,"['active site', 'terpene synthases', 'synthases', 'synthase', 'site', 'GPP', 'active', 'residues', 'Fig.', 'FPP']","[pH 9, 6.0–8.0, 6–7, Crowell et al., 30–40 °C, β-sesquiphellandrane synthase, Mg 2, Mg 2, Mg 2, Mn 2+, Mg 2, Mg 2, Mg 2, Mg 2, Mg 2, linalool/nerolidol synthase 1, Mn 2, Mn 2, Mg 2, Mn 2, Michaelis–, Mg 2, Mn 2+, snapdragon linalool/nerolidol synthase 13, Mn 2, Mg 2, Mg 2+, Mg 2, Mn 2, arguta27, −1, −1, −1, −1, −1, 0.03–0.5 , −1, β-sheets, N-terminal signal peptide region, α-helices, 66–245, C-terminal metal binding domain (, 277–540, DomPRED, glycosylhydrolases 58, (+)-bornyl diphosphate synthase (BPPS), BPPS, Mg 2, α-barrel, BPPS 5, N-terminal, BPPS, 3P5R, LQLYEASFLL, prenyl diphosphates, LQLYEASFLL, LQLYEASFLE, class I terpene synthase, α-helices, C, D, BPPS, (L, V)(V, V)x(S, GTLxEL 63, GTLDEL, BPPS, α-carbon, GMQE, GMQE, − , GMQE, ERRAT, ERRAT quality factor, ProSA, − 12, − , prenyl diphosphate, FPP (, prenyl diphosphate, protein–ligand, 3D ligand–, Mg 2+ cofactor, Mg 2, prenyl, LA D440DLG T444APF E448, Mg 2, Mg 2+C, BPPS, T444, Mg 2+B., trichodiene synthase 71, epi-aristolochene synthase 72, taxadiene synthase 9, Mg 2+, 2.0–2.75 Å, Mg 2, metal–ligand, Mg—O, gRMSD, gRMSD, LR437LADDLGTAPFE, H-α1, H-α1, BPPS, limonene synthase 6, Mg 2, epi-aristolochene synthase 72, α-bisabolene synthase, Mg 2, Mg 2, C, W268, V289, I397, W268, V289, I397, C, W268, C, W268, clavuligens linalool/nerolidol synthase, bLinS, C, D, BPPS, W268, W268, H-α1, BPPS, BPPS, –-K, J-K, bLinS, LQLYEASFLL, GTLxEL 63]",[],"['50\xa0°C.', '50\xa0°C.', 'C.']",['Citrus'],terpene synthase
158,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC8404343\eupmc_result.json,PMC8404343,"Results Light deprivation decreased terpenoid, but increased GLV emissions Predation assays performed with a biparential RIL population of  N. attenuata plants grown in a field plot in the summer of 2017 revealed that  M. sexta eggs and larvae were predated by big-eyed bugs ( Geocoris spp.) during the day time (Fig.  S1), consistent with previous findings [ 27]. Because plant volatiles play essential roles in mediating this tri-trophic interaction [ 23,  26] and to get a better understanding of their diurnal/nocturnal regulation, we collected headspace day and night time volatiles from  N. attenuata leaves on glasshouse-grown plants elicited by wounding plus  M. sexta larval regurgitant (W + R) using PDMS tubing pieces (Kallenbach et al. [ 30], Fig.  1A, B). The assayed leaf was enclosed in a plastic cup which could be wrapped using aluminum foil to locally deprive the treated leaf of light (Fig.  1A, B). We found that the emission of most terpenoid volatiles corresponded strongly to light periods, especially linalool and ( E)-α-bergamotene (Fig.  1C). The emission of these terpenoid volatiles was very low during the night period (22:00–6:00), increased in the morning (6:00–10:00), and peaked during the middle of the day (10:00–14:00), then decreased in the afternoon (14:00–18:00) and returned to low levels in the evening (18:00–22:00). When the leaf was enclosed in a wrapped cup during the middle hours of the day (10:00–14:00), the emission of most terpenoids immediately decreased to low levels, comparable to those measured at night. After the foil wrapping was removed in the afternoon and evening, the emission of these terpenoid volatiles returned to control levels (Fig.  1C). In contrast to the day-emitted terpenoids, many GLVs were abundantly emitted at night and steadily decreased during the day, although some, such as ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and ( Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate, continued to be released at high levels in the morning. Local light deprivation during the middle hours of the day did not alter GLV emissions but up-regulated them in the afternoon, which likely continued through the evening hours (Fig.  1C). The decreased total terpenoid volatile emissions and increased total GLV emissions associated with light deprivation were further confirmed in single 24 h collections after W + R treatments (Fig.  1D). Thus terpenoids and GLVs showed opposing responses to local light deprivation.  Because the volatile emission might also be affected by temperature and humidity caused by wrapping the cups, we monitored these two factors outside of cups, in clean cups and in wrapped cups (Fig.  S2A). We found that there was only 0.8–2.4 °C drop in temperature in wrapped cups compared to clean cups during the wrapping period 10:00–14:00 (Fig.  S2B). The average humidity in wrapped cups were about 9% higher than in clean cups, but it was more variable depending on the enclosed leaf (Fig.  S2B). These difference in temperature and humidity were not supposed to significantly affect the volatile emission in our experimental setups because they were in the comfortable zone of the plants. Silencing  NaPhyB1 expression and ABA treatments altered GLV but not terpenoid emissions We assessed the volatile emissions elicited by W + R treatment in a series of plants individually silenced (by stable transformation with inverted repeat—ir—RNAi constructs) in the following photoreceptor genes:  NaPhyB1, NaPhyB2, NaPhyB1 x NaPhyB2, NaCrypt1 and NaCrypt2 (previously characterized by Oh et al. [ 31]). The emission pattern of volatiles in all the plants were largely unchanged (Fig.  2A, Fig.  S3) with the exception of those of ir PhyB1 plants. Particularly, in plants generated by crossing ir PhyB1 with ir PhyB2 to silence both phytochrome genes, ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate emissions increased in the afternoon. Supplementation of far red light did not alter total terpenoid or GLV emissions as assessed in 24 h collections (Fig.  2B) or collections taken every 4 h (Fig.  S4).  ABA regulated HIPVs but not via stomatal conductance We tested if the day/night patterns of volatile emission were controlled by changes in stomatal resistance, which might influence the release of volatiles from plant tissues (Fig.  3A, [ 32,  33]). We used ABA treatments to increase the stomatal resistance of leaves of empty vector control (EV) and ir MPK4 plants, which, as previously described [ 34], have stomata that are largely in the open state and are not responsive to ABA treatments (Fig.  3A, B). ABA treatment of EV plants increased stomatal resistance during the day, but the diurnal emissions of the terpenoids, linalool and ( E)-α-bergamotene, were not altered in either EV or ir MPK4 plants (Fig.  3C). In contrast, emissions of ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate were upregulated at the sampling period that followed the ABA treatment and returned to control levels at the end of the day in both EV and ir MPK4 plants (Fig.  3C). Interestingly, measurements of the internal leaf volatile pools revealed that ABA treatments decreased the amounts of linalool accumulated in leaves during the middle part of the day in both EV and ir MPK4 plants, although it did not decrease amounts released to the headspace (Fig.  3C, D). Internal ( E)-α-bergamotene pools tended to increase but were not significantly changed by ABA treatment, consistent with the headspace emissions. Internal ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate pools tracked headspace emissions, and both were enhanced by ABA treatments in EV plants, with smaller enhancements in ir MPK4 plants (Fig.  3D).  Thus ABA treatment enhanced the emission of a GLV, which is more abundantly emitted in the dark, despite reducing stomatal conductance. Similarly, impaired red/far red light perception also increased GLV emission. However, neither ABA treatment nor impairment of plant light perception had a significant effect on emission of terpenoids. Genes responsible for terpenoid and GLV biosynthesis are diurnally transcribed A previously published microarray data set revealed dynamic transcriptome changes in  N. attenuata after W + R treatment [ 35]. From this data set,  NaLIS transcripts, encoding the linalool synthase  23, were abundant in the daytime and barely detectable at night (Fig.  4A). Transcripts of the ( E)-α-bergamotene synthase gene,  NaTPS38 [ 24] , were strongly increased in both day and night, however, the rate of up-regulation was greater during the day. Intriguingly, transcripts of  NaHPL and  NaLOX2, both involved in GLV biosynthesis, were also more abundant during the day, even though the emission of most GLVs is nocturnal. Using qRT-PCR we further confirmed that light deprivation strongly down-regulated  NaLIS transcript levels, as well as those of  NaGPPS1 and  NaGPPS2, genes responsible for the biosynthesis of monoterpenoid substrates upstream in the pathway (Fig.  4B).  Cis-acting regulatory elements involved in light-, stress-, phytohormone- and circadian-regulation were identified in the biosynthetic genes We scanned the 2 kb promoter regions of  NaLIS, NaTPS38, NaHPL and  NaLOX2 for  cis-acting regulatory elements (Fig.  5, Table  1, Table  S2).  NaLIS has six and  NaTPS38 five elements identified as potentially involved in responsiveness to light in their promoters, and eight and fourteen were found in the promotors of  NaHPL and  NaLOX2, respectively. Box 4 [ 36] was present in all the promoters with different copy numbers. Some of the elements were found in two or three of the promoters such as the AE box [ 37], G-box [ 38,  39], GT1-motif [ 40], and TCT-motif [ 41]. The others were only found in a specific promoter, e.g. the ACE [ 42] element was only in the promoter of  NaLOX, chs-CMA1a [ 43] in the promoter of  NaLIS, GA-motif [ 44] and I-box [ 45] in the promoter of  NaHPL. The promoter regions of these genes also contained numerous elements responsive tostress and/or phytohormones including JA, MeJA, SA and ABA, specifically: seven for  NaLIS, eight for  NaTPS38, 11 for  NaHPL and 13 for  NaLOX. Notably, the ABRE element (ACGTG/CACGTG/AACCCGG) involved in ABA regulation [ 46,  47] was specifically found in the  NaLIS, NaHPL and  NaLOX2 promotor regions, but not for  NaTPS38. This is consistent with ABA treatment enhancing ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate emissions and internal pools, and decreasing linalool internal pools, but not affecting ( E)-α-bergamotene (Fig.  3D). A single circadian element (CAAAGATATC, [ 48]) was identified for  NaLIS,  NaTPS38, and  NaLOX2, but not for  NaHPL. "," Background Timing is everything when it comes to the fitness outcome of a plant's ecological interactions, and accurate timing is particularly relevant for interactions with herbivores or mutualists that are based on ephemeral emissions of volatile organic compounds. Previous studies of the wild tobacco N. attenuata have found associations between the diurnal timing of volatile emissions, and daytime predation of herbivores by their natural enemies. Results Here, we investigated the role of light in regulating two biosynthetic groups of volatiles, terpenoids and green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which dominate the herbivore-induced bouquet of N. attenuata. Light deprivation strongly suppressed terpenoid emissions while enhancing GLV emissions, albeit with a time lag. Silencing the expression of photoreceptor genes did not alter terpenoid emission rhythms, but silencing expression of the phytochrome gene, NaPhyB1, disordered the emission of the GLV (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. External abscisic acid (ABA) treatments increased stomatal resistance, but did not truncate the emission of terpenoid volatiles (recovered in the headspace). However, ABA treatment enhanced GLV emissions and leaf internal pools (recovered from tissue), and reduced internal linalool pools. In contrast to the pattern of diurnal terpenoid emissions and nocturnal GLV emissions, transcripts of herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) biosynthetic genes peaked during the day. The promotor regions of these genes were populated with various cis-acting regulatory elements involved in light-, stress-, phytohormone- and circadian regulation. Conclusions This research provides insights into the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of HIPV bouquets, a mechanistic complexity which rivals the functional complexity of HIPVs, which includes repelling herbivores, calling for body guards, and attracting pollinators.","['herbivory', 'Light regulation', 'Hipvs', 'Terpenoid Volatiles', 'Glvs', 'Plant Diurnal Rhythms']","['Fig.', 'ABA treatment', 'ABA', 'GLV emissions', 'emissions Predation', 'emissions', 'emission', 'Geocoris spp.', 'GLV', 'Predation assays']","[PDMS, 22:00–6:00, 6:00–10:00, GLVs, 0.8–2.4 °C, ABA, NaPhyB2, NaPhyB1, NaPhyB2, NaCrypt2, phytochrome, ABA, MPK4, ABA, ABA, MPK4, ABA, MPK4, ABA, MPK4, ABA, ABA, MPK4, ABA, ABA, GLVs, phytohormone-, NaTPS38, G-box [, GT1-motif [ 40, TCT-motif [ 41], ACE [ 42], chs-CMA1a [ 43], GA-motif [ 44, I-box [ 45], tostress, JA, SA, ABA, ABRE element (, ABA, ABA, CAAAGATATC]","['NaTPS38', 'NaTPS38,', 'NaTPS38', 'NaTPS38,', 'NaTPS38.', 'NaTPS38,']",[],[],NaN
