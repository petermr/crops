1,1,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC1876254\eupmc_result.json,PMC1876254,"Results Identification of tomato terpene synthases 1 and 2 ( LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2) In order to identify tomato monoterpene synthases that are induced upon spider mite herbivory, we first queried tomato EST databases (www.tigr.org and www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) with known monoterpene synthase sequences from other plant species. Retrieved tomato EST sequences were used to design a primer specific for monoterpene synthases (Fig.  1). We then used cDNA derived from spider mite-infested plants, to amplify a single 850 bp fragment with this primer and an oligo dT(18) primer. This fragment was subsequently used as a probe to screen available tomato cDNA libraries. Two different full-length cDNAs were identified;  LeMTS1 (AY840091) was isolated from tomato leaves (sequence identical to the probe) and  LeMTS2 (AY840092) from tomato roots and stems. The  LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2 open reading frames encode proteins of 609 and 590 amino acids (Fig.  1), which have predicted masses of 70.8 and 68.6 kDa, respectively, and are 71% identical. LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 contain amino acid motifs conserved in angiosperm (mono)terpene synthases. These are, based on LeMTS1 amino acid positions: R(45)R(46)W(55), required for the initial diphosphate migration (Williams et al.  1998); D(362)D(363)D(366), required for binding of a Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ ion, which is used as cofactor (Cane et al.  1996; Starks et al.  1997); D(505)T(509)E(513), required for binding of a second Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ cofactor; and D(586) in the active site cleft (Schwab et al.  2001; Whittington et al.  2002). LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 contain both putative (predicted with TargetP; Emanuelsson et al.  2000) plastid targeting signal peptides, which should be processed in the region upstream of the conserved R(45)R(46) arginine pair.  Remarkably, LeMTS1 contains an extra sequence stretch of 22 amino acids starting at N170 (Fig.  1). This sequence is not found in any other terpene synthase, nor does it have homology to any protein in the NCBI database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Its presence can also not be explained by alternative splicing since the flanks do not contain canonical splice sites. This extra internal element is not an artefact of the isolated cDNA since it was present in four independent cDNAs isolated from different organs (data not shown). LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 belong to the TPSb subfamily of terpene synthases LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 are more similar to typical monoterpene synthases from, e.g., mint and citrus than to a typical tomato sesquiterpene synthase (Fig.  1). Based on protein sequence relatedness, LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 can be classified in the  TPSb subfamily (Fig.  2), a distinct group of angiosperm monoterpene synthases, according to the original classification proposed by Bohlmann et al. ( 1997). So, unlike the snapdragon ( Antirrhinum majus) monoterpene synthases from subfamily TPSg (Dudareva et al.  2003), including an Arabidopsis and a strawberry terpene synthase, the monoterpene synthases from the solanaceous family do not seem to form a new subfamily.  Terpene synthase activity of recombinant LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 Recombinant LeMTS1 and LeMTS2 proteins were produced in  Escherichia coli in order to characterize their enzymatic activities. The plastid targeting peptide was deleted up to one amino acid upstream of the RRX 8W motif (Fig.  1) to produce a His-tagged ‘pseudo-mature’ form of the proteins, since it has been reported that this can improve protein expression without affecting activity and product specificity of the enzymes (Bohlmann et al.  1999; Williams et al.  1998). The soluble protein fractions were assayed for terpene synthase activity and products were analyzed on a GC coupled to a Time Of Flight-MS. Using the monoterpene precursor geranyl diphosphate (GPP) as substrate, LeMTS1 generated only linalool whereas LeMTS2 generated several monoterpene products: β-phellandrene, β-myrcene, and sabinene (Fig.  3a). Mass spectra and relative retention indices (Adams  2001) or authentic standards confirmed the identification of terpene reaction products. Extracts of  E. coli cells expressing the empty vector control generated minor amounts of linalool (Fig.  3a) and occasionally geraniol. Thermally induced autoconversion or solvolysis of GPP to linalool has been observed before (Crowell et al.  2002; Jia et al.  1999), as well as conversion to geraniol by aspecific hydrolase or phosphatase activity in protein extracts (Crowell et al.  2002). However, LeMTS1 product levels are several hundred-fold higher than the background levels of the control (Fig.  3a).  Enantiomer separation on an enantiomer-selective column showed that LeMTS1 produced only ( R)-linalool (data not shown). LeMTS1 was also able to utilize the sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as substrate to produce ( E)-nerolidol (Fig.  3b), whereas LeMTS2 had no detectable sesquiterpene synthase activity. Both enzymes were unable to form terpene products from the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate. LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2 are differentially expressed in various plant organs We investigated the organ specificity of  LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2 expression in a mature (13 weeks old) tomato plant (Fig.  4a). Transcripts of  LeMTS1 were detected in young fruit, flower buds, petals, sepals, stems, petioles, and in young leaves. The expression pattern of  LeMTS2 was very different: no transcripts were detected in petals, sepals, and leaves. However,  LeMTS2 was expressed in roots.  For plants that contain glandular trichomes, monoterpene production is considered to be localized exclusively in these organs (Gershenzon et al.  1992; Iijima et al.  2004; Kutchan  2005; Turner et al.  1999; Turner and Croteau  2004). Tomato plants possess several types of trichomes including glandular trichomes that are present in high density on leaves, petioles, and stems and that contain terpenes (Maluf et al.  2001; Snyder and Carter  1985). Therefore, we investigated the location of  LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2 expression in trichomes of petioles and stems. This showed that  LeMTS1 is expressed in trichomes, whereas  LeMTS2 is expressed in the complementary tissue (Fig.  4b). LeMTS1 but not  LeMTS2 is induced by spider mite feeding, artificial wounding, and jasmonic acid To study whether  LeMTS1 and  LeMTS2 were induced upon spider mite feeding, changes in transcript levels of intact plants were analyzed by RT-PCR since  LeMTS gene-expression was too low to determine by RNA gel-blot analysis. Expression of  LeMTS1 was indeed induced in leaves by spider mite-feeding, but  LeMTS2, which expression was very low in leaves, was not (Fig.  5a). Spider mites damage plant tissue and induce JA- and SA-responsive genes such as a wound-induced proteinase inhibitor ( WIPI-II) and a pathogenesis related protein ( PRP6), respectively (Kant et al.  2004). Therefore, we investigated the effects of artificial wounding and exogenous application of JA and SA (Fig.  5a). Both artificial wounding and JA induced  LeMTS1. In contrast,  LeMTS2 was not induced by these treatments (Fig.  5a). SA-treatment induced the SA-marker  PRP6 but neither  LeMTS1 nor  LeMTS2 was increased. Induction of  LeMTS1 and  WIPI-II was validated by real-time Q-RT-PCR. This showed consistent and clear induction of both genes by JA, artificial wounding and spider mites, although there was large variation in the level of induction between independent experiments (Fig.  5b). We routinely used the tomato cultivar Moneymaker for our experiments. However, in our earlier work (Ament et al.  2004; Kant et al.  2004) the cultivar Castlemart (CM) was used because it has the same genetic background as the  defenseless1 ( def-1) mutant (Howe et al.  1996). Here, we show that spider mite- and JA-induced  LeMTS1 expression occurred both in CM and Moneymaker (Fig.  5b).  To investigate whether spider mite-induced expression of  LeMTS1 was dependent on JA or SA we made use of the  def-1 mutant, which is impaired in induced JA-accumulation (Howe et al.  1996) and the SA-deficient, transgenic  NahG tomato line (Brading et al.  2000). In plants with the  def-1 mutation,  LeMTS1 was not induced by spider mites, whereas the expression could be induced by exogenous JA (Fig.  6a). In contrast, the  NahG plants showed higher and clearly induced  LeMTS1 expression (Fig.  6b). This shows that induction of  LeMTS1 expression is dependent on JA but not on SA.  JA induces expression of  LeMTS1 in trichomes Since basal LeMTS1 expression in stems and petioles seemed to be restricted to trichomes (Fig.  4b), we addressed the question whether JA would induce expression of LeMTS1 solely in trichomes or also in other tissues. Indeed, JA-induced LeMTS1 expression was strongest in trichomes (Fig.  7). Interestingly, WIPI-II expression showed the opposite pattern. WIPI-II expression is very low in trichomes and basal as well as strongly induced WIPI-II expression occurred mainly in the complementary stem tissues.  Linalool accumulates in glandular trichomes and linalool emission is induced by wounding, jasmonic acid, and by ectopic  LeMTS1 overexpression Figure  4b showed that, in petioles and stems,  LeMTS1 was expressed specifically in the trichomes. Extraction of terpenes from the same tissues of that experiment demonstrated that linalool was produced predominantly in trichomes (Fig.  8). ( E)-nerolidol and β-phellandrene also accumulated in trichomes. Conversely, the volatile benzenoid methyl-salicylate was not produced in trichomes and was also clearly detected in roots, in contrast to most terpenes.  Because  LeMTS1 was induced by spider mite-infestation, wounding and JA, we investigated whether the emission of its in vitro products was induced concomitantly. Analysis of volatile production during 2 days of wounding or JA-treatment, conditions that induce  LeMTS1 expression (Fig.  5), revealed that plants emitted more linalool after both treatments (Fig.  9a), while nerolidol emission was not induced.  Next, we tried to overexpress the full length  LeMTS1 cDNA (including the putative targeting peptide) in tomato plants, under control of the CaMV 35S promoter. Four transformation experiments yielded only two transformants of which one overexpressed  LeMTS1. Compared to empty vector-transformed plants,  LeMTS1 overexpressing plants emitted several hundred-fold more linalool into the plants headspace (Fig.  9b), while emission of other terpenes, including nerolidol, did not differ significantly from control plants. This suggests that LeMTS1 functions in planta as a true linalool synthase.","Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) plants emit a blend of volatile organic compounds, which mainly consists of terpenes. Upon herbivory or wounding, the emission of several terpenes increases. We have identified and characterized the first two tomato monoterpene synthases, LeMTS1 and LeMTS2. Although these proteins were highly homologous, recombinant LeMTS1 protein produced (R)-linalool from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and (E)-nerolidol from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), while recombinant LeMTS2 produced beta-phellandrene, beta-myrcene, and sabinene from GPP. In addition, these genes were expressed in different tissues: LeMTS1 was expressed in flowers, young leaves, stems, and petioles, while LeMTS2 was strongest expressed in stems and roots. LeMTS1 expression in leaves was induced by spider mite-infestation, wounding and jasmonic acid (JA)-treatment, while LeMTS2 did not respond to these stimuli. The expression of LeMTS1 in stems and petioles was predominantly detected in trichomes and could be induced by JA. Because JA treatment strongly induced emission of linalool and overexpression of LeMTS1 in tomato resulted in increased production of linalool, we propose that LeMTS1 is a genuine linalool synthase. Our results underline the importance of trichomes in JA-induced terpene emission in tomato.",,"['Fig.', 'expression', 'induced', 'trichomes', 'monoterpene synthases', 'tomato EST', 'tomato', 'synthases', 'plants', 'synthase']","[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/, LeMTS2, D(362)D(363)D(366, Mg 2, Cane et al., D(505)T(509)E(513, Mg 2, D(586, LeMTS2, TargetP, LeMTS2, TPSb, LeMTS2, LeMTS2, LeMTS2, LeMTS2, Flight-MS, LeMTS2, Crowell et , hydrolase, Crowell et al., LeMTS2, mite-feeding, JA-, wound-induced proteinase inhibitor ( WIPI-II, PRP6, JA, SA (Fig.  , JA, JA-induced  LeMTS1, SA, JA, WIPI-II, WIPI-II, WIPI-II, E)-nerolidol, β-phellandrene, JA]","['TPSb', 'TPSb', 'TPSg']",[],[],terpene synthase
2,2,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC2459234\eupmc_result.json,PMC2459234,"Results Timing of egg parasitoid attraction to  P. sylvestris foliage Behavioral bioassays were conducted to study the parasitoid’s response to pine odor after different periods of time after sawfly egg deposition. The parasitic wasps showed a significantly positive response to odor from pine twigs laden with pine sawfly eggs for 72 h, thus confirming previous results (Hilker et al.  2002b,  2005; Mumm et al.  2003). However, at shorter (48 h) or longer (96 h) times after oviposition, the odor of pine twigs did not attract the parasitoids (Table  1). Cloning of sesquiterpene synthases from  P. sylvestris By the use of degenerate primers corresponding to conserved regions of known conifer sesquiterpene synthases and 5′-and 3′-RACE-PCR cloning strategies, three different cDNA clones containing open reading frames (ORFs) of terpene synthases were obtained from RNA isolated from oviposition-induced  P. sylvestris twigs (72 h after egg deposition). The clones were designated  PsTPS 1, 1,728 bp encoding an ORF of 576 amino acids;  PsTPS 2, 1,878 bp encoding an ORF of 626 amino acids, and  PsTPS 3, 1,743 bp encoding an ORF of 581 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequences of all three clones, when compared with other conifer terpene synthases, showed the two typical aspartate-rich DDxxD motifs which are involved in coordinating the bivalent metal ion for substrate binding (Bohlmann et al.  1999). In  PsTPS 1 and  PsTPS 2, an RR(x8)W motif was found near the N-terminus which might be important for catalysis (Pechous and Whitaker  2004). Furthermore, all three sequences show an RxR motif implicated in the complexation of the diphosphate function after ionization of the substrate, which prevents nucleophilic attack on any of the carbocationic intermediates formed subsequently (Starks et al.  1997). Analysis of the N-terminus of  PsTPS 2 suggested the presence of a 37-amino acid plastid transit peptide ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/) (Emanuelsson et al.  2000). Even though plastid targeting peptides are typical of plant monoterpene synthases (Bohlmann et al.  1998), the  PsTPS 2 sequence was most similar to those of sesquiterpene synthases (Fig.  1) when disregarding the putative signal peptide.  In summary, the three  P. sylvestris cDNAs showed greatest amino acid identity (60–80%) to three other conifer sesquiterpene synthases. In comparison with each other, the  P. sylvestris cDNAs had identities ranging from 60 to 65%, ignoring the signal peptide of  PsTPS 2 (Table  2).  Functional expression of  P. sylvestris sesquiterpene synthases The three  P. sylvestris sesquiterpene synthases were heterologously expressed in  E. coli, and the crude bacterial extracts containing recombinant protein were incubated with prenyl diphosphates. Product formation was observed for farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), but no terpenoid products were detected after incubation with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). Control bacterial extracts containing the empty vector control did not show any enzyme activity. PsTPS 1 formed only two main products: ( E)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, 76.3 and 23.7%, respectively, of total sesquiterpene peak area (Fig.  2a). No other terpenoid products were detectable.  For  PsTPS 2, assays were performed with the full ORF and with a construct in which the presumptive 37-amino acid plastid targeting sequence was removed. Both forms gave one major product from FPP, 1(10),5-germacradiene-4-ol (41.5% of total sesquiterpene peak area), and two minor products, β-elemene (19.2%) and bicyclogermacrene (13.2%). The detected β-elemene likely results from the heat-induced rearrangement of germacrene A during gas chromatography (de Kraker et al.  1998). In addition,  PsTPS 2 catalyzes the production of some products below 10% abundance, one of which was tentatively identified by its mass spectrum as α-amorphene (Fig.  2b). PsTPS 3 incubated with FPP produced longifolene as a main product with about 64.2% of total sesquiterpene peak area, α-longipinene in smaller amounts (11.2%), and three minor peaks tentatively identified as α-ylangene, longicyclene and longiborneol (Fig.  2c). None of the three expressed terpene synthases produced ( E)-β-farnesene, the terpene induced by  D. pini oviposition for which a specific role in egg parasitoid attraction had been documented in previous studies (Mumm et al.  2003; Mumm and Hilker  2005). The presence of sesquiterpene synthase products in pine needles Both pine needles 72 h after egg deposition and the artificially wounded tissue contained the major products of the cloned sesquiterpene synthases: ( E)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene (the main products of recombinant  PsTPS 1), β-elemene, bicyclogermacrene, and 1(10),5-germacradiene-4-ol (the major products of recombinant  PsTPS 2), and longifolene (the dominant product of recombinant  PsTPS 3). In oviposition-induced pine needles, the main products of  PsTPS 1 and  PsTPS 2 were slightly more accumulated (1.035 and 1.12 times more) when comparing with artificially wounded control samples (Fig.  3). The content of sesquiterpenes in artificially wounded needles used for calibration were 32 μg/g FW ± 3.2 β-elemene, 54 μg/g FW ± 4.8 ( E)-β-caryophyllene, 9.2 μg/g FW ± 1.1 α-humulene, 41 μg/g FW ± 5.3 bicyclogermacrene, and 205 μg/g FW ± 16 1(10),5-germacradiene-4-ol. Longifolene was detected only in traces.  The effect of oviposition on sesquiterpene synthase transcript levels Sawfly oviposition on pine significantly affected transcript levels of  PsTPS 1 and  PsTPS 2 when compared to artificially wounded pine. In contrast, no such significant treatment (oviposition) effect was detectable for  PsTPS 3 . Transcript levels of  PsTPS 1 and  PsTPS 2 also changed significantly over time with a striking increase 72 h after oviposition. In contrast, no such time effect was found for  PsTPS 3 (Fig.  4, Supplemental data Table S2). The results in Table  1 show that odor from  P. sylvestris twigs was significantly attractive to the egg parasitoid  C. ruforum only 72 h after  D. pini oviposition. At this time, steady state transcript levels of  PsTPS 1 and  PsTPS 2 were on average 1.9 fold and 2.6 fold higher, respectively, than those from non-attractive control twigs 72 h after artificial wounding (Fig.  4a, b). ","Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris; Pinaceae, Pinales) is known to defend against egg deposition by herbivorous sawflies by changing its terpenoid volatile blend. The oviposition-induced pine odor attracts egg parasitoids that kill the sawfly eggs. Here, we investigated whether sawfly egg deposition activates genes encoding pine terpene synthases by extracting mRNA from oviposition-induced P. sylvestris. Three new sesquiterpene synthases, PsTPS 1, PsTPS 2, and PsTPS 3, were isolated that were shown on heterologous expression in Escherichia coli to produce (E)-beta-caryophyllene and alpha-humulene (PsTPS 1), 1(10),5-germacradiene-4-ol (PsTPS 2), and longifolene and alpha-longipinene (PsTPS 3) as their principal products. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that transcript levels of PsTPS 1 and PsTPS 2 were significantly higher in oviposition-induced twigs that were attractive to the parasitoids than in non-attractive, artificially damaged twigs. Thus, our results demonstrate a specific transcription response to egg deposition, distinct from that caused by artificial wounding. Transcripts of PsTPS 3 did not change in response to egg deposition. The transcript levels of PsTPS 1, PsTPS 2, and PsTPS 3 were also determined in relation to time after egg deposition, since pine odor is attractive to the parasitoid only 72 h after egg deposition. Transcription rates of PsTPS 1 and PsTPS 2 were significantly enhanced only 72 h after egg deposition, thus matching the timing of odor attractiveness, while for PsTPS 3, enhanced transcription was not detected at any time period studied after egg deposition. The ecological significance of the oviposition-induced increase of sesquiterpene synthase transcripts is discussed.",,"['PsTPS', 'sesquiterpene synthases', 'foliage Behavioral', 'Behavioral bioassays', 'sesquiterpene', 'Fig.', 'synthases', 'products', 'Results Timing', 'recombinant PsTPS']","[5′-and 3′-RACE-PCR, RR(x8)W, 60–80, farnesyl diphosphate, geranyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPP, 37-amino acid, α-longipinene, Mumm, Mumm, μg/g FW ±, μg/g FW ±, μg/g FW ±, μg/g FW ±, μg/g FW ±]","['PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS', 'PsTPS']",['C.'],[],terpene synthase
8,8,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC2715020\eupmc_result.json,PMC2715020,"Results and discussion Identification of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases Sunflower capitate glandular trichomes were isolated in the biosynthetically active stage from anther appendages as previously described [ 36]. Degenerated primers for the conserved sequences of sesquiterpene synthases [ 43] were used in reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to retrieve partial sesquiterpene synthase sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two PCR fragments displayed high sequence similarity to other sesquiterpene synthase genes in the public database. The 3'- and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) led to the identification of two distinct full-length cDNAs. The mRNA for  HaTPS1 [GenBank:  DQ016667] showed a length of 1,913 bp, containing an ORF of 1,680 bp coding for 559 amino acids. The mRNA sequences for  HaTPS2 [GenBank:  DQ016668] showed a length of 1,944 bp with an ORF of 1,668 bp coding for 555 amino acids. Both genes encoded proteins with high similarity to germacrene A synthases from other plant species. The molecular weight of the enzymes was calculated to 64.4-kDa for  HaTPS1 and 64.2-kDa for  HaTPS2, falling into the typical mass range of plant sesquiterpene synthases [ 43- 45]. For further systematic classification of the identified sesquiterpene synthases, the genomic DNA (gDNA) sequences were obtained. PCR amplification of gDNA with specific primers for  HaTPS2 resulted in a single amplicon. The complete nucleotide sequence showed a length of 2,791 bp [GenBank:  EU443250]. In contrast to  HaTPS2, PCR amplification with primers for  HaTPS1 showed two gDNA fragments which differed in length. Sequencing of both products resulted in the identification of a third sesquiterpene synthase that showed 95% deduced amino acid identity to the  HaTPS1. Thus, the ORF of the  HaTPS1 and its close homolog was designated as  HaTPS1a and  HaTPS1b [GenBank:  EU327785], respectively. The gDNA sequences for  HaTPS1a/b consisted of highly similar exon structures but differed considerably in their intron length and sequence in particular for the intron 2 and 4 (Figure  1). The gDNA for  HaTPS1a showed a length of 2,826 bp [GenBank:  EU439590] while the gDNA for  HaTPS1b contained 3,312 bp [GenBank:  EU443249]. All three sunflower sesquiterpene synthase genes displayed an assembly of 7 exons and 6 introns, typical for class III terpene synthases [ 46]. They belong to the  TPSa-gene family [ 45], a group of genes mainly consisting of angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases [ 47]. The ORF size in  HaTPS1b was identical to  HaTPS1a (559 amino acids) with 95% sequence identity. The  HaTPS1a/b shared 63% amino acid identity with  HaTPS2 and shared 94% similarity to germacrene A synthases from Asteraceae like  Lactuca sativa ( LsLTC1 and  LsLTC2; [ 32]) or  Cichorium intybus ( CiGASlo [ 31]). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of  HaTPS2 with entries in public database showed 62% similarity to Asteraceae germacrene A synthases from lettuce or chicory but showed only about 40% identity to δ-cadinene synthases from  Gossypium arboretum and  G. hirsutum [ 48- 50]. The amino acid sequences of all three sesquiterpene synthases contained the common sequence motifs for the sesquiterpene synthase family [ 45], such as the highly conserved DDxxD and RxR motifs, responsible for the divalent metal ion-substrate binding (Figure  2). Functional characterization of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases  HaTPS2 (HaCS) For functional characterization, all three synthase genes were heterologously expressed in  E. coli as thioredoxin-fusion proteins. The  HaTPS2 fusion protein was purified through Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Figure  3a). The gas chromatograph mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis of the  in vitro enzyme assay products with substrate FDP showed the presence of the parental mass of sesquiterpene (m/z 204) but with a very low product yield (Figure  3b) which prevented the identification of conversion products. To solve this problem,  HaTPS2 was expressed heterologously  in vivo in  S. cerevisiae using high-copy plasmid pESC-Leu2d in the EPY300 strain which was previously engineered to synthesize copious amount of FDP from simple carbon source [ 51, 52]. The transgenes were induced by the addition of galactose to the medium, and non-volatile dodecane was overlaid on the culture to trap volatile sesquiterpene products. The GC-MS analysis of recombinant enzyme product showed a much higher product yield compared to the  in vitro assay (Figure  3), but the fragmentation pattern of the obtained products still did not allow unambiguous product identification. In this analysis, significant accumulation of farnesol was detected in the negative control (Figure  4, peak I) and in the products obtained by expression of  HaTPS2 in EPY300, indicating an incomplete conversion of FDP to sesquiterpenes. To improve the activity of the enzyme,  HaTPS2 was expressed as a thioredoxin-fusion protein (thioredoxin-HaTPS2, Figure  4) in EPY300, similar to the expression in  E. coli. This modification resulted in a notable increase of synthesized products without altering the overall product profile. Farnesol was completely absent in this  in vivo assay, indicating a complete conversion of FDP to sesquiterpenes probably due to the significantly enhanced  HaTPS2 activity. Products of  HaTPS2 were identified by comparison with the reference spectra in the NIST02 library and also with the authentic standards. One of the two main products was identified as δ-cadinene with α-muurolene, β-caryophyllene, α-humulene and α-copaene as minor products. This result characterized  HaTPS2 as an Asteraceae sesquiterpene synthase involved in the biosynthesis of mainly δ-cadinene and other minor sesquiterpenes (Figure  4), and hence it was named as  HaCS ( Helianthus annuus Cadinene Synthase). The second main product remained unidentified, but its fragmentation pattern (Figure  4, peak 7) showed high similarities to that of an authentic γ-cadinene standard, but differed slightly in the retention time indices (RIs). The RI of authentic γ-cadinene was 1519, whereas the RI of peak 7 was 1521. Spiking the yeast terpene products with the standard showed a fused, broader peak than the original peak 7 or γ-cadinene standard, indicating that peak 7 is not γ-cadinene (data not shown). Comparison of this fragmentation pattern with that of δ-cadinene and γ-cadinene indicates that this so far unidentified compound is also a product with a cadinene skeleton, but its chemical identity remains unknown. The fragmentation patterns of peaks 4 and 5 were very similar to each other (Figure  4) and both showed high similarities to the fragmentation pattern of γ-gurjunene from the NIST02 library. Multiproduct terpene synthases are known from different plant families. For example, γ-humulene synthase and δ-selinene synthase from  Abies grandies produce 52 and 34 products, respectively, from the FDP [ 53]. Within Asteraceae, only the epi-cedrol synthase from  Artemisia annua [ 42] has been described to produce more than one product in significant amount. The only other two sesquiterpene synthases producing sesquiterpenes with the cadinene skeleton were found in  Gossypium hirsutum and  G. arboretum [ 48, 49, 54, 55]. GC-MS analysis of pentane extracts from isolated glandular trichomes showed small amounts of sesquiterpenes. Peaks representing α-copaene, β-caryophyllene, δ-cadinene and the unidentified compounds 7 and 9 (Figure  4) were detected. SPME headspace-analysis of sunflower volatiles showed a whole bouquet of different mono- and sesquiterpenes. Again sesquiterpenes produced by  HaCS were detected, this time in larger amounts (data not shown). These results are in accordance with the report from Schuh et al. [ 56] where β-caryophyllene and α-humulene were detected as volatile emissions from  H. annuus. Besides the compounds produced from  HaCS, several other sesquiterpenes were detected in the headspace experiments, indicating the activity of yet unidentified terpene synthases in sunflower. Generally, terpene synthases form a large gene family [ 47, 57], and hence it is evident that more terpene synthases are expressed in different sunflower tissues or still remained unidentified in glandular trichomes. Functional identification of  HaTPS1a and  HaTPS1b as germacrene A synthases ( HaGAS) HaTPS1a and  HaTPS1b were expressed as thioredoxin fusion proteins in  E. coli to produce soluble protein.  In vitro enzyme assays with purified enzyme showed a single product with the expected mass of m/z 204 in the GC-MS measurements (Figure  5a). A peak with the same retention time and fragmentation pattern was observed by the analysis of a germacrene A standard, produced by the expression of the previously characterized germacrene A synthase  LsLTC2 from  Lactuca sativa [ 32]. The identity of the peak from the  in vitro assays was determined as β-elemene by an authentic standard. β-elemene is the known cope-rearrangement product of germacrene A due to the hot injection port temperature for GC measurements [ 29, 32]. Thus, the  HaTPS1a and  HaTPS1b were named as  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2, respectively. The performance of both sunflower germacrene A synthases was tested  in vivo by expression in yeast and for comparison of the product spectra between  in vitro and  in vivo expression.  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2 were cloned into the pESC-Leu2d plasmid and used to transform  S. cerevisiae EPY300. To produce the germacrene A reference standard, a previously characterized germacrene A synthase from  Lactuca sativa ( LsLTC2 [ 32]) was also cloned and expressed under the same conditions. GC-MS analyses of these products showed two identical peaks for all three germacrene A synthases (Figure  5b). The earlier eluting peak was identified as β-elemene, whereas the later peak represented germacrene A, as it showed identical fragmentation pattern to the literature data and terpene products from reference gene (i.e.  LsLTC2) [ 29, 31, 32]. In contrast to the GC-MS measurements of the  in vitro assays, germacrene A produced from  in vivo assays was not completely converted to β-elemene. The complete rearrangement of germacrene A to β-elemene depicted in Figure  5a is likely due to the high injection port temperature used (280°C for Figure  5a versus 250°C for Figure  5b). These results showed that  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2 are germacrene A synthases, which catalyze the first committed reaction for sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis in sunflower. In contrast to  HaCS, both germacrene A synthases are single product enzymes. Biochemical characterization of sunflower germacrene A synthases To obtain native HaGAS1 and HaGAS2 enzymes, the  E. coli-expressed fusion proteins were digested with enterokinase and further purified to remove the thioredoxin and the enterokinase before biochemical characterization. SDS-PAGE showed nearly homogeneous proteins. For determination of the influence of the thioredoxin fusion part on the biochemical properties of HaGAS1, thioredoxin-HaGAS1 fusion protein was also characterized. HaCS did not show reproducible results  in vitro and its biochemical properties were not determined. Measured pH-optima were 7.4 for thioredoxin-HaGAS1, 7.7 for native HaGAS1 and 7.5 for native HaGAS2. Apparent  Km values for FPP were calculated as 0.82 μM for HaGAS1, 1.06 μM for thioredoxin-HaGAS1 and 0.74 μM for HaGAS2, indicating a similar range like previously reported for sesquiterpene synthases [ 58, 59]. These results indicate that the fused thioredoxin protein part has only minor effects on the properties and catalytic activity of HaGAS1. In contrast to thioredoxin-HaGAS1 and native HaGAS1, HaGAS2 showed substrate inhibition characteristics; because the activity decreased with substrate concentrations above 2.5 μM. Substrate inhibition has also been reported for monoterpene synthases from  Citrus limon [ 60]. Tissue-specific expression of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases In order to assess the relative transcript level of sesquiterpene synthase, semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiments were carried out using cDNA templates from roots, stem, cotyledons, young and old leaves, ray flowers, and trichomes (Figure  6a). The transcript level for farnesyl diphosphate synthase ( FDPS) was also analyzed as this enzyme provides the substrate farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) for the sesquiterpene synthases. It could be shown that  FDPS was expressed in all tissues observed, but was upregulated in those tissues where expression of sesquiterpene synthase genes was detected at highest level (Figures  6,  7,  8). Due to very high sequence similarity, the transcripts for  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2 could not be distinguished in the RT-PCR analyses. Therefore, PCR products for  HaGAS represent the transcripts from both germacrene A synthase genes. The  FDPS was detectable with different expression intensity in all organs except for cotyledons.  HaGAS and the  HaCS showed a much more differentiated expression. Transcripts of all three genes were traceable in roots and young leaves, but in contrast to  HaGAS,  HaCS was not expressed in old leaves. The strongest expression of all three genes was detected in capitate glandular trichomes. These results showed the predominant expression of sunflower sesquiterpene synthase genes in the highly specialized trichome stalk cells. As the transcript for  FDPS was also detectable in RNA samples from these secretory cells, it is predicted that the whole biosynthetic pathway from the precursor molecules to the secreted STL is located in the sunflower trichomes. Transcripts detected in the leaf samples are likely to show the expression of the sesquiterpene synthase genes in trichomes located on the leaf epidermis. The expression of the sesquiterpene synthase genes in young roots, even though low in comparison to the expression in trichomes, showed that both  HaGAS1/2 and  HaCS were not exclusively expressed in the aerial parts of the sunflower. These results were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR experiments (Figure  8). Expression of terpene synthases in roots has been described for many plant species and seems to be a common biosynthetic process in plants [ 57, 58, 61- 63]. As the  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2 were not distinguishable by PCR, a restriction digestion was performed to confirm the expression of both genes. The full-length cDNA of both synthases was amplified from root and trichome cDNA with the same primer pair, and their amplicons were subjected to the differential restriction enzyme digestion. The restriction enzyme  DraI was identified to cut only  HaGAS1 but not  HaGAS2,  PauI cut HaGAS2 but not  HaGAS. Gel separation of the digested products clearly demonstrated the expression of both germacrene A synthases in roots and trichomes (Figure  6b). Two lettuce germacrene A synthases were induced in cotyledons by infection with the downy mildew pathogen  Bremia lactucae [ 32]. In contrast, inoculation of sunflower seedlings with  Plasmopara halstedii [ 64], the sunflower downy mildew pathogen, did not induce the expression of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases in cotyledons or stem and did not have influence on the expression intensity in roots (data not shown). This indicates that expression of these genes is tightly regulated by the developmental program of the trichome secretory cells and is not induced by the infection with these pathogens. Developmentally regulated expression of sesquiterpene synthase genes in sunflower capitate glandular trichomes The low density of glandular trichomes and the early termination of the secretory active phase in young leaf stages complicate the isolation of biosynthetically active trichomes from sunflower leaves. However, trichomes from the anther appendages provided an excellent alternative to study developmental gene expression along the trichome development [ 38]. Using glands from disk florets of different ages, trichome RNA could be isolated from the pre-secretory to post-secretory stage as previously described [ 36]. In order to assess transcriptionally active stages of sunflower trichome cells, semi-quantitative RT-PCR experiments were performed to amplify  HaGAS,  HaCS, and  FDPS (Figure  7). While  FDPS was expressed with the same level in all but the last trichome stage,  HaGAS and  HaCS were highly regulated and expressed only during the active secretory phase of the capitate glandular trichomes. Real-Time RT-PCR data indicated that the combined expression level of  HaGAS1 and  HaGAS2 seems to be significant higher than that of  HaCS (Figure  8). A stage-specific expression of terpene synthase genes during trichome development has not been reported before. These semi-quantitative RT-PCR results are in line with the biosynthetically active phases of sunflower trichomes determined by microscopic observations of fluorescent flavones in trichomes and HPLC-measurements of STL content [ 36, 38]."," Background Sesquiterpene lactones are characteristic metabolites of Asteraceae (or Compositae) which often display potent bioactivities and are sequestered in specialized organs such as laticifers, resin ducts, and trichomes. For characterization of sunflower sesquiterpene synthases we employed a simple method to isolate pure trichomes from anther appendages which facilitated the identification of these genes and investigation of their enzymatic functions and expression patterns during trichome development. Results Glandular trichomes of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) were isolated, and their RNA was extracted to investigate the initial steps of sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments led to the identification of three sesquiterpene synthases. By combination of in vitro and in vivo characterization of sesquiterpene synthase gene products in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively, two enzymes were identified as germacrene A synthases, the key enzymes of sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis. Due to the very low in vitro activity, the third enzyme was expressed in vivo in yeast as a thioredoxin-fusion protein for functional characterization. In in vivo assays, it was identified as a multiproduct enzyme with the volatile sesquiterpene hydrocarbon delta-cadinene as one of the two main products with alpha-muuorlene, beta-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene and alpha-copaene as minor products. The second main compound remained unidentified. For expression studies, glandular trichomes from the anther appendages of sunflower florets were isolated in particular developmental stages from the pre- to the post-secretory phase. All three sesquiterpene synthases were solely upregulated during the biosynthetically active stages of the trichomes. Expression in different aerial plant parts coincided with occurrence and maturity of trichomes. Young roots with root hairs showed expression of the sesquiterpene synthase genes as well. Conclusion This study functionally identified sesquiterpene synthase genes predominantly expressed in sunflower trichomes. Evidence for the transcriptional regulation of sesquiterpene synthase genes in trichome cells suggest a potential use for these specialized cells for the identification of further genes involved in the biosynthesis, transport, and regulation of sesquiterpene lactones.",,"['sesquiterpene synthases', 'synthases', 'Figure', 'synthase genes', 'synthase', 'sesquiterpene', 'showed', 'expression', 'sunflower sesquiterpene', 'sunflower']","[64.4-kDa, 64.2-kDa, homolog, sunflower sesquiterpene synthase, class III terpene, LsLTC1, metal ion-substrate binding (, HaCS, thioredoxin-fusion, Ni-NTA, FDP, high-copy, FDP, EPY300, FDP, thioredoxin-HaTPS2, FDP, NIST02, α-copaene, RI, RI, δ-cadinene, NIST02, FDP [, epi-cedrol synthase, 9, thioredoxin fusion proteins, sativa [ 32], β-elemene, cope-rearrangement, β-elemene, sunflower germacrene A, HaGAS1, HaGAS2 enzymes, enterokinase, thioredoxin, thioredoxin, HaGAS1, thioredoxin-HaGAS1, thioredoxin-HaGAS1, HaGAS2, HaGAS1, μM, thioredoxin-HaGAS1, μM, HaGAS2, thioredoxin protein part, HaGAS1, HaGAS1, HaGAS2, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, FDP, germacrene A synthase, sunflower sesquiterpene synthase, HaGAS2, sunflower downy mildew, post-secretory, HPLC-measurements]","['HaTPS1', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS1', 'HaTPS2,', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2,', 'HaTPS1', 'HaTPS1.', 'HaTPS1', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1b', 'HaTPS1a/b', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1b', 'TPSa-gene', 'HaTPS1b', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1a/b', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', '(thioredoxin-HaTPS2,', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS2', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1b', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1b', 'HaTPS1a', 'HaTPS1b']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
11,11,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC3295389\eupmc_result.json,PMC3295389,"Results Volatile emission and accumulation in  A. chinensis flowers The emission of floral terpenes by  A. chinensis was investigated using a combination of dynamic headspace sampling and solvent extraction followed by GC-MS analysis. Volatile sampling, which was carried out over the course of a 24 h day/night cycle, revealed a mixture of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and various terpene derivatives to be present in the headspace of the flowers ( Table 1). ( E)-nerolidol emission, calculated on a ng (g fresh weight) −1 h −1 (gFW −1 h −1) basis over a day/night cycle, constituted ∼30% of the total emitted terpenes and was produced at an average rate of 7.5 ng gFW −1 h −1. The ( E, E)-α-farnesene oxidation product, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one ( Anet, 1972), was the second most prevalent terpene compound, with an emission rate of ∼4.18 ng gFW −1 h −1, while ( E, E)-α-farnesene emission was the next highest, at ∼1.15 ng gFW −1 h −1. Lower amounts of the terpene metabolites ( E)- and ( Z)-geranyl acetone and 4,8-dimethyl −1,3,7-nonatriene, which were assumed to be oxidative degradation products of ( E)-nerolidol ( Donath and Boland, 1995;  Boland   et al., 1998 ), were also present. The emission profiles for the main floral sesquiterpenes ( Fig. 1) showed that peak ( E)-nerolidol emission occurred at midnight (0:00 h) then declined over the next 8 h where it remained low until evening. Although there was a suggestion of smaller day-time ( E)-nerolidol emission peak at 16:00 h, the emission rates between noon and 20:00 h were not significantly different. The emission profile for ( E, E)-α-farnesene and its oxidation product 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one remained relatively constant, although levels did appear to gradually decline from midnight onwards. Generally, the concentrations of the different monoterpenes ( Supplementary Fig. S1) were low (< 3 ng gFW −1 h −1) and showed little variation over the course of the day/night cycle, although cumulative amounts of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (predominantly ( E)-nerolidol) were similar ( Table 1). Solvent extractions of flowers taken at the equivalent time points to the above headspace analysis were analysed for the presence of accumulated volatiles. In contrast to the emitted volatiles, the profile of accumulated volatiles was significantly less complex and primarily consisted of sesquiterpenes ( Table 2). On a whole-flower fresh-weight basis, the dephosphorylated FDP derivative ( E, E)-farnesol was by far the most prevalent compound occurring at ∼18,700 ng gFW −1, or ∼72%, of the total extracted terpene volatiles. The accumulated terpenes, presumed to be produced by TPS enzymes, were dominated by linalool and ( E)-nerolidol, with ∼1500 and ∼890 ng gFW −1 respectively. Time point analysis of these terpenes ( Fig. 2) showed that ( E, E)-farnesol and ( E)-nerolidol were largely accumulated during the day, with peak concentrations occurring at noon. Notably, the highest concentrations of accumulated ( E)-nerolidol corresponded to the lowest rate of emitted ( E)-nerolidol and  vice versa, while linalool accumulation remained relatively constant over the course of the day/night cycle. Volatile glycosylation in  A. chinensis flowers Differences in the accumulation and emission patterns for ( E)-nerolidol and ( E, E)-farnesol in  A. chinensis flowers suggested that these compounds might be sequestered in non-volatile glycosylated form for later release. Floral glycosides were extracted from  A. chinensis and analysed by GC-MS after enzymatic hydrolysis ( Fig. 3). This analysis showed that glycosylated forms of ( E)-nerolidol, ( E, E)-farnesol, and linalool were present in the flowers, as well as high levels of glycosylated 8-hydroxylinalool. Glycosylated ( E)-nerolidol was detected at midnight, at ∼290 ng gFW −1 (or ∼44% of the total ( E)-nerolidol pool), and increased to 340 ng gFW −1 at noon (although this level now only equated to ∼12% of the total ( E)-nerolidol pool). There was no glycosylated ( E)-nerolidol detected following the period of peak ( E)-nerolidol accumulation at noon ( Fig. 2), suggesting that between noon and 16:00 h the sequestered ( E)-nerolidol had been remobilized and released from the flower. The pattern of ( E, E)-farnesol glycosylation ( Fig. 3B) was similar to that of ( E)-nerolidol, although it only comprised a minor component (∼0.1–6%) of the total ( E, E)-farnesol pool. Glycosylated linalool accounted for between ∼2.5% and 6.5% of the total linalool pool with peak accumulation occurring between midnight and noon. Unexpectedly, 8-hydroxylinalool ( Fig. 3C), was by far the most predominant  A. chinensis glycosylated floral terpene, with levels declining from ∼87% (∼11,300 ng gFW −1) of the total linalool pool at midnight to 62 % (∼2600 ng gFW −1) at 20:00 h. Identification of terpene synthase-like sequences from  A. chinensis flowers A homology-based gene mining approach was taken to identify putative TPS enzymes that could account for the production of the terpene compounds identified in  A. chinensis flowers. A search of an  Actinidia expressed sequence tag database ( Crowhurst   et al., 2008 ) identified a single contig from floral tissue with sequence homology to known floral TPS sequences ( Supplementary Fig. S2). This transcript represented a full-length cDNA (termed AcNES1) of 1978 nucleotides encoding a predicted protein of 573 amino acids and ∼65.4 kDa. AcNES1 was not predicted to contain a plastid-targeting peptide according to the ChloroP and TargetP prediction programmes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AcNES1 clustered in a well-supported manner with the TPS enzymes in the TPS-g subgroup ( Bohlmann   et al., 1998 ;  Dudareva   et al., 2003 ) ( Fig. 4). The TPS-g enzymes are characterized by the absence of an N-terminal RRX 8W motif, which is reported to be essential for cyclic monoterpene production in the angiosperm TPS-b and gymnosperm TPS-d enzyme subgroups ( Savage   et al., 1994 ). AcNES1 was most similar to the  Actinidia polygama and  A. arguta linalool synthases ( Chen   et al., 2010 ), with ∼78% amino acid identity. Enzymatic properties of AcNES1 Purified recombinant AcNES1 protein was analysed for activity with GDP and FDP precursors in separate solvent extraction assays ( Fig. 5). GC-MS analysis of the pentane/Et 2O extracted volatiles showed that AcNES1 could catalyse the conversion of both FDP and GDP precursors to the respective terpene alcohols ( E)-nerolidol and linalool. The smaller amount of ( Z)-nerolidol produced by AcNES1 was assumed to derive from ( Z,E)-FDP contamination of the ( E, E)-FDP used. Kinetic evaluation of recombinant AcNES1 enzyme ( Table 3) showed that it had a higher binding affinity for FDP compared with GDP ( Km values of 0.80 and 1.89 μM respectively) and an approximate four-fold increase in catalytic efficiency ( kcat/ Km) in the presence of FDP (300 s −1 mM −1) compared with GDP (69 s −1 mM −1) . AcNES1 also showed an approximate 8-fold increase in its affinity for Mn 2+ ( Km ≈ 14.2 μM compared with Mg 2+ ( Km ≈ 117 μM) as the divalent metal cofactor. However, in the presence of Mn 2+ AcNES1, activity was only ∼22% of that observed with FDP and Mg 2+ together and ∼54% of that observed with GDP and Mg 2+ together. The kinetics for substrate and divalent metal ion preference are similar to those observed for other TPS-g enzymes ( Nagegowda   et al., 2008 ;  Chen   et al., 2010 ). Enantiomeric analysis of terpene compounds from AcNES1 and  A. chinensis flowers Enantioselective GC-MS analysis of ( E)-nerolidol and linalool produced by AcNES1 determined that ( S)-( E)-nerolidol and ( S)-linalool ( Fig. 6) were the predominant enantiomers. AcNES1 was also observed to produce ( S)-linalool ( Fig. 6F) from racemic LDP, while the small amount of ( R)-linalool observed was assumed to have derived from LDP breakdown. This assumption was based on the fact that other racemic monoterpene products were seen in this analysis (data not shown). Equivalent analysis of an  A. chinensis whole-flower extract ( Fig. 6D) also showed that ( S)-( E)-nerolidol was the predominant enantiomer and hence supports the assumption that AcNES1 is likely to be responsible for floral ( S)-( E)-nerolidol biosynthesis in  A. chinensis. In contrast to the ( S)-linalool produced by AcNES1, the predominant linalool enantiomer in  A. chinensis flowers, as previously shown by  Matich   et al. (2010)  was ( R)-linalool. Alternative substrate usage by AcNES1 The sequence homology of AcNES1 to TPS-g nerolidol/linalool and linalool/nerolidol/geranyllinalool synthases from grape ( Martin   et al., 2010 ) provided a rational basis for testing additional prenyldiphosphate substrates ranging from C5 to C20. This analysis (summarized in  Table 4) showed that AcNES1 was able to catalyse the conversion of GGDP (C20) to the corresponding terpene alcohol geranyllinalool at ∼10% of the optimized rate for ( E)-nerolidol from FDP but was unable to convert the C5 hemiterpene (isoprene) precursor DMADP to its corresponding alcohol. This  in vitro plasticity for GDP, FDP and GGDP prenyldiphosphate usage in AcNES1 is mirrored in the activity of the three grape TPS-g sesqui-TPS enzymes ( Martin   et al., 2010 ) and again demonstrates an inherent capacity for TPS enzymes to evolve different product and substrate specificities. Gene expression analysis Relative gene expression analysis was carried out to investigate the spatial and temporal regulation patterns of  AcNES1 expression in  A. chinensis ( Fig. 7). The highest  AcNES1 expression was observed in the petals of fully open flowers, with lower expression in the stamens and pistils ( Fig. 7A).  AcNES1 expression was not observed in unopened flowers. Over the course of a day/night cycle,  AcNES1 expression followed a weak diurnal rhythm with peak expression levels occurring between 20:00–0:00 h and 8:00–12:00 h ( Fig. 7B). Gene expression analysis was also carried out to determine how genes in the MVA pathway might modulate FDP flux and consequently sesquiterpene emission and/or accumulation in  A. chinensis flowers ( Fig. 8). The profiles of three family members encoding the key regulatory enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) ( Maurey   et al., 1986 ;  Gondet   et al., 1992 ;  Hemmerlin   et al., 2003 ;  Hey   et al., 2006 ;  Muñoz-Bertomeu   et al., 2007 ) and the mevalonate-5-diphosphate decarboxylase gene ( MDC) peaked in expression at 08:00 h. This peak in expression preceded maximal ( E, E)-farnesol and ( E)-nerolidol accumulation at noon ( Fig. 2), and suggests a link between FDP substrate flux and sesquiterpene accumulation in  A. chinensis flowers. Interestingly, the reduction of floral  HMGR gene expression between 08:00 h and noon also coincided with increasing ( E, E)-farnesol concentrations ( Figs. 8 and  2, respectively). Expression analysis for the other MVA genes ( Fig. 8) showed that peak expression for the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase ( HMGS), phosphomevalonate kinase ( PMK), and isopentenyldiphosphate isomerase ( IDPI) genes all occurred at 20:00 h. Subcellular localization and in planta activity of AcNES1 The subcellular localization of AcNES1 was investigated using an AcNES1-GFP fusion protein in  Arabidopsis protoplasts . Confocal laser scanning microscopy ( Fig. 9) revealed a diffuse GFP fluorescence pattern for AcNES1-GFP protein distribution exclusively present in the cytosol. Similar fluorescence patterns were observed for a control GFP expression product, while no fluorescence was observed in untransfected protoplasts. These results are in agreement with the lack of a predicted AcNES1 plastid-targeting signal (ChloroP) and confirm that this enzyme is located in the cytosol. A. tumefaciens-mediated transient expression ( Hellens   et al., 2005 ) in  Nicotiana benthamiana leaves was used to confirm that AcNES1 acted as a ( E)-nerolidol synthase  in planta.  N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with a CaMV 35S-driven binary  AcNES1 vector construct produced significant amounts of nerolidol ( Fig. 10). ( E)-nerolidol was not produced in control  N. benthamiana leaves that had been infiltrated with buffer or a GUS-containing binary vector. Small amounts of linalool were also identified in both the control and  AcNES1 infiltrated leaves and were therefore assumed to be derived from an endogenous linalool synthase.","Flowers of the kiwifruit species Actinidia chinensis produce a mixture of sesquiterpenes derived from farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) and monoterpenes derived from geranyl diphosphate (GDP). The tertiary sesquiterpene alcohol (E)-nerolidol was the major emitted volatile detected by headspace analysis. Contrastingly, in solvent extracts of the flowers, unusually high amounts of (E,E)-farnesol were observed, as well as lesser amounts of (E)-nerolidol, various farnesol and farnesal isomers, and linalool. Using a genomics-based approach, a single gene (AcNES1) was identified in an A. chinensis expressed sequence tag library that had significant homology to known floral terpene synthase enzymes. In vitro characterization of recombinant AcNES1 revealed it was an enzyme that could catalyse the conversion of FDP and GDP to the respective (E)-nerolidol and linalool terpene alcohols. Enantiomeric analysis of both AcNES1 products in vitro and floral terpenes in planta showed that (S)-(E)-nerolidol was the predominant enantiomer. Real-time PCR analysis indicated peak expression of AcNES1 correlated with peak (E)-nerolidol, but not linalool accumulation in flowers. This result, together with subcellular protein localization to the cytoplasm, indicated that AcNES1 was acting as a (S)-(E)-nerolidol synthase in A. chinensis flowers. The synthesis of high (E,E)-farnesol levels appears to compete for the available pool of FDP utilized by AcNES1 for sesquiterpene biosynthesis and hence strongly influences the accumulation and emission of (E)-nerolidol in A. chinensis flowers.",,"['Fig.', 'nerolidol', 'chinensis flowers', 'linalool', 'FDP', 'chinensis', 'expression', 'analysis', 'emission', 'flowers']","[E)-nerolidol, −1, −1, −1, E)-α-farnesene, −1, −1, E)-, Z)-geranyl acetone, 4,8-dimethyl −1,3,7-nonatriene, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E, E)-α-farnesene, −1, E)-nerolidol, FDP, E, E)-farnesol, ∼72, TPS enzymes, E)-nerolidol, ∼1500, ∼890, E, E)-farnesol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E, E)-farnesol, E)-nerolidol, E, E)-farnesol, E)-nerolidol, ∼290, ∼44, E)-nerolidol, −1, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E)-nerolidol, E, E)-farnesol, E)-nerolidol, ∼0.1–6, E)-farnesol, ∼2.5, glycosylated floral terpene, ∼87, ∼11,300, ∼2600, ∼65.4 kDa, TargetP, TPS-g enzymes, ∼78, FDP, pentane/Et 2O, FDP, E)-nerolidol, Z)-nerolidol, E)-FDP, E, E)-FDP, FDP, FDP (, −1, −1, −1, −1, Mn 2, ≈, μM, Mg 2+, ≈ 117 μM, Mn 2+ AcNES1, ∼22, FDP, Mg 2, ∼54, Mg 2, TPS-g enzymes ( Nagegowda   , E)-nerolidol, S)-, E)-nerolidol, S)-linalool ( Fig. 6, S)-linalool (, S)-, E)-nerolidol, S)-, E)-nerolidol, S)-linalool, TPS-g nerolidol/linalool, linalool/nerolidol/geranyllinalool, C20, GGDP, ∼10, E)-nerolidol, FDP, FDP, TPS-g sesqui-TPS enzymes, 20:00–0:00, 8:00–12:00, FDP, HMG-CoA reductase, Maurey   , mevalonate-5-diphosphate decarboxylase, E)-farnesol, E)-nerolidol, FDP, E, E)-farnesol, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, HMGS, phosphomevalonate kinase, isopentenyldiphosphate isomerase, AcNES1-GFP, GFP, AcNES1-GFP, GFP, A., E)-nerolidol synthase  , E)-nerolidol]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-d', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-g', 'sesqui-TPS', 'TPS']",[],[],terpene synthase
15,15,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC3614522\eupmc_result.json,PMC3614522,"Results and Discussion Phenotypic and metabolic characterization of grape berries Grape berries were sampled at four developmental stages according to EL system  [4] during 2008 growing season. The staging took into account the berry weight and the content of the main anthocyanins, organic acids and sugars ( Fig.s 1,  2). The developmental stages investigated in this study were identified as EL 32 characterized by small hard green berries accumulating organic acids, EL 35 corresponding to  véraison, EL 36 involving sugar and anthocyanin accumulation, and active growth due to cell enlargement and EL 38 corresponding to harvest time. The date of  véraison was set at approximately 9 weeks post-flowering for each of the three varieties. Metabolic profiling of grapes was carried out using a GC-EI-TOF/MS platform that enabled the relative quantification of several classes of compounds such as fatty acids, phenylpropanoids and sugars among the polar compounds ( Table 1,  File S1). Additional metabolic profiling was achieved using a headspace GC-EI-MS platform for the relative quantification of volatiles. In what concerns amino acids, few could be quantified since the conditions used favored the identification of secondary metabolites. Homoserine and pyroglutamic acid which includes glutamine and glutamic acid were the amino acids identified ( Table 1). Specific chromatogram ion peaks were selected for relative quantification (based on peak height) of certain metabolites during ripening as shown in  Fig. 2. Regarding berry weight corresponding to ripe and harvest stages, Aragonês tends to present bigger berries, followed by Trincadeira and then Touriga Nacional. This implies that berries of Touriga Nacional contain a higher amount of skin per berry which may be related to the increased content in anthocyanins observed for this variety ( Fig.1). The higher weight observed in Aragonês berries may also be partially responsible for higher content in fructose and glucose ( Fig. 2) since these compounds accumulate preferentially in the pulp. To confirm if these and other metabolites were present in significantly different amounts during ripening Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon Rank sum tests were performed using ion peak responses ( File S2). For the multiple comparisons the Benjamini & Hochberg correction was the most adequate. These tests showed that the majority of the metabolites (77, 69%) exhibited a different content either comparing among developmental stages or among varieties. These ion peak responses were also used for Multivariate Data Analysis using the unsupervised method of Independent Principal Component analysis (ICA). A good discrimination was obtained between pre-  véraison/ véraison and post- véraison stages for all the varieties and both analysis of volatiles and polar metabolites ( Fig. 3). However, the developmental stages of EL 32 and EL 35 ( véraison) were only separated according to the polar metabolite fractions while samples corresponding to EL 36 and EL 38 clustered together in both types of analysis (though some degree of discrimination could be observed for polar metabolites). Regarding volatiles stages EL 35 and EL 32 were separated from EL 36 and EL 38 by two independent components accounting for 41.99% of variance. In what concerns polar metabolites the same discrimination accounted for 58.94% of variance. Trincadeira tends to cluster more independently of the other varieties as it has been previously observed using a NMR platform for metabolic profiling  [13]. The heat map showed that the metabolites have a differential accumulation during berry development and ripening ( Fig. 4). Some alcohols and aldehydes such as ethanol, (E)-2-hexenal and heptanal reached the highest levels in ripe and harvest stage of fruits, and contributed to the formation of aroma. The same holds true for sugars and many fatty acids. Organic acids tend to decrease during ripening in all varieties, though exhibiting a high degree of variance among them. Phosphoric acid was an exception since it increased at harvest stage in all varieties. Phenylpropanoids and flavonoids may also decrease or increase during ripening. Microarray, functional categorization of Unigenes and RT-qPCR The mRNA expression profiles of two time points (EL35 and EL36) during 2008 season were compared using the Affymetrix GrapeGen® genome array containing 23096 probesets corresponding to 18711 unique sequences. Testing was performed using biological triplicates for each time point. After performing a Bayes t-statistics from the linear models for microarray data (limma) for differential expression analysis, P-values were corrected for multiple-testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg's method  [14]. The total number of probesets that were differentially expressed at least in one variety (fold change ≥1.5 and FDR <0.05 or fold change ≤−.1.5 and FDR<0.05.) was 8696 corresponding to 37.65% of the total probesets represented in the chip ( File S3). From these, a common gene set of 2255 probesets were differentially expressed in all the three studied varieties, whereas 1282 and 954 probesets were down- and up- regulated, respectively ( Table 2,  File S3). The remaining 19 were either up- or down-regulated in the three varieties. The common set of modulated transcripts corresponds to 1915 unigenes. Gene expression data of the three varieties were used for Multivariate Data Analysis using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ( Fig. 5).A good discrimination was obtained regarding EL 35 and EL 36 stages for all the varieties through PC1 that accounts for 41,89% of the variance. On the other hand, PC2 that accounts for 26,27% of the variance enabled the discrimination of the varieties with Trincadeira clustering independently of the other varieties as obtained previously for metabolomics data. Functional annotations could be assigned to the majority of probesets though 727 of the probesets had matches to genes with still unknown functions ( Fig. 6). Eleven categories beside the genes with unknown function were differentially represented at significant levels during berry development in the common gene set. These were ""primary metabolism"", “secondary metabolism”, cellular metabolism”, ""development”, “cellular process”, “diverse functions”, “regulation overview”, ""response to stimulus, stress”, “signaling”, “transport overview”, and “xenoprotein, transposable element”. In order to validate microarray data and obtain further insights into expression of ten selected genes RT-qPCR analysis was performed ( Fig. 7). Analysis of gene expression and metabolite content during grape berry ripening Carbohydrate metabolism During ripening there is a major decrease in malate content as it was confirmed here by using GC-MS. The study of catabolism of this acid is very important for wine improvement due to its involvement in TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis, ethanol fermentation and for production of secondary metabolites (reviewed by  [23]). In the cytoplasm, malate can be produced from phosphoenolpyruvate produced in glycolysis through the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH). One gene coding for a PEPC was down-regulated (VVTU12208_at, VIT_01s0011g02740) at EL 36 vs EL 35 together with two genes coding for malate dehydrogenase (VVTU1903_at, VIT_13s0019g05250, VVTU4095_at, VIT_03s0088g01190) in agreement with a decrease in malate. Two of these genes (VVTU12208_at, VIT_01s0011g02740, VVTU4095_at, VIT_03s0088g01190) were more down-regulated in Touriga Nacional ( Table 2) which may be related to an enhanced decrease in malic acid content of this variety at EL 38 ( Fig. 2). It is not surprising that a gene coding for a TONOPLAST DICARBOXYLATE TRANSPORTER with homology to a sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter (VVTU17663_s_at, VIT_00s2188g00010), which is putatively involved in the transport of malate in the vacuole, was down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 ( File S3). Organic acids such as malic and tartaric acids are well known for their contribution to wine taste. At  véraison large amounts of malate released from the vacuole may be directly transported to the mitochondria and fed into an increased TCA cycle flux. The mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex provides acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle and NADH for oxidative phosphorylation. The alpha (VVTU3838_at, VIT_09s0018g01940) subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was induced after  véraison, though this enzyme is known to be highly regulated post-translationally. We observed an increase in the expression of a gene coding for ATP-citrate synthase (VVTU37457_s_at, VIT_01s0127g00260) at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties though the highest level of expression was observed in Touriga Nacional. At EL 32 and EL35 this variety tends to present more citric acid than Aragonês and Trincadeira. Aragonês showed elevated concentration of succinate whereas Trincadeira of fumarate ( File S2). While malic and tartaric acids showed the highest content in green berries in all varieties, citrate, succinate and fumarate showed the highest content in different developmental stages (green or  veraison) depending on the variety. During ripening a transcript encoding a Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH1; VVTU35625_s_at, VIT_19s0085g00880) putatively involved in succinate synthesis is down-regulated in all varieties as obtained by both microarray and RT qPCR analysis ( Fig. 6). It was also noticed that several genes coding for enzymes of the TCA cycle such as aconitate hydratase and malate dehydrogenase showed different expression among the three varieties, being some genes up or down-regulated in one variety but not in other ( File S3). The increase in the rate of glycolysis due to an excess of sugars leads to an increase in pyruvate that may trigger aerobic fermentative metabolism  [24]. In fact, the production of ethanol by pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase may occur in ripening fruit  [23]. Here it was observed an increase in ethanol during ripening in all varieties though pyruvate levels showed no significant change. It was observed up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase  [7] which may be indicative of a shift to an aerobic fermentative metabolism during ripening  [25]. We observed that a gene coding for an Alcohol dehydrogenase (VVTU4210_at, VIT_14s0068g01760) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35. This data may indicate that aerobic fermentation is occurring during ripening of all varieties. Other genes coding for alcohol dehydrogenases were up- or down-regulated in only one or two varieties ( File S3). Interestingly, acetic acid, a product of ethanol metabolism which is known for giving a sour, pungent fatty and sweaty aroma to wines was previously detected in higher amounts at harvest stage (EL 38) in Trincadeira comparing to the other varieties Aragonês and Touriga Nacional  [13]. Berries start to accumulate after  véraison the carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis and imported from the leaves. There is a general tendency for an increase in dehydroascorbic acid dimer (an oxidized form of ascorbic acid) at EL 36 and EL 38. This is not surprising since ripening is characterized by increased oxidative stress  [7],  [11]. Moreover, ascorbic acid present in abundant amounts in fruits undergoes rapid oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid  [26] yielding reduced glutathione. Previously, the content in glutathione was shown to increase during grape ripening with 90% being reduced  [27] in agreement with these results. Moreover, ascorbate was shown to decrease during ripening  [11] together as indicated here with genes coding for GDP-mannose 3,5-epimerase 1 (VVTU9987_s_at, VIT_05s0020g04510), VTC2 (VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE), L-Galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (VVTU8069_at, VIT_08s0007g05710), enzymes putatively involved in ascorbate biosynthesis. At the same time there is a decrease in threonic acid ( File S2) which is a polyhydroxy acid derived from L-ascorbic acid  [28]. The pentose phosphate pathway is a process that generates NADPH and pentoses used in reductive biosynthesis reactions within cells (e.g. fatty acid synthesis). An increase in expression of a gene coding for 6-phosphogluconolactonase (VVTU13533_s_at, VIT_16s0098g01200) at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties from the pentose phosphate pathway may be related to increase in fatty acids content as it will be discussed in paragraph on lipid metabolism. Interestingly, there is a big increase in β-sedoheptulose at EL 38 in agreement with major fatty acid accumulation. In conclusion, the analysis of expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and contents in metabolites in all varieties indicates that  véraison is a stage of active carbohydrate metabolism and transport. Ripening is characterized by a complex mechanism of starch breakdown with little sucrose accumulation but major accumulation of fructose and glucose. Raffinose and stachyose may play an important role in ripening of grapes. On the other hand, the pentose phosphate pathway seems to be involved in grape ripening together with aerobic fermentative metabolism. The TCA cycle may operate differently among the varieties since they were accumulating different contents in organic acids in particular in pre- véraison and  véraison stages. Sucrose concentrations remained relatively constant with a slight increase towards harvest stage. This is in agreement with transcript abundance of a gene encoding an enzyme involved in sucrose biosynthesis that was higher at EL 36 when compared with EL35, namely sucrose phosphatase (VVTU21174_s_at, VIT_08s0032g00840) ( Table 2). A gene coding for a myb domain protein R1 transcription factor (VVTU2631_at, VIT_18s0001g09850) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties ( File S3). This gene presents homology to one coding for a  Vitis vinifera sucrose responsive element binding protein which represses sucrose transporters expression in grape berry  [15]. This putative inhibition of sucrose transporters is in accordance with the fact that after  véraison sucrose is no longer transported to the grape cells but instead hydrolyzed at the apoplast  [16], which initiates a futile cycle of sucrose hydrolysis and resynthesis  [17]. Furthermore, the transcript abundance of two vacuolar invertases, GIN1 and GIN2 (VVTU3710_at, VIT_02s0154g00090, VVTU13187_at, VIT_16s0022g00670), which catalyze the catabolism of sucrose to fructose and glucose, decreased during ripening ( Table 2,  File S3) as observed for Pinot Noir  [7] and Syrah  [18]. Proteomics data also showed decreased levels of these proteins in accordance with the relocation of sucrose hydrolysis from the vacuole to the apoplast after  veraison[8]. As expected, at EL 35 an increase in fructose and glucose was already observed in all the varieties ( File S2) confirming that the onset of  veraison corresponds indeed to a stage of initiation of sugar accumulation. On the other hand, starch content has been shown to decrease in Trincadeira berries at EL 35 and EL 36  [11]. However, genes putatively involved in synthesis of starch such as coding for Starch synthase 1, chloroplast precursor (VVTU3541_at, VIT_16s0098g01780) and starch synthase (VVTU13257_s_at, VIT_02s0025g02790) were up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties. On the other hand, a gene coding for an isoamylase-type starch-debranching enzyme 1 (VVTU13947_s_at, VIT_11s0078g00310) is down-regulated. This enzyme is assumed to play a role in biosynthesis of starch  [19]. The control of activity of starch synthesis and starch degradation enzymes is complex in storage organs such as fruits. Different starch degradation pathways may be specific to early development and not active in late development  [20]. We have observed a high up-regulation of a gene coding for galactinol synthase (VVTU3450_at, VIT_05s0020g00330) at EL 36 vs EL 35 ( Table 2). The biosynthesis of raffinose and stachyose occurs via sequential transfers of galactosyl units to sucrose. The galactosyl donor is galactinol synthesized from UDP-galactose and myo-inositol, in a reaction catalyzed by galactinol synthase. The biosynthesis of raffinose and stachyose was reported during ripening of olive, also a non-climacteric fruit  [21]. On the other hand, we observed up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of a gene coding for 1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (VVTU9324_at, VIT_18s0001g03290), an enzyme that participates in inositol phosphate metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signalling. It should be noted the considerable higher fold change displayed by the gene coding for galactinol synthase (VVTU3450_at, VIT_05s0020g00330) in Touriga Nacional (∼105× comparing to 40.81× in Aragonês and 6.64× in Trincadeira). This may eventually imply a different composition in raffinose and stachyose for the three varieties. Raffinose is a minor carbohydrate in grape tissues but it has been reported that accumulation of raffinose in leaves of  Vitis vinifera might be an early step of cold acclimation  [22]. Interestingly, the sugar alcohol erythritol is more present in Aragonês cultivar at harvest stage, and may contribute to the final wine taste ( File S2). Plastid glycolysis seems to be inhibited at the onset and following  veraison as we suggested previously  [11]. On the other hand, cytoplasmic glycolysis seems to be activated. In fact, genes coding for pyruvate kinase, cytosolic isozyme (VVTU18887_s_at, VIT_08s0007g04170) are up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 and a gene coding for a cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is down-regulated (VVTU12977_s_at, VIT_18s0072g00770). Although different berry tissues may have different trends of glycolysis  [8], cellular compartmentation should be taken into account  [11]. This subject deserves further confirmation as a marker of ripening. Nevertheless, the whole rate of glycolysis seems to decrease in ripe berries as suggested by the decrease in glyceric acid ( File S2), a precursor of important biochemical intermediates in that process. Lipid metabolism The increase was mostly noticed for α-tocopherol which presents the highest anti-oxidant activity. Previously, we reported an increase in glutathione during ripening of Trincadeira grapes and suggested to be related to increased oxidative stress at the onset of ripening and during ripening as suggested by  [7]. Interestingly, we observed up-regulation in Touriga Nacional and Trincadeira at EL 36 vs EL 35 of a gene coding for tocopherol cyclase (VVTU22626_s_at, VIT_04s0008g03600,  File S3) which catalyzes the penultimate step of tocopherol synthesis. The precursor of tocopherol, phytol also increases at EL 36 and EL 38 in Touriga Nacional berries. Derivatives of fatty acids may be structural components of cell membranes, and/or used in triacylglycerol production  [39]. Two genes coding for triacylglycerol lipases (VVTU15811_at VIT_09s0002g00990, VVTU8356_at, VIT_07s0005g01240) were up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35, and may be involved in the release of fatty acids. The resultant product of glycerol-3-phosphate which decreases during ripening ( File S2) may be metabolized for synthesis of esters of fatty acids for surface waxes  [40],  [41]. It was noticed an up-regulation of a gene coding for chloroplastidial palmitoyl-monogalactosyldiacylglycerol delta-7 desaturase in all the varieties up to EL 38 as revealed by RT qPCR data (VVTU3709_at, VIT_09s0002g06970,  Fig. 7) putatively involved in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis for that purpose. Interestingly, glycerol which is also important for wineś taste presented the highest concentration at EL 38 in Aragonês ( File S2). On the other hand, it was noticed the up-regulation of a gene coding for a diacylglycerol kinase 2 (VVTU5906_at, VIT_07s0031g02840) which functions in the recycling of diacylglycerol, yielding phosphatidic acid, a compound that has emerged as an important lipid second messenger in plants, being involved in a wide range of biotic (e.g. pathogens) and abiotic (e.g. osmotic, temperature) stress responses  [42]. These stresses are known to increase during grape ripening  [11]. It was observed the up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties of a gene coding for a 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (VVTU25722_at, VIT_18s0001g11910) which intervenes in the phospholipid biosynthetic process. This suggests that this class of lipids may increase during ripening as it occurs with  Capsicum annuum, another non-climacteric fruit  [43]. Indeed, the most abundant fraction of grape lipids has been reported to be the phospholipids  [44]. The metabolism of lipids is very active during grape ripening due to the breakdown of plastid thylakoids, and differentiation of chloroplasts into non-photosynthetic chromoplasts. In these plastids fatty acid biosynthesis is enhanced for wax biosynthesis, as well as for aroma production which is due also to a specific fatty acid and correspondent esters combination. Steroid composition also varies among varieties but tends to decrease during ripening. On the contrary, tocopherol increases probably to cope with increased stress occurring during grape ripening. The glyoxalate cycle plays a role in metabolism of fatty acids during seed germination; but was relevant to our analyses even though seeds have been removed from our samples. At EL 36 vs EL 35 there is down-regulation of a gene coding for glyoxalate reductase (VVTU9635_s_at, VIT_03s0038g02510) in all varieties in agreement with a decrease in glycolic acid ( Tables 1,  2). The net result of the glyoxalate cycle is the production of glucose from fatty acids. However, fatty acid oxidation does not seem to be favored during ripening in pulp and skin but instead fatty acid biosynthesis appeared to be enhanced. Indeed, we have observed at EL 36 and EL 38 an increase in content in several saturated fatty acids ( Table 1,  File S2) as previously reported for another  Vitis vinifera variety  [29]. Moreover, genes coding for key enzymes of glyoxalate cycle such as malate synthase and isocitrate lyase were down-regulated though not in all varieties ( File S3). It was observed up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of two genes coding for Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain member 2 and 6 (VVTU13825_at, VIT_02s0025g01410, VVTU40835_s_at, VIT_05s0020g03080) in Touriga Nacional and Aragonês. The skin of berries from these varieties is thicker than from Trincadeira (Agudelo-Romero et al., unpublished). Fatty acids can be found in cells in activated form performed by enzymes acyl-CoA synthetases. The resultant acyl-CoAs are used in the biosynthesis of many cellular products such wax and cutin which are components of berry skins. After  veraison grape berries continue to enlarge due to cell expansion driven by the increase of sugar content in the cell vacuole and a continuous flow of water; therefore a thick cuticule is necessary to avoid evapotranspiration. The surface wax of the grape berry is chemically a mixture of long-chain alcohols, esters of such alcohols and fatty acids, free fatty acids, long-chain aldehydes, and hydrocarbons  [30]. The GC-MS platform enabled the identification of several saturated fatty acids which in general increase at EL 36 and/or EL 38, namely octacosanoic, hexacosanoic and triacontanoic acids ( Table 1,  File S2). This increase was much more noticed in Touriga Nacional berries whereas docosanoic and eicosanoic acids showed increased levels at EL 38 in Aragonês cultivar. This increase is not surprising since saturated long-chain fatty acids are major constituents of grape waxes that accumulate in ripe berries. The hexacosanoic acid or cerotic acid is a component of carnauba wax, an extremely good wax presenting several commercial applications. It is interesting to note that this fatty acid increased significantly in Touriga Nacional samples ( File S2). The composition of their skin e.g wax density may influence the resistance of this variety to fungal attack  [31] comparing to other varieties such as Trincadeira. Lipid components in fruits though occurring in low amounts are important due to their nutritional value and due to their contribution to aroma and flavor. Fatty acids as n-hexadecanoic acid and 9,12-(Z, Z)-octadecadienoic acid (linoleic acid) have an important influence on the flavour of strawberry fruit  [32]. A gene coding for a chloroplastidial omega 6-fatty acid desaturase (VVTU24552_at, VIT_11s0016g00130) was down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all the varieties. This enzyme also known as FAD6 is the primary route of polyunsaturated fatty acids production in plants and converts oleic acid (18∶1, a monounsaturated fatty acid) to linoleic acid  [33] which provides a potential herbaceous aroma in ripe grapes  [29]. In fact, we did not detect a significant decrease in linoleic acid. Also a gene coding for a chloroplastidial omega-3 fatty acid desaturase (VVTU5073_at, VIT_08s0105g00430) putatively involved in α-linolenic acid biosynthesis is down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties. A gene coding for a stearyl acyl carrier protein desaturase was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties (VVTU35129_s_at, VIT_18s0001g15460). Stearoyl ACP-desaturase, commonly known as fatty acid biosynthesis 2 (FAB2), is a key enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of stearic (18∶0) into oleic acid (18∶1)  [34]. Nevertheless we did not observe a significant decrease in stearic acid also known as octadecanoic acid. Other fatty acids such as octadecenoic and hexadecanoic also showed no significant differences throughout ripening ( File S2). However, in 'Pedro Ximnez'  Vitis vinifera grapes hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid) increased during ripening  [29] highlighting metabolic specificities among varieties. Regarding steroid biosynthesis we have observed down-regulation of genes coding for squalene synthase (VVTU35040_s_at, VIT_03s0038g00450), and 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (VVTU3496_at, VIT_01s0146g00070) suggesting decreased steroid synthesis at EL 36. In fact, a transcript encoding 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase has been recently considered a biomarker of pre- veraison and  veraison stages  [9]. Campesterol decreased during ripening in all the varieties while stigmastan-3-ol showed no significant variation in content. In tomato, among all sterol lipids, the ratio of stigmasterol to β-sitosterol the two major sterols in tomato, increased 2.3-fold during ripening  [35]. It has been reported an increase in the total sterol content of pericarp tissue during ripening of tomato fruit from mature green to red ripe stages  [36]. In berries of  Vitis vinifera at least for the sterols evaluated this does not seem to be the case. In addition, a gene involved in brassinosteroidś biosynthesis from campesterol and coding for a steroid 5 alpha reductase DET2 (VVTU6606_at, VIT_08s0007g01760) was down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all the varieties ( File S3). This class of hormones plays an important role in the onset of grape ripening  [37]. We observed an increase in α-tocopherol and β-tocopherol in all varieties during ripening but in particular in Touriga Nacional. The increase in tocopherol has been reported also for tomato and recently shown to be regulated by  APETALA2a ( AP2a) transcription factor  [38]. It is interesting to note that a gene coding for  AP2a (VVTU2494_at, VIT_07s0031g00220) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all the varieties ( File S3). It remains to be established whether this transcription factor is a major regulator of grape ripening as occurs in tomato  [38]. Amino acid metabolism Homoserine and pyroglutamic acid which when monitored by the chosen GC-MS profiling approach also includes glutamine and glutamic acid were the amino acids identified ( Table 1). In this context, the use of an NMR- based platform enabled the quantification of many amino acids, namely arginine, valine and threonine  [13]. This highlights the fact that both platforms used in metabolomics studies are complementary. Glutamate was shown previously to decrease at EL 38 in all varieties  [13] as it happens here with pyroglutamic acid. It is interesting to note that genes related to glutamate metabolism were down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all the varieties and may eventually be considered as negative markers of ripening such as glutamate N-acetyltransferase (VVTU22296_s_at, VIT_08s0040g03320) and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (VVTU13950_s_at, VIT_08s0007g07400). L-Homoserine is a precursor of methionine biosynthesis. Interestingly, it has been shown that homoserine accumulation in the chloroplast triggers a novel form of downy mildew resistance that is independent of known defense signaling pathways  [45]. Though the levels of this amino acid have remained the same throughout ripening in all varieties we have detected increased methionine levels towards harvest especially in Trincadeira  [13]. S-adenosyl-L-methionine is a precursor of both ethylene and polyamine biosynthesis. Recently, we showed that during ripening there is an increase in polyamine catabolism in the three varieties  [46]. Regarding the synthesis of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine which is a precursor of the phenolic compounds that accumulate during ripening, it was observed the up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of genes coding for a 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (VVTU1391_at, VIT_00s0391g00070) and a cytosolic chorismate mutase (VVTU6948_at, VIT_04s0008g06570) putatively involved in shikimate metabolism and phenylalanine biosynthesis. Therefore, it is not surprising that shikimate content is decreased in berries at ripe and harvest stages ( File S2) though it was substantially higher at EL 32 and EL 35 in Aragonês and Touriga Nacional cultivars than in Trincadeira. Those varieties are known to accumulate more phenolic compounds  [13]. Also different genes coding for phenylalanine ammonia lyase were up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 though not in all varieties ( File S3). From the above it can be suggested that the metabolisms of glutamate, methionine and phenylalanine play a major role in grape ripening. Flavonoid and stilbene metabolism Phenylpropanoid metabolism plays a major role in grape ripening changing the content in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonols, tannins, anthocyanins, and stilbenes from green to harvest stage of grapes and presenting cultivar specific variation with a tendency of Touriga Nacional to present more phenolics. Genes coding for enzymes acting on flavonols, stilbenes, and anthocyanins synthesis were noticed to be induced during grape ripening  [7],  [11]. Our results confirm these for all the varieties and establish these genes as candidate markers of grape ripening. In addition, many genes coding for transcriptions factors of the MYB family were up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all the varieties and may be involved in the regulation of the flavonoid pathway as other previously characterized MYB transcription factors  [12]. These are the case of genes coding for myb domains proteins 73, 14, R1 and 94 ( File S3). A gene coding for a flavonol synthase (VVTU16103_at, VIT_18s0001g03470) was up-regulated at EL36 vs EL 35. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of dihydroflavonols to flavonols which are important co-pigments that stabilize anthocyanins in wine. In the skin of Shiraz berries,  VvFLS1 expression is highest between flowering and fruit set, then declines to  veraison, and increases again during ripening coincident with accumulation of flavonols per berry  [47]. The same seems to be the case of this gene coding for flavonol synthase at least in Touriga Nacional ( Fig. 7). However, in this work it was detected a decrease in quercetin following EL 32 in all varieties including Touriga Nacional ( Fig. 8) in agreement with a previous identified decrease in quercetin glycoside using NMR  [13]. Ampelopsin or dihydromyricetin is a flavanonol presenting anti-cancer properties and derivates from the flavonol myricetin  [48]. Interestingly, it was detected at higher concentrations in ripe berries (EL 36) ( Fig. 8) and mainly in Aragonês. This fact highlights the use of GC-MS as a platform to investigate the medicinal potential of samples. A reduction in tannin concentration from pre- veraison to harvest has been well documented  [49]. The tannin catechin decreases during ripening in all varieties as shown in  Fig. 8 for Touriga Nacional. However, it should be noted that Trincadeira presents much lower levels of catechin at EL 32 and EL 35 than the other varieties. Interestingly, epigallocatechin was higher in Aragonês at harvest stage and may contribute to higher astringency of the wine. This compounds is a precursor of epigallocatechin-3-gallate which is known for the anti-oxidant properties  [50]. The observed decrease in gallic acid during ripening is expected since this compound makes part of tannins such as epigallocatechin. It is clear the overall flavonoid profile of grapes changes significantly over time  [51] and includes a significant reduction in catechin and gallic acid. One gene coding for an UDP-glucose: anthocyanidin 5,3-O-glucosyltransferase (VVTU14620_at, VIT_18s0041g00740) was up-regulated at EL36 vs EL 35. Another gene coding for this enzyme was down-regulated (VVTU13618_x_at, VIT_16s0050g01580) at EL 36 when compared to EL 35 but was up-regulated at EL 35 when compared to EL 32 at least for Trincadeira cultivar  [11]. This suggests that the pattern of anthocyanins may change during berry ripening as recently observed for Corvina berries  [51]. These authors showed a rapid accumulation of nonacylated anthocyanins and flavones during  veraison, concomitant with a sharp decline in the levels of aromatic organic acids and procyanidins. This could be due to the use of the organic acid pool to provide precursors for the synthesis of other molecules. For example, both coumaric acid and caffeic acid could in principle be used (as coumaroyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA, respectively) as substrates for the production of chalcones by chalcone synthase. The resulting chalcones could then be used for the synthesis of flavones and anthocyanins  [51]. Interestingly, we have detected a decrease in caffeic acid in ripe berries of all the varieties being no longer detected at harvest stage. Touriga Nacional was the variety accumulating more caffeic acid at EL 32 and shown to present more anthocyanins at EL 36 and EL 38 ( Fig. 1). The same holds true for trans- 4-hydroxycinnamic acid or  p-coumaric acid ( Fig. 8), which is a precursor of flavonoids, stilbenes and coumarins  [52]. Two genes coding for trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase (VVTU15353_at, VIT_11s0065g00350, VVTU12032_s_at, VIT_06s0004g08150) were more expressed at EL 36 vs EL 35 in Touriga Nacional ( Fig. 8). Previously, and through an NMR platform it was established that the green and  veraison stages (EL 32, EL 35) of Touriga Nacional presented more hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives such as caftaric acid than Aragonês and Trincadeira  [13] and that was recently related to increased anti-tumoral properties of that cultivar  [53]. One gene coding for flavonoid 3,5 –hydroxylase (VVTU35884_at, VIT_06s0009g03010) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 but only in Trincadeira ( Table 2,  File S3). This enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of the B-ring of flavonoids and can act on flavonols, anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins. Bogs and co-workers  [54] showed that in berry skin, expression of these genes was low at the onset of ripening but increased after  veraison concomitant with the accumulation of 3′- and 3′,5′-hydroxylated anthocyanins. The hydroxylation pattern of the B-ring is an important determinant of flavonoids ´coloration, stability, and antioxidant capacity  [55]. Regarding stilbenes, their accumulation during ripening of grape berries is well known  [2]. It is interesting to note, however, that resveratrol or  trans-3, 4′,5,-trihydroxystilbene is present at higher concentrations in Touriga Nacional berries at ripe ( Fig. 8) and harvest stages in agreement with a higher fold change detected at EL 36 vs EL 35 in this variety for several genes coding for stilbenes synthases (VVTU34913_at, VIT_16s0100g00810, VVTU15628_s_at, VIT_16s0100g00950, VVTU34553_s_at, VIT_16s0100g01030). Aroma development One gene coding for a lactoylglutathione lyase (VVTU11834_at, VIT_09s0002g06420) was up-regulated whereas another one (VVTU9837_s_at, VIT_04s0008g03560) was down-regulated EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties. The same holds true for four genes coding for aldo-keto reductase (VVTU4697_at, VIT_08s0007g01040, VVTU9888_at, VIT_05s0049g01130, VVTU11927_at, VIT_05s0062g00980, VVTU3533_s_at, VIT_05s0077g01300). Lactoylglutathione lyase or glyoxalase I is involved in the detoxification of methylglyoxal together with aldo-keto reductase. Dicarbonyl compounds, like methylglyoxal, are often associated with amino acids in the formation of odorous products present in wine so the previously mentioned enzymes may play a role in wine aroma. For instance, leucine and methylglyoxal give rise to 3-methylbutanal responsible for a moderate amylic aroma  [65]. This compound reached the highest values in Touriga Nacional at harvest stage. Among other important volatiles is the alcohol 3-methylbutanol considered as a key-odorant in Grenache, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot wines  [66]. This compound was presented in higher concentration in Touriga Nacional and Aragonês berries at EL 32 but decreased during ripening in both varieties showing no significant differences from Trincadeira at EL 38. Benzaldehyde also decreased at EL 36 and EL 38. Therefore these compounds cannot be used to discriminate the potential aroma of wines made from these varieties. Benzoic acid which may constitute a precursor of volatile benzenoids  [67] also showed a tendency to decrease in all varieties during ripening. The majority of cyanogenic glucosides are derivatives of benzaldehyde cyanohydrin (mandelonitrile, i.e. nitrile of mandelic acid). Cyanogenic glycosides may be defined chemically as glycosides of a-hydroxinitriles and function in nitrogen storage for germination and plantlet development, and pathogen and herbivory defense  [68]. The involvement of cyanogenic glycosides in fruit ripening has been previously mentioned for strawberry  [69]. In grapevine, cyanogenesis (release of cyanide) has been detected in leaves but not in berries though the possibility that cyanogenic compounds, are present in berries remains to be excluded  [70]. Interestingly, a gene coding for beta-cyanoalanine synthase (VVTU13018_s_at, VIT_15s0046g02300) putatively involved in cyanide detoxification was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 but only in Aragonês. Among other free volatiles reported in grapes are C6 alcohols and aldehydes derived from linoleate cascade through activity of lipoxygenases  [71]. We have observed up-regulation of an enzyme coding for a lipoxygenase (VVTU13955_at, VIT_14s0128g00780) that was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 but only in Touriga Nacional and Trincadeira. Since these varieties present more (E)-2-Hexenal and hexanal especially at EL 36 we can speculate whether the gene coding for this enzyme is involved in the synthesis of these C6 aldehydes. Previously and in Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, both (E)-2-hexenal and hexanal showed a significant increase after  veraison followed by a decrease in the harvest sample  [72]. It is also interesting to note that a gene coding for fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase (HPL1; VVTU37595_s_at, VIT_12s0059g01060) was down-regulated at EL36 vs EL 35 but only in Aragonês. Hexenal can be converted to hexanol by alcohol dehydrogenases. One gene coding for alcohol dehydrogenase was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 (VVTU4210_at, VIT_14s0068g01760) in all varieties. Production of volatiles as a result of alcohol dehydrogenase activity was suggested to contribute to the development of taste and aroma in fruits  [73]. Besides hexenal and (E)-2-hexenal other aliphatic aldehydes such as octanal and (E)-2-heptenal provide an herbaceous odor. Octanal seems to be in higher amounts in Trincadeira at EL 38 whereas (E)-2-heptenal is present at EL 35. (E)-2-heptenal or  trans-2-heptenal, and (E)-2-hexenal or  Trans-2-hexenal are known to provide fruity, green, leafy notes  [74]. Decanal is associated with citrus peel and “sawdust” or “plant” odor  [75] and accumulate in Trincadeira at EL 36 and EL 38. Nonanal with a fatty-green aroma  [76] also accumulates at these stages in particular in this variety. Genes coding for carboxylesterases were up or down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in only some varieties ( File S3). These enzymes are involved in hydrolysis of esters into acids and alcohols and may contribute to flavor development. Interestingly, anthraniloyal-CoA: methanol anthraniloyal transferase putatively involved in the biosynthesis of fruit esters responsible for aroma was up-regulated from EL 35 to EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties (VVTU5363_at, VIT_09s0018g01490). It is difficult to establish the activity of the enzyme coded by this gene since it shows strong homology with other acyltransferases responsible for synthesis of flavor compounds but it may be involved in the synthesis of the volatile methyl anthranilate  [77]. Monoterpenes, C 13-norisoprenoids, and some benzenoid compounds are the most important grape aroma substances present in the pulp and skin of berries in both free and glycoside forms. Their specific profiles depend mainly on the variety though environmental cues may have impact (Flamini and Traldi, 2010). S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases catalyze methylation of several molecules, and are key enzymes in phenylpropanoid, flavonoid and many other metabolic pathways. Enzymatic methylation of hydroxyl and carboxyl moieties is catalyzed by O-methyltransferases which include SAM: salicylic acid carboxy methyltransferases, SAM: jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferases and SAM: benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferases, among others  [78]. A gene coding for a S-adenosyl-L-methionine:salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (VVTU5372_s_at, VIT_04s0023g02280) was down-regulated at EL36 vs EL 35, and may play an important role in specific aroma production at earlier stages of berry development  [78]. Other two genes, however, were expressed either in Touriga Nacional (VVTU14878_s_at, VIT_04s0023g02200) or in Aragonês and.Trincadeira (VVTU8882_at, VIT_01s0011g05920). A gene coding for a caffeic acid methyltransferase (VVTU36927_x_at, VIT_12s0059g01790) putatively involved in aroma production was also down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 as it was already referred for a decrease in the compound caffeic acid. RT qPCR data showed that this gene presented a major decrease from EL 32 to EL 35 in particular in Aragonês cultivar ( Fig. 7). Other methyltransferases such as  O-methyltransferases may be involved in the synthesis of vanillin  [79] which precursor is vanillic acid. The presence of this compound was only identified in grapes at EL 36 and EL 38 stages of ripening and shown to be present at higher amounts in Touriga Nacional, highlighting the known aromatic potential of these grapes. In fact, ethyl vanillate was shown to be present in clonal red wines from Touriga Nacional (Falco da Costa, personnal communication). It should be pointed out that methyltransferases constitute a protein family in which little correlation is observed between the level of sequence similarity among enzymes and the structural similarity of their substrates so their activities should be discussed with caution  [56]. Cytochrome P450 are also involved in the formation of plant volatiles and in a vast array of biosynthetic pathways in secondary and primary metabolism  [56]. A gene coding a CYP89H3 (VVTU21329_at, VIT_16s0039g00880) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs El 35 in all varieties in particular in Trincadeira while the expression values at EL 38 were similar among the varieties ( Fig. 7). Other genes coding for CYPs were up-regulated in one or two varieties and may eventually be involved in aroma development ( File S3). It was noticed the up-regulation of a gene coding for alliin lyase precursor (VVTU16622_at, VIT_00s0225g00230) in all varieties, especially in Trincadeira. Alliin lyase (alliinase) gives rise to volatile sulphur compounds from S-alk(en)yl cysteine sulphoxide flavor precursors derived from cysteine and glutathione  [80]. This latter compound was shown to increase during ripening of Trincadeira grapes  [11]. Moreover, glutathione and  trans-2-hexenal intervene in the biosynthesis of S-(3-hexan-1-ol)-glutathione which is a flavor precursor in wines  [81]. In fact, most of the volatile sulphur compounds that contribute to varietal character are released during must fermentation from specific aroma/flavor precursors present in the grapes  [82]. The varietal aroma is built on different classes of compounds that may be more present in one variety independently of the  terroir. Nevertheless at  veraison aromas and flavors begin to develop in all varieties and increase their complexity during ripening. For all the varieties studied pre- veraison and  veraison stages seem to be enriched in carotenoids, benzaldehyde and caffeic acid and post- veraison stages in volatile terpenes and sulfur compounds, C6 alcohols and aldehydes, and vannilic acid. The largest class of plant volatiles is derived from isoprenoid pathways  [56]. The mevalonate pathway is a source of isoprene units for the biosynthesis of cytokinins and brassinosteroids. In plants, both the cytosolic mevalonate and the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate pathways generate the five-carbon compound isopentenyl pyrophosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These two precursors give rise to volatile and non-volatile terpenoid compounds such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15) diterpenes (C20), triterpenes (C30), carotenoids, sterols and phytols. In this respect, it should be noted that Touriga Nacional presented a higher quantity of phytol at EL 36 and EL 38 than Aragonês and Trincadeira. Variety,  terroir, sunlight exposure, soil water retention capacity as well as ripening stage affect carotenoid concentration in the grapes which is known to decrease following  veraison[57]. So it is not surprising that genes coding for a chloroplast precursor of phytoene synthase (VVTU39097_at, VIT_04s0079g00680), for a zeaxanthin epoxidase (VVTU6355_at, VIT_07s0031g00620) and for a Beta-carotene hydroxylase (VVTU13738_at, VIT_16s0050g01090) are down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in all varieties. However, it is interesting to note that in Touriga Nacional we found up-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of genes coding for a Zeta-carotene desaturase ZDS1 (VVTU4228_at, VIT_14s0030g01740) and a Beta-carotene hydroxylase (VVTU13791_at, VIT_02s0025g00240) involved in carotenoid biosynthesis as well as a gene coding for phytoene synthase (VVTU9210_a, VIT_13s0019g01270) that was up-regulated in Trincadeira. Volatile terpenes may derive from the cleavage of carotenoids by carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases  [56]. A gene coding for a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 2 (isoenzyme carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1; VVTU8254_at, VIT_02s0087g00930) was up-regulated at EL36 vs EL 35 in Touriga Nacional whereas another (VVTU17555_s_at, VIT_10s0003g03750) was down-regulated in Trincadeira. Some flavor volatiles peak at pre- veraison or  veraison stages and others at ripe or harvest stage and this may be also dependent on the variety. The volatiles (E)-2-Pentenal, 2-Ethylfuran, 2-Pentylfuran, (E, E)-2,4-Hexadien-1-al, 3-Methylbutanol, 3-Methylbutanal, benzaldehyde, 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and (Z)-3-Octen-1-ol were higher at EL32 while (E)-2-Heptenal was more present at both pre- veraison or  veraison stages. The volatiles ethanol, hexanal, decanal and nonanal increased their content at ripe and harvest stages while (E)-2-Hexenal peaked at EL 36. The content in the putatively identified undecane peaked at EL 35 or EL 36 depending on the variety while heptanal at EL 36 and limonene at EL 38. Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases have been reported to generate 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one from lycopene  [58]. This compound is an important flavor volatile in tomato  [59] and tends to be higher in Trincadeira at EL 38 comparing to the other varieties. Different aroma profiles may also be related to the fact that a gene coding for myrcene synthase (VVTU36515_at, VIT_00s0271g00030) was down-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 in Trincadeira and Aragonês but not in Touriga Nacional. Terpenes which are precursors for important aroma compounds start to accumulate at  véraison[60]. A gene coding for a (-)-isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (VVTU2626_at, VIT_17s0000g05580) putatively involved in monoterpenoid biosynthesis was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 but only in Touriga Nacional. On the other hand, a gene coding for (+)-neomenthol dehydrogenase (VVTU7133_s_at, VIT_15s0046g03570) putatively involved in menthol biosynthesis, a volatile monoterpenoid, was down-regulated in all the varieties but another one (VVTU21725_at, VIT_15s0046g03600) was up-regulated at EL 36 vs EL 35 only Touriga Nacional and Aragonês. From the above it is not surprising that wines made from Touriga Nacional berries are recognized as being highly aromatic. Furthermore, the putatively identified cyclic terpene limonene that provides a lemon-like fresh aroma reached the highest concentrations at harvest stage (EL 38) in Trincadeira and in particular in Touriga Nacional. In fact, Touriga Nacional wines are known to have an aroma of orange tree flower. Higher-quality Touriga Nacional wines are characterized by a fruity-citric aroma described as sweet and fresh citrus evoking the bergamot fruit ( Citrus bergamia)  [61]. In accordance, we have noticed in Touriga Nacional and by real time qPCR a very significant increase at EL 38 ( Fig.7) in the expression of a gene coding for a terpene synthase which previous functional characterization showed that produces mainly (E)-a-bergamotene (VvTPS10;  [62]). On the other hand, a terpene synthase that produces mainly (E)-b-ocimene (VvTPS34, [62]) was up-regulated at EL 38 in all the varieties but mainly in Aragonês highlighting aroma cultivar specificities. We have observed down-regulation at EL 36 vs EL 35 of a gene coding for a limonoid UDP-glucosyltransferase in all varieties (VVTU17111_s_at, VIT_03s0180g00200  Table 2) putatively involved in limonoid glucoside synthesis from limonin  [63]. In particular in Aragonês a considerable decrease in expression was noticed from EL 32 to EL 35 as shown by RT qPCR ( Fig. 7). Limonoids are highly oxygenated triterpenes and one of the components responsible for the bitterness in citrus fruit  [63]. The lower synthesis of their glucosides may be related to increased citric aroma. This gene was also shown to be induced during early withering in grape  [64]."," Background Grapes (Vitis species) are economically the most important fruit crop worldwide. However, the complexity of molecular and biochemical events that lead to ripening of berries as well as how aroma is developed are not fully understood. Methodology/principal findings In an attempt to identify the common mechanisms associated with the onset of ripening independently of the cultivar, grapes of Portuguese elite cultivars, Trincadeira, Aragonês, and Touriga Nacional, were studied. The mRNA expression profiles corresponding to veraison (EL35) and mature berries (EL36) were compared. Across the three varieties, 9,8% (2255) probesets corresponding to 1915 unigenes were robustly differentially expressed at EL 36 compared to EL 35. Eleven functional categories were represented in this differential gene set. Information on gene expression related to primary and secondary metabolism was verified by RT-qPCR analysis of selected candidate genes at four developmental stages (EL32, EL35, EL36 and EL 38). Gene expression data were integrated with metabolic profiling data from GC-EI-TOF/MS and headspace GC-EI-MS platforms. Conclusions/significance Putative molecular and metabolic markers of grape pre-ripening and ripening related to primary and secondary metabolism were established and revealed a substantial developmental reprogramming of cellular metabolism. Altogether the results provide valuable new information on the main metabolic events leading to grape ripening. Furthermore, we provide first hints about how the development of a cultivar specific aroma is controlled at transcriptional level.",,"['Touriga Nacional', 'gene coding', 'VIT', 'acid', 'coding',

20,20,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4232691\eupmc_result.json,PMC4232691,"Results and discussion Spearmint PGT and their development Spearmint leaves produce three different types of trichomes on their surfaces: non-glandular multicellular hair like, capitate glandular trichomes with a single secretory head cell and PGTs whose secretory head is composed of eight-cells with a single stalk and basal cell (Figure  1A). These PGT glands possess a large subcuticular storage space that is formed by the separation of the cuticle from the apical cells and the essential oil is secreted into this cavity [ 12] (Figure  1B). It is known that new glands keep initiating on the leaf till expansion ceases and the monoterpene content and compositions change with the age of the leaf [ 13- 16]. Different studies have indicated that monoterpene biosynthesis is most active in young 12–20 day old leaves of peppermint after which the rate of synthesis slowly declines [ 17- 19]. We performed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on young spearmint leaves (about 1–2 cm in length) and found abundance of both limonene and carvone monoterpenes (Figure  2). Limonene is the first committed step towards carvone pathway. In addition to these monoterpenes, the presence of sesquiterpenes was also observed. This indicated the dynamic terpene biosynthetic activity of leaves at this stage of development. PGT were purified from leaves of this stage and RNA isolated. The leaves of the same stage were brushed to remove all trichomes and RNA extracted from them as controls (Additional file  1). Sequencing,  de novo assembly and annotation of transcriptome Three RNA libraries were prepared and sequenced by Illumina technology. More than 100 million high quality reads of 101 base pairs (bp) were generated from PGT, leaf-PGT and leaf (Additional file  2). Using the Trinity method [ 20] the sequence reads were finally assembled into 40,587 non-redundant unigenes, spanning a total of 101 Mb of sequence with a GC content of 43.14%. All unigenes were longer than 200 bp. The N50 of the final assembled transcripts was 1,774 bp. The unigenes were annotated by performing BLASTX search against various protein databases. Among the 40,587 non-redundant unigenes, 27,025 (67%) had at least one hit in BLASTX search with E-value < = 1e-3. Functional classifications of Gene Ontology (GO) term of all unigenes were performed using Trinotate [ 20]. In order to calculate the expression level for assembled transcripts, we first mapped reads onto them using bowtie [ 21]. RSEM (RNA-seq by Expectation-Maximization) was used to estimate the abundance of assembled transcripts and to measure the expression level [ 22]. Overview of expression profile of spearmint PGT From the RNA seq data about 25,000 unigenes were observed to be expressed in spearmint PGT. The heat map in Figure  3 exhibits some specific expression patterns to PGT. Among this specific pattern for PGT we found transcripts for terpene biosynthesis, lipid transfer proteins and interesting transcription factors like MYBs and WRKYs. Comparison of PGT and leaf-PGT showed that 3,919 unigenes were differentially expressed in PGT (Additional file  3). These unigenes showed a minimum of 4 times increase in expression level in PGT as compared to leaf-PGT. About 30% of these unigenes encoded either hypothetical proteins or remained unannotated. Many of these unannotated unigenes showed none or minimal expression in leaf-PGT. They might represent novel genes that are unique to PGTs development and divergent from other plants, whose genomes have been sequenced. Data from proteomic analysis of spearmint PGT also showed that the largest functional category of the identified proteins was “unclear classification” and included proteins with unknown functions [ 11]. The absence or low levels of some PGT-specific transcripts from leaf RNA seq data indicated the dilution of PGT-specific RNAs among the total leaf RNAs and reaffirms the importance of isolating these organs for analysis. Among the top 1000 differentially expressed unigenes, we identified 16 TPSs, 18 cytochrome P450s, 5 lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), 20 transcription factors, 2 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and several transcripts associated with cell wall. Cytochrome P450s are involved in the hydroxylation of terpenes [ 23] and LTPs have been suggested to be involved in intracellular transport and secretion of lipids and terpenes [ 9, 24]. LTPs were among the most abundant unigenes in PGT and were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). The abundance of these LTPs suggests their importance in PGTs metabolic function and development. ABC transporters are also proposed to be involved in the active transport of secondary metabolites [ 11, 25]. The spearmint PGT is presumed to undergo cell wall modification to form subcuticular storage space [ 12]. Among the differentially expressed unigenes there were few that were related to cell wall synthesis or modifications and a subset of these were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Additional files  4 and  5). Whether they play a role in modification of cell wall layers to form the storage space remains to be investigated. To characterize biological processes specific for PGT, GO term was determined for all differentially expressed unigenes. Additionally, we identified unigenes whose expression was reduced in PGT by comparing leaf-PGT and PGT. These unigenes showed a minimum of 4 times reduction in expression level in PGT when compared to leaf-PGT. GO term was determined for them as well. Figure  4 shows the top 30 GO terms for the more abundant and less abundant unigenes. GO terms associated with ribosome biogenesis, ribosome structural genes and translation are highly represented in PGT, which could reflect the high protein biosynthetic activity of PGTs. Other terms included terpene metabolism and most of the primary energy producing terms like glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Furthermore, pentose phosphate related term (oxidative) was also enriched in PGT. This term provides NADPH for biosynthetic processes such as fatty acid synthesis, cytochrome P450 mediated hydroxylation and the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen [ 26]. These results indicate that the GO functions that provide energy equivalents and redox cofactors are very active in PGT. Secretory trichomes are biosynthetically very active, and hence, there is a high energy requirement in these cells. Unigenes from the GO terms of photosynthesis, chlorophyll biosynthesis and starch biosynthesis were among the less abundant ones. This shows that our PGT sample preparation was pure and not contaminated with leaf tissues as mint PGTs are non-photosynthetic. Mint PGTs being non- photosynthetic and metabolically very active would presumably rely on exogenous supply of sucrose from underlying leaf tissues to use as carbon source for energy production. We found several transcripts encoding enzymes for sucrose catabolism expressed more in PGT like sucrose synthase and neutral/alkaline invertases that are important for channelling carbon from sucrose in non-photosynthetic tissues [ 27]. These enzymes convert sucrose to hexose phosphates. Plastids in the PGTs are the main sites of secondary metabolism. In contrast to chloroplasts, plastids of heterotrophic tissues have to rely on the import of ATP and carbon to drive their metabolic processes. We checked our set of differentially expressed unigenes to see if any known transporters are present. In most plants glucose 6-phosphate seems to be the preferred hexose phosphate taken up by nongreen plastids. The transporter proteins responsible for this import of carbon into plastids are known as Glc6P–phosphate translocator (GPT) and transcript similar to GPT was seen enriched in PGT (about 30 times more in PGT). This carbon can be used for starch biosynthesis or for the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway in plastids [ 28]. GO terms for oxidative pentose phosphate pathways were seen enriched in PGT. Additionally transcript similar to plastidic Phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator was found to be expressed more in PGT. They are involved in the transport of phosphoenolpyruvate, an energy rich glycolytic intermediate from the cytoplasm into the plastids [ 29]. Further, ATP generated either by glycolysis or by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria can be imported into non- green plastids by plastidic nucleotide transporter (NTT). Transcript similar to NTT was also observed to be more abundant in PGT [ 29]. Analysis of spearmint PGT transcription factors Although the cloning and functional characterization of enzymes involved in terpene biosynthesis has been quite successful in various plants, knowledge about regulation of these secretory trichome specific pathways is very rudimentary. Studies in peppermint show a close association between enzyme activity and transcript abundance for all gene/enzyme pairs, suggesting that, essential oil biosynthesis is primarily influenced at the transcriptional level [ 12, 17, 18, 30]. Hence, identification of transcription factors that globally control metabolic pathway will provide an attractive strategy for engineering terpene production. Similarly, knowledge about the development of secretory glandular trichomes, the so-called factories of important terpenoid production, is very limited. Most of the transcription factors involved with trichome development have been isolated from Arabidopsis, which lacks secretory trichomes. Studies in tobacco and tomato are beginning to show that multicellular secretory trichomes and unicellular trichomes of Arabidopsis are not homologous structures, and they likely develop under different regulatory conditions [ 31]. Our analysis of transcriptome data of young leaves or PGT did not uncover any transcripts that matched those of the major known trichome initiating gene transcripts from Arabidopsis, like  TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1, GLABRA1, GLABRA3 [ 32]. Either these genes are not expressed or are expressed at a different developmental stage of leaves or PGT than the stage used in this study. Table  1 shows the top 20 transcription factors that were significantly more abundant in PGT when compared to leaf-PGT. The MEP (2-Cmethyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate) pathway is more abundant in spearmint PGT than the MVA (mevalonate) pathway The building blocks for all different classes of terpenes produced by plants are C5 units of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). They are generated either by plastidial MEP or cytoplasmic MVA pathway. The MEP pathway requires seven enzymes to synthesize IPP and DMAPP from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates which feed the monoterpene pathway [ 33]. From peppermint EST studies it has been proposed that the active pathway for the formation of IPP/DMAPP in the PGT is the MEP pathway. This is consistent with our analysis too where MEP pathway transcripts were more abundant in PGT than MVA. High expression of MEP pathway transcripts correlates well with the production of monoterpenes in PGT. It has been reported that 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), the first enzyme of this pathway is important for the overall regulation of the pathway [ 34]. Multiple  DXS genes have been found in plants like  Zea mays,  Medicago truncatula, Oryza sativa, Ginkgo biloba and  Pinus densiflora and  Picea abies [ 35- 40]. In all these plants, two or three candidate  DXS genes have been reported. From our data we were able to identify 2 different 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) unigenes showing different levels of abundance in PGT. The number of genes coding for each MEP pathway enzyme varies from plant to plant [ 33, 41]. Presence of multiple genes with differential tissue-specific expression levels might contribute towards the regulation of the MEP pathway, in different organs of the plant. Figure  5 shows the number of unigenes identified for each enzyme of the MEP pathway and their RNA seq expression levels. In cases of enzymes with more than one unigene, the unigene with the highest abundance in PGT was taken into consideration. Their expression was further validated by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). From our RNA seq data and qRT-PCR analysis, DXR and MCT transcript levels were low when compared to levels of other enzymes in MEP pathway. This might suggest that possibly these two enzymes are the rate limiting steps of this pathway. A possible option to explore in future will be to enhance the expression level of various rate limiting steps to enhance the production of terpenes. In contrast to the MEP pathway, the transcript levels of MVA enzymes were very low. For RNA seq expression levels of unigenes involved in this pathway refer Additional file  6. Their expression was validated by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). MVA pathway derived IPP is generally believed to be used for the production of cytosolic sesquiterpenes, triterpenes and mitochondrial terpenes. In addition to monoterpenes, mint produces a few sesquiterpenes although at much lower quantities than monoterpenes [ 9, 42]. Lower level of MVA pathway can be one of the reasons. Interestingly, the transcripts of genes involved in the MEP pathway are also enriched in  Artemisia annua trichomes, glandular trichomes of Hops and in Snapdragon flowers where sesquiterpene metabolism dominates [ 43- 45] suggesting that the MEP pathway can also feed sesquiterpene production. Studies with labelled substrate predict exchange of metabolites between the MVA and MEP pathways [ 46, 47]. How the IPP/DMAPP formed by MEP pathway is utilized to synthesize sesquiterpenes in mint remains to be investigated. Monoterpene production is enriched in spearmint PGT Subsequent condensation reactions between IPP and DMAPP are catalysed by GPP synthases (GPPS) that leads to the formation of geranyl diphosphate (GPP; C10) the precursor for monoterpenes. The conversion of IPP to DMAPP and its equilibrium is maintained by IPP isomerase (IPPI). In most plant species this enzyme is encoded by a single gene whereas Arabidopsis has two IPPI genes [ 33]. We found 2 IPPI unigenes in spearmint both enriched in PGT. Peppermint GPPS (Mp GPPS) is a two-component heteromeric enzyme consisting of a large and a small subunit, and both the subunits are catalytically inactive by themselves [ 48, 49]. In spearmint too, we found unigenes for both the small and large subunits of GPP synthase that showed high expression in PGT. The major constituent of spearmint essential oil is (−) carvone which is synthesised from GPP in a three step reaction. Transcripts for all the three enzymes involved in above reaction, Limonene synthase (LS), Limonene-6-hydroxylase (L6OH) and carveol dehydrogenase (CD) were highly expressed in PGT and verified by q-RT-PCR (Figure  6 and Additional file  4). Interestingly, the precursor for menthol in peppermint and (−) carvone in spearmint is the same limonene. In peppermint it is oxygenated by (2)-4S-limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH) to form (2)-trans-isopiperitenol and it enters the menthol pathway whereas in spearmint limonene is oxygenated by (2)-4S-limonene- 6-hydroxylase (L6OH) to form (2)-trans-carveol. Both these enzymes show a 70% identity at the amino acid level with major differences localized to the presumptive active sites [ 50]. The spearmint L6OH transcript is highly expressed in PGT as expected but the full set of downstream redox enzymes isopiperitenone reductase, (+)-pulegone reductase, and menthone reductase involved in menthol pathway were also found but poorly expressed in PGT. A previous study has shown that (−) carvone is not an efficient substrate for the initial double-bond reductase, therefore (−) carvone accumulates in spearmint even though the downstream redox enzymes are present [ 11, 51]. Hence, the abundance of a single enzyme L6OH instead of L3OH changes the final monoterpene produced. This shows how simple changes in the production of a single intermediate can result in drastic changes in the metabolic profiles. When compared to heterodimeric GPP synthase, transcripts for farnesyl diphosphate synthase which is responsible for the formation of farnesyl diphosphate precursor for sesquiterpenes, is expressed around 4 times less in PGT. Apart from low MVA pathway, low levels of FPP synthase transcripts might also contribute to the reduced sesquiterpene production in mint PGT. Functional characterization of Terpene Synthases (TPS) from spearmint In plants, specific TPSs are responsible for the synthesis of various terpene molecules from the common precursors. Our transcriptome data provides a rich resource for identifying and functionally characterizing new TPSs from spearmint. From our enriched unigenes, we found 16 that were identified as terpene synthases; all of them were more than 1 kb and 10 of them were encoding full-length open reading frames (ORFs). We found TPSs annotated as limonene synthase, (E)-β-farnesene synthase, bicyclogermacrene synthase and cis muuroladiene synthase being preferentially expressed in PGT. However, the exact functional annotation of a new TPS requires activity characterization of the recombinant protein. In mint species, to our knowledge limonene synthase from spearmint [ 52], ( E)-β-farnesene synthase from peppermint [ 42] and cis-muuroladiene synthase from black peppermint [ 53] have been previously characterised with respect to their functions. From our RNA seq data we chose to characterize two unannotated full-length TPS. Phylogenetic comparison (Additional file  7) showed that both MsTPS1 and MsTPS2 belonged to the TPS-a subfamily of angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases. The main sesquiterpenes identified by GC-MS analysis in our spearmint variety were (E)-β-farnesene, β-caryophyllene, α-caryophyllene (Humulene), cis murola-3-5 diene, β-copaene, bicyclogermacrene and bicyclosesquiphellandrene. To determine MsTPS1 and MsTPS2 enzymatic activities, the full-length open reading frame encoding these enzymes were overexpressed in  E.coli, purified and used for in vitro assays with GPP or FPP as substrate. In the presence of FPP MsTPS1 catalysed the formation of β-caryophyllene in vitro (Figure  7A) whereas MsTPS2 produced a peak from FPP that was identified as one of β-cubebene/Germacrene D/β-copaene by GCMS (Figure  7B). β-copaene was observed in our mint leaf GC-MS data suggesting that MsTPS2 is most likely to be β-copaene synthase. Both the TPSs failed to produce a peak with GPP as substrate (Figure  7A and B). Thus, our in vitro studies identified them to be sesquiterpene synthases. Furthermore, transient  Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated plant expression [ 54] was used to investigate the terpenes produced by  MsTPS1 and  MsTPS2 in planta. Both  MsTPS1 and  MSTPS2 under the control of a 35S promoter were transiently expressed in  N. benthamiana leaves by  Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration. The compounds were analysed 3 dpi (days post-infiltration) by GC-MS. Both TPSs failed to form any new peak when observed by GC-MS. Studies have shown that overexpressing enzyme 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase (HMGR), a rate limiting step of the mevalonate pathway increases heterologous plant sesquiterpene production [ 55]. Accordingly, both the TPSs were coexpressed with HMGR  in planta to observe the production of sesquiterpenes. MsTPS1 with HMGR produced β-caryophyllene as the major peak and α-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide as minor peaks Additional file  8. MsTPS2 even with HMGR failed to produce any new peaks  in planta suggesting that the compound formed by MsTPS2 might be further metabolised endogenously by the plant (data not shown). Sesquiterpene synthesis is thought to take place in the cytoplasm while monoterpene synthesis is believed to occur in plastids. Since our biochemical characterization shows that  MsTPS1 and  MsTPS2 are sesquiterpene synthases, we examined subcellular localization of these proteins in transient studies in tobacco leaves. YFP-tagged MsTPSs were transiently expressed in  N. benthamiana leaf cells by  Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration and visualized 3 dpi using the YFP channel of a confocal microscope. Both the MsTPSs showed cytoplasmic localization (Additional file  9) and their sequence analysis also showed lack of plastid targeting sequences which further affirms that these TPSs are sesquiterpene synthases. Therefore, either by sequence similarity or by functional characterization we were able to identify all the major terpene synthases that are responsible for the formation of major spearmint essential oil components. Spearmint PGTs as plants chemical defense organs Many of the secondary metabolites produced by glandular trichomes play a role in plant defence. Majority of them fall into the category of terpenes, phenylpropenes, flavonoids, methyl ketones, acyl sugars and defensive proteins. Apart from having a rich terpene pathway, spearmint PGT also shows presence of transcripts that are involved in the production of different secondary metabolites that may have a role in plant defense. Transcripts encoding enzymes for phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumarate CoA-ligase were seen expressed in PGT. These enzymes are involved in phenylpropanoid production. Presence of a variety of small molecular weight phenylpropanoids like caffeic, rosmarinic and ferulic acids has been detected in leaves of different mint germplasm [ 56]. Transcripts similar to Caffeate O-methyltransferase, an enzyme required for the conversion of caffeic acid into ferulic acid was preferentially expressed in PGT. Chalcone flavanone isomerase an enzyme in the flavonoid pathway in plants was also preferentially expressed in PGT. Unigenes encoding transcripts similar to plant invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitors were highly expressed in PGT which are important to defend against plant pathogens [ 57, 58]. All the above transcripts were verified by qRT-PCR (Additional file  4). Oxylipins are large family of biologically active oxidized fatty acid-derivatives that are important for plant defense responses. They are produced mainly by the combined action of lipases, lipoxygenases (LOXs) and members of cytochrome P450 (CYP74) family specialized in metabolizing fatty acids hydroperoxides (HPs). HPs form the initial substrates for different branches of the oxylipin pathway [ 59- 62]. We found enzymes involved in oxidation of fatty acids expressed more in PGTs. Transcripts similar to phospholipase A, lipoxygenase and allene oxide synthase and allene oxide cyclase were enriched in PGT. Allene oxide synthase and allene oxide cyclase are members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP74) family and are involved in the LOX pathways [ 63, 64]. All the above mentioned transcripts showed a minimum of 8 times enrichment in PGT and were confirmed by qRT-PCR. However to understand the role of these enzymes in plant defence and exact nature of oxylipins formed by them, further characterization is essential, especially in terms of their positional specificity and substrate specificity. Plants possess both basal and inducible mechanisms to defend themselves against pathogens. The transcriptome data reflects the basal or constitutive state of defense mechanism existing in spearmint PGT. The changes in transcript abundance in all the above mentioned genes on stress induction will provide a better understanding of how PGT act as chemical defence organs."," Background Plant glandular trichomes are chemical factories with specialized metabolic capabilities to produce diverse compounds. Aromatic mint plants produce valuable essential oil in specialised glandular trichomes known as peltate glandular trichomes (PGT). Here, we performed next generation transcriptome sequencing of different tissues of Mentha spicata (spearmint) to identify differentially expressed transcripts specific to PGT. Our results provide a comprehensive overview of PGT's dynamic metabolic activities which will help towards pathway engineering. Results Spearmint RNAs from 3 different tissues: PGT, leaf and leaf stripped of PGTs (leaf-PGT) were sequenced by Illumina paired end sequencing. The sequences were assembled de novo into 40,587 non-redundant unigenes; spanning a total of 101 Mb. Functions could be assigned to 27,025 (67%) unigenes and among these 3,919 unigenes were differentially expressed in PGT relative to leaf - PGT. Lack of photosynthetic transcripts in PGT transcriptome indicated the high levels of purity of isolated PGT, as mint PGT are non-photosynthetic. A significant number of these unigenes remained unannotated or encoded hypothetical proteins. We found 16 terpene synthases (TPS), 18 cytochrome P450s, 5 lipid transfer proteins and several transcription factors that were preferentially expressed in PGT. Among the 16 TPSs, two were characterized biochemically and found to be sesquiterpene synthases. Conclusions The extensive transcriptome data set renders a complete description of genes differentially expressed in spearmint PGT. This will facilitate the metabolic engineering of mint terpene pathway to increase yield and also enable the development of strategies for sustainable production of novel or altered valuable compounds in mint.",,"['PGT', 'Spearmint PGT', 'MEP pathway', 'pathway', 'Additional file', 'PGTs', 'unigenes', 'Spearmint', 'MEP', 'transcripts']","[PGTs, PGT, PGT, PGT, leaf-PGT, Trinotate [, RNA-seq, PGT, PGT, WRKYs, PGT, leaf-PGT, PGT (, PGT, leaf-PGT, leaf-PGT, PGTs, “, ”, PGT-specific, PGT-specific, cytochrome P450s, Cytochrome P450s, LTPs, PGT, PGTs, PGT, PGT, leaf-PGT, PGT, PGT, leaf-PGT, PGT, PGTs, PGT, cytochrome P450, PGT, PGT, Mint PGTs, PGT like sucrose synthase, neutral/alkaline invertases, PGTs, glucose 6-phosphate, Glc6P–, GPT, GPT, PGT, PGT, PGT, PGT, green plastids, PGT [ 29, PGT, TESTA GLABRA1, GLABRA1, PGT, PGT, leaf-PGT, 2-Cmethyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate, glyceraldehyde 3, PGT, PGT, PGT, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, PGT, PGT, MCT, GPPS, geranyl diphosphate, DMAPP, IPP isomerase, PGT, Mp GPPS, PGT, Limonene-6-hydroxylase, L6OH, carveol dehydrogenase, PGT, (2)-4S-limonene-3-hydroxylase, L3OH, (2)-trans-isopiperitenol, (2)-4S-limonene- 6-hydroxylase, L6OH, (2)-trans-carveol, PGT, PGT, L6OH, L3OH, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, PGT, PGT, MsTPS1, MsTPS2, MsTPS1, MsTPS2, FPP MsTPS1, β-caryophyllene, MsTPS2, MsTPS2, Coenzyme A Reductase, HMGR  , MsTPS1, HMGR, MsTPS2, MsTPS2, MsTPSs, YFP, MsTPSs, phenylalanine ammonia, 4-coumarate CoA-ligase, PGT, O-methyltransferase, PGT, Chalcone flavanone isomerase, PGT, invertase/pectin methylesterase, PGT, LOXs, cytochrome P450, CYP74, PGTs, phospholipase A, lipoxygenase, PGT, cytochrome P450, CYP74, LOX, PGT, PGT]","['TPSs,', '(TPS)', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS.', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'TPS-a', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPS2', 'TPSs', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPS1', 'MSTPS2', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPS1', 'MsTPS2', 'MsTPSs', 'MsTPSs', 'TPSs']",[],[],terpene synthase

Further, in case a single journal article lists three different sets of volatile profiles, say for three different plant parts, or under three independent stresses, we treat the datasets as three independent records. Currently, the database contains a total of 123 041 such records spanning a century of published reports of essential oil profiles, starting from early 1900s to date. These records have been sourced from over 1520 citations and the data includes 1618 plant species, subspecies or varieties representing 92 distinct taxonomic families encompassing the entire range from ancient and lower plants like chlorophytes and mosses, to the gymnosperms and angiosperms.  Figure 2 provides an estimate of the geographical and taxonomical distribution of the records and it can be seen that families over represented in the data belong to high volatile content taxa such as the Myrtaceae, Apiaceae and Lamiaceae. The extensive amount of data for these taxa, along with lists of essential oils from mosses and volatile hydrocarbons from algae to pines may assist in deducing patterns between phylogeny of plants and their emission profiles. Essential oils were extracted from distinct aerial or underground plant structures such as leaf, root, rhizome, seed, bark, flower, fruit or any combination of these or even the whole plant ( 17). The material used for extraction may further be fresh, dry, juice extract or lab-dried, or it may have been harvested at a certain developmental stage such as ripe, semiripe or unripe fruits, woody or non-woody branches etc. EssOilDB integrates these aspects wherever possible in order to collate available information about the material used for obtaining essential oils and users can browse through more than 160 different types of plant part/sub-part categories. For each compound, EssOilDB includes known information about any associated biological activity, and the current version of the database lists these properties for 44 787 records. These records comprise various combinations of over 200 distinct activities that have pharmacological, commercial or agroindustrial relevance. In view of the fact that a majority of essential oils comprised terpenoid compounds and their derivatives, the database contains information about the type or general chemical classification, wherever possible, such as a the specific class of terpenes. For example, alpha-pinene is a monoterpene, while gamma-murolene belongs to the sesquiterpene category. The database contains relatively fewer diterpenes records; namely abietol, cembrene, isopimara-7,15-diene, phytane, phytol and sclareol, which in turn, reflect the fact that diterpenes are generally not volatile in nature. Currently more than 40 categories are recorded in this section, providing information on whether a compound under consideration is an alcohol, fatty acid, ketone, ether, mono-, di- or sesqui-terpene etc. As mentioned earlier, evidence for invasive nature of a given plant under study has been incorporated wherever available, and EssOilDB presently has 2806 essential oil records obtained from invasive plants located across the major continents of the world. The data is specially relevant in the Indian context as it contains volatile profiles of highly invasive species in various parts of India, of which  Lantana camara has the highest number of records followed by  Ageratum conyzoides. The analysis of these essential oil profiles of invasive plants may provide the opportunity to identify the specific patterns present between plant volatiles and their invasive nature if any. Further, this knowledge may also be used to find the significance of specific volatiles in the development of invasive nature and these concepts may be introduced practically to gain benefit in agricultural perspectives.  Benchmarking analysis We have benchmarked EssOilDB by carrying out a comparative assessment of its features with existing public databases contributing significant information on essential oils. Some of these are EOUdb (Essential Oil University database), AromaWeb ( http://www.aromaweb.com/), Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases ( http://www.ars-grin.gov/duke/) and the Cropwatch files ( http://www.cropwatch.org/). EOUdb is an online chemical reference database ( http://essentialoils.org/eoudb/) with a login requirement, and it provides information on essential oils and their chemical composition, although details about source plant, taxonomy or ecological factors is entirely lacking. Aromaweb is dedicated to holistic aromatherapy and accordingly limited to just over one hundred essential oil profiles that are most important for the perfumery industry. The Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases are not limited to essential oils and contain vast information on all kinds of phytochemicals including sugars and proteins as well. There is also no direct way to browse the data, users have to necessarily type the name of the chemical, plant or activity of interest. Since this resource is motivated by diagnosis and medication, the records do not mention any citation details or extraction methods, providing only a list of chemicals along with activities, benefits and source plant organs and references to personal notes or text books. The Cropwatch files essentially represent a resource for surveys and critical opinions about aromatic products from commercial sources, rather than an essential oil database, per se. Many commercial essential oil databases such as Essential Oil Bioactivity Research Database, Essential oil component database ( http://www.quintessential.uk.com/index.php), LabAroma ( http://www.labaroma.com) are also available, but they emphasize on literature and information based on the bioactivity aspect of essential oils, catering mainly to the cosmetic and perfumery industry. In addition to this, ESO 2000 ( http://www.leffingwell.com/baciseso.htm) for quantitative analysis of essential oil is also commercially available but it has no contextual data on stress or invasive nature of the plants under study. A detailed comparative chart listing the features available in various databases is provided in See online  supplementary material for  Supplementary Table S1. It clearly reveals EssOilDB as the only public database that is dedicated to the biology of essential oils and may reliably be used for scientific research on patterns and profiles of essential oils and their variations across a variety of contextual situations. Association of essential oil data with genetic, phenological and ecological factors Several studies have been carried out to compare essential oil profiles under different experimental conditions. EssOilDB offers a major advancement to such studies as it provides information about specific environmental factors associated with essential oil records, thereby facilitating a comparative analysis under normal and user-specific plant conditions, which may be studied individually or in combination with other factors. Apart from available volatile profiles under normal conditions, EssOilDB has 30 883 records in which essential oil profiles have been measured and published based on a given factor as depicted in the form of a chart in  Figure 3. These records represent variations in developmental stages, spatial distribution, seasonal variation, mutant analysis, isolation techniques, population- or cultivar-based variation, as well as different kinds of abiotic and biotic stress conditions ( Figure 3). Geographical distribution studies are the topmost among all factors in the database with 8685 records. The major reports of this section include the analysis of essential oil composition of a plant species across different altitudes, habitats and populations, providing insights about spatial location based intraspecific variations. The second highest factor incorporated in the database is climatic changes (4657) in which the effect of different temperature, rainfall and day length is mapped to the volatile composition profile of a given plant. The transition from one developmental stage to another such as vegetative to reproductive is inter-connected with variety of factors such as photoperiod, temperature, nutrients and hormones. The database has 3393 records in which changes in chemical profiles are studied under various stages of growth and development during the life history of plants. Interestingly, there have been several reports on the combinatorial effect of seasonal change and developmental stage variation on plant essential oil composition, and EssOilDB contains many such records that can be browsed by users.  Figure 4 clarifies this aspect with a clustered view of the essential oils emitted under some of the specific conditions described above, each condition being depicted in distinct colors. EssOilDB thereby enables analysis of compounds emitted under user-specific combinations of conditions, such as the oils that may be specific to a given cultivar at a given geographical location. As can be seen from  Figure 4, emissions can be distinguished based on whether they are completely unique to a particular feature or may be commonly released between multiple conditions. For example, a large number of compounds synthesized under stress are unique, whereas compounds that are released based on developmental stage variations or seasonal variations are common to a majority of the conditions analysed. Such common compounds may vary by the exact amounts emitted by the respective plants, which may in turn, depend upon the condition or feature being studied. One such example has been provided in the next section, where a plant produces the same compounds before and after stress, but there is a drastic change in the amounts released upon infection. As discussed earlier, there are many isolation techniques used for the extraction of essential oils and the comparative analysis of these techniques are also reported on the basis of quality and quantity of essential oils obtained by applying them. EssOilDB includes 2872 records providing comparative lists of volatiles extracted through different methods. The chemistry of volatiles has been shown to be differential under the effect of genetic variants such as mutants, cultivars, and populations. The database incorporates genetic factor based compositional profiles that may be used for associating genotype variations with the manifestation of distinct chemical phenotypes. Plants exhibit significant variation in essential oil profiles based on variation in ecological factors, such as the nature of habitat, their abundance and abiotic and biotic factors ( 26). One of the major strengths of EssOilDB is that it can facilitate visualization of emission related variations in diverse plant conditions, providing insights into the cause of such variations. Apart from conditional variations associated with either the plant or the extraction procedure as described above, it can be very valuable to understand compositional variations in the emission itself, and such studies are facilitated in EssOilDB through incorporation of detailed information on the identified chemical compounds within essential oil bouquets, including their registry number, percentage emission, general chemical classification, chemical formula and biological activity, as described in methods.  Terpene variability in the plant kingdom As an illustrative example, we have used EssOilDB to carry out an assessment of the relationship between terpene biosynthetic pathways and actual emission records. The biosynthesis of monoterpenes and diterpenes is conventionally believed to be compartmentalized in plastidial territory of the plant where the 2C-Methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway is known to be located. In contrast, sesquiterpenes and triterpenes are supposed to be synthesized in cytosol through classical mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway ( 27). This assumption is further supported by recent studies on promoter analysis in  Arabidopsis thaliana that suggest an abundance of light and circadian clock related motifs in MEP pathway gene promoters reflecting higher expression of this pathway in green tissues as compared to MVA pathway ( 28). Spatiotemporal expression analysis of genes encoding farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), geranyl pyrophospate synthase (GPPS) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS) in  A. thaliana have also supported the fact that photosynthetic tissues have higher expression of  AtGPPS and  AtGGPPS genes ; generally assumed to synthesize monoterpenes and diterpenes respectively. In contrast, the  AtFPPS gene , which is responsible for the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes, showed higher activity in roots and seeds as compared to above ground, green parts ( 28). We used EssOilDB to test this hypothesis and found that green parts of plants (that are likely to have a more active plastidial MEP pathway) do indeed show relatively greater amounts of released hemi, mono and diterpenes, as compared to sesquiterpenes. In contrast, the non-green plant parts, such as the underground regions and woody parts (signifying an absence of plastidial units and therefore a less active MEP pathway) release higher amounts of sesquiterpenes as compared to monoterpenes. This has been depicted in  Figure 5A, with emission data records from green (plastidial) parts, leaves, fruits and flowers releasing a higher percentage of monoterpenes as compared to sesquiterpenes, whereas roots and bark or woody parts release more sesquiterpenes, thus significantly adding value to the hypothesis.  Terpene diversity in the plant kingdom OilDB data was used in conjunction with genomic data in order to understand how a plant creates the so-called final terpenome, specific to itself, and whether or not plants tap the complete potential for terpene biosynthesis at their disposal according to their genomes. For selected plant species with publicly available genome sequence data, we correlated the ‘actual/observed’ terpene emissions (as recorded in EssOilDB) with ‘expected’ terpene content, (as predicted by a computational identification of TPS genes) for that genome.  Table 1 shows this data for 11 distinct plant species, where the terpene potential of the genome (terpenome) has been compared with the observed or actual terpene emission from EssOilDb records. As can be seen from this table, the available emission profiles appear to only partially capture the full terpene potential. For example, in case of  Eucalyptus, the emission of only 21 monoterpenes have been recorded in literature, whereas the genome of this plant contains genes that code for more than double this number of monoterpene synthases. This is the case with many other plants analysed in this effort, and it may be explained by limitations of record compilations or the unavailability of data under stress for the plant, since these are secondary metabolites induced for specific functions and a large number of biosynthetic genes may lie dormant under natural conditions. Interestingly, a few plants like the legume crop chickpea ( Cicer arietinum) show a contrasting trend, wherein more terpene emissions have been recorded in literature than the predicted genomic potential (Marked in bold font in  Table 1). This means that the number of TPS gene models in the plant genome is less than the total number of terpenes released by that plant, reflecting in turn, the unique ability of TPS enzymes to synthesize multiple products from a single substrate. A single predicted TPS gene product can thus generate many terpene compounds rather than only one, and this ability to create complex odor profiles from a minimal gene set can lead to an expansion of the terpene potential of the respective genome. Further characterization and detailed analysis of such genes may provide insights into the unique molecular mechanism of TPSs that remains poorly understood. This study illustrates the use of EssOilDB for addressing complex and interesting questions in terpene biology and in identification of new avenues for scientific research.  Alteration in terpene emission profiles under stress Extensive research has been carried out to elucidate the stress responses of plants, including the investigation of essential oil compositions under adversity. Accordingly, EssOilDB contains records displaying the observed variability of volatile compositions in different abiotic and biotic stress conditions; and this data would be indispensable in mapping volatile release to the extent of stress. Emission profiles of plants often show significant changes in oil composition under various biotic and abiotic stress conditions. For example, EssOilDb records show that viral stress induces the release of two monoterpenes  Echinacea purpurea ( 29) . As depicted in  Figure 5B,  E.purpurea releases over 50 compounds during cucumber mosaic virus infection, and although these compounds are also released under normal conditions, the percentage emissions vary. Thus, it can be clearly seen that myrcene and alpha-pinene (both monoterpenes) are synthesized and released in higher amounts under stress. Similarly, sesquiterpenes emission has been recorded to increase under blue light in  Ocimum selloi, and as shown in  Figure 5C, drought stress records from EssOilDB reveal the induction of monoterpene carvacrol in  Nigella sativa whereas other monoterpenes show decreased emission under stress ( 30,  31). The database also contains records exposing the induced emission of beta-caryophyllene (a sesquiterpene) in severe salt stress from stems alone, suggesting that emission profiles can significantly vary with plant parts. Interestingly, emission patterns recorded in EssOilDB show significant difference in cases of natural and artificial infection, or based on the noxious state of a plant, or whether it is an introduced plant. This complex emission pattern indicates that the specific isoprenoid compound, type and degree of stress conditions, plant species and plant parts are dynamically co-ordinated by a multi-layered and finely tuned regulatory network that excellently controls isoprenoid biosynthesis and its emission.","Plant essential oils are complex mixtures of volatile organic compounds, which play indispensable roles in the environment, for the plant itself, as well as for humans. The potential biological information stored in essential oil composition data can provide an insight into the silent language of plants, and the roles of these chemical emissions in defense, communication and pollinator attraction. In order to decipher volatile profile patterns from a global perspective, we have developed the ESSential OIL DataBase (EssOilDB), a continually updated, freely available electronic database designed to provide knowledge resource for plant essential oils, that enables one to address a multitude of queries on volatile profiles of native, invasive, normal or stressed plants, across taxonomic clades, geographical locations and several other biotic and abiotic influences. To our knowledge, EssOilDB is the only database in the public domain providing an opportunity for context based scientific research on volatile patterns in plants. EssOilDB presently contains 123 041 essential oil records spanning a century of published reports on volatile profiles, with data from 92 plant taxonomic families, spread across diverse geographical locations all over the globe. We hope that this huge repository of VOCs will facilitate unraveling of the true significance of volatiles in plants, along with creating potential avenues for industrial applications of essential oils. We also illustrate the use of this database in terpene biology and show how EssOilDB can be used to complement data from computational genomics to gain insights into the diversity and variability of terpenoids in the plant kingdom. EssOilDB would serve as a valuable information resource, for students and researchers in plant biology, in the design and discovery of new odor profiles, as well as for entrepreneurs--the potential for generating consumer specific scents being one of the most attractive and interesting topics in the cosmetic industry.

26,26,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4452144\eupmc_result.json,PMC4452144,"Results Reaction of pure ( E)-β-farnesene with ozone and its protective effects We tested whether the reaction of ( E)-β-farnesene with ozone, which has been observed in smog chambers [ 28], could remove substantial amounts of ozone from the air surrounding a living plant, and whether such removal would prevent ozone-induced foliar necrosis. Injecting 1 µl pure ( E)-β-farnesene into empty chambers containing ca. 500 ppb ozone lowered within-chamber ozone concentrations by >100 ppb within a few minutes ( Fig 1A). The disappearance of ( E)-β-farnesene from chambers containing 350 ppb ozone ( Fig 1B) provided additional evidence that the drop in ozone resulted from reaction of ozone with ( E)-β-farnesene. To test whether  (E)-β-farnesene-mediated ozone destruction in the leaf headspace would protect plants, we supplemented the ozone-susceptible  N.  tabacum cv. BelW3 with external ( E)-β-farnesene diluted in acetonitrile and impregnated into cotton tampons. A dose of 2000 μg plant -1 h -1 visibly reduced ozone-induced foliar necrosis ( Fig 1C), but was unrealistically high given the sesquiterpene emission rates reported from plants [ 45]. In contrast, a physiologically plausible dose of 20 μg plant -1 h -1 was not protective ( Fig 1C). Leaf extractions showed that even during 350 ppb ozone fumigation, some ( E)-β-farnesene from the 2000 μg plant -1 h -1 treatment reached and was retained in the leaf, although the 10-fold greater leaf retention in the control fumigation suggested that most  (E)-β-farnesene was destroyed in the headspace ( Fig 1D). Sesquiterpene content and emission from transformed  N.  attenuata plants External supplementation indicated that the reaction of ( E)-β-farnesene with ozone could protect plants by destroying ozone in the headspace around leaves. Yet whether endogenous ( E)-β-farnesene production would be sufficient to achieve leaf protection, either by acting in the headspace or within the leaf itself, remained unclear. To test for benefits of endogenous production, we transformed  N.  attenuata with two versions of a maize sesquiterpene synthase expressed behind a constitutive 35S promoter. The enzyme ZmTPS10 (TPS10 line) yielded nearly equal amounts of ( E)-β-farnesene and  (E)-α-bergamotene, whereas the point mutant Zmtps10M produced primarily ( E)-β-farnesene ( Fig 2A and 2B).The amount of transgenic sesquiterpene emission dwarfed native sesquiterpene emission from the wild-type (WT) ( Fig 2A and 2B). Emission of α-duprezianine, the only sesquiterpene recorded from unwounded WT plants [ 38], was less than 5% of total emission in either transformed line and undetectable in leaf extracts. Emission rates were similar in quantity to the lower 20 μg/plant dose used in the BelW3 experiments and robust even to acute ozone exposure (3 h, 300 ppb) ( Fig 2A and 2B). TPS10 plants tended to emit higher levels of both sesquiterpenes following ozone exposure, although these increases were not statistically significant (Welch’s t-test, ( E)-β-farnesene:  t(2.29) = 1.11,  p = 0.36;  (E)-α-bergamotene:  t(2.35) = 1.21,  p = 0.33). Emission of the TPS10- and TPS10M-catalyzed sesquiterpenes from the transformed  N.  attenuata lines was approximately twice as high as the sesquiterpene emission rate measured from herbivore-damaged maize plants, and exceeded undamaged plant emission by an order of magnitude [ 22]. Within-leaf sesquiterpenes ( Fig 2C) qualitatively resembled emitted sesquiterpenes; within-leaf concentrations averaged 0.4 μg/g fresh mass and were on the same order of magnitude as the 1.4 μg/g observed in BelW3 leaves during the high-dose (2000 μg/plant) external supplementation experiments without ozone treatment ( Fig 1D). Leaf sesquiterpene pools in the transformants were similar to the 0.733 μg/g reported by Köllner and colleagues for seedling-stage, herbivore-elicited maize leaves [ 46], which was the highest value recorded among all tissue types and developmental stages. Ozone treatment of sesquiterpene synthase transformants Sesquiterpene synthase-transformed and WT  N.  attenuata had similar visible and physiological responses to ozone treatment. Leaf necrosis was apparent to equal extents in TPS10 and WT after the 6 h, 300 ppb ozone treatment ( Fig 3A). Ozone-fumigated leaves sustained 20-fold increases in salicylic acid (SA,  Fig 3B; treatment:  F(1, 12) = 734.3,  p<0.001) and significant decreases in moisture content ( Fig 3C; treatment:  F(1, 15) = 25.95,  p<0.001)) and photosynthetic rate ( Fig 3D; treatment:  F(1, 15) = 7.81,  p<0.016), all common effects of ozone exposure [ 47]. A two-way ANOVA showed no significant genotype by treatment interaction in any of these metrics (SA:  F(1, 12) = 0.88,  p = 0.37; moisture:  F(1, 15) = 0.07,  p = 0.80; photosynthetic rate:  F(1, 15) = 0.04,  p = 0.85). Surprisingly, ozone treatment had no significant effect on three markers of oxidative stress in leaves: malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation ( Fig 3E; treatment:  F(1, 12) = 0.55,  p = 0.47); oxidative radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) ( Fig 3F; treatment:  F(1, 12) = 0.49,  p = 0.50); and rutin ( Fig 3G; treatment:  F(1, 12) = 0.16,  p = 0.69), a flavonoid glycoside that dominates the leaf phenolic profile of  N.  attenuata and whose induction plays a role in UVB tolerance [ 39]. A TPS10M line (596.1, hereafter ""TPS10M2"") was also included in the experiment, but results from this line were omitted due to its delayed stem elongation: the leaves of the shorter TPS10M plants were further away from the ozone inlets at the top of the chamber and likely did not experience equivalent ozone concentrations. In numerous replicate experiments, responses of this TPS10M line to ozone did not differ from those of WT ( S3 Fig). UVB treatment of sesquiterpene synthase transformants To directly test for within-leaf antioxidant effects of sesquiterpenes, we exposed sesquiterpene synthase-transformed and WT plants to UVB irradiation. Since we had evidence of ( E)-β-farnesene’s reactivity and protective potential from the ozone experiments with BelW3, and we hypothesized that protection against UVB exposure would accrue from within-leaf terpenes, we used the TPS10M line with the highest leaf ( E)-β-farnesene content (line 596.1, TPS10M2). To control for effects of transformation unrelated to sesquiterpenes, we included a second, independently transformed TPS10M line (line 334.6, TPS10M1). The morphological responses of both TPS10M and WT leaves, which assumed a curled appearance and crispy texture, testified to the severity of the UVB exposure ( Fig 4A). After 8 days of treatment, phenolic content increased significantly in all lines ( Fig 4B; treatment:  F(1, 28) = 12.73,  p = 0.001), while chlorophyll fluorescence ( Fig 4C; treatment:  F(1, 29) = 55.20,  p<0.001) and photosynthetic rate ( Fig 4D; treatment:  F(1, 29) = 24.88,  p<0.001) were significantly decreased, but no significant differences emerged between responses of TPS10M and WT plants (genotype x treatment, phenolic content:  F(2, 28) = 0.62,  p = 0.55; chlorophyll fluorescence:  F(2, 29) = 0.79,  p = 0.47; photosynthetic rate:  F(2, 29) = 0.42,  p = 0.66). MDA measurements did not show a significant treatment effect ( Fig 4E; treatment:  F(1, 12) = 2.45,  p = 0.14). The daily UVB exposure was continued for a total of 8 weeks, leading to significant decreases in height ( Fig 4F; treatment:  F(1, 30) = 157.00,  p<0.001) and seed capsule number ( Fig 4G; treatment:  F(1, 30) = 38.15,  p<0.001), but again, no differences in responses to treatment appeared between genotypes (genotype x treatment, height:  F(2, 30) = 0.50,  p = 0.61; seed capsule number:  F(2, 30) = 0.16,  p = 0.86). Drought treatment of sesquiterpene synthase transformants We tested for ( E)-β-farnesene-mediated resistance to drought stress using the same two TPS10M lines used in the UV experiment. Within 3 d of treatment onset, all drought-treatment plants raised their leaves, a sign of water stress in  N.  attenuata. At the time of tissue harvest, 6 days into the treatment, abscisic acid (ABA) levels were double those in controls ( Fig 5A; treatment:  F(1, 24) = 13.39,  p = 0.001) and photosynthesis was decreased by 80% ( Fig 5B; treatment:  F(1, 30) = 562.33,  p<0.001), but responses did not differ between TPS10M and WT (genotype x treatment, ABA:  F(2, 24) = 0.60,  p = 0.56; photosynthesis:  F(2, 30) = 0.12,  p = 0.89). Although shoot MDA did not show a treatment effect ( Fig 5C; treatment:  F(1, 29) = 1.07,  p = 0.31), root MDA increased (treatment:  F(1, 27) = 12.57,  p = 0.001), but to a similar extent in all lines ( Fig 5D; genotype x treatment:  F(2,27) = 0.71,  p = 0.50). Ion leakage also increased (treatment:  F(1, 30) = 8.26,  p = 0.007). Increases tended to be less dramatic in the ( E)-β-farnesene emitter TPS10M1 than in WT, but TPS10M2 was no different from WT in its response, nor was the genotype x treatment term significant in an ANOVA ( Fig 5E; genotype x treatment:  F(2,30) = 1.53,  p = 0.23). Total fresh mass after 6 d of treatment ( Fig 5F; treatment:  F(1, 30) = 50.86,  p<0.001), plant height after 2 weeks of treatment ( Fig 5G; treatment:  F(1, 60) = 152.19,  p<0.001), and seed capsule count after an 11 d drying period in both treatment groups ( Fig 5H; treatment:  F(1, 60) = 16.94,  p<0.001) all showed significant declines with drought, but no differences between the responses of TPS10M and WT (genotype x treatment, fresh mass:  F(2, 30) = 1.72,  p = 0.20; height:  F(2, 60) = 0.53,  p = 0.59; seed capsule number:  F(2, 60) = 1.06,  p = 0.35).","Among the terpenes, isoprene (C5) and monoterpene hydrocarbons (C10) have been shown to ameliorate abiotic stress in a number of plant species via two proposed mechanisms: membrane stabilization and direct antioxidant effects. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (C15) not only share the structural properties thought to lend protective qualities to isoprene and monoterpene hydrocarbons, but also react rapidly with ozone, suggesting that sesquiterpenes may similarly enhance tolerance of abiotic stresses. To test whether sesquiterpenes protect plants against ozone, UVB light, or drought, we used transgenic lines of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata. The transgenic plants expressed a maize terpene synthase gene (ZmTPS10) which produced a blend of (E)-ß-farnesene and (E)-α-bergamotene, or a point mutant of the same gene (ZmTPS10M) which produced (E)-ß-farnesene alone,. (E)-ß-farnesene exerted a local, external, and transient ozone-quenching effect in ozone-fumigated chambers, but we found no evidence that enhanced sesquiterpene production by the plant inhibited oxidative damage, or maintained photosynthetic function or plant fitness under acute or chronic stress. Although the sesquiterpenes (E)-ß-farnesene and (E)-α-bergamotene might confer benefits under intermittent heat stress, which was not tested, any roles in relieving abiotic stress may be secondary to their previously demonstrated functions in biotic interactions.",,"['Fig', 'treatment', 'ozone', 'β-farnesene', 'sesquiterpene', 'ozone treatment', 'plants', 'leaf', 'emission', 'sesquiterpene emission']","[TPS10 line, 2B).The, α-duprezianine, TPS10, TPS10-, μg/g, μg/g, μg/g, Köllner, herbivore-elicited, synthase-transformed, TPS10, WT, SA, TPS10M line, TPS10M2, TPS10M, TPS10M line, synthase-transformed, WT, TPS10M line, TPS10M2, TPS10M line, TPS10M1, TPS10M, TPS10M, 4F, E)-β-farnesene-mediated, TPS10M lines, drought-treatment, abscisic acid, ABA, 562.33, TPS10M, ABA, Ion, TPS10M1, TPS10M2, 5F, TPS10M]","['ZmTPS10', '(TPS10', 'TPS10', 'TPS10-', 'TPS10M-catalyzed', 'TPS10', 'TPS10M', '""TPS10M2"")', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M2).', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M1).', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M', 'TPS10M1', 'TPS10M2', 'TPS10M']",[],[],terpene synthase

Dwarf ylang ylang flowers have little floral scent when the petals are green, but their scent gradually becomes stronger as the flower matures. To examine the overall intensity and the diversity of the floral scent during flower development, total essential oils from flowers at four different stages of development were analysed by GC-MS ( Fig. 1).  Figure 1B and  Supplementary Fig. S1 show that the chemical composition of the essential oils from the floral bud stage to the three different stages of open flower development was very diverse, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Only 15 compounds that had meaningful levels of >0.1% of total volatile compounds were detected from floral buds ( Fig. 1B,  Table 1). The number of peaks increased progressively during maturation of flower buds into fully open flowers. More than 20, 27, and 45 volatile compounds were obtained from the three different stages of flower development: undeveloped small flower (I), mature green flower (II), and fully mature yellow flower (III). Hence, the fully mature stage represents the stage where there was maximum production of VOCs by the flowers. At this stage, the majority of the volatiles were terpenes with a few benzenoid/phenolpropanoid compounds. Out of 45 compounds identified, 31 were identified as mono- and sesquiterpenes using the mass spectra reference library ( Fig. 1B and  Table 1). Interestingly, >90% of the total identified terpenes were sesquiterpenes consisting of α-farnesene (31.50%), α-bergamotene (26.79%), germacrene D (13.26%), β-caryophyllene (11.57%), humulene (1.63%), farnesol (0.75%),  trans-β-farnesene (0.77%), and β-ylangen (0.63%), whereas monoterpenes were quantitatively less than 10%, comprising mainly  cis-β-ocimene (1.99%),  trans-β-ocimene (1.55%), and β-linalool (1.40%). Other aromatic compounds comprised <3%. The relative amounts of all identified volatiles are shown in  Table 1 (see mature yellow flowers, III). Dried yellow flowers of ylang ylang also showed a similar volatile composition ( Supplementary Fig. S2A, available at  JXB online). Compared with flowers, ylang ylang leaves contained very low levels of terpenes, comprising mainly α-pinene, β-caryophyllene, germacrene D, and phytol ( Supplementary Fig. S2B). Two sesquiterpenes, germacrene D and β-caryophyllene, could be found at all stages of development, and their levels were retained or slightly decreased during open flower development (#22 and #28,  Fig. 1B, and  Supplementary Fig. S3, available at  JXB online). However, the other two major sesquiterpenes, α-farnesene and α-bergamotene, were undetectable at the floral bud stage but were found during early flower development (#29 and #30 in I,  Fig. 1B, and  Supplementary Fig. S3) and subsequently became the most abundant components of essential oils at mature stages of flower development (II and III,  Fig. 1B). Interestingly, most of the monoterpenes except α-pinene were undetectable at the floral bud stage, but they gradually increased during open flower development ( Fig. 1B). Among the monoterpenes,  trans-β-ocimene, β-ocimene, and β-linalool were highly inducible during flower maturation (#9, #10, and #13,  Fig. 1B). Additionally, our GC-MS analysis identified several sesquiterpenes or sesquiterpene alcohols that decreased during flower maturation such as δ-elemene (#46), α-ylangene (#47), γ-cadinene (#48), and α-copaene-11-ol (#49). Other aromatic compounds such as benzenoid/phenolpropanoid and volatile fatty acids were found almost exclusively in mature yellow flowers ( Fig. 1B and  Supplementary Fig. S1,  Table 1). GC-MS analysis of flowers at night did not show any change in VOC profile, suggesting that there are no significant diurnal changes in the emission pattern ( Supplementary Fig. S4, available at  JXB online). RNA sequencing,  de novo assembly, and annotation of the transcriptome To profile the dwarf ylang ylang floral transcriptome, we sequenced RNA-seq libraries synthesized from the mature yellow flowers. Illumina sequencing runs generated more than 110 million reads of 101bp, and the quality of reads was evaluated by FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) ( Supplementary Fig. S5, available at  JXB online). Due to the absence of reference genomic sequences for ylang ylang, the Trinity method was used for  de novo assembly of short sequence reads ( Grabherr   et al., 2011 ). These assemblies generated a total of 45 379 unigenes with an N50 value of 2016bp ( Table 2). The assembled unigenes were BLASTed against the National Centre for Biotechnology Information non-redundant (nr) protein database and protein databases for  Arabidopsis thaliana,  Vitis vinifera, and  Oryza sativa. Among 45 379 unigenes, 30 539 unigenes (67.3%) were annotated through a BlastX search with E-values ≤1e–3 ( Table 2). Functional classifications of Gene Ontology (GO) terms of all unigenes were performed using Trinotate ( Quevillon   et al., 2005 ).  Figure 2 shows enriched GO terms for the top 1000 highly expressed transcripts. From our annotated unigenes, 16 were identified as TPSs that were more than 500bp. Of these, four unigenes contained full-length ORFs encoding TPS. RNA-seq analysis of different biosynthetic pathways active in flowers GC-MS analysis of the mature flowers showed that the majority of VOCs were terpenes. We used our RNA-seq data to analyse the expression profile of genes encoding enzymes for the precursor pathways leading to the formation of VOCs in mature flowers. The majority of ylang ylang orthologue unigenes were full length and showed high sequence similarity to known enzymes of these pathways from other plants ( Supplementary Fig. S6, available at  JXB online). The MEP and MVA pathways are the pathways leading to the formation of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Transcripts of all the enzyme genes involved in these two pathways were detected in our RNA-seq data, and their expression was validated by qRT-PCR ( Fig. 3). Additionally, the expression of these enzyme genes was also examined at earlier stages of flower development and in leaves by qRT-PCR. Genes encoding the MEP and MVA enzymes were active in all stages of flower development consistent with the high production of terpenes in the flowers ( Fig. 3A,  B). It has been reported that 1-deoxy- d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), the first enzyme of the MEP pathway, is important for the overall regulation of the pathway and is encoded by a small gene family ( Cordoba   et al., 2011 ). From our RNA-seq data, we were able to identify four different  DXS unigenes showing different levels of abundance in flowers and leaf. One of these,  DXS3, belonging to clade 2, which may be related to secondary metabolism ( Walter   et al., 2002 ;  Phillips   et al., 2007 ), was highly induced in stage III flowers ( Fig. 3A and  Supplementary Figs S7 and Fig. S8, available at  JXB online). The majority of the genes, except phenylalanine ammonia lyase ( PAL), for the shikimate pathway enzymes, which produce phenylalanine for the production of benzonoids and phenylproponids, appeared to be expressed more in mature flowers ( Fig. 3C,  D). The significant benzenoids in VOCs were benzyl benzoate and benzyl salicylate, and the phenylproponoid was eugenol. These compounds were detected only in mature flowers (#18, #39, and #45,  Fig. 1B,  Table 1). Previous  in vitro experiments have indicated that benzyl benzoate might play a role in pollinator attraction ( Hoballah   et al., 2005 ;  Huber   et al., 2005 ) or in plant defence (miticide) ( Harju   et al., 2004 ). Phylogenetic analysis of  TPS genes from dwarf ylang ylang flowers Terpenes were the major VOCs of dwarf ylang ylang flowers. From the dwarf ylang ylang RNA-seq data, four full-length ORFs of  TPS genes were PCR amplified from cDNA pools of the flowers. Phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences of four  CoTPS cDNAs showed that CoTPS2 (561 aa) belonged to the TPS-a subfamily representing the sesqui-TPSs, whereas CoTPS1 (590 aa) and CoTPS3 (547 aa) fell into the TPS-b subfamily, which consists mainly of mono-TPSs ( Chen   et al., 2011 ;  Fig. 4A). CoTPS4 (586 aa) is a member of the TPS-g subfamily, which lacks the R(R)X 8W motif in the N-terminal region of mono-TPSs and produces acyclic monoterpenes ( Dudareva   et al., 2003 ;  Yuan   et al., 2008 ;  Chen   et al., 2011 ;  Fig. 4A). All four CoTPSs had the conserved aspartate-rich motif (DDXXD) and NSE/DTE motifs that chelate divalent metal ions, typically Mg 2+, in the C-terminal domain ( Fig. 4B). Both motifs are required for cyclization of the universal acyclic terpene precursors, such as GPP and FPP, to synthesize mono- and sesqui-terpene, respectively ( Chen   et al., 2011 ). The arginine-tryptophan motif, R(R)X 8W, present at the N terminus of most mono-TPS and in some sesqui-TPS and di-TPS, was found in CoTPS1, CoTPS2, and CoTPS3 but not in CoTPS4 ( Fig. 4B). One of the distinguishing structural features between mono- and sesqui-TPS is the presence of an N-terminal plastid transit peptide (Tp) sequence. Using the signal sequence analysis programs ChloroP ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP) and WoLF PSORT ( http://www.genscript.com/psort/wolf_psort.html), a putative N-terminal plastid Tp sequence of 41 and 35 aa for CoTPS1 and CoTPS4, respectively, was predicted, indicating they are likely to be mono-TPSs. However, we could not find a putative plastid Tp sequence for CoTPS3, which was supposed to be a mono-TPS belonging to the TPS-b subfamily. CoTPS2 did not contain a plastid Tp sequence, which correlated well with the prediction of it being a sesqui-TPS. The amino acid sequences of CoTPS1 and CoTPS2 had highest identity with the magnolia ( Magnolia grandiflora) TPSs Mg17 (70% similarity, 54% identity) and Mg25 (72% similarity, 55% identity) for α-terpineol and β-cubebene, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S9A, B, available at  JXB online) ( Lee and Chappell, 2008). CoTPS3 showed 65% amino acid similarity and 47% identity with mountain pepper ( Litsea cubeba)  trans-ocimene synthase ( Supplementary Fig. S9C) ( Chang and Chu, 2011). CoTPS4 was most similar to geraniol synthase from Madagascar periwinkle ( Catharanthus roseus) (92% similarity, 84% identity;  Supplementary Fig. S9D) ( Simkin   et al., 2013 ). Subcellular localization and expression of the four CoTPSs As well as phylogenetic analysis and bioinformatics-based attempts to classify TPSs, their subcellular localization is also important for function prediction. This was especially true for CoTPS3, since its function was unpredictable from the bioinformatics analyses based on amino acid sequences. To address this issue, we transiently expressed the full-length ORF of each CoTPS fused to a YFP reporter gene to produce a CoTPS–YFP fusion protein in  N. benthamiana leaves using  Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration.  Figure 5 shows that CoTPS1–YFP and CoTPS4–YFP, which had the N-terminal plastid Tp sequence, were localized in chloroplasts as expected, whereas CoTPS2–YFP and CoTPS3–YFP were distributed throughout the cytosol. Based on the results of the subcellular localization experiments, it is likely that CoTPS1 and CoTPS4 are involved in monoterpene synthesis in plastids, whereas CoTPS2 and CoTPS3 might produce sesquiterpenes in the cytosol. The transcript levels for the four  CoTPS genes at different developmental stages of dwarf ylang ylang flowers were examined by qRT-PCR. The expression levels of all four transcripts were very low or below detection limits in leaf tissues but greatly elevated in flower tissues ( Fig. 6). Transcripts for three  TPS genes,  CoTPS1,  CoTPS3, and  CoTPS4, were highest in mature green flowers (II), whereas  CoTPS2 was highly expressed at the floral bud stage ( Fig. 6). Functional characterization of CoTPSs The subcellular localization of each CoTPS–YFP fusion protein provided us with preliminary evidence to elucidate the function of each TPS. The exact functional annotation of a new TPS requires activity characterization of the recombinant protein. To determine the enzymatic activity of CoTPSs  in vitro, 6His-tagged CoTPS recombinant proteins purified from  E. coli BL21(DE3) ( Supplementary Fig. S10, available at  JXB online) were used for  in vitro assays. GPP (C10) or FPP (C15) was used as the common substrate for mono- and sesqui-TPS, respectively. Control assays using heat-inactivated recombinant 6His-tagged CoTPSs did not form any terpenes from GPP or FPP ( Supplementary Fig. S11, available at  JXB online).  Figure 7A shows that CoTPS1, a member of the TPS-b family, synthesized four products corresponding to β-thujene, sabinene, β-pinene, and α-terpinene from GPP, but not from FPP, which were found in the essential oil profiles of dwarf ylang ylang flowers (#1, #4, #5 and #7,  Fig. 1,  Table 1). These results suggested that CoTPS1 is a multifunctional β-thujene/sabinene/β-pinene/α-terpinene synthase that is able to catalyse the synthesis of a mixture of monoterpenes, namely β-thujene, sabinene, β-pinene, and α-terpinene. This is not surprising, as several multiproduct mono-TPSs that produce similar compounds, such as α-thujene, sabinene, α/β-pinene, α/γ-terpinene, have been reported widely in other plant species ( Lücker   et al., 2002 ;  Chen   et al., 2003 ;  Fäldt   et al., 2003 ;  Shimada   et al., 2004 ;  Fähnrich   et al., 2011 ). Similarly, recombinant CoTPS2 catalysed the synthesis of three compounds, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene, from FPP. CoTPS2 is a multifunctional β-ylangene/β-copaene/β-cubebene synthase capable of producing three sesquiterpenes, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene ( Fig. 7B). Many sesqui-TPSs are also known to be multifunctional ( Steele   et al., 1998 ;  Lee and Chappell, 2008). However, TPSs that produce β-ylangene/β-copaene/β-cubebene have not yet been reported. Of these three sesquiterpene compounds, we could only detect β-ylangene and β-cubebene in the flowers of dwarf ylang ylang (#23 and #27,  Fig. 1,  Table 1). CoTPS3 is a member of the TPS-b family with the unusual feature that it lacks a putative N-terminal Tp sequence. Our enzyme assays showed that CoTPS3 catalysed the formation of α-bergamotene from FPP ( Fig. 7C), which is a major sesquiterpene produced in the flowers of ylang ylang (#30,  Fig. 1,  Table 1). CoTPS4, which belongs to TPS-g family, was capable of utilizing GPP to synthesize an acyclic monoterpene, geraniol ( Fig. 7D). This was confirmed by comparison of retention time and mass spectra with those of an authentic standard ( Supplementary Fig. S11). This result was expected, as the protein showed the highest amino acid identity with geraniol synthases (84%) from Madagascar periwinkle ( Supplementary Fig. S9D) ( Simkin   et al., 2013 ). However, geraniol was not detected in our GC-MS analysis of ylang ylang flowers. Functional characterization of CoTPS  in vivo We further investigated whether CoTPSs would produce the same terpene products  in vivo using  Agrobacterium-mediated transient gene expression in tobacco leaves. The YFP-fused CoTPS1, CoTPS2, CoTPS3, or CoTPS4 was expressed in  N. benthamiana with or without co-expression of  Arabidopsis HMGR. HMGR catalyses a rate-limiting step of the MVA pathway and its overexpression is known to increases heterologous sesquiterpene production ( Song   et al., 2012 ;  Jin   et al., 2014 ). Analysis by GC-MS showed that the  in vivo results were consistent with those obtained  in vitro. CoTPS2–YFP clearly produced three compounds, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene, when it was co-expressed with AtHMGR ( Fig. 8A), whereas Co-TPS3 produced α-bergamotene when co-expressed with AtHMGR ( Fig. 8B). The expression of CoTPS2 or CoTPS3 alone without AtHMGR in  N. benthamiana did not produce any terpenes, which may be due to limiting amounts of the substrate, FPP ( Supplementary Fig. S12, available at  JXB online). CoTPS1 and CoTPS4 characterized as mono-TPS  in vitro failed to produce any new peaks  in planta, suggesting that they might require the co-expression of additional genes, probably a rate-limiting step in the non-MVA pathway. Alternatively, compounds formed by these TPSs might be further metabolized endogenously by the plants.","The pleasant fragrance of ylang ylang varieties (Cananga odorata) is mainly due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the flowers. Floral scents are a key factor in plant-insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to β-thujene, sabinene, β-pinene, and α-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate. The other two TPSs were identified as sesqui-TPSs. CoTPS3 catalysed the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to α-bergamotene, whereas CoTPS2 was found to be a multifunctional and novel TPS that could catalyse the synthesis of three sesquiterpenes, β-ylangene, β-copaene, and β-cubebene. Additionally, the activities of the two sesqui-TPSs were confirmed in planta by transient expression of these TPS genes in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration.","['Terpene synthase', 'volatile organic compounds', 'terpenes', 'Floral Scent', 'Cananga Odorata Var.

28,28,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4574175\eupmc_result.json,PMC4574175,"Results and discussion Production of geraniol by a wine yeast strain expressing the  GES gene of  O. basilicum and its metabolic fate in synthetic defined (YPD) media The truncated  O. basilicum GES cDNA [ 22] (GenBank Accession No. AY362553) coding for a geraniol synthase lacking the first 34 codons—which encode the plastid transit peptide—was cloned under the control of the  S. cerevisiaeACT1 (encoding actin) promoter ( ACT1p) and the  HIS3 (encoding imidazole glycerol-phosphate dehydratase) terminator ( HIS3t) into the binary vector YEplac195 [ 23]. The resulting plasmid (YEp195Ges) was used to transform the  S. cerevisiae T 73-4 [ 24] wine strain and the uracil prototrophic (ura +) transformants YR377 and YR378 (T 73Ges) were isolated. The growth rates of YR377, YR378 and the control strain YR70 (T 73-4 transformed with the empty plasmid) on liquid YPD media were almost identical, albeit slightly slower than that of the industrial strain T 73 (Fig.  1a) as observed previously for other recombinant yeasts [ 17]. This indicates that neither the amount of geraniol nor the putative reduction of precursors from the isoprenoid pathway apparently produce deleterious effects on yeast growth under such conditions. In addition, GC and GC–MS analyses of these culture media showed similar extraordinarily high geraniol yields (8,017.85 ± 1,245.81 and 7,859.12 ± 1,614.62 μg/L after 32 h) (Fig.  1b). These levels are about 16-fold higher than those produced by recombinant  S. cerevisiae laboratory strains expressing the same  GES gene, about 1.6-fold the amount produced by laboratory yeasts co-expressing  GES and an optimized farnesyl diphosphate synthase [ 25,  26], and about 120-fold the amount of linalool excreted by engineered T 73-4 wine strains expressing  LIS [ 17,  21]. These results clearly reinforce the previously shown importance of the genetic background of this industrial yeast for monoterpene production [ 21] but also that of the monoterpene synthase being expressed. In contrast to the T 73Lis strains that produced linalool as the only end product, and in agreement with the reported ability of  S. cerevisiae T 73 to metabolise supplemented geraniol and its reaction products [ 20], the T 73Ges strains produced geraniol (84.83%) and geraniol derivatives i.e. citronellol (10.92%), nerol (3.90%), linalyl acetate (0.13%), geranyl acetate (0.12%) and linalool (0.1%). As expected, monoterpene production by the control strains lacking  GES (YR70 and T 73) was practically negligible (7.13 ± 1.12 μg/L; >1,300-fold lower than YR377 and YR378) (Fig.  1b). YR377 was chosen for the microvinification experiments. Aromatic wines from neutral grapes using the self-aromatizing wine yeast YR377 Microvinification experiments were carried out in parallel on sterile Parellada white grape must using the wine yeast strain T 73-4 that carries the  GES expression cassette (YR377) and a control strain lacking  GES (YR70). Both alcoholic fermentations progressed similarly (Fig.  2b) and reached completion in about 19 days leaving approximately 2 g/L residual sugar (i.e. dry wine). Given the persistence of the ura + phenotype (around 85%) in YR377 and hence high maintenance of the  GES expression cassette throughout the process it is evident that neither the expression of the  GES gene nor its consequences affected the growth or fermentative capacity of the engineered wine strain. To evaluate the influence of  GES expression on wine aroma, volatile profiles were determined by GC and GC–MS (Fig.  3a). As expected given the aromatic neutrality of the Parellada grape, free geraniol was undetectable in wines produced by YR70. In contrast, geraniol concentrations (~750 μg/L) well in excess of its olfactory perception threshold (40–75 μg/L) and exceeding those present in wines obtained from the highly aromatic Muscat grapes (Additional file  1: Table S1) were found in wines fermented with the ‘self-aromatizing’ wine yeast YR377 (Fig.  3b; Table  1). Remarkably, GC analysis (Fig.  3) showed that apart from the geraniol peak there were also notable quantities (~810 μg/L) of additional monoterpenes and esters associated with strain YR377: citronellol, linalool, nerol, citronellyl acetate and geranyl acetate, resulting in a total terpene concentration >220-fold greater than the control wine. With the exception of nerol and citronellyl acetate, the other compounds are present above their perception thresholds (Table  1). The presence of geraniol and its derivatives will enrich these wines with flowery and fruity notes. GES and  E. coli-expressed recombinant GES both exclusively catalyze the synthesis of geraniol from GPP [ 22]. Our comparative GC–MS data (Figs.  2,  3) revealed that the same terpenes found in wine were also excreted by YR377 when grown in synthetic (YPD) medium. Thus during vinification the enzymatic activities intrinsic to this wine yeast strain are also able to metabolize geraniol and its derivatives resulting in their conversion to other monoterpenes and aromatic esters, a situation resembling the metabolic diversion occurring in tomato expressing the  GES gene [ 27]. The reduction of geraniol to citronellol and the acetylation of geraniol and citronellol are probably catalyzed by the oxidoreductase Oye2 and the alcohol acetyl transferase Atf1 [ 28], respectively. An obvious strategy to further expand our ability to modulate wine aroma would therefore be to promote or suppress the formation of these geraniol derivatives by modification of these enzyme activities. To investigate whether  GES expression could lead to additional changes in a wine’s volatile profile, determinations of other volatile compounds of oenological relevance were carried out on both recombinant yeast derived and control wines. The compositions and concentrations of higher alcohols (e.g. 2-phenylethyl alcohol) and acetate esters (e.g. isoamyl acetate), the presence of which is considered favorable for the aromatic properties of wines, were seen to be statistically similar in wines fermented with YR377 and YR70 strains (Table  1). Introduction of the  C. breweriLIS gene into wine yeast strain T 73-4 (T 73Lis) under the control of the  TDH3 yeast promoter was our first attempt to construct a self-aromatizing wine yeast [ 17]. This resulted in de novo accumulation in wine of linalool alone to levels exceeding its odor perception threshold. Remarkably, the amount of geraniol-derived linalool produced by YR377 (T 73Ges) was about 7.5 times greater than that obtained with T 73Lis (~141 versus ~19 μg/L) and the total de novo terpene concentration is more than 80-times greater, illustrating the importance of the MTPS employed in engineering strain T 73. These results justify the strategy of engineering the wine yeast isoprenoid pathway as a means of achieving efficient plant-derived aromatic monoterpene production during alcoholic fermentation. Mixed fermentation with T 73Ges and  S. cerevisiae strains not producing monoterpenes serves to modulate levels of terpenes In order to assess whether it would be feasible to produce wines with a predetermined monoterpene content, vinifications were conducted using mixed starters (1:1) of yeast strains YR377 and YR70 and were compared to those obtained using pure cultures of YR377. The monoterpene profiles of wines derived from mixed fermentations were directly related to the composition of the initial inocula. Thus the amounts of geraniol (~388 μg/L) and its derivatives (~311 μg/L) detected were about half of those obtained using inocula of YR377 alone (Table  2). Terpenes are also important flavor compounds in other fermented drinks. Geraniol, linalool and citronellol have all been shown to be important contributors to the floral, fruity and citrus flavors of beer [ 29], and biotransformations of these monoterpenes by ale and lager yeasts have been reported [ 19]. Engineered brewing-yeasts designed as vehicles for the de novo production of these monoterpenes thus have potential for use in the brewing industry. Moreover, certain monoterpenes have been shown to display a plethora of potential health benefits (see [ 5– 8] and references therein)."," Background Monoterpenes are important contributors to grape and wine aroma. Moreover, certain monoterpenes have been shown to display health benefits with antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer or hypotensive properties amongst others. The aim of this study was to construct self-aromatizing wine yeasts to overproduce de novo these plant metabolites in wines. Results Expression of the Ocimum basilicum (sweet basil) geraniol synthase (GES) gene in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine strain substantially changed the terpene profile of wine produced from a non-aromatic grape variety. Under microvinification conditions, and without compromising other fermentative traits, the recombinant yeast excreted geraniol de novo at an amount (~750 μg/L) well exceeding (>10-fold) its threshold for olfactory perception and also exceeding the quantities present in wines obtained from highly aromatic Muscat grapes. Interestingly, geraniol was further metabolized by yeast enzymes to additional monoterpenes and esters: citronellol, linalool, nerol, citronellyl acetate and geranyl acetate, resulting in a total monoterpene concentration (~1,558 μg/L) 230-fold greater than that of the control. We also found that monoterpene profiles of wines derived from mixed fermentations were found to be determined by the composition of the initial yeast inocula suggesting the feasibility of producing 'à la carte' wines having predetermined monoterpene contents. Conclusions Geraniol synthase-engineered yeasts demonstrate potential in the development of monoterpene enhanced wines.",,"['wine yeast', 'GES', 'wine', 'geraniol', 'GES gene', 'yeast strain', 'GES expression', 'GenBank Accession', 'yeast', 'strain']","[cerevisiaeACT1, actin, glycerol-phosphate dehydratase, HIS3, YR378 (T 73Ges, YR377, YR378, T 73-4, GC–, 8,017.85 ± 1,245.81, 7,859.12 ± 1,614.62 μg/L, farnesyl diphosphate synthase [ 25, T 73Lis, T 73Ges, YR70, T 73, YR377, YR378, YR377, self-aromatizing wine yeast YR377, YR377, YR70, YR377, YR70, 40–75 μg/L, YR377, GES, GES, YR377, oxidoreductase Oye2, alcohol acetyl, YR377, YR70, geraniol-derived, YR377 (T 73Ges, T 73Lis, T 73Ges, YR377, YR70, YR377, ~311 μg/L, YR377, ale, brewing-yeasts]",['MTPS'],['C.'],[],terpene synthase
32,32,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4654506\eupmc_result.json,PMC4654506,"Results Illumina sequencing and assembly of sequence reads In this study, nine cDNA libraries were constructed and subjected to Illumina deep sequencing. We obtained 337,669,638 raw reads and 319,425,972 clean reads from the three developmental-stage libraries after eliminating primer and adapter sequences and filtering out low-quality reads. We obtained 130,981 contigs from these reads. Based on the paired-end reads, these contigs were further assembled into primary unigenes using CLC Genomics Workbench (version: 6.0.4;  Table 1). Finally, using CAP3 EST, we spliced the primary unigenes a second time and obtained a transcriptome database for  S.  oblata. The  de novo assembly generated 104,691 final unigenes ( Table 1). The distribution of unigene sequence length is shown in  Fig 2. Approximately 30% of the unigenes were 401–600 bp in length, 23% were 201–400 bp, and 47% were >600 bp ( Fig 2). Unigene annotation All unigenes for  S.  oblata were searched against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) database using BlastX with a cut-off E-value of 10–5. Among these unigenes, approximately 42% showed significant similarity to known proteins in the NR database, and 29% were matched to the SwissProt database ( Table 2). In further analysis of the matching unigenes, we found that  S.  oblata unigenes were most closely matched with gene sequences from  Vitis vinifera, followed by  Solanum tuberosum,  S.  lycopersicum,  Theobroma cacao, and  Populus trichocarpa ( Fig 3). In addition to the NCBI NR and SwissProt databases,  S.  oblata unigenes were aligned with Gene Ontology (GO), eukaryoticorthologous groups of proteins (KOG), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). In total, 42% of the unigenes provided significant BLAST results; of these, approximately 84% had matches in the GO database, 45% had matches in the KOG database, and 25% had matches in KEGG ( Table 2). The significance of a BLAST search depends on the length of the query sequence; thus, short reads obtained from sequencing are rarely matched to known genes [ 38]. Approximately 23% of the unigenes we identified were short (200–400 bp), which might help to explain the proportion that did not match. In other words, these short reads generated by sequencing or assembly might have resulted in the low significance[ 25]. GO classification of unigenes We used Blast2GO to classify the functions of the predicted  S.  oblata unigenes. Of the 104,691 final unigenes, 36,967 were successfully annotated by GO assignments. The annotated unigenes were assigned into three main GO categories and 62 subcategories, and some belonged to more than one of the three categories ( Fig 4). Based on annotation against the NR database, 33,208 GO terms were assigned. The greatest proportion (~62%) was assigned to biological processes (GO: 0008150); the others were assigned to molecular functions (GO: 0005575; ~24%) or cellular components (GO: 0003674; ~14%) ( Fig 4). Among the biological processes, dominant subcategories included cellular, metabolic, and single-organism processes and response to stimulus and biological regulation were also important ( Fig 4). The large proportion of annotated unigenes involved in metabolic processes suggested that novel genes involved in pathways of secondary metabolite synthesis could be identified. Dominant subcategories of cellular components included cells, cell parts, organelles, and membranes. Molecular function subcategories with the largest numbers of annotated unigenes were catalytic activity, binding, transporter activity, and nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity ( Fig 4,  S2 File). KOG classification of unigenes The KOG database is a useful platform for functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes. Based on sequence homology, 19,956 unigenes were assigned to the KOG functional classification into 25 categories denoting their involvement in cellular processes, biochemistry and metabolism, signal transduction, and other functions ( Fig 5). Signal transduction mechanisms were dominant, and general functional prediction and posttranslational modification–protein turnover–chaperones shared a large proportion of genes ( Fig 5,  S3 File). However, 924 unigenes (4.6%) were assigned to the category of secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism, which suggests that identification of novel genes involved in secondary metabolism pathways is a promising area of study ( S3 File). Metabolic pathway assignment by KEGG The KEGG database places emphasis on biochemical pathways and provides an alternative approach to the categorization of gene function. Here, 12,388 annotated unigenes were assigned to 286 KEGG pathways ( S4 File). Metabolic pathways had the most representation (~23%), followed by biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (~13%). Several signaling pathways (AMPK, MAPK, p53) and biosynthesis pathways of important secondary metabolites (e.g. phenylpropanoid, carotenoid, flavonoid, flavone and flavonol, anthocyanin, volatile terpenoids) were represented ( S4 File). These data provide a valuable resource for further mining pathways of interest in  S.  oblata. We focused on the metabolic pathways involved in flower pigments and scents biosynthesis. Flavonoids are primary compounds affecting the formation of flower or fruit color, and three pathways are involved in flavonoid metabolism: the anthocyanin, flavonoid, and flavone/flavonol biosynthetic pathways [ 39]. Among these pathways, 55 unigenes (average length,1130 bp) were associated with flower pigment synthesis, including 16 unigenes annotated to anthocyanin biosynthesis, 31 unigenes annotated to flavonoid biosynthesis, and 14 unigenes annotated to the flavone/flavonol biosynthetic pathway ( S5 File). Further analysis revealed that nine unigenes were between 300 and 500 bp, 20 unigenes were between 500 and 1000 bp, and 26 unigenes were >1000 bp; moreover, all unigenes had very high homology with the NR database (E <10 –12) ( S5 File). In addition, six unigenes were annotated to both the flavonoid and the flavone/flavonol biosynthetic pathway, which suggested that these genes could be key nodes in the three flavonoid metabolic pathways ( S5 File). Volatile terpenoids are important components of the floral scent in  S.  oblata[ 40]. Three metabolic pathways: terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, and limonene and pinene degradation contributed to the biosynthesis of terpenoid volatiles, and 213 unigenes (average length,1069 bp) were annotated ( S5 File). Among these, 45% of the unigenes were involved in limonene and pinene degradation, 43% were involved in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, and only 25 unigenes were clustered in monoterpenoid biosynthesis ( S5 File). This analysis of the metabolic pathways of flower pigment and floral scent helps to provide a basis for cloning and functional analysis of the key genes involved these important characteristics of  S.  oblata. Variation in gene expression among flower development stages Among the annotated unigenes, we found that 83,343 genes were expressed in samples of all three developmental stages, and 2,203, 1,510, and 1,682 genes were found to be expressed specifically in the SOFB, SOB, and SOF stages, respectively ( Fig 6A). To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during flower development, we performed genome-wide expression analysis for the SOFB, SOB, and SOF developmental stages ( Fig 1). Following Anders and Huber [ 27], we identified genes that were differentially expressed between two samples by comparing SOB and SOFB, SOF and SOB, and SOF and SOFB. In total, 1,068 differentially regulated genes, including 645 upregulated and 423 downregulated genes, were identified in SOB compared to SOFB ( Fig 6B). The functional annotations and statistics for all DEGs between SOB and SOFB are in the  S6 File. We also classified the functions of the 1,068 DEGs by Blast2GO. Among biological processes, dominant subcategories included metabolic processes, cellular processes, and single-organism processes. In cellular components, the two largest subcategories were cell and cell parts. Catalytic activity was dominant in the molecular functions section ( S7 File). GO enrichment analysis showed that most of the upregulated DEG sets were related to biological processes, cellular components, molecules, and DNA binding ( S8 File). The KEGG enrichment classification showed that 23 groups were significantly enriched, and most of these were upregulated primarily in the SOB library, which was correlated with metabolic and biosynthesis pathways of secondary metabolites ( S8 File). Based on sequence homology, the 1,068 DEGs were assigned to the KOG functional classification into 23 categories ( S1 Fig). Compared with SOB, more DEGs were identified in SOF ( Fig 6B), and the statistical information for these DEGs is summarized in the  S6 File. The results of the GO functional classification between the SOF and SOB stages were similar to those for the comparison of SOB to SOFB ( S9 File). GO enrichment analysis indicated that approximately half of the gene sets were downregulated and half were upregulated in the SOF library. The downregulated genes were mainly related to responses, chloroplasts, membranes, and cytosol, and the upregulated genes were related to molecular functions, kinase activity, nuclei, and biological processes ( S10 File). In the KEGG classification, 32 groups were significantly enriched, and about half of these genes were upregulated and half were downregulated in the SOF library. These enriched genes were mainly related to metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites ( S10 File). The KOG functional classification showed that the DEGs between the two stages were also assigned to 23 categories ( S2 Fig). We also compared gene expression between SOF and SOFB, and found 3298 genes with differential expression ( Fig 6B). The functional annotations and statistical information of all 3298 DEGs are summarized in the  S6 File. GO functional classification indicated that the most of the 3298 DEGs were involved in metabolic processes, cellular processes, and single-organism processes in the biological process section; the dominant subcategories were cell and cell parts in the cellular components section; and catalytic activity was the dominant subcategory in the molecular functions section ( S11 File). GO enrichment analysis showed that most of the gene sets were downregulated in the SOF library, and these genes were mainly related to epigenetics, flower development, cytosols, and binding ( S12 File). KEGG classification showed that 14 groups were significantly enriched, and most of these genes were downregulated in the SOF library and were related to ribosomes and DNA replication ( S12 File). In KOG functional classification, the DEGs between the two stages were also assigned to 24 categories ( S3 Fig). Genes related to flower pigment biosynthesis and floral scent metabolism During development, the flowers of  S.  oblata underwent rapid changes in color and scent, from green and unscented (SOFB) to amaranth and slightly scented (SOB), and then to lilac with very strong scent (SOF). We focused on genes related to flower pigment biosynthesis and scent metabolism, and chose some genes that showed significant differential expression among the three developmental stages ( Fig 7). The functional annotation for these unigenes was provided in  S13 File. For example, contig_2561 showed lower expression levels in SOFB and SOF than in SOB and was homologous with  Catharathus roseus cinnamic acid 4-hydrolase (C4H), related to flavonoid biosynthesis. Other genes associated with anthocyanins biosynthesis showed higher expression levels in SOB and SOF than in SOFB. These genes included contigs_52106 (homologous with  Perilla frutescens chalcone synthase, CHS), 14647 (homologous with  Camellia chekiangoleosa flavanone 3-hydroxylase, F3H), 9238 (homologous with  Petunia×hybrida flavonol synthase, FLS), 22308 (homologous with  Eustoma grandiflorum anthocyanidin synthase, ANS), and 32424 (homologous with the  Olea europaea flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase, 3GT). In addition, some genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways, such as contig_38186 (homologous with COMT1), contig_27568 (homologous with DOMT-like) and contig_33752 (homologous with GT) displayed the highest expression in the SOF stage, which indicated that these genes located downstream of anthocyanin biosynthesis. In particular, the mean FPKMs of contig_27568 were 1.08, 1.43, and 4295 in each SOFB, SOB, and SOF stage, respectively (P = 0), which means that the  DOMT-like gene might be specifically and strongly expressed at the SOF stage ( S6 File). Some key genes related to fragrance biosynthesis showed a significant difference in expression among the three flower developmental stages. The functional annotation for these unigenes is shown in the  S13 File. The contigs_3232 (homologous with  Salvia miltiorrhiza1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase, DXS), 33311 (homologous with  Nicotiana tabacum hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, HMGR), 13388 (homologous with  S.  miltiorrhiza geranyldiphosphatesynthase, GPS), and 33785 (homologous with  Oryza sativa subsp.  Japonica1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, DXR) had the highest levels of expression in SOF and encoded key enzymes involved in biosynthesis of terpenoid volatiles; however, the three terpenoid synthase genes with contigs_22002 (homologous with camphene/tricyclene synthase [TPS3] of  S.  lycopersicum), 19143 (terpene synthase[TPS] of  O.  europaea), and 41137 ([3S]-linalool/[E]-nerolidol synthase [LIS] of  V.  vinifera) showed the highest expression levels in SOF. In contrast, contigs_2134 and 18066 from terpene degradation genes showed the highest expression in SOFB and SOB, respectively. In addition, we found that some cytochrome P450 genes involved in metabolism of terpenoid volatiles, such as contigs_2134 (homologous with  V.  vinifera cytochrome P450 76A2, CYP76A2), 819 (homologous with  A.  thaliana cytochrome P450 78A7, CYP78A7), and 17171 (homologous with  V.  vinifera cytochrome P450 77A3, CYP77A3), showed the highest expression in SOFB stage. However, contig_18066 (homologous with  V.  vinifera cytochrome P450 77A2, CYP77A2) displayed higher expression in SOB and SOF than in the SOFB stage. Finally, we found that three genes,  DXS (contig_3232),  TPS (contig_19143), and  LIS (contig_41137), were induced specifically and strongly (>100-fold change in expression) at the SOF stage ( S6 File). Apart from the structural genes, nine transcription factors regulating anthocyanin and fragrance biosynthesis were found in this study ( S6 File). We found that the six genes encoding the transcription factors [e.g., contigs 28146 (homologous with  Prunus avium transcription factor R2R3-MYB), 28147 (homologous with  Theobroma cacao transcription factor MYB), 38962 (homologous with  Camellia sinensis transcription factor R2R3-MYB1), 25616 (homologous with  Citrus sinensis transcription factor bHLH79), 9153 (homologous with  S.  tuberosum transcription factor bHLH147), and 64997 (homologous with  Fragaria vesca bHLH79-like transcription factor)] showed higher expression in SOB and SOF than in the SOFB stage. However, the other three genes [e.g., contigs_11688 (homologous with  A.  thaliana transcription factors MYB44), 21735 (homologous with  S.  tuberosum transcription factor bHLH3), and 20570 (homologous with  A.  thaliana transcription factor bHLH48)] displayed higher expression in SOFB than in the other two stages ( S6 File). Real-time Quantitative PCR Validation of RNA-seq Results To validate the sequencing data, 22 genes involved in flower pigment biosynthesis and fragrance metabolism were selected for real-time qPCR with gene-specific primers designed using Primer version 5.0 ( S1 File). The expression patterns of these genes in each flower developmental stage are shown in  Fig 8. Using  S.  oblata DSK2B as a reference gene, expression patterns determined by real-time qPCR were consistent with those obtained by RNA-Seq ( Fig 7,  Fig 8), confirming the accuracy of the RNA-Seq results. We also obtained identical real-time qPCR results using  S.  oblata ACT-7 as a reference gene ( S4 Fig).Thus, the data generated here can be used to investigate specific flowering genes that show comparative expression levels among different developmental phases.","Syringa oblata Lindl. is a woody ornamental plant with high economic value and characteristics that include early flowering, multiple flower colors, and strong fragrance. Despite a long history of cultivation, the genetics and molecular biology of S. oblata are poorly understood. Transcriptome and expression profiling data are needed to identify genes and to better understand the biological mechanisms of floral pigments and scents in this species. Nine cDNA libraries were obtained from three replicates of three developmental stages: inflorescence with enlarged flower buds not protruded, inflorescence with corolla lobes not displayed, and inflorescence with flowers fully opened and emitting strong fragrance. Using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique, 319,425,972 clean reads were obtained and were assembled into 104,691 final unigenes (average length of 853 bp), 41.75% of which were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Among the annotated unigenes, 36,967 were assigned to gene ontology categories and 19,956 were assigned to eukaryoticorthologous groups. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database, 12,388 unigenes were sorted into 286 pathways. Based on these transcriptomic data, we obtained a large number of candidate genes that were differentially expressed at different flower stages and that were related to floral pigment biosynthesis and fragrance metabolism. This comprehensive transcriptomic analysis provides fundamental information on the genes and pathways involved in flower secondary metabolism and development in S. oblata, providing a useful database for further research on S. oblata and other plants of genus Syringa.",,"['File', 'Fig', 'unigenes', 'SOF', 'Genes', 'SOB', 'SOFB', 'homologous', 'biosynthesis', 'SOF stage']","[337,669,638, 319,425,972, CLC, 401–600, 10–5, 200–400, nucleic acid, KOG, –chaperones, ~23, AMPK, MAPK, p53, flavone/flavonol, length,1130, flavone/flavonol, S5, –12, S5, flavone/flavonol, S5, S5, S5, 83,343, SOFB, SOFB, SOFB, SOFB, SOFB, SOFB, SOFB (, KOG, SOFB, S12, S12, KOG, SOFB, contig_2561, SOFB, C4H, SOFB, contigs_52106, chalcone synthase, CHS, hybrida flavonol synthase, anthocyanidin synthase, 32424, europaea flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase, contig_38186 (homologous with, contig_27568, contig_33752 (homologous with, GT, contig_27568, SOFB, contigs_3232, miltiorrhiza1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate, 33311 (homologous with, 33785 (homologous with, contigs_22002 (homologous with camphene/tricyclene synthase [, 41137 ([3S]-linalool/[E]-nerolidol synthase, contigs_2134, 18066, SOFB, cytochrome P450, contigs_2134 (homologous with, cytochrome P450 76A2, CYP76A2, cytochrome P450 78A7, CYP78A7, 17171 (homologous with, cytochrome P450 77A3, CYP77A3, SOFB, contig_18066 (homologous with, cytochrome P450 77A2, SOFB, contig_3232, contig_19143, contig_41137, 28146, MYB, 25616, 64997 (, SOFB, MYB44, SOFB, gene-specific, DSK2B, 8)]","['[TPS3]', 'synthase[TPS]', 'TPS']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
35,35,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC4865098\eupmc_result.json,PMC4865098,"Results Thirty-eight to 44 million clean reads were obtained from infected and control plants and mapped to the  Citrus sinensis ‘Valencia’ reference genome [ 13], with approximately 73 % for CTV-B2, 76 % for the healthy, CTV-B6 and CaLa-B232 libraries (Additional file  1: Figure S1). Dramatic differences in the transcriptome profiles of sweet orange trees were observed in response to the three pathogens. Many more transcripts identified in the citrus gene database were up-regulated than down-regulated in response to the three pathogens (Additional file  1: Figure S2). More transcripts were differentially expressed in response to CaLas-B232, followed by CTV-B6 and CTV-B2 (Additional file  1: Figure S2). Among these differentially expressed transcripts (DETs), 50 transcripts were up-regulated, while only two transcripts were down-regulated in response to all three pathogens (Fig.  1). The number of transcripts regulated in response to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (105 up and two down) was approximately four times the number of transcripts regulated in response to the two strains of CTV (27 up and 0 down) or CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232 (22 up and 3 down) (Fig.  1). The number of DETs responding to CaLas-B232 only (412 up and 15 down) was much larger than the number responding only to CTV-B2 (143 up and 37 down) or CTV-B6 (146 up and 72 down) (Fig.  1). A similar pattern was also found when the DETs were identified using the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (Fig.  2). DETs with unknown functions were also identified (Additional file  1: Table S1). Plant Gene Sequence Enrichment Analysis (PlantGSEA) was performed with excellent  p-values and low false discovery rates to reveal perturbed pathways. The functions of DETs observed in response to all three pathogens were mainly associated with the maintenance of circadian rhythms, such as flowering and photoperiodism, response to stimulus and response to other organism and signaling (Additional file  1: Table S2). DETs observed in response to CTV-B2 and CTV-B6 were disproportionally involved in hormone related responses, signaling pathways, and water stress (Additional file  1: Table S3). DETs observed in response to CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232 disproportionally encoded binding activities, including to iron, tetrapyrrole and heme molecules, which could affect chloroplast function, in addition to genes that respond to biotic stimulus or stress (Additional file  1: Table S4). A much larger set of DETs observed in response to both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 disproportionally encoded biological process (BP) functions in signaling, defense, immune and stress responses and other BPs (Additional file  1: Table S5). DETs observed to respond only to CTV-B2 were mainly associated with molecular functions (MF) and cellular components (CC) (Fig.  3) and disproportionately functioned in active transport of molecules across membranes and cell junctions (Additional file  1: Table S6). In contrast, the DETs observed to respond only to CTV-B6 or CaLas-B232 were primarily involved in BPs (Fig.  3). The long lists of DETs observed in response to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 are the reflection of the BPs disrupted by the severe disease symptoms caused by these pathogens, although symptoms had not yet developed in the tissues at the time they were sampled. Genes whose products functioned in transcription and inositol metabolism, as well as membrane bound intracellular organelles were up-regulated but signaling pathways were down regulated in response to CTV-B6 (Additional file  1: Table S7). The effects on inositol metabolism and membrane bound organelles could represent either the cause or an effect of chloroplast dysfunction seen in citrus infected by this pathogen, and negative regulation of signaling pathways likely impedes the defense response of the host. The long list of DETs that were observed in response only to CaLas-B232 included a large group associated with response to fungal pathogens, programmed cell death, hypersensitive responses and other host defense responses, and the production of jasmonic acid (JA) catalytic activity (Additional file  1: Table S8). The substantial number of genes annotated as ‘response to fungus’ may be correlated with the root decline and rot caused by CaLas and a potential interaction with  Phytophthora spp. [ 14,  15]. Similar defense responses could also be triggered by effectors secreted by CaLas and delivered by fungus. DETs were also assigned to several specific function groups by Mapman (Fig.  4), including cell wall, hormone metabolism, secondary metabolism, transcription factors and signaling  etc. Many pathways related to biotic stress were affected by CTV-B2, CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Fig.  5). For more complete information about DETs, please refer to the supplemental information (Additional file  1: Table S9). Stress response Many disease resistance (R) genes were differentially regulated in response to CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232, and fewer to CTV-B6 (Additional file  1: Figure S4G), including CC (TIR)-NB-LRR (coiled-coil/Toll-interleukin1 receptor-nucleotide binding-Leucine rich repeat) and NB-ARC (nucleotide binding-adaptor shared by APAF-1, certain  R gene products and CED4) domain-containing disease resistance proteins, the largest and well-characterized group of R genes. Transcripts encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs) were especially regulated in response to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  4). The expression of Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (PI), located in the cell wall and responsive to peroxidase, was significantly up-regulated only in response to CaLase-B232 (Table  4). Remarkably, a transcript encoding accelerated cell death 2 (ACD2) was highly up-regulated only responding to CTV-B2 (Table  4). Oxidation/reduction processes Transcripts related to the peroxidase super family were also differentially regulated in response to the three pathogens (Additional file  1: Table S9). Peroxidase 2 (PA2) mRNA accumulated in response to CTV-B2 (Table  4). Transcripts encoding WCRKC thioredoxin1 (WCRKC1), likely involved with redox homeostasis in the chloroplast, were greatly up-regulated only responding to CTV-B6 (Table  4). Transcripts encoding oxidoreductase, a zinc-binding dehydrogenase family protein, were up-regulated in response to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  4). Development, protein degradation and miscellaneous functions Transcripts encoding thiazole biosynthetic enzyme (THI1, TZ, THI4) were up-regulated responding to all three pathogens, especially CTV-B6 (Additional file  1: Table S9). Thiamine biosynthetic genes respond to bacteria, and also act in starch and maltose metabolism [ 35]. These enzymes may contribute to the accumulation of starch in leaves of diseased trees. Transcripts encoding gigantea (GI) and NAC domain containing protein 2 involved in the development and strengthening of secondary cell walls were strongly up-regulated in response to all three pathogens (Table  4). A set of transcripts involved in protein degradation were also differentially regulated in response to the three pathogens (Additional file  1: Table S9), consistent with a previous result that protein degradation and misfolding processes were activated in citrus fruits infected with CaLas [ 36]. A larger set of transcripts encoding UDP-glycoyl transferase and cytochrome P450 were differentially regulated in response to all three pathogens (Additional file  1: Table S9). Both UDP-glycoyl transferase and cytochrome P450 are involved in secondary metabolism, responses to biotic and abiotic stress and oxidation/reduction process. A transcript encoding a concanavalin A-like (ConA-like) protein with a jacalin-like lectin domain was very highly up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  4). Jacalin-related proteins were demonstrated as components in plant defense system [ 37]. RT-qPCR validation of RNA-seq results Thirty-eight genes were tested by replicated RT-qPCR. Expression levels ranged from −7 to 8 (log 2FC) (Additional file  1: Table S10). Spearman’s rho values, 0.821 for CTV-B2, 0.687 for CTV-B6 and 0.813 for CaLas-B232, indicated excellent correlations between Gfold analysis of the RNA Seq libraries and RT-qPCR (Fig.  6). All primers showed amplification efficiencies between 90–110 % (Additional file  1: Table S11) and melting curves showed single peaks for the evaluated genes (Additional file  1: Figure S3). Genes involved in cell wall and cell organization Many transcripts related to cell wall modification and cell organization were differentially regulated, especially in response to CaLas-B232 (Additional file  1: Figure S4A). Transcripts encoding xyloglucan endotransglycosylase 6 (XTR6) were up-regulated by infection with all three pathogens (Table  1). A gene annotated as encoding a plant invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI), was strongly up-regulated in response to CaLas-B232 (Table  1). Inhibition of pectin methyl esterase would strengthen the cell wall and is a common defense response [ 16,  17]. Another set of genes encoding expansin were up-regulated in response to CaLas-B232, in accordance with another study [ 10]. Expansin functions to loosen the structure of cell walls. Taken together this set of genes could contribute to the thickening and stiffening of leaves that occurs as a primary symptom of HLB and distortions of phloem cell walls as CaLas multiplies [ 18]. Transcripts encoding cellulose synthesis, including cellulose synthase-like B3 (CSLB3) and A2 (CSLA2), were sharply up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  1). A transcript encoding COBRA-like protein 7 precursor (COBL7), likely involved in the deposition of cellulose, were also remarkably up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  1), all consistent with a stronger cell wall in response to CTV-B2. A pectin lyase-like superfamily protein and beta-D-xylosidase 4 (XYL4) protein related to cell wall degradation were down-regulated by infection with CTV-B6 (Table  1). Transcripts encoding phloem protein (PP2-B13 and PP2-B15) were strongly down-regulated in response to CTV-B2 (Table  1), but up-regulated by infection with CaLas-B232. The expression of PP2-B10 gene was up-regulated by CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  1). Because these phloem proteins move with assimilate from source to sink tissues [ 19], they may be markers for altered source sink flow of assimilates. Transcripts encoding NPR3 and NPR4, participating in cell organization, were also up-regulated responding to CaLas-B232 (Table  1). Transcripts encoding CYP83B1, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates and defense response by callose deposition, were up-regulated by both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 [ 20] (Table  1). Transcription factors (TFs) The expression of transcription factors, including WRKYs, B-box, MYB, bHTH, heat shock transcription factors (HSF), CDR1, pseudo-response regulator (PRR), ABR1, and jumonji domain-containing protein (JMJD5), were differentially modulated in response to the three pathogens. This was especially the case in trees infected by CTV-B6 (Additional file  1: Figure S4B). Transcripts encoding PRR5 and PRR7 were up-regulated responding to all three pathogens (Table  2). A transcript encoding PRR3 was up-regulated by infection with CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  2). Transcripts encoding JMJD5, a histone demethylase, and CCT motif family protein were up-regulated in response to both CTV strains (Table  2). JMJD5 participates in circadian systems in both plants and animals [ 21]. The expression level of the late elongated hypocotyl (LHY) gene was down-regulated in response to the three pathogens, especially CTV-B6 (Table  2), consistent with down-regulation in flavedo (FF) and vascular tissue (VT) of both symptomatic ‘Hamlin’ and ‘Valencia’ sweet orange infected with CaLas [ 22]. Plant-specific WRKY transcription factors with a DNA-binding domain are involved in plant senescence, plant defense and response to various environmental stresses [ 23,  24]. Expression of WRKY13 and WRKY 70 were especially up-regulated by infection with CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232. WRKY27 and WRKY50 were also up-regulated in response to both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 and WRKY28, WRKY33 and WRKY40 also were up-regulated in response to CaLas-B232 (Table  2). The expression of  constitutive disease resistance ( CDR1) gene, encoding an aspartic protease, was very strongly induced in response to both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232, but not at all to CTV-B2 (Table  2).  CDR1is involved in salicylic-acid-dependent inducible resistance responses and over-expression of  CDR1 enhances resistance to bacterial pathogens in Arabidopsis [ 25]. A Myb-like HTH (helix-turn-helix) transcription factor was very highly down-regulated by infection with CTV-B2, but up-regulated with CaLas-B232 (Table  2). Transcripts encoding an integrase-type DNA-binding protein (ABR1), responsive to ethylene stimulus, were up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  2). Transporters Many transporter genes were differentially regulated in response to the three pathogens, especially CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232 (Additional file  1: Figure S4C). Transcripts encoding 4 zinc transporters (ZIP1, 4, 5 and 11), especially ZIP4 and ZIP5, were up-regulated in association with CaLas infection, but down regulated responding to CTV-B2, consistent with symptoms of zinc deficiency in HLB-diseased plants (Table  2). Transcripts encoding cyclic nucleotide gated channel 1 (CNGC1), involved in cyclic nucleotide or calcium transport, were differentially up-regulated in response to the three pathogens (Table  2). Transcripts encoding copper transporter 1 (COPT1) were up-regulated in response to all three pathogens (Table  2). Transcripts encoding ABC-2 type transporters were highly up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  2). These ATP-binding cassette transporters typically function to export substrates from eukaryotic cells [ 26]. The expression of phosphate transporter 1;7 (PHT1;7) was induced by infection with CaLas-B232 (Table  2), consistent with a prominent role of phosphate deficiency in the HLB disease syndrome [ 27]. The expression of another phosphate transporter PHT1;4 was slightly up-regulated in response to both strains of CTV (Table  2). Transcripts encoding an oligopeptide transporter 7 (OPT7), involved in transport of small peptides [ 28], were up-regulated by infection with CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  2). Hormone metabolism Transcripts encoding jasmonic acid carboxyl methyl transferase (JMT) were highly up-regulated responding to the three pathogens (Table  3). Transcripts encoding lipoxygenase 2 (LOX2), a key enzyme in the synthesis of JA [ 29], and involved in the JA signaling pathway, were highly up-regulated in response to CaLas-B232, but not to the other pathogens (Table  3). Different transcripts of the senescence-related gene (SRG1), involved in ethylene metabolism, were induced in response to the three pathogens (Table  3). The expression of ethylene responsive element binding factors (ERF1 and ERF104), involved in ethylene signal transduction, was also up-regulated by infection with CaLas-B232 (Table  3). A transcript encoding a gibberellin-regulated protein was down-regulated only by infection with CTV-B6 (Table  3). Secondary metabolism Many different transcripts encoding 2-oxoglutarate and Fe (II)-dependent (2OG-Fe (II)) oxygenases were highly up-regulated in response to all three pathogens (Table  3). Transcripts encoding terpene synthase (TPS21), involved in isoprenoid and terpenoid metabolism, were induced up to eight fold by infection with CTV-B2, and to a lesser extent infection by CaLas-B232, but were repressed by CTV-B6 (Table  3). These perturbations of the terpenoid pathways likely contribute to the different volatile components detected following infection by CTV or CaLas [ 30,  31]. The expression of O-methyltransferase (OMT), participating in flavonoid and phenylpropanoid metabolism, was up-regulated in response to both strains of CTV (Table  3). A transcript encoding geranylgeranyl pyrophosphatesynthase1 (GGPS1), also involved in isoprenoid biosynthetic process, was strongly up-regulated in response to CTV-B2 and less so to CaLas-B232 (Table  3). Transcripts encoding homogentisate phytyltransferase (VTE2) were up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2, but were down-regulated by infection with CTV-B6 and did not respond to CaLas-B232 (Table  3). VTE2 catalyzes the synthesis of tocopherol, which plays an important role in protecting chloroplast membranes. The expression of VTE2 was induced in symptomatic and repressed in asymptomatic leaves of sweet orange in response to CaLam [ 32]. Transcripts encoding terpenoidcyclases/proteinprenyl transferase were also significantly up-regulated by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  3). Laccase genes  LAC4,  LAC5 and  LAC7 participating in simple phenol metabolism, were over-expressed in response to CaLas-B232 (Table  3). Transcripts encoding UDP-glucosyl transferase 74B1 (UGT74B1) involved in plant secondary metabolism and playing a potential role in stress or defense responses were up-regulated by both CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232 [ 33] (Table  3). Signaling Plant receptor-like proteins/kinases (RLPs/RLKs) regulate developmental processes and respond to pathogens and abiotic stresses [ 34]. A large number of transcripts encoding RLRs/RLKs, including leucine rich repeat (LRR) kinases, wall-associated kinases (WAKs) and Domain of Unknown Function 26 (DUF26) kinases, were differentially expressed in response to all three pathogens, and very notably to CaLas-B232 (Additional file  1: Figure S4F). The expression of LRR kinases were up-regulated responding to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 but not to CTV-B2, consistent with their role in defense response [ 34]. These included RLP6, RLP9, RLP13, RLP14, RLP15 and RLP45, which were consistently up-regulated by infection with CaLas-B232 and CTV-B6 (Table  4). Transcripts related to wall associated kinases were differentially expressed in response to CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232, including WAK2 and WAK7 (Table  4). Notably, the expression of two members of DUF26 RLKs, cysteine-rich RLK2 (CRK2) and receptor-like kinase1 (RLK1), was significantly induced by infection with CTV-B2 (Table  4). The expression of E1-E2 ATPase was up-regulated in response to all three pathogens. The expression of EF-hand binding protein and calmodulin (CaM) was induced responding to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 (Table  4). Transcripts encoding cold-circadian rhythm RNA binding-like protein (CCR-like, CCL) were up-regulated in response to all three pathogens, especially CTV-B6, approximately five fold (Table  4)."," Background Huanglongbing (HLB) and tristeza, are diseases of citrus caused by a member of the α-proteobacteria, 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CaLas), and Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) respectively. HLB is a devastating disease, but CTV strains vary from very severe to very mild. Both CaLas and CTV are phloem-restricted. The CaLas-B232 strain and CTV-B6 cause a wide range of severe and similar symptoms. The mild strain CTV-B2 doesn't induce significant symptoms or damage to plants. Results Transcriptome profiles obtained through RNA-seq revealed 611, 404 and 285 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) after infection with CaLas-B232, CTV-B6 and CTV-B2. These DETs were components of a wide range of pathways involved in circadian rhythm, cell wall modification and cell organization, as well as transcription factors, transport, hormone response and secondary metabolism, signaling and stress response. The number of transcripts that responded to both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 was much larger than the number of transcripts that responded to both strains of CTV or to both CTV-B2 and CaLas-B232. A total of 38 genes were assayed by RT-qPCR and the correlation coefficients between Gfold and RT-qPCR were 0.82, 0.69, 0.81 for sweet orange plants infected with CTV-B2, CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232, respectively. Conclusions The number and composition of DETs reflected the complexity of symptoms caused by the pathogens in established infections, although the leaf tissues sampled were asymptomatic. There were greater similarities between the sweet orange in response to CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232 than between the two CTV strains, reflecting the similar physiological changes caused by both CTV-B6 and CaLas-B232. The circadian rhythm system of plants was perturbed by all three pathogens, especially by CTV-B6, and the ion balance was also disrupted by all three pathogens, especially by CaLas-B232. Defense responses related to cell wall modification, transcriptional regulation, hormones, secondary metabolites, kinases and stress were activated by all three pathogens but with different patterns. The transcriptome profiles of Citrus sinensis identified host genes whose expression is affected by the presence of a pathogen in the phloem without producing symptoms (CTV-B2), and host genes whose expression leads to induction of symptoms in the plant (CTV-B6, CaLas-B232).","['Huanglongbing', 'Host-pathogen interactions', 'Gfold']","['Table', 'Additional file', 'response', 'Transcripts encoding', 'Additional', 'up-regulated', 'transcripts', 'encoding', 'file', 'infection']","[CTV-B2, CTV-B6, CaLa-B232, CaLas-B232, CTV-B6, CTV-B2 (Additional file, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, DETs, CaLas-B232, CTV-B2 (143 up, CTV-B6 (146, DETs, CTV-B2, CTV-B6, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, heme molecules, DETs, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, BPs, S5, CTV-B2, DETs, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, BPs, DETs, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, BPs, CTV-B6 (Additional file, CaLas-B232, ‘, CTV-B2, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, DETs, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, CTV-B6 (Additional file, S4G, coiled-coil/Toll-interleukin1 receptor-nucleotide binding-Leucine, APAF-1, CED4, R, heat shock proteins, HSPs, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (PI, peroxidase, CaLase-B232, CTV-B2 (Table  4, peroxidase, Peroxidase 2, PA2, CTV-B2 (Table  4, WCRKC thioredoxin1, WCRKC1, CTV-B6 (Table  4, oxidoreductase, dehydrogenase, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, THI1, CTV-B6 (Additional file, UDP-glycoyl transferase, cytochrome P450, UDP-glycoyl transferase, cytochrome P450, concanavalin A-like, CTV-B2 (Table  4, RNA-seq, −7, CTV-B2, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, Gfold, Seq, 90–110 , CaLas-B232, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase 6, XTR6, invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI, CaLas-B232, pectin methyl, esterase, CaLas-B232, HLB, cellulose synthase-like, B3 (, CSLB3, A2 (, CSLA2, CTV-B2 (Table  1, COBRA-like protein 7, COBL7, CTV-B2 (Table  1, pectin lyase-like, beta-D-xylosidase 4, XYL4, CTV-B6 (Table  1, PP2-B13, PP2-B15, CTV-B2 (Table  1, CaLas-B232, PP2-B10, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, NPR3, NPR4, CaLas-B232, CYP83B1, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, WRKYs, B-box, MYB, bHTH, HSF, CDR1, pseudo-response, ABR1, jumonji domain-containing protein, JMJD5, CTV-B6 (Additional file, PRR5, PRR7, PRR3, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, JMJD5, histone, JMJD5, LHY, CTV-B6 (Table  2, vascular tissue (VT), WRKY13, WRKY 70, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, WRKY27, WRKY50, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, WRKY28, WRKY33, WRKY40, CaLas-B232, CDR1, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, CTV-B2 (Table  2, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, ABR1, CTV-B2 (Table  2, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, S4C, ZIP1, ZIP4, ZIP5, CTV-B2, HLB-diseased, CNGC1, copper transporter 1, COPT1, ABC-2 type transporters, CTV-B2 (Table  2, phosphate transporter 1;7, CaLas-B232, phosphate transporter, PHT1;4, oligopeptide transporter 7, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, lipoxygenase 2, LOX2, CaLas-B232, SRG1, ERF1, ERF104, CaLas-B232, CTV-B6 (Table  3, Fe (II)-dependent, 2OG-Fe (II)) oxygenases, TPS21, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, CTV-B6 (Table  3, O-methyltransferase, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphatesynthase1, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, homogentisate phytyltransferase, CTV-B2, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, VTE2, VTE2, terpenoidcyclases/proteinprenyl transferase, CTV-B2 (Table  3, Laccase, CaLas-B232, UDP-glucosyl transferase 74B1, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, receptor-like proteins/kinases, RLPs/RLKs, RLRs/RLKs, wall-associated kinases, CaLas-B232, S4F, LRR kinases, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, CTV-B2, RLP6, RLP9, RLP13, RLP14, RLP15, RLP45, CaLas-B232, CTV-B6 (Table  4, CTV-B2, CaLas-B232, WAK2, WAK7, cysteine-rich RLK2, CRK2, receptor-like kinase1, RLK1, CTV-B2 (Table  4, EF-hand binding protein, calmodulin (, CTV-B6, CaLas-B232, cold-circadian, CCR-like, CTV-B6]","['(TPS21),']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase

Quality Traits of Apricot during Development and Ripening Fruits were classified into five different stages (immature green, S1, maturation green, S2; turning, S3; green ripe, S4; and full ripe, S5) and picked according to peel color ( Table 1 and  Figure 1). Skin color changed dramatically between maturity stages and ripening. The longitudinal and equatorial diameters of cultivars tested varied from 16.25 to 50.85 mm and 20.83 to 49.55 mm during the development and ripening period, respectively ( Figure 2a,b), while the weight increased from 2.6 to 54.35 g. Hongyuxing (HY) had the largest two diameters and fruit weight ( Figure 2c), which presented the large fruit shape, and Danxing (DX) and Yechengheiyeyxing (YC) were the medium-sized fruit cultivars, Luntaixiaobaixing (LT) and Baixing (BX) were the small fruit cultivars. The development of fruits tested was characterized by cell enlargement (0–27 or 32 days), rapid enlargement (0–57 or 91 days) and a period of retarded enlargement (74–101 days). With the development and ripening, the titratable acid (TA) level decreased to the lowest point (<0.55 mmol·L −1 H +) at the full-ripe stage. Yechengheyexing (YC) and Luntaixiaobaixing presented low TA level at ripe stage (<0.4 mmol·L −1 H +), they are low acid cultivars ( Figure 2d). In contrast, the total soluble solids (TSS) of fruit increased from 6.7 to 20.47 Brix, TSS of all tested cultivars increased rapidly after turning stage ( Figure 2e). For almost all cultivars tested, the TSS increased to double the amount of turning stage at the full-ripe stage, and Danxing (DX) had the highest TSS. A similar trend in change was observed in the ratio of TSS/TA ( Figure 2f), the index increased slowly from 2.15 to 6.46 during early development period (S1 to S2), and then increased from 5.78 to 17.78 during the middle period (S3 to S4), at last increased rapidly from 17.78 to 49.75 (S4 to S5) during the ripening period. Fruit softened rapidly during development and ripening ( Figure 2g). The firmness of fruit for all cultivars tested declined from 47.83 to 2.15 N, and the firmness of all fruit tested was less than 6 N at the full-ripe stage. Danxing (DX) had the lowest firmness of the tested cultivars (2.15 N). The levels of ethylene production increased from stage 1 (S1) to stage 4 (S4), then decreased at the stage 5 (S5) ( Figure 2h), and an obvious peak of ethylene were observed at the stage 4 (S4) for all tested fruits (8.24–11.55 ng·kg −1·s −1). 2.2. Changes in Sugars during Fruit Development and Ripening As shown in  Figure 3a, all sugars including fructose, glucose, sucrose and total sugars kept increasing during the whole development period. From the turning stage (S3) to the full-ripe stage (S5), the sugar contents increased especially steeply. Trace sorbitol was detected in fruit tested at all developmental stages. Even though no significant differences of sugar content during the early development (from S1 to S2) were found in all tested fruits, significantly higher fructose was observed in Danxing (DX), Luntaixiaobaixing (LT) and Baixing than those in Hongyu (HY) and Yechengheiyexing (YC) during ripening (from S3 to S5). The content of all sugars identified and total sugars in Luntaixiaobaixing (LT) were found significantly higher than those in other cultivars during ripening. Though higher contents of fructose, glucose, sucrose and total sugars were found in Danxing (DX), Yechengheiyexing (YC) and Luntaixiaobaixing (LT) peels than their pulps during the whole development period, significantly lower level of sugars were found in Hongyuxing (HY) pulps than those in its peels. At the same time, no marked difference of sugar content was found between Bainxin peels and pulps during the whole development period. Therefore, the difference of sugar contents between peels and pulps may dependent on the cultivar. As for the ratio of sugars ( Figure 3b), on the whole, ratio of glucose in fruit decreased significantly during the whole development period, it decreased from 70.17% to 19.43% in peels and 70.17% to 19.17% in pulps of tested cultivars, respectively. However, glucose was the predominant sugar during the early development (from S1 to S3) and still accounted for 38.6%–71.42% of total sugar in peels and 45.08%–70.68% of total sugar in pulps. Similar to glucose, the ratio of fructose also decreased from 21.46% to 4.56% in peels and from 21.46% to 4.82% in pulps during the whole development period. As the second major sugar at the early stage, fructose accounted for 11.41%–21.46% of total sugar in peels and 13.1%–21.46% of total sugar in pulps. However, the ratio of sucrose increased from 10.98% to 69.92% in peels of tested cultivars and 10.98% to 72.22% in pulps of tested cultivars during the whole development period, and become the major sugar in all cultivars tested during ripening (from S3 to S5), accounting for 35.94%–69.92% of total sugars in peels and 27.55%–71.62% of total sugars. Glucose become the second major sugar during ripening, it represented 19.43%–55.64% of total sugar in peels and 19.17%–55.88% in pulps of cultivars tested. During the ripening period, fructose was found at the lowest level of all tested sugars, only accounting for 4.56%–12.14% in peels and 4.82%–16.57% in pulps of cultivars tested. 2.3. Changes in Organic Acids during Fruit Development and Ripening As shown in  Figure 4a, all organic acids including oxalate, tartrate, quinate, malate, citrate, fumarate and total organic acids mostly increased during the early stages of fruit development (from S1 to S3) and decreased until fruits were full-ripe (from S4 to S5). Oxalate, tartrate, quinate, malate, citrate, and fumarate decreased from 2.07 to 0.07 mg/g FW, from 1.56 to 0.12 mg/g FW, from 33.47 to 2.98 mg/g FW, from 27.72 to 6.44 mg/g FW, from 10.22–3.53 mg/g FW and from 0.03–0.01 mg/g FW, respectively. Quinate, malate and citrate were the predominant organic acids throughout the whole fruit development and ripening period. Oxalate and tartrate were found at lower levels, while trace fumarate was also detected in the fruit of cultivars tested during the whole development period. The content of quinate in HY, YH and LT increased to the peak at the turning stage of fruit development, whereas BX accumulated the largest amount of quinate at stage 2 (S2), then decreased to the lowest point at the full-ripe stage (S5). The level of quinate in DX almost kept deceasing throughout the whole development period. Except for HY, higher level of quinate in pulps were found than in peels. DX had the highest quinate content of all tested cultivars. YC and BX presented significantly lower level of quinate than other cultivars tested. Malate in DX, YC and BX increased to the highest level at stage 2 (S2), and then kept decreasing. Malate in DX and LT reached the highest level at stage 3 (S3) and stage 4 (S4). Higher level of malate in peels of DX, YC and LT were observed than in their pulps. A significantly lower level of malate was found in YC than other cultivars tested. The level of citrate kept increasing until stage 3 (S3) or stage 4 (S4) of fruit development, and then decreased at the full-ripe stage. HY presented the lowest level of citrate than other cultivars tested. Except for YC, oxalate generally decreased throughout the whole development period, and the lowest level of oxalate was found in HY. Significantly higher levels of oxalate were found in pulps than in peels. Tartrate was only detected in YC, LT, BX and DX peels, and the content of tartrate in peels tested increased to the highest level at stage 3 (S3), and then declined. Higher levels of tartrate in peels were observed than in pulps. Total acid had a similar trend to that of quinate. DX had significantly higher organic acids identified than other cultivars. As for the ratio ( Figure 4b), quinate, malate and citrate are the predominant organic acids in apricot regardless of developmental stage. Malate is the first major organic acid in apricot. The ratio of malate in fruit decreased from 71.97% to 34.14% in peels and 69.78% to 21.25% in pulps of cultivars tested, respectively. The ratio of quinate also decreased from 55.03% to 7.09% of total organic acids in peels and from 55.03% to 15.57% in pulps during development and ripening, respectively. However, the ratio of citrate increased significantly from 0% to 36.52% in peels and 0% to 45.98%, respectively. Quinate and malate account for more than 85% of total organic acids at the early stage, they are the major organic acids of fruit tested during early development. However, with the increase in the ratio of citrate in fruit, quinate, malate and citrate occupied 93% of total organic acids in both peels and pulps. The ratio of oxalate and tartrate to total organic acids was only 0%–6.47% and 0%–5.87%, respectively. From the ratio of individual organic acid to total organic acids, YC, LT and BX had a richer variety of organic acids than DX and HY. 2.4. Changes in Aroma Volatiles during Development and Ripening A total of 46 aroma compounds were identified, including eight aldehydes, five alcohols, seven esters, five norisoprenoids, eight lactones, ten terpenes and six acids ( Table S2). Among them, 18 aroma compounds, including three aldehydes (hexanal, ( Z)-3-hexenal, ( E, Z)-2,6-nonadienal), three apocarotenoids (β-damascenone, β-ionone, dihydro-β-ionone), five lactones (γ-octalactone, δ-octalactone, γ-decalactone, δ-decalactone, γ-dodecalactone), five terpenes (β-myrcene, linalool, α-terpineol, geraniol, limonene) and two esters (hexyl acetate, ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate), were the major aroma compounds in apricots by odor activity values (OVA) method. The OVAs of these 18 aroma compounds were more than 1 ( Table 2). γ-decalactone was the highest OVA compound in all cultivars tested, it ranged from 145 to 319 with the highest OVA in LT peel. β-ionone was the second major aroma compound in apricot fruit tested. It ranged from 40 to 506. The OVA of β-ionone in LT and BX were 4.65-16.09 times greater than those in other cultivars. γ-dodecalactone was the third major aroma compound and it ranged from 37.21 to 160 with the highest level in LT peel. High OVAs of β-damascenone (180) and hexyl acetate (183), ( E, Z)-2,6-nonadienal (319), and α-terpineol (103) were found in DX, whereas high OVAs of β-ionone (506), γ-dodecalactone (160), γ-decalactone (319) and hexyl acetate (183) was found in LT. Significantly higher OVAs were observed in peels than pulps for all cultivars tested. Changes in 18 major aroma compounds during the whole development period are given in  Figure 5. The contents of hexanal, ( Z)-3-hexenal and ( E, Z)-2,6-nonadienal decreased rapidly throughout the whole development period ( Figure 5a). The total aldehydes decreased from 1170 to 47.8 μg/kg FW. Significantly higher aldehydes were observed in peels than in pulps. As the most abundant aroma compounds in apricot, the contents of β-damascenone, β-ionone and dihydro-β-ionone increased dramatically during fruit ripening, especially the major apocarotenoids. The content of β-ionone increased from 155 to 1875 μg/kg FW in peels and from 30 to 1026 μg/kg FW in pulps of all cultivars tested. It is very interesting that the content of β-ionone, dihydro-β-ionone and total apocarotenoids in LT and BX were significantly higher than those in other cultivars, especially the β-ionone. Similarly, the contents of apocarotenoids in peels were significantly higher than those in the pulps of cultivars tested. Lactones were the second most abundant aroma compounds, and γ-decalactone was the predominant lactone, it ranged from 17.14 to 350.71 μg/kg FW in peels and 5–277.14 μg/kg FW in pulps, respectively. BX had the highest γ-decalactone in cultivars tested. Total lactones also increased rapidly during the ripening period. Conversely, β-myrcene, linalool, α-terpineol, geraniol and limonene all decreased through the ripening period. Linalool was the predominant terpene in these fruits, and it decreased from 987 to 122 μg/kg FW in peels and from 356 to 45 μg/kg FW in pulps during the whole development period. DX had the highest level of linalool and total terpenes during fruit ripening. Two major esters, hexyl acetate and ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, increased during the whole development period, especially as the predominant, ester hexyl acetate increased from 13 to 365 μg/kg FW in peels and 3 to 76 μg/kg FW in pulps, respectively. LT peel had the highest level of total esters. The contents of total aldehydes and terpenes in all cultivars decreased rapidly during fruit development and ripening, while the contents of total lactones and apocarotenoids kept increasing during this period ( Figure 5b). It is interesting that the contents of individual and total apocarotenoids in LT and BX were significantly higher than those in other cultivars in both peels and pulps ( Figure 5). On the whole, peels presented significantly individual or total aroma volatiles than pulps. 2.5. Effect of Flavor Compounds and Ripening on Consumer Acceptance The result showed that flavor compounds and sensory attributes account for 83% of total variability in consumer acceptability ( Figure 6a). Cultivar and development stage appeared to be the main differentiating factors. Fruits were clearly distributed in different locations in the score plot, based on the stage of cultivars or development variable. The DX, HY and YC were located on the lower left side of the PC1, and LT and BX on the right side of the PC1, while cultivar-stage points were clearly separated from the cultivar-stage points ( Figure 6a).  Figure 6b suggested that cultivar—stage DXS4, HYS4 and YCS4 were not the best fruit for consumers mainly due to high level of n-hexanal, malic acid, organic acid content and high sourness; whereas LTS5, BXS5, especially LTS5, were the best mainly due to high contents of β-ionone, γ-decalactone, sucrose, citrate, sweetness, aroma and flavor ( Figure 6b,c). These results suggested that excellent flavor quality and consumer acceptability have a positive relationship with the levels of these above parameters. 2.6. Enzymes Involved in Flavor Compound Metabolism during Development and Ripening Nine enzymes involved in sugar metabolism were analyzed in apricot fruit during the whole development process ( Figure 7a). With regard to enzymes involved in sucrose accumulation, significant increase of activities in sucrose synthase (SS) responsible for synthesis direction (SSthy) and sucrose phosphatesynthase (SPS) were found throughout the whole development process. A significant increase of activity in SS responsible for degradation direction (SSca) was also observed during the development process, although to a lesser extent than SSthy and SPS. Significantly higher levels of SSthy, SPS and SSca were found in LT than those in other cultivars. In addition to synthesis, sucrose can also be cleaved by neutral invertase (NI) and acid invertase (AI), no significant changes were found for these enzymes. Sorbitol can be inverted into fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), and a significant increase SDH enzyme activity was observed during the whole development period ( Figure 7b). Fructose can be cleaved by fructokinase (FK), nevertheless, no significant change was found during ripening process ( Figure 7b). In addition, sorbitol can be also oxidized into glucose by sorbitol oxidase (SO), and a significant increase was found during whole development period ( Figure 7c). In contrast, glucose can be cleaved by glucokinase (GK), however, no significant change was observed in the enzyme activity. For all cultivars tested, no significant differences in the nine enzymes for sugar metabolism were observed between peels and pulps. Six enzymes involved in organic acid metabolism were analyzed in apricot during the fruit development and ripening process. Quinate dehydrogenase (QH) is responsible for converting 3-dehydroquinate into quinate, and significant decrease was found in apricot during fruit development process ( Figure 7d). With regard to malate, malate synthase (MS) is the key enzyme for synthesis, and a significant decrease in its activity was observed throughout the whole development process, which was consistent with the decrease of malate content ( Figure 7e). Significantly higher levels of MS enzyme activity was found in YC fruit than in other cultivars. Malate can also be metabolized by NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), and NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME), and a significant increase in these enzymes were found in cultivars tested in both peels and pulps, which leads to the decease of malate content during the development and ripening process ( Figure 7e). Citrate synthase (CS) mainly is responsible for the citrate biosynthesis, and the activity was induced significantly during fruit development and ripening ( Figure 7f). It is reported that glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) activity participates in regulating cytosolic pH, while no significant change in GAD activity was found in apricot throughout whole development process ( Figure 7f). Similar to the enzymes of sugar metabolism, no significant differences in the six enzymes for organic acid metabolism were observed between peels and pulps. Significant increase of lipoxygenases (LOX), hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), alcohol acyl-transferases (AAT), Acyl-CoA Oxidase (ACX) activities were found throughout the whole development period of apricot fruit ( Figure 7g–j). Similar remarkable increase trend was observed in peels or pulps of apricot tested during fruit development process. A rapid significant increase in carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCD) activity was found during fruit development process in both peels or pulps tested ( Figure 7k), whereas the terpene synthase (TPS) activity decreased significantly during this process ( Figure 7l). On the whole, the enzyme activities of aroma volatiles metabolism in peels were significantly higher than those in pulps of all cultivars tested. 2.7. Correlation between Enzymatic Capacities and Flavor Compound Accumulation To search for possible links between enzymatic activities and flavor compounds accumulation, a Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed. As seen in  Figure 8a, the contents of fructose, glucose and sucrose are significantly positively correlated with SPS activity ( p < 0.01). Similarly, a significant positive correlation was observed between the contents of sucrose, total sugars and Ssthy activity ( p < 0.01). In contrast, a significant negative correlation was found between the contents of sucrose, total sugars and Ssca activity. No other significant correlations were found between the enzyme activities of sugar metabolism and sugar accumulation. Regarding organic acids ( Figure 8b), the content of malate was significantly positively correlated with MS activity, but negatively with NADP-ME and NAD-ME activities ( p < 0.01). The content of citrate was significantly positively correlated with CS activity, but negatively with GAD activity ( p < 0.01). As shown in  Figure 8c, ester and lactone accumulation is significantly positively correlated with LOX, HPL, ADH, AAT and ACX activities ( p < 0.01), however, significant negative correlations were found between the content of aldehydes and ADH activity. The contents of apocarotenoids and terpenes are significantly positively correlated with CCD and TPS activities, respectively.","Sugars, organic acids and volatiles of apricot were determined by HPLC and GC-MS during fruit development and ripening, and the key taste and aroma components were identified by integrating flavor compound contents with consumers' evaluation. Sucrose and glucose were the major sugars in apricot fruit. The contents of all sugars increased rapidly, and the accumulation pattern of sugars converted from glucose-predominated to sucrose-predominated during fruit development and ripening. Sucrose synthase (SS), sorbitol oxidase (SO) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) are under tight developmental control and they might play important roles in sugar accumulation. Almost all organic acids identified increased during early development and then decrease rapidly. During early development, fruit mainly accumulated quinate and malate, with the increase of citrate after maturation, and quinate, malate and citrate were the predominant organic acids at the ripening stage. The odor activity values (OAV) of aroma volatiles showed that 18 aroma compounds were the characteristic components of apricot fruit. Aldehydes and terpenes decreased significantly during the whole development period, whereas lactones and apocarotenoids significantly increased with fruit ripening. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) results revealed that β-ionone, γ-decalactone, sucrose and citrate are the key characteristic flavor factors contributing to consumer acceptance. Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCD) may be involved in β-ionone formation in apricot fruit.","['Metabolites', 'Fruit quality', 'Apricot', 'Organic acids', 'Flavor', 'Volatiles', 'Sugars']","['Figure', 'Development', 'development period', 'Fruit Development', 'cultivars tested', 'peels', 'cultivars', 'fruit', 'tested', 'Ripening']","[S4, S5, g.

40,40,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5234130\eupmc_result.json,PMC5234130,"Results and discussion De novo assembly and functional annotation De novo RNA-seq approach facilitates analysis of transcriptome for an organism without sequenced genome such as rose-scented geranium [ 21]. Transcriptome sequencing of rose-scented geranium foliage on Illumina platform generated a total of 16.05 million raw reads. The filtered reads were deposited in NCBI Short Read Achieve (SRA) database under accession number SRP078041. A total of 15.44 million high quality reads were  de novo assembled into 78,943 nonredundant contigs (>200 bp length), with an average length of 623 bp and N50 length of 752 bp (Table  1). The total size of the assembled transcriptome was amounted as 49.23 Mb, with average GC content of 44.97%. Majority of the contigs (53.92%) had 200 to 500 bp lengths. The lengths of 30.86% contigs (24,366) were ranged from 501 to 1000 bp, followed by 14.98% contigs (11,826) of 1001–3000 bp. Only 24 transcripts were detected in the range of 4001–7500 bp (Fig.  2). All the transcripts of the rose-scented geranium were searched (BLASTx) against known proteins in NR database, annotating a total of 51,802 contigs. A total of 611 plant species contributed the annotated contigs in the top-scoring BLASTx hits against NR protein database (Additional file  3). Out of these, top five species that contributed the greatest number of annotated contigs were  Vitis vinifera,  Theobroma cacao, Jatropha curcas,  Citrus sinensis, and  Ricinus communis (Fig.  3). The results provided transcript sequence information, their expression and putative function of the genes expressed in the leaves of rose-scented geranium (Additional file  3) . The transcriptome data is a useful resource for identifying genes with putative roles in various biochemical activities and pathways in the volatile oil plant.  Functional categorization The contigs having sequence homology with uniprot annotations were subjected to GO assignments under biological processes, cellular component and molecular function categories. A total of 25,776 transcripts were assigned to at least one GO term (Additional file  4). In the category of biological processes, transcripts related to transcription regulation, translation, carbohydrate metabolic process, transmembrane and intracellular protein transports were predominant. In molecular functions, genes involved in ATP binding, DNA binding, zinc ion binding, nucleic acid binding and structural constituent of ribosome were abundantly expressed. In cellular components, genes related to integral component of membrane, nucleus, intracellular, cytoplasm and ribosome were the most abundant classes (Additional file  1: Figure S2). A total of 54,104 rose-scented geranium contigs could be mapped to 12,381 non-redundant  A. thaliana protein sequences (Additional file  5). The orthologous  A. thaliana gene ids were used to perform MapMan analysis. MapMan results visualized significant representation of genes associated with secondary metabolic biosynthesis pathways as terpenes, flavonoids, and phenylpropanoids (Additional file  1: Figures S3 and S4). The secondary metabolites participate in active defense mechanism of plants providing protection from a wide range of stresses [ 25]. Accordingly, MapMan analysis revealed putative genes quoted as involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses (Additional file  1: Figure S5). Terpene biosynthesis Rose-scented geranium produces essential oil, containing fragrant as well as other specialized metabolites with antioxidant, antimicrobial, and human health-promoting effects, in specialized tissues of leaves known as glandular trichomes. Terpenes are the largest and the most diverse class of natural products, and constitute a major component of essential oil in rose-scented geranium. They are produced as a homologous series of molecules as polymers of isoprene, the C 5 precursor molecules being IPP and/or DMAPP that are generated via the process of isoprenogenesis [ 11,  26]. In plants, isoprenogenesis occurs through two discrete biosynthetic pathways: the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway in cytosol and the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (MEP/DOXP) pathway in plastids. Their relative contribution for isoprenes, to be used in terpenoid biosynthesis, depends on many factors such as specific sub-classes of terpenoids, specific terpenoidal molecules, quantitative level of production and environmental conditions. Generally, the MEP/DOXP pathway generates monoterpenes and diterpenes, whereas the MVA pathway is largely responsible to produce sesquiterpenes and triterpenes [ 27]. However, there are exceptions to this generalization and exchange of precursors as well between the two pathways [ 28], for example, the MEP/DOXP pathway synthesizes sesquiterpenes along with monoterpenes in  Antirrhinum majus [ 29]. In MVA pathway, IPP is biosynthesized by sequential actions of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase/acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT), hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA synthase (HMGS), hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), mevalonate kinase (MVK), phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MVD) (Fig.  4). AACT condenses two molecules of acetyl CoA to biosynthesize acetoacetyl CoA, and then HMGS combines acetyl CoA with acetoacetyl CoA generating hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) [ 30]. The transcriptome analysis identified three unique putative genes for AACT (e-value: 1e −48 to 0) and four for HMGS (e-value: 1e −30 to 0) in rose-scented geranium. A total of thirteen unique putative transcripts represented NADPH-dependent enzyme- HMGR (e-value: 3e −21 to 0) in rose-scented geranium, which catalyzes the biosynthesis of mevalonate from HMG-CoA [ 17,  31]. The sequence analysis of putative AACT, HMGS and HMGR genes suggested that they contain full-length open reading frames (ORFs). Mevalonate is transformed into mevalonate 5- di phosphate by two phosphorylation reactions catalyzed by MVK and PMK. Thereafter, MVD converts mevalonate 5- di phosphate into the key isoprene unit, IPP. The transcriptome examination revealed homologies with four MVK (e-value: 2e −41 to 6e −126), one PMK (e-value: 2e −41 to 3e −52), and two MVD (e-value: 2e −47 to 9e −51) putative unique genes. IPP is enzymatically isomerized into DMAPP by isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI), and thus providing two types of phosphorylated isoprenes (IPP and DMAPP) for isoprenoid biosynthesis. The transcriptome analysis identified five representative contigs for IDI (e-value: 1e −56 to 5e −129). Sequence analysis suggested presence of complete ORFs in the putative IDI gene.  In DOXP pathway, biosynthesis of IPP or DMAPP involves seven enzymatic steps (Fig.  4). The condensation of pyruvate and D -glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) is catalyzed by 1-deoxy- D -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), producing 1-deoxy- D -xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) that is transformed into 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) by 1-deoxy- D -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) or MEP synthase [ 17]. A total of 9 and 8 unique putative genes were identified related to DXS (e-value: 2e −24 to 0) and DXR (e-value: 3e −29 to 0), respectively. Computational analysis predicted full-length sequences of the candidate protein-coding DXS and DXR genes. The enzyme 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (MCT) catalyzes conversion of MEP into 4-(cytidine 5′ -diphospho)-2-C-methyl- D-erythritol (CDP-ME), which is then transformed into 2-phospho 4- (cytidine 5′ -diphospho) 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol (CDP-ME2P) by 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (CMK). The enzymatic actions of 2-C-methyl- D -erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MDS) and (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate synthase (HDS) causes sequential conversion of CDP-ME2P into C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (ME 2,4 cPP), and then 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate (HMBPP). Finally, biosynthesis of IPP happens from HMBPP by (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HDR) [ 30]. The transcriptome investigation identified three unique putative contigs for CMK (e-value: 2e −17 to 5e −146), two for MDS (e-value: 1e −29 to 3e −91), three for HDS (e-value: 1e −41 to 6e −77), and five for HDR (e-value: 7e −27 to 4e −110). The putative CMK and MDS genes showed full-length ORFs in sequence analysis. The C5 units, IPP or DMAPP, may be linked together by head to tail condensation reaction resulting terpenes of different classes e.g. mono, sesqui, di and triterpenes. The first condensation step of IPP and DMPP is catalyzed by geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS), synthesizing geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP). GPP is substrate for monoterpene biosynthesis by enzymatic actions of monoterpene synthases (MTPS), such as geraniol synthase and linalool synthase. Catalysis of sequential coupling of IPP units to GPP results farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) by farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS) enzymes, respectively. FPP and GGPP are substrates for sesquiterpene and diterpene biosynthesis, catalyzed by sesquiterpene synthases (STPS) and diterpene synthases (DTPS) [ 32,  33]. The transcriptional profiling identified two representative unique transcripts for GPPS (e-value: 1e −54 to 2e −146), three for FPPS (e-value: 2e −56 to 8e −155), ten for GGPPS (e-value: 5e −21 to 2e −164), thirteen for MTPS (e-value: 1e −32 to 0), five for STPS (e-value: 9e −20 to 6e −166), and ten unique contigs for DTPS (e-value: 3e −14 to 1e −106). Full-length sequences were obtained in case of the candidate genes for GGPPS, MTPS (ocimene synthase) and STPS (germacrene D synthase). The essential oil of rose scented geranium contains several mono-, di and sesquiterpenes. The main components which determine its aroma are citronellol, geraniol, linalool and their esters [ 34]. In addition, significant quantities of isomenthone, menthone, nerol,  cis-and  trans-rose oxides, α-terpineol, α -pinene, myrcene, and β-phyllandrene contributes to its aroma [ 26]. In agreement with the aroma profile of this plant, significant level of expression was observed for the putative genes encoding geraniol synthase, linalool synthase, myrcene synthase, β-ocimene synthase, limonene synthase, germacrene synthase, nerolidol synthase, cadinene synthase, copalyl diphosphate synthase, kaurene synthase, and BAHD acyltransferase. In the annotated rose-scented geranium leaf transcriptome, a total of 158 contigs were mapped on 103 unique proteins involved in terpene biosynthesis, with significantly low e-value (Fig.  4; Additional file  6). The putative protein-coding genes exhibited presence of conserved ORFs, and many of them were likely to contain complete ORFs, suggesting identification of relevant transcripts involved in the terpene biosynthetic pathways. The putative genes involved in downstream steps of the MEP pathway exhibited relatively higher expression as compared to the MVA pathway (Additional file  6), which is in agreement with abundance of monoterpene hydrocarbons in essential oil of geranium plants [ 5,  27]. The sequence information and transcriptional pattern of the putative genes would be useful in understanding molecular mechanism and engineering of terpene biosynthesis in rose-scented geranium . Tartaric acid biosynthesis pathway The plant-derived metabolite, tartaric acid, is of high human value as a vital antioxidant and flavorant in food products. Recently, our group established a process for production of scented natural tartaric acid from rose-scented geranium biomass  per se or from residual water after hydro-distillation of the geranium foliage [ 13]. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C), the most abundant soluble antioxidant in cells of higher plants, is a putative biosynthetic precursor in the formation of tartaric acid. Tartaric acid biosynthesis is the result of catabolism of the six-carbon ascorbic acid. The hydrolysis of ascorbic acid may follow cleavage between the carbon atoms 2 and 3 or 4 and 5, with still unresolved plant-species specific preference of the alternative cleavage pathways [ 35]. The 2–3 cleavage in ascorbic acid results oxalic acid and threonic acid, further oxidizes into tartaric acid [ 36]. Alternatively, ascorbic acid is converted to idonic acid, and the latter into an intermediate compound 5-keto D-gluconic acid by the action of an enzyme called idonate dehydrogenase. The intermediate compound is then cleaved between carbon atoms 4 and 5 resulting tartaric acid [ 12]. Though, intermediates of tartarate biosynthesis from ascorbic acid have been characterized chemically, enzymes catalyzing all the reactions are yet to be identified. Geraniaceae family plants have been suggested to follow C2-C3 cleavage in ascorbic acid during tartarate biosynthesis [ 12,  35,  36]. However, no enzymatic or genomic information about the metabolic steps is known. The transcriptome analysis of rose-scented geranium notified substantial level of expression for idonate dehydrogenase (IDH) (Fig.  5). The sequence analysis of IDH gene revealed 80% protein sequence identity with that of  Vitis venifera (XP_010662490) at 99% query coverage and zero e-value. As IDH is involved in C4-C5 cleavage of ascorbate [ 35], the findings indicate the possibility of operation of both the C2/C3 and C4/C5 pathways of ascorbic acid hydrolysis for tartarate biosynthesis in rose-scented geranium . Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway is the principal route for biogenesis of the precursor multifunctional metabolite ascorbic acid in higher plants [ 37,  38] . Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway is based on photosynthesis-based carbon flux and catalyzed by a series of enzymes, such as GDP-D-mannose 3′, 5′ epimerase (ME), GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (GP), L-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase (GPP), L-galactose dehydrogenase (GD), and L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GLDH) [ 39]. The transcriptome investigation identified six unique putative genes representing ME (e-value: 8e −47 to 0), four for GP (e-value: 1e −24 to 2e −117), one for GPP (e-value: 8e −46 to 9e −64), sixteen for GD (e-value: 1e −28 to 0), and one putative gene for GLDH (e-value: 2e −122 to 0). Full-length transcripts with relevant putative ORFs were obtained for the aforementioned key enzymes involved in ascorbate biosynthesis. Transcripts were also identified for two other ascorbic acid biosynthetic routes arising from  myo-inositol and pectin (Fig.  5), as reported in few plants [ 35]. A total of 189 contigs could be mapped on 130 unique genes belonging to ascorbic acid and tartaric acid biosynthesis (Additional file  7). Anacardic acid biosynthesis pathway Anacardic acid (2-hydroxy-6-alkylbenzoic acid) is a dietary and medicinal phytochemical structurally similar to salicylic acid. It has been reported to be produced in glandular trichomes of Geraniaceae plants, conferring pest resistance [ 40– 42]. Pest resistant and susceptible genotypes exhibit predominance of unsaturated (22:1 ώ 5 and 24:1 ώ 5) and saturated (22:0 and 24:0) anacardic acid, respectively [ 40,  43]. The biosynthesis of anacardic acid could happen through polyketide mechanism using fatty acids as precursor molecules [ 41,  44]. Carbon elongation in anacardic acid is achieved by utilizing acetate units derived from malonyl-CoA. Acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] desaturase and type III polyketide synthase (PKS), a muilti module protein, catalyzes condensation reaction steps of anacardic acid biosynthesis [ 41]. In transcriptome data, a total of 114 contigs were identified, with substantial level of expression, showing homology with thirteen type-III PKS (e-value: 3e −19 to 0) and six Acyl ACP desaturase (e-value: 1e −53 to 5e −175) putative genes (Fig.  6; Additional file  8). However, their involvement as candidate genes in anacardic acid biosynthesis need to be further validated.  Putative genes for transcription factors and hormones Transcription factors (TFs) modulate, qualitative and quantitative transcriptional behavior of genes at spatial and temporal level regulating various metabolic pathways. The rose-scented geranium contigs were annotated against all plant TFs. A total of 15,666 contigs were mapped on 3,440 all plant TF genes at an e-value cut-off of 1e −5 (Additional file  9). The putative genes for the TF families- bHLH, MYB, WRKY, C2H2, CH, NAC, MYB-related, GRAS, FAR1, and bZIP were significantly abundant in the transcriptome data (Fig.  7a). The TFs belonging to bHLH, MYB, AP2/ERF, and WRKY families execute key roles in regulation of biosynthesis of terpenes, which is the largest secondary metabolite family [ 45– 49]. Some of the TF genes have been characterized for regulating biosynthesis of terpene secondary metabolites in different plants e.g.  AaWRKY1,  AaERF1,  AaERF2,  AaORA1,  AabZIP1,  GaWRKY1,  TaWRKY1,  HbEREBP1,  HbWRKY1,  OsTGAP1, and  MsYABBY5 [ 50]. Transcripts were identified for orthologous putative genes of these TFs (e-value: 3e −8 to 0) in the transcriptome data (Fig.  7b; Additional file  9). Some of the putative TFs exhibited presence of complete ORFs in the sequence e.g.  AaWRKY1, AabZIP1, GaWRKY1,  HbWRKY1, and  MsYABBY5. These could be potential candidates for metabolic engineering and improvement of the production of secondary metabolites in rose-scented geranium . Signaling molecules known as phytohormones regulate the plant development and physiological processes, and responses to environment and endogenous factors. In the transcriptome data, a total of 9,453 rose-scented geranium transcripts were matched with 516 protein sequences (e-value >1e −5) of  A. thaliana belonging to different hormones: abscisic acid, auxin, ethylene, brassinosteroid, salicylic acid, gibberellin, cytokinin, and jasmonic acid (Fig.  8; Additional file  10). When analyzed hormone related transcripts with ≥ 5 Log2 FPKM, orthologous genes for abscisic acid, ethylene, auxin and brassinosteroids were found most abundant, followed by salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and gibberellin (Additional file  10). Plant hormones such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid have been noted as potential elicitors of secondary metabolite biosynthesis [ 48,  51].  The sequence and transcriptional pattern information of TFs and hormones would be useful in understanding secondary metabolism as well as engineering of biosynthesis of value-added compounds (e.g. terpene and tartaric acid) in rose-scented geranium. SSR detection Simple sequence repeats (SSR) are locus-specific, co-dominant, abundant in genome, and multiallelic molecular markers with high rates of transferability across the species [ 52,  53]. Mining of SSRs was carried out to enable the development of molecular markers in rose-scented geranium . In total, 6040 SSR motifs (mono to hexa nucleotides) were identified in 5380 contigs (Additional file  11), which corresponds to 6.8% of the total unique transcripts. The result agrees with previous studies reporting approximately 3–7% of expressed sequences with putative SSR motifs [ 54]. Out of these analyzed transcripts, 571 contained more than one SSR, whereas, 316 were in compound form (Table  2). The highest frequency of SSR was of tri-nucleotide (50%), followed by di- (28.13%) and mono-nucleotide (18.95%), as represented in Table  2. These SSR motifs could be potential candidates for development of transcript based microsatellite marker, helpful in analyzing molecular mapping, marker assisted selection, and functional genetic variation in rose-scented geranium and related  Pelargonium species.  Assembly validation The  de novo transcriptome assembly, done by Trinity assembler tools, was validated by using standard PCR. End-to-end primers were designed using sequences of four randomly selected putative genes of different size  viz 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (689 bp), GDP mannose 3′, 5′ epimerase (799 bp), WRKY-4 (992 bp) and zeaxanthin epoxidase (369 bp). PCR assay, using first strand cDNA of rose scented geranium leaf as template, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis yielded amplicons of expected size of the respective transcripts (369 to 992 bp), validating transcriptome assembly (Additional file  1: Figure S6). Validation of putative gene expression via semi-quantitative and real-time PCR To validate the expression of putative genes in RNA-seq data, semi-quantitative and real-time PCR analyses were performed for selected transcripts belonging to terpene and tartaric acid pathways, transcription factor and hormone regulation. The comparative analysis revealed similar expression pattern as observed in transcriptome analysis (Fig.  9; Additional file  1: Figure S7). "," Background Rose-scented geranium (Pelargonium sp.) is a perennial herb that produces a high value essential oil of fragrant significance due to the characteristic compositional blend of rose-oxide and acyclic monoterpenoids in foliage. Recently, the plant has also been shown to produce tartaric acid in leaf tissues. Rose-scented geranium represents top-tier cash crop in terms of economic returns and significance of the plant and plant products. However, there has hardly been any study on its metabolism and functional genomics, nor any genomic expression dataset resource is available in public domain. Therefore, to begin the gains in molecular understanding of specialized metabolic pathways of the plant, de novo sequencing of rose-scented geranium leaf transcriptome, transcript assembly, annotation, expression profiling as well as their validation were carried out. Results De novo transcriptome analysis resulted a total of 78,943 unique contigs (average length: 623 bp, and N50 length: 752 bp) from 15.44 million high quality raw reads. In silico functional annotation led to the identification of several putative genes representing terpene, ascorbic acid and tartaric acid biosynthetic pathways, hormone metabolism, and transcription factors. Additionally, a total of 6,040 simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs were identified in 6.8% of the expressed transcripts. The highest frequency of SSR was of tri-nucleotides (50%). Further, transcriptome assembly was validated for randomly selected putative genes by standard PCR-based approach. In silico expression profile of assembled contigs were validated by real-time PCR analysis of selected transcripts. Conclusion Being the first report on transcriptome analysis of rose-scented geranium the data sets and the leads and directions reflected in this investigation will serve as a foundation for pursuing and understanding molecular aspects of its biology, and specialized metabolic pathways, metabolic engineering, genetic diversity as well as molecular breeding.","['Ascorbic acid', 'tartaric acid', 'Terpene', 'Anacardic Acid', 'De Novo Transcriptome', 'Rose-scented Geranium', 'Pelargonium Sp.

41,41,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5281624\eupmc_result.json,PMC5281624,"Results Heat treatment and berry temperature recording HT was applied locally on clusters of Cabernet Sauvignon fruiting cuttings at 3 developmental stages, namely middle-green, veraison and middle-ripening (Figure  1A). Three different sets of 25 plants per condition (control or HT) were used for each developmental stage. HT was applied every day during 14 d from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. to mimic usual daytime temperature course of sunlight-exposed berries. Under control conditions, average daytime berry flesh temperature measured were 26.5°C ± 1.4 (control green stage, GC clusters), 25.8°C ± 2.2 (control veraison stage, VC clusters), and 26.2°C ± 2.5 (control ripe stage, RC clusters). HT increased the average daytime pulp temperature to 34.7 ± 1.4°C, 33.7 ± 1.9°C, and 35.2 ± 2.5°C for GHT, VHT, and RHT clusters respectively (Figure  1B). Depending on the developmental stage, this experimental set-up led to average pulp temperature differences of 8.2°C ± 1.3 (GHT vs. GC), 7.9°C ± 1.1 (VHT vs. VC) and 9.0°C ± 0.8 (RHT vs. RC) between heat-treated and control berries (Figure  1B). The HT imposed during the herbaceous stage delayed the onset of anthocyanin accumulation by 2 to 3 weeks (GHT  vs GC berries), (Figure  2A). Furthermore, for control clusters 4 weeks were needed to reach complete color turning stage (100% clusters ( n = 25) while at least one additional week was required to reach the same stage in the heated clusters. However, even at the last stage, the percentage of uncolored berries per cluster (46%) remained much higher than in control clusters (8%) (Figure  2C). A similar delay in the increase in total soluble solids (TSS) content was also observed in stressed berries (Figure  2B) while the average berry weight was not affected by the treatments (data not shown). Biochemical analysis of the treated berries The biochemical content of berries collected at harvest from control fruiting cuttings was compared with that of berries exposed to a 2-week period HT at 3 different developmental stages (Table  1). The berry hexose content (glucose and fructose) at harvest was not affected whenever the fruit-localized HT took place. By contrast, applying HT at veraison and to a lesser extent at ripening stage decreased malate content while tartrate content was slightly higher in VHT clusters than in other samples. In the present study, 20 amino acids including the non-proteinogenic ones were quantified. The concentration of 7 amino acids (THR, ARG, TYR, PHE, CYS, LYS, GABA) was significantly increased by a HT applied at veraison or ripening stages. Conversely, the PRO amount decreased dramatically after mid-ripening treatment (Table  1). The total anthocyanin concentration (TSA) in berry skin at harvest was reduced by about 50% in VHT and RHT when compared to control and GHT berries (Table  1). Interestingly, the GHT berries that colored later (Figure  1, Supplementary data) displayed a TSA comparable to control berries at harvest. Cabernet Sauvignon berries contained higher amounts of tri-hydroxylated anthocyanins than di-hydroxylated ones in both control and heated conditions. Heat exposure preferentially decreased the proportion of dihydroxylated anthocyanins, regardless of the period of HT treatment (Table  1). Acylated anthocyanins represented a higher proportion of the total anthocyanin pool in HT berries (Table  1). The concentration of malvidin-3- O-glucoside, which is the most abundant anthocyanin in Cabernet Sauvignon berries (Dimitrovska et al.,  2011; Lorrain et al.,  2011) remained unaffected at harvest whereas the amount of one of its acylated forms (malvidin-3- O-(6′-acetyl)-glucoside) was significantly increased in GHT clusters. By contrast, the concentrations of dephinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and of their 3-acetyl-glucoside derivatives were severely reduced by heat irrespectively of the period of treatment in GHT, VHT and RHT berries. The inhibiting effect of HT on the corresponding 3-coumaroyl-glucoside derivatives was less pronounced. Alteration of global berry transcriptome in response to localized heat treatment Principal component analysis of the whole normalized gene expression dataset showed that the 3 replicates of each experimental condition are well-grouped and therefore adequate for further analysis (Figure  3; Supplementary Figure  1). Principal component 1 (PC1) and PC2 explained 26% of the total variance in gene expression and can be attributed to development. PC1 (18.9%) clearly separated the green stage from both veraison and ripening stages, whereas separation between veraison and the two other stages can be distinguished on PC2 (7.1%) (Supplementary Figure  1). PC3 explained 6.2% of the total variance and splits HT from control samples in a similar proportion whatever the developmental stage. Finally, the samples were clearly separated according to the treatment duration, potentially reflecting a developmental dependent response (Figure  3). A total of 7518 transcripts were differentially expressed (fold change > 2,  p-value adj. < 0.05) in at least one of the 9 conditions (Supplementary Table  1), corresponding to 25.4% of the unigenes represented on the microarray slide. The overlaps in DEGs under these nine conditions were depicted with 3-way Venn diagrams, according to developmental stage (Figure  4A) or stress duration (Figure  4B). The strongest HT effect was observed for the herbaceous stage with 5287 DEGs, compared to 4122 and 5061 DEGs identified after HT exposure at veraison and ripening stage, respectively (Figure  4A; Supplementary Table  2). A total number of 4141, 6612, and 3717 genes were deregulated after 1, 7, and 14 days of HT, respectively (Figure  4B; Supplementary Table  2). Except for one condition (V14D), the number of up-regulated genes was always higher than the number of down-regulated genes. The strongest HT effect was observed at G7D with 4024 DEGs (2135 up-regulated and 1889 down-regulated genes, 7 and 6% of the grapevine unigenes, respectively) whereas the smallest effect (577 DEGs) was observed in G1D. The comparison of all 9 conditions showed that only 36 genes were steadily induced under HT condition whereas continuously down-regulated transcripts were not found (Supplementary Table  3). These genes will be further considered in the discussion section below. Identification of significantly altered functional categories according to the stage and the treatment duration To gain insight into the functional categories impacted by HT, the 7518 DEGs were distributed into 35 MapMan functional categories, the so-called BINs (Usadel et al.,  2005). The proportion of DEGs representing each category was determined for each of the nine experimental conditions (Figure  5). Functional enrichment analysis was performed to better identify the significantly altered functional categories according to the stage and the stress duration. HT triggered a wide range of effects on the berry transcriptome (Figure  5; Supplementary Table  4). Twenty-seven of the 35 MapMan BINs were significantly altered in HT berries in at least one condition, but only 3 functional categories, namely “Stress” (BIN 20), “Protein” (BIN 29) and “Secondary metabolism” (BIN 16), were profoundly affected in all 9 conditions. The 24 other categories were differentially affected according to the developmental stage and the stress duration, and particularly correspond to Photosynthesis (BIN 1), Cell wall (BIN 10), Hormone metabolism (BIN 17), RNA (BIN 27), DNA (BIN 28), Signaling (BIN 30), and Transport (BIN 34). “Stress” -associated BIN Four hundred twenty seven DEGs were related to the functional category “Stress” and mainly belonged to the “abiotic/heat stress” cluster (Supplementary Table  5; 98 out of the 427 “Stress” DEGs). Most of the transcripts associated to “heat stress” category were predominantly up-regulated (Supplementary Figure  2A) and belong to the HSP family (Heat Shock Protein). Transcripts encoding universal stress proteins (USPs; VIT_17s0000g04260, VIT_04s0079g00610, VIT_08s0032g00590) also accumulated in response to HT. “Protein” -associated BIN HT deeply affects protein homeostasis. Indeed, numerous HSP and chaperones genes were up-regulated in HT berries (Supplementary Tables  5,  6). These proteins play an important role in protein-protein interactions (Kotak et al.,  2007a; Bokszczanin and Fragkostefanakis,  2013). The abundance of several FK506-binding protein (FKBP) related transcripts was also increased by HT (VIT_19s0015g01100, VIT_07s0031g01150, VIT_08s0007g04340, VIT_13s0064g00580, VIT_01s0011g00930, VIT_00s0260g00070). These proteins belong to the large family of peptidyl prolyl cis–trans isomerases that can function as chaperones. Protein synthesis and degradation were also strongly affected in heated berries as suggested by the 60 DEGs linked to protein synthesis category and the 348 genes belonging to proteolysis (Supplementary Tables  5,  6). Protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays an essential role in diverse cellular pathways, cell-cycle progression, DNA repair, and degradation of damaged proteins as well as in signal transduction. Particularly, UPS components are major players in plant acclimation to abiotic stresses (Stone,  2014; Guerra et al.,  2015). In the present study, 167 transcripts potentially linked to the ubiquitin machinery were deregulated after HT (102 up-, 56 down-, 9 both up- and down-regulated transcripts; Supplementary Table  6). Most of these DEGs encode different putative ubiquitin ligases (E3). Orthologs of each of the 3 major E3 classes (namely RING-type (Really Interesting New Gene); HECT-type (Homology to E6-Associated Carboxyl- Terminus), and U-box-type) were up-regulated in heat-stressed berries. While some E3-like transcripts accumulated whatever the developmental stage (VIT_09s0002g00220, VIT_12s0034g01390, VIT_05s0124g00230, VIT_06s0009g03670, VIT_08s0040g02600, VIT_19s0027g00320), most of these were transiently or specifically deregulated at a particular stage. For instance, some E3-related transcripts were only HT up-regulated during the herbaceous stage (VIT_17s0000g09790, VIT_18s0041g01090, VIT_14s0068g02150, VIT_14s0066g02580, VIT_08s0056g01410) whereas others responded to HT during veraison or ripening stages (VIT_19s0015g00660, VIT_01s0011g02950, VIT_01s0026g00300, VIT_07s0005g01360, VIT_08s0007g04790, VIT_18s0001g02280, VIT_00s0160g00270, VIT_18s0001g06220). Furthermore, the CRL group (Cullin based Ring E3 ligases), corresponding to the largest class of ubiquitin ligases (Stone,  2014), and especially the CUL1 based E3s, [also referred to as Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF)] were strongly impacted by HT. Indeed, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis adaptor protein S-Phase kinase-associated protein (SKP; VIT_03s0038g02480) and many F-box proteins are up-regulated at the transcriptional level upon HT. “Secondary metabolism” -associated BIN While many structural genes were transcriptionally affected in HT berries, the positive regulatory genes identified so far in grapevine were either weakly ( VviMYBPA1, VviMYB14, VviMYB15, VviMYBF1) or not deregulated ( VviMYBA1, VviMYBA2, VviMYBA3, VviMYC1, VviMYCA1, VviMYBPA2) in HT berries (Supplementary Table  11). Accordingly, HT did not affect the amount of  VviGT1 transcript (VIT_16s0039g02230) that encodes the anthocyanidin glycosyltransferase catalyzing the limiting step for anthocyanin accumulation and are a direct target of VviMybA1 transcription factor (TF; VIT_02s0033g00410) (Cutanda-Perez et al.,  2009). For comparison, no effect of HT was observed on  VviMYBA1 transcripts in berries from fruiting cuttings (Carbonell-Bejerano et al.,  2013), whereas a  VviMYBA1 repression was reported in two others studies (Yamane et al.,  2006; Rienth et al.,  2014). It is also noteworthy that both  VviMYBC2-L3 (VIT_14s0006g01620) and  VviMYB4b (VIT_04s0023g0371) transcripts were transiently enhanced in VHT and RHT berries, respectively. These two TFs were recently described as negative regulators of the phenylpropanoid pathway in grape (Cavallini et al.,  2015). While HT did not significantly impact the expression of genes known to act in the transport of flavonoids (reviewed by Zhao ( 2015), either directly ( VviAM1, VviAM3, VviABCC1, VviMATE1, VviMATE2) or indirectly  (VviGST1, VviGST4), the present work pointed out a significant deregulation of many putative ABC or MATE transporters and Glutathion S-transferase family members (Supplementary Tables  1,  11). It cannot be excluded that these proteins could be involved in the control of flavonoid transport in HT grape berries, as well. In addition to synthesis, stabilization and vacuolar sequestration, the anthocyanin content can also be modulated through degradation that may involve enzymes such as laccases, polyphenol oxidases, class III peroxidases, and β-glucosidases (Oren-Shamir,  2009). Our experiments showed a strong HT effect on the expression of laccase genes, potentially impacting the polymerization rate of various phenolic compounds. Out of the 93  laccase-annotated genes in the grapevine genome, 33 transcripts were deregulated by HT (Supplementary Table  12). Interestingly, the laccase  TT10 ( Transparent Testa 10, VIT_18s0075g00600) showed a maintained up-regulation by HT whatever the stage of development. In Arabidopsis,  TT10 was proposed to participate in the oxidative polymerization of phenolic compounds (Pourcel et al.,  2005). In a similar way, numerous genes encoding putative polyphenol oxidases (4), peroxidases (25) and β-glucosidases (16) were impacted by HT (Supplementary Table  12). In the present study, HT induced several  peroxidase genes including class III type (VIT_07s0130g00220, VIT_18s0001g06850) whereas others were repressed (VIT_18s0001g06840, VIT_18s0001g06890). Recently, Movahed et al. ( 2016) showed that the expression of 3 of the 5  peroxidase genes (VIT_14s0066g01850, VIT_06s0004g07770, VIT_07s0191g00050, VIT_11s0016g05320 and VIT_18s0072g00160) that were most strongly expressed in grape berry pericarp during ripening was influenced by temperature elevation. In agreement with these results, the present data also pinpoints the alteration of 4 of these genes (VIT_14s0066g01850, VIT_06s0004g07770, VIT_11s0016g05320 and VIT_18s0072g00160) in response to HT but with different kinetics and intensities. The secondary metabolism produces compounds of critical importance for berry quality and wine bitterness and astringency (Lund and Bohlmann,  2006; Ali et al.,  2010; Kuhn et al.,  2014; Robinson et al.,  2014). Three hundred twenty seven DEGs were related to “Secondary metabolism” and mainly belonged to the subcategories “isoprenoids,” “phenylpropanoid-lignin,” and “flavonoids” (Supplementary Table  7). Numerous genes affected by HT correspond to aroma and aroma-precursor related gene. Terpenes (predominantly eucalyptol, β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene) are usually present at low levels in Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, accumulating during the preveraison stage whereas benzene derivatives (2-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethanal) appear at late ripening (Kalua and Boss,  2009; Robinson et al.,  2014). The strong repression of genes encoding the  1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (VIT_05s0020g02130, VIT_09s0002g02050, VIT_11s0052g01730, VIT_11s0052g01780) suggests that volatile terpenoids biosynthesis may be decreased by HT (Supplementary Table  7). The 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase catalyzes the synthesis of isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP), which is the precursor of all terpenes. The condensation of IPP and its isomer DMAPP (dimethylallylpyrophosphate) forms geranyl diphosphate (GPP) that is used by terpene synthase (TPS) to produce monoterpenes and derivatives. The Pinot Noir reference genome contains 89 putative  TPS, among which half have been functionally characterized (Martin et al.,  2010). Among the 55 probe sets giving reliable results and representing transcripts of functional, partial and pseudo  TPS on the NimbleGen array (Cramer et al.,  2014), 16 transcripts showed differential abundance in HT berries (Supplementary Table  8). Thirteen  TPS were transiently repressed in GHT, VHT and or RHT clusters whereas only three  TPS were upregulated by HT ( VviTPS25, VviTPS26, VviTPS50). From the literature, most of these  TPS accumulate at the late stages of ripening in vineyard conditions (Cramer et al.,  2014). Finally, the transcript abundance of several terpene-related genes decreased in berries directly exposed to HT, in a similar way to that observed after exposing the whole vine to HT (Rienth et al.,  2014). These repressed genes encode geraniol 10-hydroxylase, (-)-germacrene D synthase and linalool synthase (Supplementary Table  8). Within the terpene family, carotenoids are a complex subgroup of isoprenoid pigments playing diverse roles in plants and providing nutritional value. Carotenoids also lead to C 13-norisoprenoids which contribute the characteristic aromas of  Vitis vinifera varieties (Mendes-Pinto,  2009). Among the 42 putative grape carotenoid metabolic genes (Young et al.,  2012), 21 transcripts showed differential abundance after HT in at least one of the 9 conditions, most of these being down-regulated (Supplementary Tables  7,  9). The abundance of 2 out of 3 phytoene synthase transcripts ( VviPSY, VIT_12s0028g00960, VIT_06s0004g00820), encoding the enzyme that catalyzes the first step committed to carotenoid biosynthesis, decreased upon HT. This down-regulation was also observed for downstream genes, namely phytoene dehydrogenase (VIT_04s0023g01790), carotene desaturase (VIT_14s0030g01740), carotenoid isomerase (VIT_08s0032g00800, VIT_12s0035g01080), lycopene cyclase (VIT_06s0080g00810, VIT_11s0016g01880) and carotene hydroxylase (VIT_04s0023g00080). The β-carotene hydroxylase 2 transcripts ( VviBCH2, VIT_16s0050g01090) were the only ones strongly accumulating under HT, and especially at the herbaceous stage. Methoxypyrazines (MPs) are strongly odorant volatile molecules with vegetable-like fragrances that participate to the distinct herbaceous/ bell pepper characters of some wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon (Dunlevy et al.,  2009; Darriet et al.,  2012; Kuhn et al.,  2014). Isobutyl methoxypyrazine (IBMP) is the predominant MP in Cabernet Sauvignon berries, accumulating throughout the pre-veraison stage before declining during the ripening phase. The last step of its biosynthesis was recently deciphered in grapevine, through the unambiguous identification of VviOMT3 (VIT_03s0038g03090), an  O-methyltransferase capable of converting the nonvolatile precursor 2-hydroxy-3-isobutylpyrazine (IBHP) into IBMP (Dunlevy et al.,  2013; Guillaumie et al.,  2013). By contrast to VviOMT4, VviOMT1 and VviOMT2 are active with a broad range of substrates but methylate IBHP  in vitro, although with poor affinity (Dunlevy et al.,  2010). Interestingly,  VviOMT3 transcripts were strongly repressed in green berries exposed to HT (Supplementary Table  7). A similar decrease was also observed in GHT berries for  VviOMT4 (VIT_03s0038g03080) and  VviOMT1 (VIT_12s0059g01790) transcripts, whereas  VviOMT2 (VIT_12s0059g01750) remained unaffected. Grape berry phenolics derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway participate to sensory properties, color and protection against environmental stress (Teixeira et al.,  2013). Our biochemical analysis highlighted the dramatic effects of local warming on the onset of veraison and on the final anthocyanin contents in berries at harvest (Table  1; Figure  2). MapMan analysis (Figure  6) shows the contrasted heat responses of DEGs related to the general phenylpropanoid and to the flavonoid biosynthesis pathways (Figure  6; Supplementary Figure  3; Supplementary Table  10). The transcriptomic responses of GHT samples clearly differed from both VHT and RHT samples. During the herbaceous stage, genes involved in the general phenylpropanoid pathway ( phenylalanine ammonia-lyase PAL, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase C4H, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase 4CL) were induced by HT regardless to the stress duration. By contrast, in VHT and RHT samples, the same genes were up-regulated after 1 day, but strongly repressed after 7 and 14 days of treatment. Many transcripts related to the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were repressed in GHT clusters. Two  chalcone synthase transcripts ( VviCHS1: VIT_14s0068g00920,  VviCHS2: VIT_14s0068g00930) encoding the first committed enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis (Parage et al.,  2012) were repressed after 7 days. A significant repression by HT was also observed for many flavonoid transcripts of the late biosynthetic pathway, such as  flavonoid 3′ -hydroxylase ( VviF3′ H, VIT_11s0016g01020, VIT_11s0016g01030, VIT_09s0002g01090 ), flavonoid 3′ 5′ -hydroxylase ( VviF3′ 5′ H),  dihydroflavonol 4-reductase ( VviDFR, VIT_16s0039g02350, VIT_18s0001g1280) and  leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase ( VviLDOX, VIT_08s0105g00380), whereas the  flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene ( VviF3H, VIT_16s0098g00860) was up-regulated (Figure  6; Supplementary Figure  3; Supplementary Table  10). The HT led to contrasted effects on the same set of genes in VHT and RHT clusters when compared with GHT.  VviF3H transcript was significantly less abundant whereas  VviCHI (chalcone isomerase, VIT_19s0014g00100) and  VviF3′ H genes were mostly up-regulated. Moreover, the repressive effect of HT on  VviF3′ 5′ H isoforms was not observed in VHT clusters and only transiently detected in RHT berries. In addition, the structural genes  VviANR ( anthocyanidin reductase, VIT_00s0361g00040), and  VviLAR ( leucoanthocyanidin reductase, VIT_01s0011g02960, VIT_17s0000g04150) involved in proanthocyanidins (PA) synthesis were significantly repressed under HT, according to the stage and/or duration of the stress. The anthocyanidin aglycones are further modified through glycosylation, methylation and acylation events, leading to the production of a wide variety of anthocyanin compounds. Glycosylation of flavonoids is catalyzed by enzymes from the large glycosyltranferase (GT) family, represented by 240 genes in the grape genome (Ono et al.,  2010). Glycosylation enhances the structural diversity and modifies the functional properties of these secondary metabolites. For instance, the expression of  UFGT [ UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase, renamed  VviGT1, VIT_16s0039g02230 (Parage et al.,  2012)], catalyzing the 3-O-specific glycosylation of anthocyanidin is critical for the coloration of grape skin (Boss et al.,  1996). Twenty-nine putative  VviGT were deregulated in berries exposed to HT (Figure  6; Supplementary Figure  3; Supplementary Table  10). Despite the loss of anthocyanins upon HT,  VviGT1 expression remained unaffected by HT. By contrast,  VviGT5 (VIT_11s0052g01600) and  VviGT6 (VIT_04s0023g01290) transcripts were strongly down-regulated in VHT and RHT clusters.  VviGT5 and  VviGT6 drive the glycosylation of flavonols, which increase their water solubility and their accumulation (Ono et al.,  2010). In grapevine, anthocyanins can also be modified through the action of  O-methyltransferases (AOMTs) and acyltransferases (ACTs) before being transported into the vacuole (Fournier-Level et al.,  2011; Rinaldo et al.,  2015). These modifications modulate berry color by reducing anthocyanin reactivity and increasing their stability and solubility in water. None of the two grape  AOMTs ( VviAOMT1; VIT_01s0010g03510,  VviAOMT2; VIT_01s0010g03490) that were previously described as effective anthocyanin 3′- and 3′,5′- O-methyltransferase (Hugueney et al.,  2009; Lücker et al.,  2010; Fournier-Level et al.,  2011) was significantly deregulated by HT (Supplementary Table  10). However, other putative  VviAOMTs transcripts (VIT_11s0016g02610, VIT_07s0031g00350, VIT_03s0063g00140, VIT_12s0028g03110), were transiently up- or down-regulated by HT depending on the ripening stage and stress duration. HT also modified the transcript amounts of various  ACTs (Supplementary Table  10). Indeed, 5 putative  ACTs were transiently repressed in GHT berries (VIT_12s0134g00590, VIT_12s0134g00630, VIT_12s0134g00600, VIT_12s0134g00650, VIT_12s0134g0660), whereas 3  ACTs (VIT_03s0017g00870, VIT_12s0134g00590, VIT_12s0134g00630) were up-regulated in both VHT and RHT berries. VIT_03s0017g00870 corresponds to Vvi3AT, an enzyme recently associated to the production of the common grape berry acylated anthocyanins (Rinaldo et al.,  2015). Stilbenes and lignins represent branching points in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Stilbenes are a small family of phytoalexins synthesized by plants in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Under normal growth conditions, berries stilbene content increases from veraison to ripening, with significant differences among  V. vinifera varieties (Gatto et al.,  2008). Forty-eight  stilbene synthases (STSs) genes catalyzing the biosynthesis of the stilbene backbone were found in grapevine genome. This represents an unusual example of functional redundancy (Parage et al.,  2012). Most of these (39 genes) were impacted in berries exposed to HT, displaying a quite similar and noticeable expression profile (Figure  6; Supplementary Figure  3; Supplementary Table  10). In GHT clusters, 18  STS transcripts accumulated after 1 and 7 d of treatment before being repressed at 14 d. In VHT and RHT fruits, the  STSs were transiently induced at 1 d and then strongly repressed over the 2 weeks of experiment. Lignification can also be induced as a response to various biotic and abiotic stresses, as shown in Citrus fruit after postharvest HT (Yun et al.,  2013). Conversely, the cell wall lignin content was reduced in the skin of grape mature berries experiencing a water stress (Vannozzi et al.,  2012; Fernandes et al.,  2015). In the present study, numerous transcripts (39) potentially involved in the lignin biosynthetic pathway differentially accumulated in HT berries (Figure  6; Supplementary Figure  3; Supplementary Table  10). Two  cinnamoyl-CoA reductase ( VviCCR) gene isoforms were affected in an opposite way by HT, VIT_14s0066g01150 being induced, and VIT_09s0070g00240 being repressed. In GHT and VHT clusters, the transcript levels of 16  cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase ( VviCAD) genes were mainly repressed whereas a few ones accumulated in RHT berries. The content of 3  ferulate 5-hydroxylase transcripts ( VviF5H) was reduced in both VHT and RHT berries. Finally, HT led to contrasted effects on  caffeic acid O-methyltransferase ( VviCOMT) and peroxidase transcripts (catalyzing the polymerization of monolignols into lignins).","Reproductive development of grapevine and berry composition are both strongly influenced by temperature. To date, the molecular mechanisms involved in grapevine berries response to high temperatures are poorly understood. Unlike recent data that addressed the effects on berry development of elevated temperatures applied at the whole plant level, the present work particularly focuses on the fruit responses triggered by direct exposure to heat treatment (HT). In the context of climate change, this work focusing on temperature effect at the microclimate level is of particular interest as it can help to better understand the consequences of leaf removal (a common viticultural practice) on berry development. HT (+ 8°C) was locally applied to clusters from Cabernet Sauvignon fruiting cuttings at three different developmental stages (middle green, veraison and middle ripening). Samples were collected 1, 7, and 14 days after treatment and used for metabolic and transcriptomic analyses. The results showed dramatic and specific biochemical and transcriptomic changes in heat exposed berries, depending on the developmental stage and the stress duration. When applied at the herbaceous stage, HT delayed the onset of veraison. Heating also strongly altered the berry concentration of amino acids and organic acids (e.g., phenylalanine, γ-aminobutyric acid and malate) and decreased the anthocyanin content at maturity. These physiological alterations could be partly explained by the deep remodeling of transcriptome in heated berries. More than 7000 genes were deregulated in at least one of the nine experimental conditions. The most affected processes belong to the categories ""stress responses,"" ""protein metabolism"" and ""secondary metabolism,"" highlighting the intrinsic capacity of grape berries to perceive HT and to build adaptive responses. Additionally, important changes in processes related to ""transport,"" ""hormone"" and ""cell wall"" might contribute to the postponing of veraison. Finally, opposite effects depending on heating duration were observed for genes encoding enzymes of the general phenylpropanoid pathway, suggesting that the HT-induced decrease in anthocyanin content may result from a combination of transcript abundance and product degradation.","['High temperature', 'Climate change', 'Grapevine', 'Microclimate', 'Microarrays', 'Berry Development', 'Metabolomics/metabolite Profiling']","['Supplementary Table', 'VIT', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Supplementary', 'Figure', 'Table', 'berries', 'genes', 'stage', 'RHT berries']","[middle-green, middle-ripening (Figure  1A, °C ±, °C ±, °C ±, ±, °C, ±, °C, ±, °C, VHT, °C ±, °C ±, °C ±, heat-treated, ARG, TYR, GABA, VHT, RHT, malvidin-3- O-glucoside, Dimitrovska, malvidin-3- O-(6′-acetyl)-glucoside, dephinidin, VHT, well-grouped, PC2, PC2, G7D, G1D, “Stress”, “Protein”, BIN 29, “, ”, ”, “Stress”, “abiotic/heat, “, ”, “heat stress”, HSP, Heat Shock Protein, USPs, VIT_17s0000g04260, VIT_04s0079g00610, VIT_08s0032g00590, “, ”, HSP, chaperones, Bokszczanin, Fragkostefanakis, FK506-binding protein, FKBP, VIT_19s0015g01100, VIT_07s0031g01150, VIT_08s0007g04340, VIT_13s0064g00580, VIT_01s0011g00930, VIT_00s0260g00070, peptidyl prolyl cis–trans isomerases, UPS, cell-cycle, UPS, ubiquitin, ubiquitin ligases, E3-like, VIT_09s0002g00220, VIT_12s0034g01390, VIT_05s0124g00230, VIT_06s0009g03670, VIT_08s0040g02600, VIT_19s0027g00320, E3-related, VIT_17s0000g09790, VIT_18s0041g01090, VIT_14s0068g02150, VIT_14s0066g02580, VIT_08s0056g01410, VIT_01s0011g02950, VIT_01s0026g00300, VIT_07s0005g01360, VIT_08s0007g04790, VIT_18s0001g02280, VIT_00s0160g00270, VIT_18s0001g06220, Cullin, ubiquitin ligases, CUL1, Skp1-Cullin-F-box, SCF, S-Phase kinase-associated, F-box, “, ”, VviMYB15, VviMYBF1, VviMYBA1, VviMYBA2, VviMYBA3, VviMYC1, VviMYCA1, VviMYBPA2, VIT_16s0039g02230, anthocyanidin glycosyltransferase, VviMybA1 transcription factor, TF, VIT_02s0033g00410, VIT_04s0023g0371, VHT, VviAM1, VviAM3, VviABCC1, VviMATE1, VviMATE2, VviGST1, VviGST4, MATE, Glutathion S-transferase, laccases, class III peroxidases, Oren-Shamir, laccase, VIT_18s0075g00600, peroxidases (25), class III type (VIT_07s0130g00220, VIT_18s0001g06850, VIT_18s0001g06890, VIT_14s0066g01850, VIT_06s0004g07770, VIT_07s0191g00050, VIT_11s0016g05320, VIT_18s0072g00160, VIT_14s0066g01850, VIT_06s0004g07770, VIT_11s0016g05320, VIT_18s0072g00160, “, ”, “, ”, “flavonoids”, aroma-precursor, 2-phenylethanal, Kalua, Boss, VIT_05s0020g02130, VIT_09s0002g02050, VIT_11s0052g01730, VIT_11s0052g01780, isopentenylpyrophosphate (, geranyl diphosphate, terpene synthase, VviTPS25, VviTPS26, VviTPS50, terpene-related, Carotenoids, Mendes-Pinto, VviPSY, VIT_12s0028g00960, VIT_06s0004g00820, VIT_04s0023g01790, VIT_14s0030g01740, carotenoid isomerase, VIT_08s0032g00800, VIT_12s0035g01080, VIT_11s0016g01880, carotene hydroxylase, VIT_04s0023g00080, VviBCH2, VIT_16s0050g01090, MPs, MP, VviOMT3 (, VviOMT4, VviOMT1, VviOMT2, VIT_03s0038g03080, VHT, C4H, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase 4CL, VviCHS1, VIT_14s0068g00920, VIT_14s0068g00930, VviF3′ H, VIT_11s0016g01020, VIT_11s0016g01030, VIT_09s0002g01090, 4-reductase, VviDFR, VIT_16s0039g02350, VIT_18s0001g1280, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, VIT_08s0105g00380, VviF3H, VIT_16s0098g00860, VHT, chalcone isomerase, VIT_19s0014g00100, anthocyanidin reductase, VIT_00s0361g00040, leucoanthocyanidin reductase, PA, GT, VIT_16s0039g02230, 3-O-specific, VIT_11s0052g01600, VIT_04s0023g01290, VHT, AOMTs, ACTs, VIT_01s0010g03510, anthocyanin 3′-, 3′,5′- O-methyltransferase, VIT_11s0016g02610,, VIT_07s0031g00350, VIT_03s0063g00140, VIT_12s0028g03110, VIT_12s0134g00590, VIT_12s0134g00630, VIT_12s0134g00600, VIT_12s0134g00650, VIT_12s0134g0660, VIT_03s0017g00870, VIT_12s0134g00590, VIT_12s0134g00630, VHT, VIT_03s0017g00870, Vvi3AT, VHT, VviCCR, VIT_14s0066g01150, VIT_09s0070g00240, alcohol dehydrogenase, 5-hydroxylase, VHT, O-methyltransferase, VviCOMT, peroxidase]","['(TPS)', 'TPS,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'VviTPS25,', 'VviTPS26,', 'VviTPS50).', 'TPS']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
43,43,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5301923\eupmc_result.json,PMC5301923,"Results (+)-Valencene is one of the characteristic volatile compounds in mature sweet orange Following earlier comparative studies ( Del Rio   et al., 1992 ;  González-Mas   et al., 2011 ;  Miyazaki   et al., 2011 ), the volatile compounds from six species of citrus fruit (mandarin, sweet orange, bitter orange, hybrids, pummelo, and citron) plus some new cultivars, (satsuma, ‘Newhall’ and ‘Fengjie’) were analysed. A total of 119 volatiles were identified from these citrus fruit, including 16 monoterpenes, 37 sesquiterpenes, 36 monoterpenoids, 10 sesquiterpenoids, 14 aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols, and six aliphatic esters ( Supplementary Table S4). Differences in volatile profiles were observed between the samples and fifteen characteristic volatile compounds from citrus species were successfully identified ( Fig. 1). Bitter orange was characterized by (+)-cycloisosativene and copaene. The volatile profile of citron fruit was complex:  cis-α-bisabolene, α-bisabolol, elixene, and β-bisabolene were exclusively found in citron but germacrene B, camphor, α-bergamotene, ( E)-geranial, and neral were also found to be characteristic for citron due to their relative higher concentrations as compared to the other species. Hybrid cultivars had a higher concentration of octylacetate while the pummelo species were characterized by (–)-α-panasinsen, farnesol and (+)-valencene. Sweet orange was characterized by the volatile compound (+)-valencene, which was much more abundant than in other citrus species ( Fig. 1). Screening for  CitAP2/ERF genes encoding proteins that activate the  Terpene Synthase 1 ( CsTPS1) promoter CsTPS1 has previously been characterized as the key gene encoding the enzyme terpene synthase that catalyzes (+)-valencene biosynthesis ( Sharon-Asa   et al., 2003 ). Therefore, we screened a large set of citrus transcription factors for activation or inhibition using the promoter of  CsTPS1 and a dual-luciferase assay ( Supplementary Fig. S1). Previously, an AP2 domain transcription factor ( CrORCA3) was reported as a regulator of terpenoid indole alkaloids ( van der Fits and Memelink, 2000). However, a linkage between a  CitAP2/ERF transcription factor and developmental accumulation of (+)-valencene in sweet orange fruit has not yet been demonstrated. Utilizing the promoter of  CsTPS1 and a dual-luciferase assay, the  CitAP2/ERF genes were screened to identify any that activated the  CsTPS1 promoter (–573~–1bp region). Among the  CitAP2/ERFs, one transcription factor,  CitAP2.10, showed a 2.1-fold trans-activation effect on the  CsTPS1 promoter ( Fig. 2). Association of  CitAP2.10 and  CsTPS1 expression and (+)-valencene accumulation during ‘Newhall’ fruit development The percentage content of five classes of aroma substances in citrus peel (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpenoids, monoterpenoids, others) was analysed and the relative change in content during fruit development was measured, using fruits harvested 120 DAFB as a reference point (set as 0). The most significant class of volatiles that accumulated was the sesquiterpenes ( Fig. 3), which had doubled by 180 DAFB and increased 12-fold by 210 DAFB, while the other four classes of aroma substances remained relatively less abundant ( Fig. 3). The main sesquiterpene that accumulated during fruit development was (+)-valencene, which increased by 9-fold and 93-fold at 180 DAFB and 210 DAFB, respectively, which was much higher than any of the other volatiles ( Fig. 3). The expressions of  CitAP2.10 and  CsTPS1 were analysed in parallel with volatile accumulation in sweet orange ‘Newhall’ ( Fig. 3). The results indicated that mRNAs for  CsTPS1 and  CitAP2.10 accumulated during maturation of sweet orange fruit (120 DAFB to 210 DAFB). Thus,  CitAP2.10 expression was positively correlated with  CsTPS1 activity and (+)-valencene accumulation. Modulation by ethylene and 1-MCP of (+)-valencene content and expression of  CitAP2.10 and  CsTPS1 The correlation between  CitAP2.10 and (+)-valencene was further tested by treatment with exogenous ethylene and 1-MCP (an ethylene antagonist). The results indicated that ethylene enhanced and 1-MCP inhibited (+)-valencene biosynthesis. In control fruit ( Fig. 4) (+)-valencene content increased by approximately 16.4% between 0 d and 4 d, whereas treatment with ethylene enhanced valencene content by 30.9% and treatment with 1-MCP reduced it to 6.89% over the same time period. Further analysis of gene expression indicated that  CsTPS1 mRNA showed the same accumulation pattern as (+)-valencene in fruit in response to both ethylene and 1-MCP treatment.  CitAP2.10 transcript abundance was significantly higher than in the control following ethylene treatment, and significantly lower in fruit treated with 1-MCP relative to the control ( Fig. 5). Trans-activation activity of  AtWRI1, a homolog of  CitAP2.10 on the  CsTPS1 promoter The results above indicate that  CitAP2.10 is positively associated with  CsTPS1 and also with the accumulation of the metabolite (+)-valencene. In order to verify the regulatory role of CitAP2/ERF, four Arabidopsis  AtWRI genes showing the closest similarity to  CitAP2.10 ( Supplementary Fig. S2) were isolated and their  trans-activation activities were tested using the dual-luciferase assays. The results ( Fig. 6) indicated that  AtWRI1 functioned in a similar way to  CitAP2.10 and was able to activate the  CsTPS1 promoter, while the other three  AtWRI genes had limited effects. Transient over-expression in ‘Newhall’ fruits Citrus is a perennial woody plant and stable transformation is difficult and time-consuming. Thus, a more rapid and efficient transient overexpression assay was chosen to examine the function of  CitAP2.10 in vivo.  CitAP2.10 and the empty vector were separately injected on opposite sides of the equatorial portion in the same fruit and the volatiles of these parts were analysed 5 d after infiltration. The results indicated that introducing  CitAP2.10 accelerated (+)-valencene synthesis ( Fig. 7). The (+)-valencene content of the peels infiltrated with  CitAP2.10 was 1.04 μg.g −1, representing a significant ( P<0.01) increase compared with peels infiltrated with empty vector (0.62 μg.g −1). Accumulation of endogenous  CsTPS1 mRNA occurred concomitantly with the increase in (+)-valencene ( Fig. 7).","Aroma is a vital characteristic that determines the quality and commercial value of citrus fruits, and characteristic volatiles have been analyzed in different citrus species. In sweet orange, Citrus sinensis, the sesquiterpene (+)-valencene is a key volatile compound in the fruit peel. Valencene synthesis is catalyzed by the terpene synthase CsTPS1, but the transcriptional mechanisms controlling its gene expression are unknown. Here, the AP2/ERF (APETALA2/ethylene response factor) transcription factor, CitAP2.10, is characterized as a regulator of (+)-valencene synthesis. The expression pattern of CitAP2.10 was positively correlated with (+)-valencene content and CsTPS1 expression. Dual-luciferase assays indicated that CitAP2.10 could trans-activate the CsTPS1 promoter. Ethylene enhanced expression of CitAP2.10 and this effect was abolished by the ethylene antagonist 1-methylcyclopropene. The role and function of CitAP2.10 in (+)-valencene biosynthesis were confirmed using the Arabidopsis homolog (AtWRI1), which also transiently activated the CsTPS1 promoter. Furthermore, transient over-expression of CitAP2.10 triggered (+)-valencene biosynthesis in sweet orange fruit. These results indicate that CitAP2.10 regulates (+)-valencene synthesis via induction of CsTPS1 mRNA accumulation.","['Ethylene', 'Transcriptional regulation', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Terpene synthase', 'TPS', 'sweet orange', 'Citap2/erf', 'Citrus Volatile', 'Valencene.']","['Del Rio', 'Fig.', 'Valencene', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'fruit', 'sweet orange', 'DAFB', 'volatile compounds', 'volatile', 'orange']","[Del Rio   , ‘Newhall’, ‘Fengjie’, α-bisabolol, α-bergamotene, octylacetate, (–)-α-panasinsen, CsTPS1, CsTPS1, Sharon-Asa   , dual-luciferase, AP2, CrORCA3, dual-luciferase, –573~–1bp, ‘Newhall’ fruit, CitAP2/ERF, dual-luciferase, ‘Newhall’ fruits]","['CsTPS1)', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1', 'CsTPS1']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
44,44,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5341033\eupmc_result.json,PMC5341033,"Results Transcriptome sequencing, assembly and annotation M. koenigii leaf cDNA library was prepared ( Table S2) and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. Obtained sequences/raw reads were deposited at NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) and Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) databases under the accession numbers SRR2970920 (Bioproject PRJNA304945 and Biosample SAMN04311782) and GFCO01000000, respectively.  De novo assembled contig lengths were distributed between <150 bp to >4000 bp ( Fig. S1a). The average transcript length and mean GC% of assembled contigs were 1163.43 bp and 40.79%, respectively ( Table S2 and  Fig. S2a). Contigs having <150 bp length were excluded from downstream analysis. Analysis of FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million Mapped reads) showed that 102857 contigs, representing 90.28% of total contigs, were having ≥1 FPKM ( Fig. S1b). Annotation of these contigs against public databases showed that 87417 (84.98%) contigs had at least one significant hit against NCBI database ( Table S3 and  Fig. S2b,c). The top BLASTX hit of each 87417 contigs against NCBI nr database revealed similarity with sequences of 650 organisms, of which only six were having occurrence frequency of >1000 transcripts. Among the six organisms,  Citrus clementia exhibited the highest occurrence frequency of 47.8% followed by  Citrus sinensis with 35.5% ( Fig. S1c). In total, 35812 (40.97%) annotated contigs representing 2636 “GO” terms were distributed among three main ontologies comprising “biological processes” with maximum number of 1265 terms followed by “molecular function” and “cellular components” with 1035 and 336 terms, respectively ( Fig. S3). Secondary metabolic pathways in curry leaf To gain insight into secondary metabolic pathways in  M. koenigii, all assembled contigs with ≥150 bp and ≥1 FPKM were mapped against KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database using KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS). A total of 25809 contigs were annotated and mapped to 325 canonical pathways including primary and secondary metabolic processes ( Fig. S4). Maximum percentage of contigs (39.02%) were found to be involved in metabolism, of which 9.9% contigs were putatively involved in 30 secondary metabolic pathways ( Fig. 2 and  Fig. S4). Majority of the contigs under “secondary metabolic pathways” were annotated to be involved in terpenoid biosynthesis (22.5%), including terpenoid backbone, mono-, sesqui-, di-, and tri-terpenoid biosynthetic pathways ( Fig. 2). Also, significant percentage of contigs belonged to phenylpropanoid (19.1%) and different alkaloid biosynthetic pathways (16.9%). Within terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, 60 contigs corresponding to 7 genes of MEP pathway and 43 contigs for 6 genes of MVA pathway were identified with a cumulative FPKM of 3413 and 509, respectively ( Table 1). The number of annotated contigs for downstream genes were 11 (IDI), 15 (GDS), 41 (GGDS) and 6 (FDS) with a cumulative FPKM of 833, 292, 1906 and 74, respectively. Mono- and sesqui- terpene synthases were represented by 36 and 70 contigs having FPKM of 2828 and 1928, respectively ( Table 1). Contigs related to anthranilate pathway leading to synthesis of quinolone included 112 contigs accounting for 5 genes with a combined FPKM of 4661 ( Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis of polyketide synthases from  M. koenigii The enzymes catalyzing quinolone formation belong to a group of multifunctional polyketide synthases (PKSs). PKSs characterized from plants belong to PKSIII superfamily, which is broadly classified into chalcone synthase-type (CHS-type) PKSIII and non-chalcone synthase type (non-CHS type) PKSIII ( Fig. 3). Search of curry leaf transcriptome to identify candidates that could be involved in carbazole alkaloid biosynthesis resulted in 44 contigs annotated as PKSs, which were having a combined FPKM of 2169. Out of these contigs, 4 full length PKS candidates (MkPKS1-4) were identified and used to build phylogenetic relationship with other characterized PKSs. While MkPKS1 was grouped with the CHS-type PKSIII suggesting it to be a chalcone synthase (CHS), MkPKS2 was grouped together with non-CHS type PKSIII that are involved in the formation of different alkaloids ( Fig. 3). MkPKS3 and MkPKS4 were grouped with multifunctional PKSs from bacteria and fungus that included MtPKS1 ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis PKS) involved in the synthesis of the immunomodulatory phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) 10 and PaPQSH ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone synthase) synthesizing quinolone as a signaling molecule 11 ( Fig. 3). The catalytic triad Cys-His-Asn present within the active sites of all characterized type-III PKSs from plants was also found in MkPKS1 and MkPKS2 ( Fig. S5). This catalytic triad catalyzes the repetitive condensations of C 2 units derived from CoA-linked starter molecules 12. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the role of PKSs in synthesizing one or multiple steps of carbazole alkaloids may be hypothesized. Genes for downstream carbazole alkaloid formation In addition to PKS candidates, transcriptome mining also yielded contigs for prenyltransferases (PTs), methyltransferases (MTs), and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450s), of which some may be involved in the formation of carbazole alkaloids 39. A total of 119 contigs were annotated as PTs in the transcriptome having different metabolic pathways assigned to them. However, 17 contigs with “prenyltransferase activity” were not assigned to any putative pathways indicating that they could be further studied for their involvement in prenylation of quinolone ( Table S4). In the case of MTs, out of 172 annotated contigs, 37 were annotated as either “MT”, “MT family protein” or “putative/uncharacterized MTs” ( Table S5), suggesting their possible role in alkaloid biosynthesis.  M. koenigii transcriptome also comprised 452 CYP450 candidates that were distributed among 38 CYP450 families ( Table S6). Among them, candidates belonging to various CYP450 gene families reported in the biosynthesis of terpenoids and alkaloids were also identified. They included CYP51, CYP71, CYP73, CYP76, CYP82, CYP88, CYP98, CYP706 and CYP716 families. Future functional studies on these candidates may shed light on their involvement in carbazole alkaloid biosynthesis. Phylogenetic analysis of  M. koenigii terpene synthases Search for TPS candidates using KEGG, NCBI and uniprot databases yielded 160 contigs annotated as putative TPSs ( Table 1). Further search for full length TPS candidates yielded 7 full length sequences designated as MkTPS1 to 7 encoding putative mono-, sesqui- and di- terpene synthases. Phylogenetic analysis of these TPS proteins showed that MkTPS1 (602 aa), MkTPS3 (607 aa) and MkTPS4 (608 aa) were clustered with TPS-b subfamily, which consisted mainly monoterpene synthases, whereas MkTPS2 (560 aa), MkTPS5 (562 aa) and MkTPS6 (562 aa) grouped with TPS-a subfamily representing sesquiterpene synthases ( Fig. 4). MkTPS7 (781 aa) formed a separate clade with TPS-e subfamily consisting of diterpene synthases. While MkTPS1 and MkTPS3 exhibited highest identities to  C. limon γ-terpinene synthase (Clγ-TPNS) (86% identity) and limonene synthase (ClLIMS) (71% identity), respectively, MkTPS4 was closest to  Populus alba isoprene synthase (PaIPS) (54% identity) ( Fig. 4). Within TPS-a subfamily, MkTPS2 showed highest identity (83%) to δ-elemene synthase from  C. jambhiri (RlemTPS4). MkTPS5 and MkTPS6 exhibited 63 and 88% identities to  C. sinensis valencene synthase (CsVLS) and  C. unshiu linalool synthase (CuLIS), respectively, whereas MkTPS7 exhibited 65% identity to  Malus domestica kaurene synthase (MdKS), a diterpene synthase. The arginine-tryptophan rich motif “R(R)X 8W” was found at the N-terminus of all TPSs except MkTPS7 of TPS-e subfamily that lacks this motif or may have a highly modified version of it 13 ( Fig. S6). This motif may play a role in the initiation of isomerization-cyclization reaction or stabilizes the protein through electrostatic interaction 13. All seven TPS proteins contained highly conserved arginine-rich motif “RXR” that is believed to assist in directing the diphosphate anion away from the reactive carbocation after ionization 14. Also, aspartate-rich metal ion binding motifs “DDXXD” and “(N/D)DXX(S/T)XXXE” were present at the C-terminus of all MkTPS protein sequences ( Fig. S6). Subcellular localization of MkTPS1 and MkTPS2 To understand volatile terpenoid biosynthesis in curry leaf, two candidates, MkTPS1 (GenBank accession no. KX171229) and MkTPS2 (GenBank accession no. KX171230) having highest FPKM of 127.27 and 45.83, respectively, were characterized.  In silico prediction analysis indicated that MkTPS1 and MkTPS2 to be plastidial and cytosolic, respectively, suggesting their putative mono- and sesqui- TPS activities ( Table S7). To confirm their subcellular localization, the open reading frames (ORFs) of  MkTPS1 and  MkTPS2 were fused upstream of, and in frame with, GFP and the fusion constructs were transformed into  Arabidopsis protoplasts. While the green fluorescence of MkTPS1 (100)-GFP fusion protein was localized in the plastids similar to the RbTP-GFP that served as positive control for plastid localization, MkTPS2 (100)-GFP exhibited cytosolic localization similar to the GFP control ( Fig. 5). This was in agreement with other known monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases and indicated that MkTPS1 and MkTPS2 could be involved in the formation of mono- and sesqui- terpenes emitted from  M. koenigii leaves. Functional characterization of MkTPS1 and MkTPS2 The coding regions of  MkTPS1 and  MkTPS2 were sub-cloned into pET32a expression vector, the encoded proteins were expressed in  Escherichia coli, and purified recombinant proteins were analyzed for TPS activities. For  MkTPS1cloning, the transit peptide was truncated at second methionine (Met-40) to avoid the formation of inclusion bodies, which is a typical feature of monoterpene synthases 1516. GC-MS analysis of the reaction products of MkTPS1 showed the formation of predominantly sabinene utilizing GPP as substrate whereas there was no product formed in the case of boiled enzyme ( Fig. 6). Further, chiral analyses of the reaction products showed that MkTPS1 catalyzed the formation of (−)-sabinene. Chiral GC analysis of leaf essential oil also confirmed the presence of (−)-sabinene as a major leaf volatile along with (−)-α-pinene and (+)-sabinene ( Fig. 6). Sabinene synthases (SSs) have been reported from five plant species including  Salvia officinalis (SoSS) 17,  C. jambhiri (RlemTPS2) 18,  Picea sitchensis (PsSS) 19,  Thuja plicata (TpSS) 20 and  Hedychium coronarium (HcTPS7) 21. Among the characterized SSs, MkTPS1 exhibited highest homology (80%) to RlemTPS2 ( Table S8). Amino acid alignment revealed that catalytic active site residue Asn-348 is present at the 7 th position upstream of metal ion binding “DDXXD” motif in MkTPS1 ( Fig. S6). In the case of MkTPS2, the product analysis showed the formation of α-farnesene with FPP as substrate. There was no product formation either in the boiled protein control ( Fig. 7) or with GPP as substrate, indicating that MkTPS2 is a sesquiterpene synthase with  bona fide α-farnesene synthase activity ( Fig. 7a). Next, the geometric isomeric nature of the identified α-farnesene was determined to be ( E,E)-α-farnesene by comparison with authentic farnesene mix ( Fig. 7b and  Fig. S10). Among the characterized plant α-farnesene synthases, MkTPS2 exhibited highest identity (54%) with  Vitis vinifera (E,E)-α-farnesene synthase (VvαFS1) 13 that catalyzed the formation of α-farnesene from FPP. Amino acid sequence alignment of MkTPS2 with characterized plant α-farnesene synthases showed the presence of all conserved characteristic motifs of terpene synthases ( Fig. S8). Involvement of MkTPS1 and MkTPS2 in the formation of curry leaf volatiles In order to determine the involvement of characterized MkTPSs in curry leaf volatiles formation, tissue specific gene expression and headspace volatile compounds of  M. koenigii leaves were analyzed. Before proceeding for quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) analysis to determine the expression of  MkTPS1 and  MkTPS2, two endogenous reference genes  actin and  F-BOX were selected and validated for transcript normalization. Among them,  actin exhibited highest stability in different tissues ( Fig. S9). Root was used as calibrator to determine the relative expression in other tissues. Results showed the highest expression of both  MkTPS1 and  MkTPS2 in green berry and mature leaf followed by flower and stem ( Fig. 8). While  MkTPS1 exhibited ~13.5 and ~11.5 fold expression in berry and leaf, the expression of  MkTPS2 was also higher in above tissues (~9 fold and 8 fold respectively). Among the two candidates,  MkTPS1 exhibited higher transcript abundance compared to  MkTPS2 in mature leaf and green berry ( Fig. 8). Highest expression of both  MkTPS1 and  MkTPS2 in leaf and berry (which are the parts of the plant known for their higher aroma levels), indicated their involvement in the formation of major terpene volatiles. Subsequent GC-MS analysis of  M. koenigii leaf volatiles revealed that, the emitted volatiles were dominated by monoterpenes with sabinene as the major compound ( Fig. S11). The highest mRNA expression of MkTPS1 that catalyzes the formation of (−)-sabinene and the presence of (−)-sabinene as the major volatile compound indicated the involvement of MkTPS1 in (−)-sabinene formation in curry tree leaf. However, ( E,E)-α-farnesene formed by MkTPS2 was not detected in the headspace of curry leaf ( Fig. S11).","Curry tree (Murraya koenigii L.) is a rich source of aromatic terpenes and pharmacologically important carbazole alkaloids. Here, M. koenigii leaf transcriptome was generated to gain insight into terpenoid and alkaloid biosynthesis. Analysis of de novo assembled contigs yielded genes for terpene backbone biosynthesis and terpene synthases. Also, gene families possibly involved in carbazole alkaloid formation were identified that included polyketide synthases, prenyltransferases, methyltransferases and cytochrome P450s. Further, two genes encoding terpene synthases (MkTPS1 and MkTPS2) with highest in silico transcript abundance were cloned and functionally characterized to determine their involvement in leaf volatile formation. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions revealed the plastidial and cytosolic localization of MkTPS1 and MkTPS2, respectively. Enzymatic characterization demonstrated the monoterpene synthase activity of recombinant MkTPS1, which produced primarily (-)-sabinene from geranyl diphosphate (GPP). Recombinant MkTPS2 exhibited sesquiterpene synthase activity and formed (E,E)-α-farnesene as the major product from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Moreover, mRNA expression and leaf volatile analyses indicated that MkTPS1 accounts for (-)-sabinene emitted by M. koenigii leaves. Overall, the transcriptome data generated in this study will be a great resource and the start point for characterizing genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of medicinally important carbazole alkaloids.",,"['Fig.', 'contigs', 'Table', 'formation', 'FPKM', 'synthases', 'synthase', 'leaf', 'analysis', 'annotated contigs']","[sequences/raw, SRA, SRR2970920, PRJNA304945, Biosample SAMN04311782, GFCO01000000, GC%, 102857, ≥1, 87417, 87417, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “cellular, ”, ≥150 , ≥1, 25809, “, ”, anthranilate, PKSIII, chalcone synthase-type, non-chalcone synthase type, MkPKS1-4, MkPKS1, chalcone synthase, CHS, MkPKS2, MkPKS3, MkPKS4, MtPKS1, PaPQSH, MkPKS1, MkPKS2 ( Fig. S5, MTs, cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP450s, PTs, “prenyltransferase, ”, MTs, “MT”, “MT, ”, “putative/uncharacterized MTs”, S5, CYP450, CYP450, CYP450, CYP51, CYP71, CYP76, CYP82, CYP88, CYP98, NCBI, TPSs ( Table 1, MkTPS1, MkTPS1 (602 aa, MkTPS3, MkTPS4 (608 aa, MkTPS2 (560 aa, MkTPS5 (562 aa, MkTPS6 (562 aa, TPS-e, MkTPS1, MkTPS3, Clγ-TPNS, MkTPS4, MkTPS2, MkTPS5, MkTPS6, CsVLS, MkTPS7, MdKS, “R(R)X, ”, MkTPS7, TPS-e, “RXR”, aspartate-rich metal ion binding motifs, “DDXXD”, “(N/D)DXX(S/T)XXXE”, MkTPS, MkTPS1, MkTPS2, MkTPS1, MkTPS2 (GenBank, MkTPS1, MkTPS2, GFP, MkTPS1 (100)-GFP, MkTPS2 (100)-GFP, GFP, MkTPS1, MkTPS2, MkTPS1, MkTPS2, pET32a, MkTPS1, MkTPS1, (−)-sabinene, TpSS, HcTPS7, MkTPS1, Asn-348, “DDXXD”, MkTPS1 ( Fig. S6, MkTPS2, MkTPS2, E)-α-farnesene, MkTPS2, E)-α-farnesene synthase, MkTPS2, MkTPS1, MkTPS2, ~13.5, green berry ( Fig. 8), MkTPS1, MkTPS1, MkTPS2]","['TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'MkTPS1', 'TPS', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS3', 'MkTPS4', 'TPS-b', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS5', 'MkTPS6', 'TPS-a', 'MkTPS7', 'TPS-e', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS3', 'MkTPS4', 'TPS-a', 'MkTPS2', '(RlemTPS4).', 'MkTPS5', 'MkTPS6', 'MkTPS7', 'TPSs', 'MkTPS7', 'TPS-e', 'TPS', 'MkTPS', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'TPS', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'TPS', 'MkTPS1cloning,', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS1', '(RlemTPS2)', '(HcTPS7)', 'MkTPS1', 'RlemTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2,', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPSs', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2,', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS1', 'MkTPS2']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']","['Citrus', 'Citrus']",terpene synthase
45,45,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5404360\eupmc_result.json,PMC5404360,"Results Volatile Terpenes of  S. miltiorrhiza Determined by GC-MS To analyze volatile terpenes in root, stem, leaf and inflorescence of  S. miltiorrhiza, fresh tissues were extracted with hexane and subjected to GC-MS. In total 20 terpenes were detected, including 8 monoterpenes, 11 sesquiterenes, and 1 diterpenes ( Figure   1). Of the four organs sampled, leaf contained the most diversified terpenes, with at least 18 compounds (8 monoterpenes, 10 sesquiterpenes) being identified by searching NIST database and retention indices ( Garms et al., 2010). By contrast, root had the lowest diversity, as GC-MS identified only 1 diterpene (ferruginol). Notably, ferruginol was not present at a detectable level in the aerial tissues examined. Isolation of Terpene Synthase Genes and Phylogenetic Analysis We searched  S. miltiorrhiza transcriptomes ( Yang et al., 2013) for TPSs, and amplified cDNAs by 5′- and 3′-RACE. Three cDNAs, namely  SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and  SmSTPS3 (GenBank accession numbers are  KY432512,  KY432513, and  KY432514), were isolated. They all encode proteins of 546 amino acids, which are highly identical to each other with the sequence identity of 97∼99%. Based on  S. miltiorrhiza genome sequence database ( Xu et al., 2016),  SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and  SmSTPS3 are duplicates arranged as a cluster in the genome. Searching of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein database showed that the three proteins share a high (62%) sequence identity to germacrene A synthase PatTpsCF2 (AY508728) from  Pogostemon cablin ( Deguerry et al., 2006), another Lamiaceae species which is particularly rich in sesquiterpenes ( Swamy and Sinniah, 2015). The three proteins of  S. miltiorrhiza contain the conserved domain DDxxD involved in the coordination of divalent ions and water molecules, and a modified NSE/DTE domain [ND]D[LIV]x[ST]x 3E at the  C-terminal involved in metal cofactor binding ( Whittington et al., 2002). In addition, a modified RRx 8W motif exists at the  N-terminal ( Figure   2), which is related to cyclic products formation ( Martin et al., 2010;  Liu et al., 2014). Terpene synthases of plants are divided into eight clades or subfamilies designated TPS-a through TPS-h, with a minimum identity of 40% in each clade, and most angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases are clustered into TPS-a subfamily ( Bohlmann et al., 1997;  Pazouki and Niinemets, 2016). SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and SmSTPS3 appear to be typical sesquiterpene synthases ( Figure   3). Enzyme Activities of the Three TPSs The three putative terpene synthases were then expressed in  E. coli cells ( Supplementary Figure   S1). The purified fusion proteins were incubated with farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrate, and Mg 2+ as a metal cofactor. SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2 and SmSTPS3 all converted FPP into a single and same 204 Da sesquiterpene product, corresponding to the chemical formula C 15H 24 ( Figure   4). Its MS spectrum is closely resemble those of valencene by searching NIST database, however, the retention time of this enzymatic product in GC-MS analysis is different to that of authentic (+)-valencene ( Supplementary Figure   S2), suggesting that it may share the same skeleton with valencene. Kinetic analysis with FPP in the presence of Mg 2+ showed that the  K  m values of SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2 and SmSTPS3 are 25.35, 24.20, and 10.44 μM, the estimated  k  cat are 2.09 s -1, 2.07 s -1 and 1.53 s -1, and the  k  cat/K  m values are 8.27 × 10 4 s -1⋅M -1, 8.56 × 10 4 s -1⋅M -1, and 1.48 × 10 5 s -1⋅M -1, respectively ( Table   1). Thus, these three synthases have similar catalytic activities, though SmSTPS1 and SmSTPS2 are slightly more efficient. These parameters are in the normal range of plant TPSs. Structural Analysis of the Enzymatic Product To elucidate the structure of the enzymatic product of three putative terpene synthases, we collected 4.5 mg this compound through large scale incubation experiment. The  1H and  13C NMR spectroscopic data of this sesquiterpene product ( Table   2) were analogous to those of (+)-eremophilene ( Schifrin et al., 2015), a stereoisomer of (+)-valencene, but their MS data are different; furthermore, in GC-MS separation of (+)-eremophilene and (+)-valencene mix, peak of (+)-valencene eluted before (+)-eremophilene ( Schifrin et al., 2015), whilst in our GC-MS analysis of (+)-valencene and this esequiterpene product mix, (+)-valencene eluted after this compound ( Supplementary Figure   S2). All of these suggest that these compounds are structurally similar. The detailed 2D NMR analysis allowed the construction of the structure of the sesquiterpene ( Supplementary Figures   S3–  S8). The  1H- 1H chemical shift correlation spectroscopy (COSY) correlation of an olefinic proton (δ H = 5.36) to H-2, and its heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) correlations to C-3, and C-9 indicate the presence of C1-C10 double bound. The other olefinic protons (δ H = 4.74,  J = 15 Hz) have HMBC cross peaks with C-7 and C-13 methyl group, locating the exo-isopropylidene group at C-7. The HMBC correlations of C-15 methyl group to C-3, C-4, and C-5; And C-14 methyl group to C-4, C-5, C-6, and C-10 attached these two methyls at C-4 and C-5, respectively. Thus, this compound has the same planar structure as valencene and eremophilene, which harbors three chiral centers of C-4, C-5, and C-7, indicating the existence of eight stereoisomers. The GC-MS and NMR data of this compound are different to those of (+)-valencene, (-)-4-epieremophilene ( Zhao et al., 2004) and (+)-eremophilene ( Schifrin et al., 2015), and thus their enantiomers (-)-valencene, (+)-4-epieremophilene, and (-)-eremophilene, only leaving (+)-5-eremophilene and (-)-5-eremophilene as two possible candidates. The rotating frame overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) data are in agreement with this assignment. The optical rotation analysis gave a [α] 24 value of -29.4 (ethanol). Taken together, this compound was unambiguously determined as (-)-5-epieremophilene, which is neither isolated nor synthesized previously. And these three sesquiterpene synthases are  S. miltiorrhiza (-)-5-epieremophilene synthases. Transient Expression of SmSTPS1 in  Nicotiana benthamiana Because (-)-5-epieremophilene was not detected from the extracts of  S. miltiorrhiza plants, we adopted a transient expression system to produce recombinant proteins in leaves of  N. benthamiana ( Peyret and Lomonossoff, 2013;  Sainsbury and Lomonossoff, 2014), in order to further assay the activity of  S. miltiorrhiza (-)-5-eiperemophilene synthase  in planta. After 4 d of the infiltration of  Agrobacterium harboring pEAQ-SmSTPS1, the leaves were gathered and extracted. We found that, compared to the extracts from control  N. benthamiana leaves, an extra peak with the retention time of approximately 16 min appeared when SmSTPS1 was expressed, which was determined to be (-)-5-epieremophilene by GC-MS ( Figure   5). Spatial Expression Patterns and Hormone Induction Relative expression levels  SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and  SmSTPS3 in root and aerial organs were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The three (-)-5-epieremophilene synthase genes were mainly expressed in leaf and inflorescence, and their transcript levels were low or undetectable in stem and root. In general,  SmSTPS1 was expressed at a higher level than the other two, and its transcripts were most abundant in leaf.  SmSTPS2 was weakly expressed and exhibited a clear expression only in leaf, whereas  SmSTPS3 was expressed predominantly in inflorescence ( Figures   6A–  C). Thus, the three  STPS genes were differentially regulated in  S. miltiorrhiza plants. Next, we examined responses of the three sesquiterpene synthase genes to phytohormone treatments. Since  SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and  SmSTPS3 were all expressed in  S. miltiorrhiza leaves, changes in their expression levels in leaves were analyzed after hormone treatments. We found that, although the three sesquiterpene synthases share high similarities in sequences and catalytic activities, they responded differentially to different phytohormones at transcription level.  SmSTPS1 was induced strongly by ethylene (ET) and moderately by MeJA, abscicic acid (ABA) and gibberellin A 3 (GA 3) ( Figure   6D),  SmSTPS2 responded not only to ET but also to ABA ( Figure   6E), and  SmSTPS3 was up-regulated slightly only by ABA ( Figure   6F)."," Salvia miltiorrhiza , a medicinal plant in China, has been used for thousands of years to treat coronary heart diseases. Although biosynthesis of tanshinones, a group of diterpenoids in  S. miltiorrhiza , has been extensively investigated, to date we know little about the formation of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in this medicinal plant. Here, we report the characterization of three sesquiterpene synthases, named SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and SmSTPS3, which catalyzed the formation of a new compound, (-)-5-epieremophilene. Additionally, the (-)-5-epieremophilene biosynthesis activity of SmSTPS1 was confirmed by transient expression in  Nicotiana benthamiana.  Despite the similar enzyme activities of SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, and SmSTPS3, the three (-)-5-epieremophilene synthase genes displayed different spatial expression patterns and responded differently to hormone treatments, implicating their specific roles in plant-environment interactions. Our results provide valuable data to understanding the biosynthesis and composition of terpenes in plant.","['Salvia miltiorrhiza', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Natural products', 'Terpene Synthases', '(-)-5-Epieremophilene']","['Volatile Terpenes', 'Figure', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Results Volatile', 'analyze volatile', 'Terpene synthases', 'sesquiterpene synthases', 'synthases', 'miltiorrhiza', 'valencene']","[5′-, 3′-RACE, SmSTPS2, SmSTPS2, AY508728, Deguerry, TPS-a, TPS-h, SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, SmSTPS3, farnesyl diphosphate, Mg 2, SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, SmSTPS3, Its, Mg 2, SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, SmSTPS3, μM, × 10 4, SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, Schifrin, Schifrin, δ, H-2, δ, Schifrin, (+)-5-eremophilene, (-)-5-eremophilene, α] 24, SmSTPS1, pEAQ-SmSTPS1, SmSTPS1, SmSTPS2, SmSTPS2, ABA, gibberellin A 3, GA 3, ABA, ABA]","['TPSs,', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2,', 'SmSTPS3', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2,', 'SmSTPS3', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-h,', 'TPS-a', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2,', 'SmSTPS3', 'TPSs', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2', 'SmSTPS3', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2', 'SmSTPS3', 'SmSTPS1', 'SmSTPS2', 'TPSs.', 'SmSTPS1', 'pEAQ-SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS1', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2,', 'SmSTPS3', 'SmSTPS1', 'SmSTPS2', 'SmSTPS3', 'STPS', 'SmSTPS1,', 'SmSTPS2,', 'SmSTPS3', 'SmSTPS1', 'SmSTPS2', 'SmSTPS3']",[],[],terpene synthase
47,47,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5432621\eupmc_result.json,PMC5432621,"Results and discussion Our study gives an example of the systems biology approach. Systems biology has been successfully applied to the discovery of regulatory and biosynthetic genes involved in the control of metabolite production (Yuan et al.,  2008; Liberman et al.,  2012), including examples from grape (Zamboni et al.,  2010; Fortes et al.,  2011; Agudelo-Romero et al.,  2013; Costantini et al.,  2015; Malacarne et al.,  2015; Suzuki et al.,  2015; Wen et al.,  2015; Savoi et al.,  2016). Metabolic analysis The present work provides a temporal profiling of aromatic compounds in the Moscato Bianco ripening berry. The protocol used for the chemical analysis was optimized for molecules belonging to the monoterpenoid class, however it allowed the simultaneous quantification of additional metabolites. In particular, the content of 21 monoterpenoids, 3 C 13-norisoprenoids, 5 phenylpropanoids/benzenoids and 3 C 6 aliphatic compounds was quantified from pre- veraison to over-ripening in 2005, 2006, and 2007. For several compounds a coherent accumulation trend was observed in the different years (Figure  1 and Supplementary Figure  S1A). The most significant correlation between seasons was observed for free linalool, nerol, α-terpineol, hydroxy-diendiol I + hydroxy-trienol, hydroxy-diendiol II, hexanol,  cis-3-hexen-1-ol, bound linalool, geraniol, nerol,  trans-furan linalool oxide and benzyl alcohol. Other metabolites appeared instead to be more sensitive to seasonal effects, like rainfall and temperature (Supplementary Figure  S1B). Hereafter, we will refer to 2006, which is the year assayed by microarray analysis. The most abundant metabolites were monoterpenes (hydroxy-diendiol I,  trans-geranic acid, linalool, geraniol and nerol), with concentrations higher than 600 μg/kg of berries (Figure  2 and Supplementary Figure  S2). The majority of monoterpenoids reached the highest amount in their glycosidically bound form. The main exceptions are represented by high oxidation state monoterpenes, like the two pyran linalool oxides, the two diendiols and rose oxide I. A clear prevalence of the free form was also observed for the C 6 aliphatic compounds, while the most abundant C 13-norisoprenoids and phenylpropanoids/benzenoids were glycosidically bound, in agreement with previous analyses (Sánchez Palomo et al.,  2006; D'Onofrio et al.,  2016). The quantity of many metabolites was significantly (at least 2-fold) altered during ripening. The compounds that changed most with respect to pre- veraison were linalool, geraniol, nerol, cis/ trans-8-hydroxy-linalool, hydroxy-diendiol I and II in both forms;  cis-furan linalool oxide,  trans-geranic acid, 7-hydroxy-geraniol, 7-hydroxy-citronellol, hydroxy-trienol in their free form;  trans-furan linalool oxide, 3-oxo-α-ionol, methyl salicylate, hexanol and  cis-3-hexen-1-ol in their bound form (Supplementary Figures  S3A,D, Supplementary Table  S4). The pattern of accumulation along berry development varied with the metabolite (Figure  2 and Supplementary Figure  S2). The concentration of the three compounds mainly contributing to Muscat aroma (linalool, geraniol, and nerol) was from low to moderate before  veraison (August 17 or stage E-L 34.5 in this work) and then increased during ripening. Free linalool reached its maximum on September 13 (technological maturity or stage E-L 38) and decreased during over-ripening. A similar behavior was observed in 2005 and 2007, even though the peak corresponded to slightly earlier stages (Figure  1E), proving that technological and aroma ripening might not occur at the same time (Vilanova et al.,  2012). Otherwise, free geraniol and nerol as well as the three bound forms showed a steady increase in their content during the sampling period. These results confirm previous findings (Günata et al.,  1985; Ebang-Oke et al.,  2003; Piazzolla et al.,  2016). Several additional patterns were observed. For example, the four linalool oxides could be detected at berry onset; their concentration reached a minimum between July 31 (stage E-L 31.5 in this work) and August 8 (stage E-L 33) and then increased in at least one of the two forms to peak on September 13 (stage E-L 38) in their free form. While the glycosidically bound forms of the two diendiols showed a similar pattern of accumulation, free hydroxy-diendiol I and hydroxy-trienol were highly concentrated before  veraison and decreased over the course of berry ripening, with a trend opposite to that of free hydroxy-diendiol II (Figures  1,  2). The high content of free hydroxy-diendiol I and hydroxy-trienol at berry onset, when free linalool was not yet produced, may indicate that their accumulation is regulated independently from that of their precursor. In the attempt of simplification, metabolite network analysis was performed on a total of 52 (26 free and 26 glycosidically bound) compounds. Metabolite grouping was obtained through hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis by using different metabolic data sets (Figure  3 and Supplementary Figures  S3,  S4). It is clearly evident that most monoterpenes are tightly correlated, which is indicative of their common metabolic origin and in agreement with previous findings (Ilc et al.,  2016b). In particular, when considering the absolute amount of free metabolites at 13 time points, three main clusters (AU > 95%) could be identified: (1)  cis-pyran linalool oxide (OxD),  trans-pyran linalool oxide (OxC),  trans-furan linalool oxide (OxA) and  cis-furan linalool oxide (OxB); (2) geraniol, nerol,  cis-8-hydroxy-linalool, benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol,  trans-geranic acid, citronellol, hydroxy-diendiol II,  trans-8-hydroxy-linalool, linalool, hexanol,  trans-3-hexen-1-ol, rose oxide I, rose oxide II and α-terpineol; (3) 4-terpineol and hydroxy-diendiol I + hydroxy-trienol. Additionally, within the second cluster a clear separation could be noticed between linalool on one side, geraniol and nerol on the other side (Figure  3A and Supplementary Figure  S4A). Oppositely, when considering the absolute amount of bound metabolites at 13 time points a single significant cluster was obtained, which included most of the analyzed compounds. It can be easily noticed that bound  cis-furan linalool oxide (OxB) has a peculiar behavior with respect to the other three linalool oxides (Figure  3B and Supplementary Figure  S4C). Microarray analysis Gene expression in Moscato Bianco berry skin at stages 2–5 was compared to stage 1 (pre- veraison). The two biological replicates assayed at each stage were confirmed to perfectly cluster together (Supplementary Figure  S5). The total number of differentially expressed probes (DEPs) in at least one comparison was 2,228, which corresponds to 15% of the chip probes (Supplementary Table  S5). As expected, the highest number of DEPs was observed in stage 5 vs. stage 1 (616 up-regulated and 1,132 down-regulated probes), whereas the lowest number was recorded in stage 2 vs. stage 1 (452 up-regulated and 506 down-regulated probes). A number of DEPs were common among comparisons (21, 19, and 28% of common DEPs among 2, 3, and 4 comparisons, respectively), whereas 32% of the DEPs were regulated at only one time point (data calculated from Supplementary Table  S5). Microarray validation via real-time PCR Specific primers were designed for 15 candidate genes and the change in their expression during berry development was analyzed in skin tissues by qRT-PCR to validate the microarray dataset (Figure  4). A strong relationship was found between the microarray and qPCR fold changes in the expression levels of the 15 genes (overall Pearson correlation coefficient  r = 0.84, with individual values ranging from 0.47 to 1), indicating the reliability of the whole transcriptome assay (Figure  4 and Supplementary Table  S3). Discovery of a link between transcriptome and metabolome in aroma development Potential links between transcripts and metabolites were established based on correlation and clustering approaches, though they do not necessarily imply causation. To this purpose, 4,450 probes with adjusted  p-values < 0.05 in all comparisons were considered, which included 1,906 out of the 2,228 DEPs with a cut-off of 2 fold-change and adjusted  p-value < 0.01. Integration of 2006 transcriptomic and metabolic data Pairwise correlation Significant (at the 0.05 or 0.01 level) Pearson correlations could be established only in the absence of Benjamini and Hochberg ( 1995) correction for multiple testing (Supplementary Table  S6). Consequently, this result was employed as criterium in the following candidate gene selection only in combination with additional supporting evidence. In the two-step strategy, positive pairwise expression correlations were discovered between 33 enzyme/transporter-coding genes correlated to metabolites and several regulatory genes within the microarray (Supplementary Table  S6). Correlation biclustering Correlation clustering between transcripts and metabolites resulted in the identification of 419 biclusters, that are groups of probes with a common behavior toward a group of metabolites. The clustered probes and metabolites were found to belong to a number of biclusters ranging from 1 to 10 and from 3 to 182, respectively (Supplementary Table  S7). Soft clustering Based on their expression profile across stages 1–5, the selected 4,450 probes and 52 metabolites were clustered into nine distinct Mfuzz groups (Figure  5 and Supplementary Table  S8). The distribution of probes per cluster within each MapMan functional category is shown in Supplementary Figure  S6 and the enriched categories within each cluster are indicated in Figure  5. Probes annotated with the Mapman functional category “Secondary metabolism” were not found to be significantly over-represented in any cluster. Free geraniol and nerol were attributed to a distinct cluster (cluster 6) with respect to free linalool (cluster 9), which reflects their Pvclust clustering (Figure  3A and Supplementary Figure  S4A). This separation is mainly due to the decrease of free linalool, but not geraniol and nerol, from technological maturity onwards (Figure  2). The highly similar accumulation trend of geraniol and nerol likely reflects a common chemical origin (nerol is a geometrical isomer of geraniol), while their relationship with linalool is less clear. Oppositely, the bound forms of the three monoterpenoids accumulated to a similar extent (cluster 4 in Figure  5), suggesting dynamic changes in the distribution and concentration of these compounds. Selection of candidate genes Several genes with a potential association to aroma-related compounds were identified from the probes correlated and clustered with those metabolites (Supplementary Table  S9, Supplementary Discussion in Supplementary  Data1 and Supplementary Table  S10). In particular, the contrasting behavior of free linalool and free geraniol/nerol encouraged us to search for genes specifically related to one or the other profile. The existence of linalool-specific metabolic pathways is even more intriguing if we consider that the prevalence of the linalool class on the geraniol one clearly distinguishes Moscato Bianco from other aromatic varieties (D'Onofrio et al.,  2016). From this broad gene set, the most promising candidates for monoterpene biosynthesis and its regulation were further selected (Table  2) based on supporting evidence from the literature, e.g., a relevant role for the homolog gene in other plant species, the co-localization with QTLs for monoterpene content (with a special attention to the linalool-specific QTLs on chromosomes 2 and 10, which were also detected in the Moscato Bianco genetic background by Battilana et al.,  2009), or the coexpression from public transcriptomic databases with genes involved in the metabolic pahways under study, which may indicate functional association according to the “guilt-by-association” principle. Hereafter, we discuss the most interesting findings from the present work; obvioulsy, we can't exclude that additional genes not included in this microarray platform may participate in monoterpene biosynthesis, as well as we can't know  a priori whether our findings will be reproduced in other Muscat varieties with a genetic background different from Moscato Bianco. Monoterpene skeleton biosynthesis Early terpenoid pathway genes. The role of  VvDXS isoforms in the development of aroma was previously investigated by real-time PCR on the same samples of Moscato Bianco analyzed here (Battilana,  2009), for which reason we did not repeat the analysis. In that study a significant up-regulation of  VvDXS1 was found to precede the peak of linalool, geraniol and nerol resulting in a positive correlation between  VvDXS1 expression profile and monoterpenoid accumulation. On the Grape AROS V1.0 array no probe could be found for  VvDXS1, whereas four probes corresponding to other  DXS isoforms (VIT_04s0008g04970 and VIT_00s0218g00110) were not differentially expressed during Moscato Bianco berry ripening. Several pieces of evidence from different plant species suggest that flux control in the MEP pathway does not converge on a single rate-limiting enzyme, such as DXS, but may involve other enzymes like DXR (1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase) and HDR (Vranová et al.,  2012; Hemmerlin,  2013). The lack of significant modulation and the decreasing trend during berry ripening observed for  VvDXR in our study (VIT_17s0000g08390 in Figure  4) do not support a regulatory role, in agreement with Rodríguez-Concepción et al. ( 2001) and Mendoza-Poudereux et al. ( 2014). Oppositely, the expression of  VvHDR (VIT_03s0063g02030 in Figure  4) is consistent with the  veraison-initiated accumulation of monoterpenes, as reported by Martin et al. ( 2012) and Wen et al. ( 2015) (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). Middle and late terpenoid pathway genes. In other plant species GPPS works as a heterodimeric complex; in particular, the levels of GPPS small subunit, but not GPPS large subunit, might play a key role in regulating monoterpene biosynthesis (Tholl et al.,  2004). Consistently, the AROS probes for GPPS large subunit genes (VIT_04s0023g01210 and VIT_18s0001g12000) were neither differentially expressed during Moscato Bianco berry ripening nor correlated to any monoterpene. No probe could be identified for the GPPS small subunit. Only three probes for terpene synthases are present on the Grape AROS V.1 array, which are not specific to any single gene prediction. One of them, showing the best match to the sesquiterpene synthases VIT_18s0001g04280 and VIT_18s0001g04530, was up-regulated during Moscato Bianco berry ripening (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). It is worth noting that the same genes were reported to correlate with linalool and α-terpineol (Savoi et al.,  2016). An interesting candidate gene for the biosynthesis of monoterpenes is a nudix hydrolase (VIT_10s0003g00880), whose expression increases along berry development (Figure  4). The corresponding probe belongs to cluster 4, which also harbors several monoterpenes (Table  2, Supplementary Tables  S8,  S9). Recently, a rose nudix hydrolase was reported to convert geranyl diphosphate to geranyl monophosphate, which in turn is hydrolyzed to geraniol by a phosphatase activity (Magnard et al.,  2015). This alternative and completely new terpene synthase-independent route for monoterpene production might play a role also in other plants, including grapevine. Secondary monoterpene transformations Extensive oxidative monoterpene metabolism has been reported in grapes and wine, with a percentage of linalool oxygenation ranging from 52 to 97% (Ilc et al.,  2016b). The main linalool oxidation products are  trans/ cis-8-hydroxy-linalool (by hydroxylation),  trans/ cis pyranoid/furanoid linalool oxides and polyhydroxylated derivatives or polyols like the odorless hydroxy-diendiol I and II (by epoxidation and hydrolysis). Similarly, C-8 oxygenated geraniol and citronellol derivatives can be formed through hydroxylation, whereas the oxidation to geranial and neral (altogether named citral) is supposedly mediated by alcohol dehydrogenases. Geranic acid is another oxidation product of geraniol. Rose oxide is generated from citronellol by allylic hydroxylation and acid-catalyzed cyclization. Citronellol in turn arises from the reduction of geraniol and nerol (hydrogenation). Members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 71 and 76 families were recently shown to metabolize linalool in  Arabidopsis thaliana (Ginglinger et al.,  2013; Höfer et al.,  2014; Boachon et al.,  2015). Interestingly, the CYP76 gene family has encountered an evident expansion in the grape genome (Nelson et al.,  2008). In order to identify genes potentially implicated in grape monoterpenoid metabolism we looked in VTCdb database ( http://vtcdb.adelaide.edu.au/Home.aspx) for CYP genes coexpressed with linalool synthases, as in Ginglinger et al. ( 2013). This information was then added to our transcriptomic and metabolic integrated datasets. On this base, we propose some genes (VIT_15s0048g01490, VIT_15s0048g01590, VIT_18s0001g13790, VIT_00s0389g00030, VIT_00s0389g00040) and eventually additional ones as potential CYPs involved in linalool metabolism (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). Most of these candidates have been never reported elsewhere, and thus deserve further attention. Conversely, VIT_15s0048g01490 and VIT_18s0001g13790 were recently characterized by Ilc et al. ( 2017) but their biochemical activity was only tested on a limited number of compounds. Our findings suggest instead that these genes might play a role in the production of a broader set of hydroxylated and/or epoxidized products as in other species (Meesters et al.,  2007; Ginglinger et al.,  2013; Höfer et al.,  2013,  2014; Boachon et al.,  2015) and, even if the need for further oxidoreductases can not be excluded (Ilc et al.,  2016a), they encourage to check this hypothesis by analyzing additional substrates (geraniol, nerol, citronellol) and products (e. g. pyranoid/furanoid linalool oxides, hydroxy-diendiols, geranic acid, rose oxides) in CYP enzymatic assays. We also propose an epoxide hydrolase (VIT_04s0023g02610) to be assessed for involvement in monoterpene oxidative metabolism (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). Based on their sequence similarity with terpenoid glucosyltransferases from different plant species and on their membership in biclusters harboring some glucosylated monoterpenes, we propose that VIT_03s0180g00200, VIT_03s0180g00320 (Table  2) and eventually other genes reported in Supplementary Table  S9 (VIT_03s0091g00040, VIT_03s0180g00280, VIT_05s0062g00430, VIT_05s0062g00520, VIT_05s0062g00630, VIT_05s0062g00640) might code for enzymes that glucosylate monoterpenes along with additional metabolites. Most of these genes have been investigated in previous works but they were not considered as candidates for monoterpene glucosylation in view of their decreasing expression during berry development (Khater et al.,  2011; Bönisch et al.,  2014a, b). However, they might be involved in the production of glucosylated monoterpenes with a similar trend, like the high oxidation state monoterpenoids sharing the same biclusters (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9), which were not quantified in those papers. This hypothesis is not contradicted by the lack of gene annotation referring to the “Monoterpenoid biosynthesis” pathway and of positive correlation between transcript and monoterpenyl glucoside accumulation, as the same holds for the biochemically characterized monoterpenol glucosyltransferase  VvGT7 (Table  2) and may be explained by the broad substrate tolerance and overlapping enzymatic activities of the large GT family. Monoterpenyl glucosides are only intermediates within the glycosylation pathway and post-transcriptional control is additionally involved (Bönisch et al.,  2014a). Monoterpene transport Terpene transport within the cell and into the apoplast is an almost unexplored field. It may engage multiple pathways, e.g., (1) insertion of the hydrophobic terpenes into vesicle membranes followed by transport and fusion to the plasma membrane, (2) carrier proteins (like GSTs, glutathione S-transferases, and ABC, ATP-binding cassette transporters) that conduct these molecules to the (plasma) membrane, and (3) direct diffusion between the endoplasmic reticulum and/or plastidial (stromule) membranes and the plasma membrane (Ting et al.,  2015). The fusion of vesicles with target membranes is mediated by a group of proteins called SNAREs (soluble NSF attachment protein receptors). Surprisingly and still without a clear underlying mechanism, both sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes were boosted when vesicle fusion was inhibited in  Nicotiana benthamiana (Ting et al.,  2015). Moreover, two  Arabidopsis linalool synthases were detected in vesicular structures associated with the plastids (Ginglinger et al.,  2013). Based on these findings, we included among our candidates a gene coding for a SNARE associated Golgi protein (VIT_02s0012g01630). Plant ABCG transporters play a role in the flux of secondary metabolites, particularly of terpenoid origin (Kang et al.,  2011). Interestingly, we found an ABCG gene (VIT_16s0039g00010) that shows a profile consistent with monoterpene accumulation and is coexpressed with several monoterpene synthases in VTCdb. We also selected a glutathione S-transferase (VIT_08s0040g03040) and two amino acid permeases (VIT_06s0009g01140 and VIT_08s0007g05210), which are coexpressed with monoterpene biosynthetic genes in VTCdb and positively correlated to several monoterpenes in the present study (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). Monoterpene biosynthesis transcriptional regulation Recent works (Cramer et al.,  2014; Wen et al.,  2015) suggested that a group of ERF6-type transcription factors clustered on chromosome 16 are involved in aroma accumulation, based on the correlation of their transcript abundance and the transcript abundance of several terpenoid pathway genes. For some of these regulatory genes, e.g., the orthologs of  CrORCA2, CrORCA3, and  AaERF1 (De Geyter et al.,  2012), no probe was found among the 4,450 probes used for our integrative analysis. Other  ERF genes reported in the mentioned papers (VIT_16s0013g00950, VIT_16s0013g00980, VIT_16s0013g00990, VIT_16s0013g01030, VIT_16s0013g01050, VIT_16s0013g01060, not listed in Supplementary Table  S9) belonged to clusters 1, 2, 7 and did not show any relevant positive correlation with monoterpenes. However, some of the AROS probes had only a partial match with these genes, as a consequence they might correspond instead to  ERF gene isoforms not involved in flavor determination. Conversely, the genes VIT_16s0100g00400 and VIT_18s0001g05250 showed an expression profile consistent with the accumulation of monoterpenes in Moscato Bianco ripening berry (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). We also observed an interesting behavior (Figure  4, Table  2, and Supplementary Table  S9) for TFs of the MYB (VIT_14s0066g01090) and NAC (VIT_19s0014g03300) families that promote mono- and sequiterpene production in other plant species (Reeves et al.,  2012; Nieuwenhuizen et al.,  2015). In particular, VIT_14s0066g01090 ( MYB24) has been proposed as a candidate transcriptional regulator of (mono)terpene biosynthesis also in grapevine (Matus,  2016; Savoi et al.,  2016), for which reason it deserves further attention. Finally, based on the negative effect of GBF1 (G-box binding factor 1) and ZCT (zinc-finger  Catharanthus transcription factor) proteins on the expression of the TIA (terpenoid indole alkaloid) biosynthetic genes  Str (strictosidine synthase) and  Tdc (tryptophan decarboxylase) (Sibéril et al.,  2001; Pauw et al.,  2004), we selected two genes (VIT_15s0046g01440 and VIT_18s0001g09230) negatively correlated with monoterpene accumulation during Moscato Bianco berry ripening (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). One of the signals dramatically impacting isoprenoid biosynthesis in higher plants is light, which activates the MEP pathway at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (Rodríguez-Concepción,  2006; Cordoba et al.,  2009; Vranová et al.,  2012; Mannen et al.,  2014). Sunlight exclusion limits the synthesis and accumulation of terpenes also in grape berries (linalool and the bound forms being the most responsive) by especially affecting  DXS and  TPS genes (Zhang et al.,  2014; Friedel et al.,  2016; Joubert et al.,  2016; Matus,  2016; Sasaki et al.,  2016). Our findings (Figure  4, Table  2, and Supplementary Table  S9) are consistent with a role, among others, for  HY5 ( LONG HYPOCOTYL5, VIT_04s0008g05210) in the regulation of light-induced terpenoid biosynthesis in grapes, in agreement with other evidences (Carbonell-Bejerano et al.,  2014a, b; Zhou et al.,  2015; Loyola et al.,  2016). The isoprenoid pathway has also been reported to be under the circadian clock control. In particular, the emission of volatile terpenoids follows a diurnal rhythm and genes encoding enzymes involved in IPP biosynthesis (especially those from the MEP pathway) and downstream pathways are coexpressed with circadian clock genes and show typical circadian expression profiles (Cordoba et al.,  2009; Vranová et al.,  2012; Pokhilko et al.,  2015). Some probes on the AROS array correspond to a gene of the circadian oscillator (VIT_15s0048g02410) and fall into clusters harboring several monoterpenes (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  S9). The expression profile of a number of additional transcription factors (including master regulators) and genes potentially involved in the post-transcriptional regulation (Hemmerlin,  2013) overlaps monoterpene accumulation during Moscato Bianco berry ripening, which supports a role in the control of monoterpene biosynthesis for VIT_01s0026g01970, VIT_02s0012g01040, VIT_02s0012g01240, VIT_02s0234g00100, VIT_03s0038g02500, VIT_04s0023g00130, VIT_04s0023g01250, VIT_04s0023g02950, VIT_06s0004g07550, VIT_07s0031g01320, VIT_07s0031g01930, VIT_07s0104g01050, VIT_08s0007g05880, VIT_09s0054g01780, VIT_10s0003g03190, VIT_12s0028g03860, VIT_00s0214g00090, VIT_00s0463g00020 (Figure  4, Table  2, Supplementary Table  S9). To our knowledge, these genes represent new regulatory candidates for the production of several (cluster 4) or specific metabolites, like linalool (cluster 9) and geraniol/nerol (cluster 6), as suggested by their co-localization with QTLs and their correlation with enzyme/transporter genes correlated to metabolites. Integration of transcriptomic and metabolic data over multiple seasons to verify a subset of candidate genes In order to confirm the above links between transcriptome and metabolome in aroma development, the 15 genes assessed by both microarray and real-time analyses were also tested for correlation with the metabolic profile over three seasons, which were considered as three biological replicates (Table  3 and Supplementary Figure  S1A). Significant correlations were found for all the genes except  VvDXR (confirming the results from 2006 data) and  VvHDR, which probably precedes monoterpene accumulation. Several compounds were affected, especially in their glycosidically bound form. Unsurprisingly, most of the metabolites with no correlation showed an inconsistent profile among seasons (e.g., free OxA and citronellol, bound α-terpineol) or a decreasing trend along berry ripening (e.g., free HO-diendiol I + HO-trienol and bound OxB). Though not ensuring a punctual conformity to the observations from a single year (Table  2), the findings from multiple seasons (Table  3) prove the general consistency of the outcomes of different techniques and years and argue for the reliability of the whole set of results based on the integration of 2006 transcriptomic and metabolic data.","Monoterpenes confer typical floral notes to ""Muscat"" grapevine varieties and, to a lesser extent, to other aromatic non-Muscat varieties. Previous studies have led to the identification and functional characterization of some enzymes and genes in this pathway. However, the underlying genetic map is still far from being complete. For example, the specific steps of monoterpene metabolism and its regulation are largely unknown. With the aim of identifying new candidates for the missing links, we applied an integrative functional genomics approach based on the targeted metabolic and genome-wide transcript profiling of Moscato Bianco ripening berries. In particular, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of free and bound terpenoid compounds was combined with microarray analysis in the skins of berries collected at five developmental stages from pre- veraison  to over-ripening. Differentially expressed metabolites and probes were identified in the pairwise comparison between time points by using the early stage as a reference. Metabolic and transcriptomic data were integrated through pairwise correlation and clustering approaches to discover genes linked with particular metabolites or groups of metabolites. These candidate transcripts were further checked for co-localization with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting aromatic compounds. Our findings provide insights into the biological networks of grapevine secondary metabolism, both at the catalytic and regulatory levels. Examples include a nudix hydrolase as component of a terpene synthase-independent pathway for monoterpene biosynthesis, genes potentially involved in monoterpene metabolism (cytochrome P450 hydroxylases, epoxide hydrolases, glucosyltransferases), transport (vesicle-associated proteins, ABCG transporters, glutathione S-transferases, amino acid permeases), and transcriptional control (transcription factors of the ERF, MYB and NAC families, intermediates in light- and circadian cycle-mediated regulation with supporting evidence from the literature and additional regulatory genes with a previously unreported association to monoterpene accumulation).","['Development', 'Grapevine', 'Integration', 'Candidate gene', 'Berry skin', 'Monoterpene', 'Muscat', 'Metabolic And Transcript Profiling']","['Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary Figure', 'VIT', 'Table', 'Supplementary', 'Figure', 'Moscato Bianco', 'linalool', 'genes', 'linalool oxide']","[Savoi, 3 C 6, α-terpineol, hydroxy-diendiol I, hydroxy-trienol, hydroxy-diendiol II, hydroxy-diendiol I, C 6, hydroxy-diendiol I, 7-hydroxy-geraniol, 7-hydroxy-citronellol, hydroxy-trienol, 3-oxo-α-ionol, D, Günata, Ebang-Oke, hydroxy-diendiol I, hydroxy-trienol, hydroxy-diendiol II, hydroxy-diendiol I, hydroxy-trienol, hydroxy-diendiol II, rose oxide I, rose oxide II, α-terpineol, hydroxy-diendiol I + hydroxy-trienol, Hochberg ( 1995), “, ”, geraniol/nerol, linalool-specific, linalool-specific, “, ”, obvioulsy, VIT_04s0008g04970, VIT_00s0218g00110, enzymes like DXR, Vranová, Hemmerlin, Rodríguez-Concepción, Mendoza-Poudereux et al., VIT_03s0063g02030, GPPS small, GPPS large subunit, AROS, GPPS large subunit genes, VIT_04s0023g01210, GPPS small, VIT_18s0001g04280, VIT_18s0001g04530, α-terpineol, VIT_10s0003g00880, hydrolase, cis-8-hydroxy-linalool, alcohol dehydrogenases, cytochrome P450, CYP, Boachon, CYP76, VTCdb database ( http://vtcdb.adelaide.edu.au/Home.aspx, CYP, Ginglinger et al.

50,50,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5562913\eupmc_result.json,PMC5562913,"Results Alphonso mango transcriptome Alphonso mango transcriptome was screened through eight tissue samples. To map differentially expressed transcripts a merged assembly was generated from the reads of all the tissues, which reflected upon overall Alphonso mango flower and fruit transcriptome. For each tissue read numbers were more than 100 million, which were assembled using k-mers 67, 75 and 83 separately and then merged for individual tissue. Average number of unique transcripts post assembly was 76,043 and with N50 and N80 values as 1,835 and 1,008 bp, respectively (Table  1). The minimum and maximum lengths of transcript from these assemblies were 100 and 17,342 bp, respectively (Table  1). Average number of transcripts was 11,925 upon filtering for redundancy and identifying candidate coding regions with maximum 90% identity and minimum 70% coverage (Table  2).  Unique transcripts from each assembled and filtered set were subjected to BLASTx against the non-redundant dataset from NCBI ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). From a total of 20,755 unique transcripts from the merged assembly, 92.22% transcripts were annotated while 954 transcripts (4.59%) encoded hypothetical proteins and 661 (3.17%) remained unidentified. BLASTx statistics revealed maximum hits from  Citrus sinensis and  C. clementina followed by  Theobroma cacao, Jatropha curcas, Vitis venifera and  Ricinus communis (Fig.  1a). Total 74,330 GO terms related to various biological processes (BP), molecular functions (MF) and cellular components (CC) were assigned to these 20,755 unique transcripts. Metabolic, cellular and single organism processes followed by biological regulation and localization were the most abundant terms under the BP category; binding and catalytic activity related terms under MF category; while, organelle, membrane and macromolecular complex terms under the CC category, respectively (Fig.  1b, Supplementary Figure  SF1).  Unique transcripts were assigned enzyme commission (EC) number to determine the involvement of these transcripts in various BPs. Total 4,611 ECs were assigned from oxidoreductase, transferase, hydrolase, ligase, lyase and isomerase classes; wherein, transferases were the most abundant followed by hydrolases in all the eight tissues (Fig.  1c). These assigned ECs represented 142 known pathways from the KEGG database ( http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) 31–  33, which are potentially functional in Alphonso mango fruit development and ripening. Most of these pathways were saturated with higher number of annotations from transcriptome data e.g. metabolism of starch, sucrose and various amino acids including methionine and biosynthesis pathway of ethylene, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids (Supplementary Figure  SF2). Transcriptome changes through flower to fruit and fruit development to ripening Variations in the transcriptome were studied using several parameters, such as differentially expressed transcripts, transcripts distinctive to a stage and gene ontology enrichment during flower to fruit transition and through process of fruit development and ripening. Differentially expressed transcripts Comparison between adjacent tissue stages was carried out to identify differentially expressed transcripts at each stage of fruit development and ripening (Table  3, Supplementary Table  ST1). Flower to fruit of 30DAP, 524 transcripts were down regulated while 181 were up-regulated. Among the down-regulated transcripts alpha-amylase and subtilisin inhibitor-like (contig_6593), carbonic anhydrase (contig_5377), chitinase (contig_4907) and maternal effect embryo arrest 59 (contig_4949) exhibited the highest fold change (>2-fold); while homeodomain-like protein (contig_12912 and 12913), cytochrome p450 - cyp72a219-like (contig_4083), heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein (contig_5948) and inositol-3-phosphate synthase (contig_9620) were highly up-regulated (>2-fold).  Transition from 30 DAP to 60 DAP resulted in up-regulation of 73 and down-regulation of seven transcripts. Important down-regulated transcripts were, n-acetyltransferase (contig_1261), 9- cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (contig_1680), protein reversion-to-ethylene sensitivity (contig_9164) and ethylene receptor 2 (contig_6147). While important up-regulated transcripts were nucleotide sugar transporter family protein (contig_6337), beta-xylosyltransferase (contig_4150), various cellulose synthase catalytic subunits and laccases. Comparison of 60 DAP fruit tissue with 90 DAP pulp and skin tissue, respectively revealed down-regulation of beta-xylosyltransferase, beta-d-xylosidase, cellulose synthase and galacturonosyl transferase; whereas spx and exs domain-containing protein was up-regulated in both 90 DAP pulp and skin. Up-regulation of homeobox protein sbh1, gdsl esterase lipase, caffeoyl shikimate esterase, hydroperoxide lyase, udp-rhamnose:rhamnosyl transferase and pectinesterase inhibitor was evinced from 90 DAP pulp tissue compared to that in 60 DAP fruit tissue. Evaluation of differentially expressed transcripts between pulp and skin of 90 DAP revealed very few transcripts down-regulated in skin with none of them showing change more than 2-fold, while 54 transcripts were up-regulated in 90 DAP skin tissue including the important ones as DNA mismatch repair protein msh5, acyl carrier protein, amino-acid permease, calcium-transporting ATPase, isoflavone reductase and various disease resistance proteins. During ripening of Alphonso pulp from 90 DAP to 5 DAH, 42 transcripts were up-regulated (>2-fold) including methyltransferase, amino-acid permease, chloroplastic 9- cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, beta-galactosidase and protein phosphatase mainly, whereas 52 transcripts were down-regulated, important ones being few disease resistance proteins, peroxidase, sucrose synthase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The highest level of differential expression was evinced through transition from 5 DAH to 10 DAH among all the ripening tissues wherein 418 transcripts were down and 191 were up-regulated. These stages are known for non-climacteric to climacteric transition during Alphonso fruit ripening based on metabolite analysis 17,   34. Prominently down regulated transcripts were phospholipase-A LCAT3, sugar phosphate exchanger, auxin-responsive protein IAA9, abscisate β-glucosyltransferase and membrane-associated kinase regulator with more than 3-fold change, while up-regulated transcripts were aspartic proteinase nepenthesin, UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, peroxidase, bidirectional sugar transporter sweet1-like, omega-6 fatty acid desaturase and squalene monooxygenase. During the transition from 10 DAH to 15 DAH stage, increased phosphate metabolism was evident. Total 30 transcripts were up-regulated mainly including phospholipase-D, inorganic pyrophosphatase, phosphate transporter, transcription factor glk2 and DNA translocase, whereas 12 transcripts were down-regulated and important ones were aspartic protease, plastocyanin-like domain protein, annexin d2-like and glucuronosyltransferase (>2-fold). Idiosyncratic transcripts for the stage Various transcripts unique to each of these stages (Fig.  2, Table  4, Supplementary Table  ST2) representing multiple stage specific processes were identified during this comparative analysis. A total of 388 transcripts were identified as unique to flower tissue, which mostly included various transcription and translation factors, late embryogenesis abundant proteins, stress-sensitive and dehydration-responsive element-binding protein-1b and various ribosomal proteins.  Similarly, distinct transcripts specific to fruit developing and ripening stages were identified, wherein 1,090 and 27 transcripts were idiosyncratic to the fruit developing and ripening stages, respectively (Supplementary Table  ST2). Various auxin and gibberellin induced and regulated proteins as well as several proteins responsible for various vacuole activities, multiple disease resistance proteins and various terpene synthases were distinct to the developing stages. Transcripts encoding for multiple transcription and translation factors during Alphonso fruit development were also detected. Interestingly multiple ethylene responsive transcription factors along with the protein reversion-to-ethylene sensitivity were uniquely revealed in the developing stages. Whereas, NIN-like protein, respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein d-like, rhamnogalacturonate lyase b-like, lectin receptor kinase, gag protein and methionine Υ-lyase were exclusive to the Alphonso ripening stages. Similarly, WRKY transcription factor 43, b3 domain-containing val3 and ap2 ERF domain-containing transcription factors were uniquely identified from the ripening stages. Several hypothetical and uncharacterized proteins were also found to be Alphonso ripening specific and their characterization might help to reveal the ripening process in Alphonso. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment Fisher’s exact test was performed to understand over- and down-represented GOs (p-value ≤ 0.001) during the transition, which gave an overall picture of the Alphonso mango development and ripening (Fig.  3). During the flower to 30 DAP fruit transition certain GOs were over-expressed such as post-embryonic developmental and anatomical structure morphogenesis process, response to abiotic stimulus and various plastid and thylakoid processes. At the same time, hydrolysis of  O-glycosyl compounds and UDP-glycosyltransferase activity along with the methyltransferase, sucrose metabolic and lipid biosynthetic activities coding GOs were down-represented. 30 DAP to 60 DAP transition described enriched GOs for starch and sucrose metabolic process, fatty acid, cellulose and vitamin biosynthetic processes, protein glycosylation, response to oxidative stress and heat along with HSP binding. During the same event cell differentiation, growth and cell death in addition to the anatomical structure morphogenesis, secondary metabolic process and response to biotic stimulus coding GOs were observed to be decreased. Comparison between 60 DAP fruit and 90 DAP pulp revealed over-represented GOs for cell differentiation and cell growth, response to biotic stimulus, secondary metabolic process, tropism and regulation of gene expression. While, starch and sucrose metabolic processes,  O-glycosyl hydrolase UDP-glucosyltransferase activities, fatty acid biosynthesis and catabolic processes along with the lipid transport, various amino acid and terpenoid biosynthesis and cell wall biogenesis were down-represented. 90 DAP pulp and skin tissues showed over-expression of various ion, ADP and sequence-specific DNA binding activities along with the response to hormone, chemical and organic substances in the skin tissue; whereas only cytoplasm and cytoplasmic part related GOs were found to be down-expressed in the skin compared to that in the pulp at 90 DAP.  Transition of 90 DAP pulp to 5 DAH pulp revealed only over-representation of GOs such as biosynthesis of RNA, aromatic compounds, and nucleobase containing compounds; binding of various ions; regulation of primary, cellular, nitrogenous compounds, RNA biosynthesis processes and gene expression and response to hormone, chemical and organic substance. Surprisingly, none of the GOs showed significant (P-value ≤ 0.001) enrichment during the transition from 5 DAH to 10 DAH and reflected as the stationary phase of Alphonso mango ripening. The 10 DAH (mid ripe stage) to 15 DAH (ripe stage) transition showed over-expression of many GOs such as binding of various ions; phospholipid, glycolipid, amino acid, co-enzyme and water soluble vitamin biosynthetic processes; methyltransferase, UDP-glycosyltransferase and  O-glycosyl hydrolase activities; starch, sucrose metabolic processes, gluconeogenesis and glycolytic process; protein phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, folding, protein modification and small protein conjugation along with the regulation and response to oxidative stress, oxidoreductase activity and redox homeostasis. While the GOs related to plastid and cytosol; post embryonic development; response to abiotic and endogenous stimulus; anatomical structure morphogenesis, plasma membrane, cell differentiation and communication were down-represented. Spatial changes in transcriptome at 90 DAP In case of Alphonso mango, 90 DAP stage is a mature raw stage of the fruit and is considered as the right stage of fruit harvest (0 DAH) for further artificial ripening of the fruit 35. Hence transcriptome analysis of skin and pulp were separately carried out at this stage. Overall 90 DAP skin was found to be metabolically more active compared to the 90 DAP pulp with respect to differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table  ST1), unique genes (Supplementary Table  ST2) and enriched GOs (Fig.  3). In the skin, 54 transcripts were up-regulated whereas only four were down-regulated compared to the pulp. Among the up-regulated transcripts (>2-fold), isoflavone reductase, transcription and translation regulatory proteins, hydrolases, methyltransferase etc. were more prominent; whereas four down-regulated transcripts were membrane and cytoplasm related GOs. Unique transcripts upon comparison between 90 DAP pulp and skin showed carotene and xanthophylls biosynthesis related contigs, beta-carotene hydroxylase (contig_5406) and anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase, flavor related various terpene synthases and ripening related contigs such as ethylene-responsive transcription factors, pectate lyase, pectin esterase and cellulase as unique to skin compared to the pulp. Interestingly, in comparison of 5DAH stage with 90 DAP pulp few of these transcripts such as isoflavone reductase (contig_5337) and beta-carotene hydroxylase (contig_5406) were observed to be idiosyncratic to 5 DAH stage as seen in 90 DAP skin stage. Similarly, transcripts encoding enzymes involved in pectin degradation (contigs_9578, 9579, 18096 and 3603) were found to be upregulated (>2-fold) in the comparison between 10DAH vs 90 DAP pulp and 15 DAH vs 90 DAP pulp. These finding suggest progression of ripening related molecular processes in the pulp of 5 DAH and onward stages which were initiated at 90 DAP skin and highlight initiation of Alphonso ripening process from skin and its probable progress towards fruit stone. Genes involved in the flavor biogenesis in Alphonso mango Quantitatively mono-terpenes are abundant in Alphonso followed by sesqui-terpenes 2,   35. The present data revealed six contigs encoding mono-terpene synthases ( limonene synthase1, limonene synthase2, beta ocimine synthase1, beta ocimine synthase2,  isoprene synthase1 and  isoprene synthase2), five contigs encoding sesquiterpene synthases ( germacreneD synthase1, germacreneD synthase2, nerolidol synthase1, nerolidol synthase2 and  alpha farnesene synthase) and three contigs coding for di-terpene synthases ( ent-kaurene synthase and  casbene synthase (E,E)-geranillinalool synthase). Phylogenetic analysis (Fig.  4) of these genes along with other plant terpene synthases (TPS) showed distribution of these genes in to the TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-e and TPS-f clades, respectively 36.  Furaneol and mesifuran are the two furanones from Alphonso mango and their synthesis by  enone oxidoreductase ( EO) and  O-methyltransferase ( OMTS), respectively have been described earlier 10,   11. Multiple contigs coding for  quinone oxidoreductase and  O-methyltransferases were detected in the present analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of these contigs with the characterized genes revealed another similar transcript variant for the  MiEO (Supplementary Figure  SF3), whereas none of the contigs showed similarity to the  MiOMTS (Supplementary Figure  SF4). Green grassy aroma of unripe fruits is due to the C6 volatiles formed during the lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) pathways. In the present study a single contig encoding the  hydroperoxide lyase and six contigs encoding  13-lipoxygenase were detected. Involvement of  9-lipoxygenase ( Mi9LOX) and epoxide  hydrolase 2 ( MiEH2) in the biogenesis of lactones from Alphonso mango was confirmed in our recent study 15. One more transcript encoding  9-lipoxygenase similar to that of the characterized  Mi9LOX (Supplementary Figure  SF5) and three contigs coding for  epoxide hydrolase 2 grouping with the  MiEH2 (Supplementary Figure  SF6) were additionally detected in the present study. Three more novel contigs coding for  epoxide hydrolase were also detected but neither grouped with the other  EH1or  EH2 from different plant species (Supplementary Figure  SF6). We further analyzed the differential expression of all these flavor related genes in terms of transcript abundance in flower and fruit developing and ripening stages (Supplementary Figure  SF7). Among these the contigs encoding various TPS were abundant in flower and during early developing stages. Interestingly, many contigs encoding EH (contigs 8280, 3904, 3901, 14123 and 8281), LOX (contigs 18105, 12748, 12747 and 12385) and EO (contigs 8026, 5618, 15594, 14137 and 13600) were found to be ripening specific and might be playing crucial role in generating unique aroma volatiles during Alphonso fruit ripening. Glycosidases and cell wall degrading enzymes from Alphonso mango Glycosidases are involved in a variety of functions such as hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates (storage and structural) to mono-saccharides, removal of sugars from various glycans including glycosidically bound aroma volatiles, which serve as storage pool for the aroma compounds. In the present study, many glycosidases acting on various sugars i.e. glucose, galactose, mannose, fructose, xylose, fucose and rhamnose, were detected. Among these, class glucosidase with the highest number of contigs (51 contigs) was observed to contain 28 and 21contigs coding for glucan β-glucosidase and general β-glucosidase, respectively. Two contigs coding for α-glucosidases were identified of which one coded for glucan α-glucosidase and the other for general α-glucosidase. Among these, at 30 DAP stage contig_7442 and contig_7857 were found to be down-regulated (>3-fold) compared to those in flower stage. Contig_16888 was down-regulated whereas contig_17138 was up-regulated at 10 DAH than those at 5 DAH. At 15 DAH contig_9072 was down-regulated (1.5-fold) compared to that at 10 DAH. Among the galactosidase class, nine contigs encoding α-galactosidase and 21 contigs encoding β-galactosidase were detected. Two of these were down-regulated (contig_1095 and contig_1096) at 30 DAP compared to those in flower. Contig_3844 was down regulated in 90 DAP pulp compared to 60 DAP. Transition from 90 DAP to 5 DAH reflected in to up-regulation of contig_3844 (2.72-fold) whereas, contig_1525 coding for α-galactosidase was down-regulated in 10 DAH compared to that at 5 DAH. In the mannosidase class, five α-mannosidase and eight endo-β-mannosidase coding contigs were identified out of which two encoding for endo-beta-mannosidase (contig_15554 and contig_15558) were down-regulated at 10 DAH compared to 5 DAH, rest didn’t show differential regulation. Among two α-xylosidase and five β-xylosidase from Alphonso mango only contig_1633 showed differential regulation which was up-regulated at 60 DAP compared to 30 DAP and was further down-regulated in both the 90 DAP tissues. Two transcripts coding for the acid beta-fructofuranosidase (contig_12501 and contig_12502) were detected but did not show any differential regulation in various tissues analyzed. Also, seven contigs coding for the alpha-l-fucosidase were identified from Alphonso mango but did not show differential regulation. Degradation of plant cell wall components, namely cellulose, hemi-cellulose and pectin by cellulases and glucanases in ripening fruits is responsible for the fruit softness. Cellulases encoding five contigs were identified among which one coded for acidic cellulase and found to be abundant during flower and early fruit developing stages. Total 18 contigs encoding glucanase were detected of which contig_4148 was up-regulated in flower compared to 30 DAP, whereas, four transcripts (contig_9268, contig_19283, contig_9267 and contig_17145) were down-regulated (>2-fold) at 10 DAH compared to 5 DAH stage. Pectin is another component of fruit cell wall and is degraded by a set of enzymes  viz. pectate lyase (PL), pectin esterase (PE), polygalacturonase (PG) and rhamnogalacturonate lyase. In the present study 18 PL, 24 PG and 10 PE coding transcripts were detected. However, only few were differentially expressed, for example, only PL contig_7696 was down-regulated in 30 DAP fruit compared to flower and PL contig_9578 was up-regulated in 10 DAH fruit than 5 DAH fruit. PG non-catalytic subunit jp650 coding contig_9895 was down-regulated in 5 DAH pulp than in 90 DAP pulp, whereas PG contig_3471 was down regulated and PG contig_1614 was up-regulated in 10 DAH compared to 5 DAH stage. Likewise, PE contig_7997 was down-regulated and contig_9162 was up-regulated at 30 DAP stage compared to flower. Similarly, eight transcripts encoding rhamnogalacturonate lyase were detected of which two (contig_7745 and contig_7746) were distinct to the ripening stages (Supplementary Table  ST2). Transcriptome analysis identified novel enzyme inhibitors from Alphonso mango We identified various classes of enzyme inhibitors (Supplementary Table  ST3) such as α- amylase inhibitor (2 contigs), inhibitor of proliferation pds5, apoptosis inhibitor (2 contigs), bax inhibitor (4 contigs), lipid transfer protein inhibitor (6 contigs), various kinase inhibitors (16 contigs), cysteine proteinases inhibitor (4 contigs), inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (3 contigs), serine protease inhibitor, kunitz family trypsin and protease inhibitor, guanosine nucleotide diphosphate dissociation inhibitor, nf-kappa-b inhibitor (2 contigs), pectinesterase inhibitor (12 contigs), polygalacturonase inhibitor, proteasome inhibitor, protein transport inhibitor (4 contigs), protein phosphatase inhibitor and rho gdp-dissociation protein inhibitor (4 contigs). Along with these, contigs coding for protein reversion-to-ethylene sensitivity (3 contigs), cell wall and vascular inhibitor of beta-fructosidase (2 contigs) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor were also identified from Alphonso transcriptome. These inhibitors showed differential regulation during fruit development and ripening (Supplementary Figure  SF8). Most of the inhibitors were found to be expressing throughout all the stages except for the group 4 (coding for bax inhibitor), which were abundant only during fruit ripening stages of Alphonso mango and probably played important role in ripening physiology of Alphonso mango. Transcriptome validation through qRT PCR Results of the transcriptomic analysis were validated by qRT PCR of 38 representative genes from various metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate metabolism (cellulose synthase: CS, chitinase: CTN, and pectate lyase: PL), fatty acid metabolism (omega 3 fatty acyl desaturase: O3FAD, omega 6 fatty acyl desaturase: O6FAD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate acyl transferase: G3PAT, alcohol dehydrogenase: ADH and long chain fatty acyl CoA ligase: LCFACL), terpene metabolism (mono-terpene synthases: MTPS, sesqui-terpene synthases: STPS and di-terpene synthases: DTPS) and proteins such as ethylene responsive factors: ERF and disease resistance proteins: DRP. Various transcript variants of these genes were selected wherever available to confirm the accuracy of assembly. qRT PCR analysis revealed similar differential expression pattern for almost all the transcripts through all the eight stages with correlation coefficient  R ranging between 0.8 and 0.99. Few transcripts showed variation in the fold change of RNAseq and qRT PCR data at few stages but still had good correlation ( R ≥ 0.7) (Figs  5– 9 and Supplementary Table  ST5). Transcript variants confirmed the accurate assembly and showed differential expression of these variants from each other through various tissues analyzed (Figs  5– 9). ","Alphonso is known as the ""King of mangos"" due to its unique flavor, attractive color, low fiber pulp and long shelf life. We analyzed the transcriptome of Alphonso mango through Illumina sequencing from seven stages of fruit development and ripening as well as flower. Total transcriptome data from these stages ranged between 65 and 143 Mb. Importantly, 20,755 unique transcripts were annotated and 4,611 were assigned enzyme commission numbers, which encoded 142 biological pathways. These included ethylene and flavor related secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, as well as those involved in metabolism of starch, sucrose, amino acids and fatty acids. Differential regulation (p-value ≤ 0.05) of thousands of transcripts was evident in various stages of fruit development and ripening. Novel transcripts for biosynthesis of mono-terpenes, sesqui-terpenes, di-terpenes, lactones and furanones involved in flavor formation were identified. Large number of transcripts encoding cell wall modifying enzymes was found to be steady in their expression, while few were differentially regulated through these stages. Novel 79 transcripts of inhibitors of cell wall modifying enzymes were simultaneously detected throughout Alphonso fruit development and ripening, suggesting controlled activity of these enzymes involved in fruit softening.",,"['DAP', 'DAP pulp', 'Alphonso mango', 'DAH', 'contig', 'transcripts', 'Supplementary Table', 'contigs', 'Alphonso', 'Supplementary Figure']","[76,043, 74,330, macromolecular complex, BPs, oxidoreductase, hydrolase, isomerase, hydrolases, 30DAP, alpha-amylase, subtilisin inhibitor-like, contig_6593, carbonic anhydrase, contig_5377, chitinase (, contig_4907, contig_4949, homeodomain-like protein, cytochrome p450, contig_4083, heat shock cognate 70 , contig_5948, inositol-3-phosphate synthase, n-acetyltransferase, contig_1261, cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, protein reversion-to-ethylene, contig_9164, ethylene receptor 2, contig_6147, contig_6337, beta-xylosyltransferase (, contig_4150, cellulose synthase, subunits, laccases, beta-xylosyltransferase, beta-d-xylosidase, cellulose synthase, galacturonosyl transferase, homeobox, sbh1, gdsl esterase lipase, udp-rhamnose:rhamnosyl transferase, pectinesterase inhibitor, calcium-transporting ATPase, isoflavone reductase, methyltransferase, beta-galactosidase, protein phosphatase, peroxidase, sucrose synthase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Prominently, phospholipase-A LCAT3, IAA9, abscisate β-glucosyltransferase, membrane-associated kinase, aspartic proteinase nepenthesin, UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase, peroxidase, sugar transporter sweet1-like, phospholipase-D, phosphate transporter, glk2, annexin d2-like, glucuronosyltransferase (, protein-1b, ribosomal, auxin, NIN-like, rhamnogalacturonate lyase, lectin receptor kinase, gag, methionine Υ-lyase, b3 domain-containing val3, ap2 ERF domain-containing, down-represented GOs, UDP-glycosyltransferase, HSP, GOs, glycolipid, UDP-glycosyltransferase, hydrolase, oxidoreductase, isoflavone reductase, hydrolases, methyltransferase, beta-carotene hydroxylase, contig_5406, anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase, pectate lyase, pectin esterase, cellulase, isoflavone reductase, contig_5337, beta-carotene hydroxylase, contig_5406, pectin, contigs_9578, 10DAH, sesqui-terpenes 2, synthase1, synthase2, beta ocimine synthase1, beta ocimine synthase2, synthase1, synthase2, germacreneD synthase1, germacreneD synthase2, alpha farnesene synthase, ent-kaurene synthase, E)-geranillinalool synthase, TPS-b, TPS-e, oxidoreductase (, oxidoreductase, lipoxygenase, hydroperoxide lyase, Mi9LOX, epoxide  hydrolase 2, MiEH2, epoxide hydrolase 2, hydrolase, EH, LOX, class glucosidase, 21contigs, glucan β-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, α-glucosidases, glucan α-glucosidase, α-glucosidase, contig_7442, contig_7857, contig_17138, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, contig_1095, contig_1096, Contig_3844, contig_3844, α-galactosidase, mannosidase, α-mannosidase, endo-β-mannosidase, endo-beta-mannosidase (, contig_15554, contig_15558, n’t, α-xylosidase, β-xylosidase, contig_1633, beta-fructofuranosidase, contig_12501, contig_12502, alpha-l-fucosidase, pectin, cellulases, glucanases, cellulase, glucanase, contig_4148, contig_9268, contig_19283, contig_9267, contig_17145, Pectin, PL, pectin esterase, PE, polygalacturonase (, rhamnogalacturonate lyase, PL, PE, PL contig_7696, PL contig_9578, contig_9895, PG contig_3471, PG contig_1614, PE contig_7997, contig_9162, rhamnogalacturonate lyase, contig_7745, contig_7746, α- amylase, bax, cysteine proteinases, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (3, serine protease, protease inhibitor, nf-kappa-b inhibitor (2, pectinesterase inhibitor (12 contigs, polygalacturonase, rho gdp-dissociation, vascular inhibitor of, beta-fructosidase (2, bax, chitinase, pectate lyase, PL, O3FAD, O6FAD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate acyl, alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH, RNAseq]","['(TPS)', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-e', 'TPS-f', 'TPS', 'MTPS,', 'STPS', 'DTPS)']",['C.'],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
51,51,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5568196\eupmc_result.json,PMC5568196,"Results Volatile profiling and variation between ‘fortune’ and ‘Murcott’ More than 300 peaks were separated by GC in juice samples from ‘Fortune’, ‘Murcott’ and their hybrids over four harvests (H1–12, H2–12, H1–13 and H2–13). Of those, 148 volatiles were detected including one acid, 12 alcohols, 20 aldehydes, 14 esters, one furan, three aromatic hydrocarbons, 16 ketones, one phenol, 27 sesquiterpenes, 15 monoterpenes, and 38 unknown volatiles (Table  1, Additional files  1 and  2). Compared to ‘Murcott’, ‘Fortune’ produced a similar number of volatiles, but with lower concentration. The total relative content of volatiles in ‘Murcott’ was about 13 times as much as in ‘Fortune’ for both harvests in 2013, which was partly due to limonene. The ‘Murcott’ fruits contained about 20 times the amount limonene of ‘Fortune’. The most abundant volatiles identified in ‘Fortune’ included limonene (77.77%), valencene (2.63%), ethyl acetate (2.01%) and myrcene (1.53%); while ‘Murcott’ contained limonene (79.14%), hexanal (6.59%), myrcene (1.91%), heptanal (1.25%), and geranyl acetone (1.25%) in H1–13.  The average number of volatiles detected in F 1 hybrids was 63.7, and ranged from 28 to 111 (Table  1). The average relative content of volatiles detected in F 1 hybrids was 14.4, and ranged from 0.24 to 133.24. Three volatiles were present in all F 1 hybrids, including linalool, myrcene and limonene; and another 18 volatiles were detected in 90–99% of all F 1 hybrids (Additional file  1). On the other hand, 19 compounds were detected in less than 10% of all hybrids. Among the 148 detected volatiles, 64 volatile compounds were detected specifically in F 1 hybrids but were not present in either of the parents. The total content of volatiles and number of volatiles in F 1 progeny showed continual variation, although some of their distributions were generally skewed and/or significantly deviated from normality ( p = 0.05) based on the Shapiro-Wilk test [ 26] (Fig.  1, Additional file  3). For instance, the total content displayed a distribution significantly deviated from normality in H1–12, so did the number of volatiles in H1–12, H1–13 and H2–13. Transgressive segregations were found in both directions where decanal, perillaldehyde, ethyl acetate, octyl acetate, decyl acetate, p-menth-1-en-9-ol acetate, α-pinene, myrcene, limonene and terpinolene exhibited the most significant transgressions (Table  1, Additional file  2).  A total of 20 volatile compounds were reported with odor activities in the F 1 individual FoMu-081 [ 14]. In the present study (Table  1, Additional file  2), (E)-2-decenal described as minty/piney, 1-octen-3-one described as mushroom and β-ionone described as floral, were found in ‘Murcott’, but not in ‘Fortune’ in 2013. Four aroma active compounds were detected only in F 1 hybrids in 2013, including (E)-carveol described as minty, dodecanal described as green, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate described as fruity and nootkatone described as spicy/woody. Two aroma active compounds were present in all F 1 hybrids in 2013, including linalool described as floral and myrcene described as metallic. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to analyze the differences in volatile composition in ‘Fortune’ x ‘Murcott’ within each harvest, and the results from H1-13 were shown here as a representative (Fig.  2). The first and second principal components (PC1 and PC2) represented 35.8 and 7.37% of the total variance. The parents were relatively well separated from each other, but not differentiated from most of their F 1 progeny, indicating that ‘Fortune’ and ‘Murcott’ exhibited relatively different volatile compositions. F 1 individuals formed a distribution trend from top left, with more of the compounds like hexanal (44, volatile code as shown in Additional file  2), methacrolein (15), pentanal (30), 3-heptanone (61), 1-penten-3-one (28), heptanal (65), and to the bottom right, with more of the volatiles like α-terpineol (165), β-phellandrene (98), α-phellandrene (93), p-cymene (95). Some hybrids on the top right contained much more volatiles compared to others, like F 1 individuals FoMu-115, FoMu-020, FoMu-091 and FoMu-076 with 111, 109, 101 and 108 volatiles respectively. Principal component, PC1, separated the individual hybrids primarily based on the relative content of α-humulene (267), δ-cadinene (288), (E)-cadina-1,4-diene (293), caryophyllene (253), α-muurolene (283), myrcene (81) and α-pinene (70), while α-phellandrene (93), p-cymene (95), β-phellandrene (98), α-colocalene (317), α-calacorene (296), α-cadinene (294), α-terpineol (165) and neointermedeol (335) were important for the separation of mandarin hybrids across PC2.  Correlation analysis of volatiles in ‘Fortune’ x ‘Murcott’ The pair-wise correlation coefficient for each volatile against every other compound was calculated in order to identify co-regulated compounds. Pearson correlation was performed for F 1 progeny juice samples in H1–13. Of the 11,476 pairs analyzed, 5885 resulted in significant correlations ( p < 0.05) (data not shown). Of these 5885 pairs, most of them (5724) exhibited positive correlation coefficients. The strongest positive correlations were found between α-muurolene with δ-cadinene ( r = 0.999) and (E)-cadina-1,4-diene ( r = 0.998). Strong positive ( r > 0.5) correlations were also found between (E)-2-octenal with (E)-2-nonenal ( r = 0.997) and heptanal ( r = 0.996), between δ-cadinene and (E)-cadina-1,4-diene ( r = 0.996), between nonyl acetate with octyl acetate ( r = 0.995) and decyl acetate ( r = 0.994). The strongest negative correlations were observed between 3-heptanone with linalool ( r = −0.26), and limonene ( r = −0.25) with dihydrocarvone ( r = −0.24). The 148 volatile compounds were categorized into 12 groups based on their chemical structure including acid, alcohol, aldehyde, ester, ether, furan, aromatic hydrocarbon, ketone, phenol, sesquiterpene, monoterpene and unknown [ 13]. The pair-wise correlation coefficient for each chemical group against every other group was calculated for juice samples from hybrids (Additional file  4). Strong positive correlations were observed for most of the major groups over four harvests, except for the ketone group which showed poor or no correlations. The ketone group was correlated with alcohols ( r = 0.49 and 0.56) in 2013, but showed no strong correlations with any other groups. The pair-wise correlation coefficient for each chemical group against every fruit characteristic was also calculated for hybrids (Additional file  5), and few strong correlations (|r| > 0.5) were observed. In 2013, total volatile content positively correlated with the traits TA and juice color space value  L, but negatively correlated with fruit diameter, fruit weight, juice percentage, SSC/TA ratio, flavedo and juice color space value  a and  a/ b ratio. Significant ( p < 0.05) positive correlations were found between TA with alcohols, aldehydes, esters and monoterpenes over two harvests in 2013. Juice color space value  a was negatively correlated with monoterpenes over four harvests, and juice color space value  b displayed relatively strong correlations with alcohols, aldehydes, esters and monoterpene in H1–13. The pair-wise correlation coefficient for color characteristic against every carotenoid-derived volatile including 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, β-cyclocitral, isophorone, neryl acetate, geranyl acetone and β–ionone, was calculated for hybrids (Additional file  6). Only a few stable significant correlations were found. Flavedo and juice color space value  a and  a/ b ratio displayed stable significant negative correlations with β-cyclocitral and neryl acetate, and a positive correlation with geranyl acetone over two or more harvests. Cluster validation using correlation analysis HCA (hierarchical cluster analysis) based on pairwise correlation coefficients were run individually for four harvests, and four distinct groups of volatiles were formed in H1–13 (Additional file  7). Cluster A included 26 volatiles, of which the majority were aldehydes, ketones and unknown compounds. Cluster B contained two sub-clusters B1 and B2 with 24 and 27 volatiles respectively. The B1 sub-cluster consisted of mainly aldehydes, esters, monoterpenes and unknown compounds, and the B2 comprised mainly alcohols, sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes. Cluster C included two sub-clusters C1 and C2 with 18 and 12 volatile compounds respectively. The C1 sub-cluster contained mainly sesquiterpenes, and the C2 comprised mainly sesquiterpenes and unknown compounds. Cluster D included two sub-clusters D1 and D2 with 20 and 23 volatiles respectively. The D1 consisted of mainly sesquiterpenes and unknown compounds, and the D2 contained mainly aldehydes, esters and ketones. Genetic mapping of QTLs controlling aroma compounds in ‘Fortune’ X ‘Murcott’ Some volatiles displayed qualitative variations, which suggested single locus inheritance. Pentanal, valencene and α-selinene were detected in juice samples from one parental line and the segregation pattern in the progeny matched a 1:1 ratio (α =0.05, χ 2 test), while (E)-2-octenal, acetone and (D)-carvone were present in both parents and the segregation pattern matched a 3:1 ratio (Additional file  2). In addition, 12 volatile compounds were absent in parental lines and the segregation pattern matched a 3:1 ratio. All QTLs for volatile compounds were identified using Log 10 transformed data. A total of 244 significant associations were found between molecular markers and 94 volatiles (Fig.  3 and Additional file  8). QTLs for each volatile located in the same chromosomal regions from different harvest seasons were considered to be the same, hence the 244 associations then were summarized into 206 QTLs, with 25 (12.14%) being repeatable (Table  2). Within the 25 repeatable QTLs, two, two, five, nine and five were detected for alcohols, aldehydes, esters, sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes, respectively. Out of the 206 QTLs, 41 QTLs were identified for 17 aroma active compounds. The number of QTLs ranged from zero on linkage groups FOR3.1, FOR7.2, FOR9.1, FOR9.3, MUR3.2, MUR3.3 and MUR7.1 to 47 on FOR1.1. The average R 2, explaining phenotypic variance, for all volatiles was 21.9%, and ranged from 14.49% for nonanoic acid to 59.82% for valencene in H1–13 with the highest LOD value of 17.22.  QTLs were grouped into four and three main clusters in the FOR and MUR maps, respectively. The first cluster on the FOR map was located on FOR1.1, where QTLs were identified for 47 volatiles including six alcohols, six aldehydes, five esters, one phenol, 11 sesquiterpenes, 10 monoterpenes and eight unknown compounds. Out of the 47 volatiles, nine volatiles were aroma active compounds, including linalool, heptanal, (E)-2-heptenal, decanal, dodecanal, myrcene, β-phellandrene, γ-terpinene and terpinolene. The second and third clusters were both located on FOR3.3. The second cluster was made up of nine QTLs identified for one alcohol, one ketone and seven sesquiterpenes. The R 2 was 59.82% for valencene in H1–13. Within the confidence intervals of the cluster, no candidate genes were found related to terpenoid regulation, even though the gene encoding valencene synthase (TPS1) was located on the Clementine genome scaffold 3. The third cluster of QTLs was identified for one acid, one alcohol, one ester, one ketone, two sesquiterpenes, eight monoterpenes and one unknown compound. The fourth cluster was located on FOR6.3, included QTLs for one alcohol, one aldehyde, one ester, one sesquiterpene and eight monoterpenes. Five of the eight monoterpenes were aroma active compounds including linalool, myrcene, terpinolene, β-phellandrene and γ-terpinene. The first cluster on the MUR map was located on MUR1.2, and contained QTLs for 24 volatiles including one acid, two alcohols, three esters, three ketones, six sesquiterpenes and nine monoterpenes. The second cluster was located on MUR2, consisted of QTLs for 22 volatiles including one alcohol, one aldehyde, five esters, five sesquiterpenes, nine monoterpenes and one unknown compound. Four of them were aroma active compounds including myrcene, β-phellandrene, γ-terpinene and dodecanal. Within the confidence intervals of the QTL cluster on MUR2, 572 annotated genes were listed. After screening, four of these genes,  GPS1,  TPS3,  TPS4 and  TPS14, encoding geranyl diphosphate synthase 1, terpene synthase 3, terpene synthase 4 and terpene synthase 14 respectively, were probably related to terpenoid regulation based on their biological function as studied in model plant species such as  Arabidopsis (Additional file  9). The third cluster was located on MUR4.1, where QTLs were identified for two esters, one aromatic hydrocarbon and one unknown compound. Repeatable and overlapped QTLs were also detected elsewhere for biologically related compounds in FOR and MUR maps. Overlapped QTLs were identified for (D)-carvone and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one on FOR2.1, (E)-dihydro carvone and (D)-carvone on FOR2.2, nonyl acetate and p-menth-1-en-9-ol acetate on FOR5.2, and α-copaene and δ-cadinene on FOR6.2. Repeatable QTLs were overlapped for δ-cadinene and calamenene on MUR6.1, and ethanol and ethyl acetate on FOR7.1. Eight QTLs on MUR9 were overlapped for one alcohol, three aldehydes, one ketone and three unknown compounds, and three of them were aroma active compounds including (E)-carveol, (E)-2-nonenal and (E)-2-decenal."," Background Flavor is an important attribute of mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco), but flavor improvement via conventional breeding is very challenging largely due to the complexity of the flavor components and traits. Many aroma associated volatiles of citrus fruit have been identified, which are directly related to flavor, but knowledge of genetic linkages and relevant genes for these volatiles, along with applicable markers potentially for expeditious and economical marker-assisted selection (MAS), is very limited. The objective of this project was to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with these volatile traits. Result Aroma volatiles were investigated in two mandarin parents ('Fortune' and 'Murcott') and their 116 F 1  progeny using gas chromatography mass spectrometry in 2012 and 2013. A total of 148 volatiles were detected, including one acid, 12 alcohols, 20 aldehydes, 14 esters, one furan, three aromatic hydrocarbons, 16 ketones, one phenol, 27 sesquiterpenes, 15 monoterpenes, and 38 unknowns. A total of 206 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified for 94 volatile compounds using genotyping data generated from a 1536-SNP Illumina GoldenGate assay. In detail, 25 of the QTLs were consistent over more than two harvest times. Forty-one QTLs were identified for 17 aroma active compounds that included 18 sesquiterpenes and were mapped onto four genomic regions. Fifty QTLs were for 14 monoterpenes and mapped onto five genomic regions. Candidate genes for some QTLs were also identified. A QTL interval for monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes on linkage group 2 contained four genes: geranyl diphosphate synthase 1, terpene synthase 3, terpene synthase 4, and terpene synthase 14. Conclusions Some fruit aroma QTLs were identified and the candidate genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway were found within the QTL intervals. These QTLs could lead to an efficient and feasible MAS approach to mandarin flavor improvement.","['Breeding', 'Citrus', 'QTL', 'Molecular marker', 'Aroma Volatile']","['Additional file', 'volatiles', 'compounds', 'volatile compounds', 'Additional', 'Murcott’', 'fortune’', 'QTLs', 'Volatile', 'unknown compounds']","[‘, ’, ‘Fortune, ’, H1–12, H2–12, H1–13, H2–13, ‘Fortune, ’, ‘Fortune, ’, ‘Fortune, ’, geranyl acetone, 90–99, p , H1–12, H1–12, H1–13, H2–13, p-menth-1-en-9-ol acetate, α-pinene, FoMu-081 [ 14, minty/piney, β-ionone, (E)-carveol, spicy/woody, ‘Fortune’, H1-13, PC2, ‘Fortune, ’, α-terpineol (165), FoMu-115, FoMu-020, FoMu-091, FoMu-076 with, α-pinene (70, α-terpineol (165), neointermedeol (335), PC2, p , δ-cadinene ( r , (E)-cadina-1,4-diene ( r , (E)-2-nonenal ( r , δ-cadinene, (E)-cadina-1,4-diene ( r , |r| , p , β-cyclocitral, β–ionone, β-cyclocitral, HCA, B2 with 24, B1, C1, C2 with 18, C1, C2, D2, D1, D2, ‘Fortune, ’ X ‘, α-selinene, α, χ 2, (D)-carvone, Log, FOR3.1, FOR7.2, FOR9.1, FOR9.3, MUR3.2, MUR3.3, MUR7.1, FOR3.3, TPS1, FOR6.3, β-phellandrene, MUR1.2, MUR2, MUR2, geranyl diphosphate synthase 1, terpene synthase 3, terpene synthase 4, terpene synthase 14, MUR4.1, (D)-carvone, (D)-carvone, p-menth-1-en-9-ol acetate, FOR6.2, MUR6.1, MUR9, (E)-carveol, (E)-2-nonenal]","['(TPS1)', 'TPS3,', 'TPS4', 'TPS14,']",[],[],terpene synthase
52,52,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5573811\eupmc_result.json,PMC5573811,"Results Sweet orange sesquiterpene emission profile Volatile profile in sweet orange leaves, flowers, and fruits at various phenological stages was investigated by static headspace sampling, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Separated volatile analysis for peel and pulp tissues from mature fruit were performed. In total, 99 volatile compounds, including 36 (plus 6 acetate/formate derivates) monoterpenes, were identified. In all samples, analyzed volatile emission was dominated by this class of terpenes, which constituted between 13 and more than 90% of the total emission (Supplementary Table  2). In general, β-terpinene, β-ocimene, and D-limonene were major compounds in all tissues, although it is interesting to note the high percentage of linalool in the volatile profile of sweet orange flowers. Despite their quantitative low contribution to total volatile emission from sweet orange tissues (<18%, Supplementary Table  2), sesquiterpene profile was qualitatively rich (Figure  1). Overall, up to 25 sesquiterpenes were identified in total. Small amounts of β-caryophyllene were detected in all samples, while α-copaene, β-elemene, α-humulene, and α-selinene were emitted by all tissues except young leaves. Beside this, each tissue showed a characteristic sesquiterpene emission profile. Major sesquiterpenes emitted by adult leaves were β-elemene and β-caryophyllene, while flowers emitted nerolidol, absent from most tissues analyzed. In fruit tissues, valencene emission contributed greatly to total emitted volatiles, in much more extent in peel than in pulp. Identification of the  TPS gene family in the sweet orange genome To identify all sweet orange genes with homology to  TPSs, the recently released sweet orange genome sequence (CAP 1) was screened using previously annotated  Citrus TPSs and relevant keywords as queries. This search identified a total of 95 loci and 111 predicted transcripts, 96 of them exhibiting significant similarities with known  TPSs (Supplementary Table  3). Most of the predicted peptides presented domains described in pFAM 5 and CCD 13 resources as TPS-characteristics, such as PF01397, and PF03936, described as TPS N-terminal and C-terminal domains, respectively. Besides, PLN02279 (ent-kaur-16-ene synthase), PLN02150 (TPS/cyclase), and PLN02592 (ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase) were identified. Putative  TPS genes were located on 6 of the 9 citrus chromosomes, being a significant proportion (78.84%) of them located in chromosomes II, III, IV, and V (Figure  2), while in chromosome VIII there was just one putative  TPS gene and none in chromosomes I, VI, and IX. Of the complete set of 95  CsTPS loci identified in this study, 61 (63.54%) were organized in 19 distinct clusters (distance between genes lower to 67 knt), covering from 2 to 6  CsTPS genes or pseudogenes, while 24 of them (named as orange1.1t) were not assigned to specific positions of the genome. 16  TPS loci arranged in five nearby clusters located in a region of 617 knt in chromosome IV, while isolated  TPS genes were identified in chromosomes II, IV, V, and VIII. In chromosomes II, IV, and V,  TPS genes were almost equally distributed in both DNA strands while in chromosome III all but one gene were located in the positive strand, and in chromosome VII all the genes were in the negative strand. Encoded protein predictions and homology analysis revealed that just 55 of the genes (70 predicted transcripts) appear to have uncompromised ORFs, encoding proteins longer than 400 amino acids and presenting significant homology to known non-citrus TPS enzymes (Supplementary Table  3). Remaining genes encoded polypeptides shorter than 400 amino acids and are likely to be pseudogenes or partial genes. Protein Cs3g21590 presented only 41% query coverage (from amino acid 1–531) to an annotated protein product from  Vitis and to other genes annotated as  SesquiTPS, while from amino acid 569 it presented high homology to 60S ribosomal genes. When NCBI citrus-annotated sequences were considered in homology analysis, Cs3g21590 presented 100% identity to a predicted SesquiTPS (XP_006473872) identified in the same genome annotation project that finally resulted in the CAP database. Consequently, annotated Cs3g21590 was replaced by a corrected version (Cs3g21590c) for subsequent analysis. Attending to their intron/exon number, as proposed by Trapp and Croteau ( 2001),  TPSs were classified into three classes: I (12–14 introns), II (9 introns), or III (6 introns) (Figure  3). Four genes, namely  Cs2g06470, Cs5g15530, Cs5g31210, and  orange1.1t03278, with 12, 13, 15, and 14 predicted exons, respectively, were classified as class I, which comprises mainly diterpene synthases from both angio- and gymnosperms. Remaining genes were annotated as class III, coding for TPS-a (SesquiTPS), TPS-b (cyclic monoterpene and hemiterpene synthases) and TPS-g (acyclic MonoTPS). From these, 12 were found to be partial genes in which some part of the gene is missed, probably by deletion or incomplete duplication, while other three genes presented duplications of the 3'-end. For example, gene  Cs3g16210 had automatically predicted nine introns, a characteristic feature of class II-TPS, which is gymnosperm specific. Detailed analysis of the sequence revealed two insertions of 800 and 356 nt, corresponding to duplications from more than half of intron 3 to almost the end of exon 5, and from intron 5 to the beginning of intron 6, respectively, after exon 7. Other genes, despite suffering insertions (i.e.,  orange1.1t04360, which harbors a small insertion in exon 3), coded for putative full length TPSs (Figure  3). In total, 40 of the genes were predicted to be full-length. Manual analysis of the architecture of  CsTPSs revealed a high conserved gene structure, with exons/introns (7/6) from class III TPSs corresponding to exons/introns 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 of class I TPSs (data not shown). Number, size, placement and position of exons and introns and splice sites of all these genes have been also analyzed. The size of the exons, although to a lesser extent the first one, was quite preserved, with median lengths from 44 to 125 amino acids (Figure  4A), while intron length was highly variable, from 16 to 2,335 nucleotides, most of them being between 81 and 400 nucleotides (Figure  4C). However, conservation of intron phase was evident in all them, though with some (1–4) exceptions in all introns but 6 (Figure  4B). To further characterize  CsTPSs, introns splicing sites context was analyzed and conserved trinucleotides R/GT and YAG/ were detected at 5′ and 3′ ends of the introns, respectively (Figure  4D). Protein conserved motifs and phylogenetic analysis Overall amino acid identity among predicted citrus TPS was 42.10%, although it varied widely, from 16.92% (Cs3g07850 and Cs5g15530) to 99.81% (Cs4g12120.1 and Cs4g12120.2) (Supplementary Table  4) similarity decreasing toward the carboxyl terminus of the proteins (Supplementary Figure  1). Protein length also differed extensively, from 729–851 amino acids of class I TPS to the minimum size of class III TPS (410 amino acids for Cs4g11320, Supplementary Table  3), being the medium size for this last class of 556 amino acids. Amino acidic sequence of putative full-length class III CsTPS was further analyzed (Supplementary Table  5). The size of the predicted protein sequences ranged from 410 to 629 amino acids, with theoretical molecular weights between 47.15 and 72.51 KDa and pIs between 4.86 and 7.63. Chloroplast transit peptides were predicted for 15 of the proteins, envisaging their probable MonoTPS activity, while the rest of CsTPSs are probably targeted to the cytosol and thus are most likely SesquiTPSs. Although all predicted full-length class III CsTPSs contained characteristic TPS motifs to a greater or lesser extent, just 39 of them (corresponding to 37 genes) contained all the motifs required for activity. At the N-terminal position, RRX8W motif essential for monoterpene synthase cyclization (Bohlmann et al.,  1998; Trapp and Croteau,  2001) was completely conserved in 25 of the predicted peptides, while variations affecting the second arginine were found in 18 sequences. This motif was completely absent in nine of the predicted peptides. At the C-terminus, a fully conserved RDR motif was found in most sequences, with variations R(E/S)(Q/S) in seven of them. The aspartate rich motif involved in bivalent metal ion cofactor binding varied between CsTPSs, occurring mostly as DDIYD. Only three predicted peptides lacked this motif. NSE/DTE signature was found in all selected full-length TPSs, with the general consensus sequence (D/N)D(V/M/L/I)X(S/T)XXXE. One predicted protein (orange1.1t02008) lacked the first aspartate, while two other lacked the terminal E (Cs2g22150 and Cs7g18530). Variations at intermediate positions were found in six of the putative peptides. Interestingly, the position of all these characteristic motifs was conserved along exon structure (Figure  3, Supplementary Table  5). To explore the evolutionary relationship between the citrus TPS family, putative full length functional CsTPSs identified in the CAP database, and all citrus TPSs functionally characterized up to date were used to construct a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree (Figure  5). This analysis separated CsTPSs in two clades, one with four members and the other with the remaining sequences. The first one included TPS-c, -e, and -f subfamilies, with one or two members each. Members of these subfamilies belong to class I TPS, as envisaged from their intron number, and their larger size due to the presence of an N-terminal plant diterpene synthase conserved signature, which includes SAYDTAW and QXXDGSWG motifs (Supplementary Figure  1). Identified citrus class I TPS did not contain RRX8W, RDR, or NSE/DTE motifs. TPSc members (Cs5g15530 and Cs5g31210) did not harbored DDXXD, but DXDD. These characteristics, together with the ancestral position of this clade, suggest that CsTPSc members are most probably copalyl diphosphate synthases, in good agreement with homology analysis (Supplementary Table  3). Orange1.1t03278 and Cs2g06470 contained DDXXD signature. The first one, which constitutes by itself clade TPS-e, resembled ent-kaurene synthase from other species while Cs2g06470, only representative of clade TPS-f, presented high homology to geranyl linalool synthases annotated in the NCBI public database. The second clade divided in two clusters, the larger one including TPS-b/g and TPS-a1 subfamilies. Identity within TPS-a1 group ranged from 28.17 (between Cs4g11320 and orange1.1t02448/orange1.1t03307) to 98.72% (between Cs5g12880 and Cs5g12900). This group contains putative SesquiTPSs and, consequently, all but one did not have a predicted transit peptide. Previously, functionally characterized citrus SesquiTPSs, such as β-farnesene synthase (Q94JS8), valencene synthase (AAQ04608), δ-elemene synthase (BAP74389), germacrene-A synthase (CuSesquiTPS1), and nerolidol/linalool synthase (BAP75561), also claded in this group. Members of Q94JS8 subcluster (Cs4g11320, orange1.1t03302.1, Cs4g12480 and Cs4g12220) maintain the DXDD motif, absent from the rest of predicted full length TPSs from class III (Supplementary Table  5). In this subfamily, arginine rich motifs presented R(P/R)X(A/S)X(F/Y)HP(S/T/N)(I/L)W and R(D/N)R consensus sequences and were found in almost all members. The first motif was absent in Cs4g12220 and Cs2g24110.1, while Cs4g11320 and orange1.1t03302 lacked RDR signature (Supplementary Table  5). Aspartate rich motifs DD(I/T)(Y/F)D and (D/N)D(I/M/V)X(S/T/G)(H/Y)(K/E)(F/V)E were found as conserved sequences in CsTPS-a, and they were present in all predicted full length proteins but Cs4g11320 and orange1.1t03302, which also lacked DDXXD. TPS-b subfamily, related to angiosperm MonoTPSs, had 19  C. sinensis predicted peptides, many of them harboring plastid targeting signals (Figure  5). Minimum identity within this group was 36.67%, between Cs2g22100 and Cs3g07880, while highest was 98.68%, between Cs3g04360 and Cs3g04190.  Citrus D-limonene (BAD27256, BAD27257, BAF73932, AAM53944, and AAM53946), geraniol (BAM29049), β-ocimene (BAD91046), γ-terpinene (AAM53943, BAD27258, and BAD27259), 1,8-cineole (BAD91045), β-pinene (AAM53945 and BAD27260) and sabinene (BAF73933) synthases reported in the literature, also claded in this group. Most (73%) predicted CsTPSb harbored all characteristic TPS motifs, presented as R(R/Q)SA(N/D)YXP(S/T/N)IW, R(D/N)(R/S), DD(I/V)YD, and (D/N)DL(G/A)TSSDE. Although the corresponding proteins from  C. sinensis have not been functionally characterized yet, in basis of current phylogenetic analysis, and their high identity (>95% from RRX8W onwards) it could be inferred that  Cs7g18530, and  Cs3g07850 encode sweet orange β-pinene and γ-terpinene synthases. In addition, if we compare their amino acid sequence between RDR and NSE/DTE signatures, which mostly corresponds to the catalytic pocket (Kampranis et al.,  2007), the identity between these CsTPSs, and citrus characterized β-pinene and γ-terpinene synthases raises to 99%. Similarly, D-limonene synthase activity can be envisaged for Cs3g04170, and Cs3g04360, grouped with enzymes with this activity from  C. sinensis, C. limon, and  C. unshiu, and highly identical to them (>94% from RRX8W and >99% between conserved motifs). A second cluster of D-limonene synthases including a protein from  C. unshiu and another putative D-limonene synthase from sweet orange (Cs3g04340) was also found. Closely related to TPS-b family, a TPS-g cluster, corresponding to predicted acyclic MonoTPS, was found. It included five members, three of them having a predicted transit peptide to chloroplasts. All members of this cluster completely lacked RRX8W signature and poorly conserved RDR motif, being the most common version R(D/E)Q. By the other hand, DDIFD, and DDLGSAKDE were found to be absolutely conserved in all CsTPS-g, except in Cs2g22180, which presented DDLGTAREE. Cs2g22180 presented low identity (38.50% in average) with remaining sequences of the group, which showed an overall identity of 78.16%. Previously characterized citrus linalool synthases also clustered in this group (BAP75559 and BAP75560), closely related to some of the identified CsTPSs. CsSesquiTPS gene isolation and expression analysis In order to gain knowledge about CsTPSs, an expression analysis of putative full-length  CsTPSs was performed using CAP RNA-seq data (Figure  6A). Resulting heatmap showed differential mRNA expression between genes. Eight genes showed low expression levels while other 22 were found to be expressed in all analyzed tissues (leaf, flower, and fruit). Four, one, and three genes showed tissue-specific expression in leaf, flower, or fruit, respectively. Most identified full length putative  CsTPS genes belong to the TPS-a subfamily, from which, to our knowledge, just four proteins have been functionally characterized up to date. Conversely, numerous peptides with MonoTPS activity, almost covering every subclade from the phylogenetic tree (Figure  5) have been reported. Then, gene expression of seven putative  CsSesquiTPS in different sweet orange tissues, such as peel, pulp, leaves, and flowers, was further examined. For  Cs5g23510, a unique sequence of 1,680 nt ( CsSesquiTPS1, Acc. N°  MF280919), encoding a protein of 559 amino acids (MW 64.54 kDa; pI 5.89) was obtained. This protein was 99.82% identical to that predicted in the CAP database, with just one amino acid change (M479I). Transcripts corresponding to this gene were observed in all tissues analyzed decreasing their accumulation in pulp as fruit matured (Figure  6B). For  Cs4g12120, a unique sequence of 1,689 nt was obtained ( CsSesquiTPS2, Acc. N°  MF280920). It encoded a 562 amino acid protein (MW 65.09 kDa; pI 5.79) identical to that annotated in the CAP database as Cs4g12120.2. Accumulation of this mRNA increased in orange peel along maturation, while in pulp it was only detected at the immature green stage. Expression of this gene was not detected in leaves at any developmental stage analyzed, while in flowers besides the mRNAs observed in fruit tissues, an additional transcript of about 1,400 nucleotides longer was also detected. The shorter predicted mRNA (Cs4g12120.1, 1,551 nt) was not detected at any of the tissues analyzed (Figure  6C). Orange1.1t03302 cDNA clones corresponded to a unique ORF of 1,683 nt ( CsSesquiTPS3, Acc N° MF280921) for a predicted protein of 560 amino acids (MW 64.25; pI 5.43), 74 more than that predicted in the CAP database, and contained all characteristic TPS motifs (Supplementary Figure  2A). This longer transcript was detected in the peel of orange fruit until degreening and in pulp of immature green fruits. In flowers and young leaves, mRNAs of the same size were detected, while in adult leaves only a much longer transcript (about 5,000 nt) was distinguished (Figure  6D). For  Cs4g12350, a 1,668 nt unique sequence ( CsSesquiTPS4, Acc. N°  MF280922), coding for a polypeptide of 555 amino acids (MW 64.37; pI 5.32) identical to that predicted in the CAP database, was obtained. This transcript was observed in peel, independently of fruit developmental/maturation stage, and in the pulp of immature green fruits. It was also detected in flowers and in all leaf tissues analyzed (Figure  6E). Shorter mRNAs were observed in peel from full colored fruits and in pulp from mature green and breaker fruits. For  Cs4g12400 gene, two cDNA clones of 1,668 nt (Acc. N°  MF280923 and  MF280924 for clones  CsSesquiTPS5a and  b, respectively) were obtained, both coding proteins of 555 amino acids, highly identical between them (95.86%) and to that predicted by the CAP database (96.04–99.82% for clones a and b, respectively). Predicted protein (Cs4g12400) and CsSesquiTPS5a had only one difference, a conservative amino acid substitution at the N-terminus (K15Q, Supplementary Figure  2B). On the other hand, CsSesquiTPS5b presented 22 amino acid substitutions (13 of them conservative, Supplementary Figure  2B) when compared with CsSesquiTPS5a. Transcripts corresponding to Cs4g12400 were detected in all tissues analyzed (Figure  6F). Three different cDNA clones were retrieved for  orange1.1t004360, two of them ( CsSesquiTPS6a Acc. N°  MF280925, and  CsSesquiTPS6b Acc. N°  MF280926) encoding proteins identical to those predicted from transcripts orange1.1t004360.1, and orange1.1t004360.2, with 574, and 567 amino acids, respectively. The third isolated sequence ( CsSesquiTPS6c, Acc. N°  MF280927) coded for a polypeptide 99.6% identical to orange1.1t004360.2, with two non-conservative substitutions (Asp for Gly) at positions 105, and 319. Transcription of this gene was detected in flower, leaves, and fruit tissues at certain developmental stages (Figure  6G). All cDNA clones corresponding to  Cs4g11980 showed an equal sequence of 1,701 nt ( CsSesquiTPS7, Acc. N°  MF280928), 99.29% identical to the ORF predicted in the CAP database. From the 12 nucleotide changes detected between both sequences, just six amino acid variations were found among them (Supplementary Figure  2C), showing 98.92% identity at amino acid level. Expression of this gene was detected in peel and pulp of immature green fruits, in leaves and flowers (Figure  6H). Functional characterization of the putative SesquiTPSs in  E. coli Functional characterization was carried out by expression of recombinant proteins in  E. coli, and  in vitro enzyme assays using FPP as substrate. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that sufficient soluble protein was formed for all constructs (data not shown). Volatile terpenes produced by the different recombinant proteins were analyzed by GC-MS. Analysis of the sesquiterpene products generated by CsSesquiTPS1 showed the presence of a 62:38% mixture of ( Z)-β-cubebene and α-copaene (Figure  7A). The major sesquiterpene product of CsSesquiTPS2 was tentatively identified as β-cadinene (59.19 ± 4.63% of total), followed by α-copaene (25.84 ± 2.76% of total) along with two minor products, α-cubebene and γ-cadinene (9.96 ± 1.11 and 4.98 ± 1.76% of total, respectively, Figure  7B). Enzyme coded by  CsSesquiTPS3 converted FPP to β-farnesene as the major product (74.74 ± 1.94% of total) with lesser amounts of β-sesquiphellandrene, zingiberene, and β-maaliene (16.07 ± 1.36, 4.78 ± 1.40, and 3.91 ± 1.10% of total, respectively, Figure  7C). More than half of CsSesquiTPS4 sesquiterpene production corresponded to β-elemene. In addition, between 6.22 and 12.68% of β-caryophyllene (6.22 ± 0.50%), α-humulene (12.68 ± 0.60%), and α-, β- and γ-selinene (9.82 ± 8.16, 9.84 ± 7.92, and 7.81 ± 4.70%, respectively) were detected (Figure  7D). Both  CsSesquiTPS5 clones (a and b) catalyzed the formation of multiple products from FPP, being all them bicyclic, except traces of the tricyclic sesquiterpene longifolene (Figures  7E,F). In both cases, the three major products (at least 20% each) were allo-aromadendrene (23.55 ± 12.43 and 25.67 ± 10.05% of total, for clones a and b, respectively), ledene (23.88 ± 0.80 and 20.43 ± 5.60% of total, for clones a and b, respectively) and β-cadinene (25.52 ± 6.79 and 31.58 ± 16.22% of total, for clones a and b, respectively). Trace to small amounts of α-cubebene, α-copaene, γ-gurjunene, (+/−)-cadinene, longifolene, α-muurolene, and 4,15-selinadiene were also found. In the case of  CsSesquiTPS6 clones, each showed different activities when FPP was used as substrate (Figures  7G–I). CsSesquiTPS6a produced exclusively β-caryophyllene, while CsSesquiTPS6b rendered higher amounts of β-caryophyllene (73.51 ± 0.26% of total) together with α-humulene (23.14 ± 0.30% of total). Clone CsSesquiTPS6c did not produce any sesquiterpene. As CsSesquiTPS6b, CsSesquiTPS7 produced β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, and in similar proportions (about 75:25%, respectively, Figure  7J). Protein modeling The different proteins encoded by  CsSesquiTPS5, CsSesquiTPS6 and  CsSesquiTPS7 were 3D modeled based on the crystal structure of the δ-cadinene synthase from cotton (Gennadios et al.,  2009, Protein Data Bank code  3G4D_(A). All predicted structural models show high quality (coverage >94%, sequence similarity >0.44, high GMQE and QMEAN scores), and fitted well with the crystallographic model, displaying the two TPS characteristic domains: the functional C-terminal domain consisting of 14 α-helices forming a central cavity and the amino terminal domain formed by two 10 antiparallel α-helices (Figure  8). The aspartate-rich motifs DDXXD (located on Helix α-13) and NSE/DTE motif (located helix α-20) both involved in binding a trio of divalent magnesium ions, co-orientated to the catalytic pocket. Most of the non-equivalent amino acid substitutions identified between CsSesquiTPS5a and b were located in α-helices without causing significant alterations of the predicted structure (i.e., E134A, L243H, Y369C). Some others, such as S129P and R191C, were found on the outer surface of the protein, in contact with the solvent, and neither expected to induce alterations in its conformation. The change Q458H was found near to the active site. The light steric effect that this substitution could have may be somehow compensated by the Q482A change, which in the tertiary structure faces with the previous one, thus not altering size or conformation of the catalytic cavity. In the cleft, D309, and 313, N453, and Q387 were found to interact with the Mg 2+ cluster. A representative model of CsSesquiTPS5 proteins is shown in Figure  8A. Despite their differences at sequence level, CsSesquiTPS7, and CsSesquiTPS6b both produced β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, and in similar proportions (Figure  7). By modeling and comparing their structures, we found that most amino acid changes between both proteins were solvent exposed and were not expected to induce important changes in the protein structure (Figure  8B). Just A256E and I260R (counted on CsSesquiTPS6b sequence), both located on an α-helix, were found to disturb somewhat the facing N-terminal loop, in which E41D, and T44P substitutions could compensate the structural differences. Consequently, the predicted N-terminal end varies slightly between both proteins, but the predicted catalytic pocket remained almost identical. Contrary, on CsSesquiTPS6c, the D319G change prevents the interaction of this residue with one of the Mg 2+ atoms (Figure  8C). On the other hand, in comparison to CsSesquiTPS6b, insertion of seven amino acids in the loop between α-helix 14 and 15 of CsSesquiTPS6a would allow establishment of new hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with faced helixes α-15 and α-16, the last harboring the E404 residue involved in interactions with the Mg 2+ cluster (Figure  8D). Besides, the loop may also stabilize the α-helix 14 itself, providing extra rigidity to the preceding α-helix-13, which includes the DDXXD signature. Altogether, these effects may result in higher rigidity and stability of the C-terminal domain of the structure. Modelling also predicts small deviations of helixes α-17, α-20, and α-21, the second one including D471, also involved in binding the bivalent metal ion cofactor.","Citrus aroma and flavor, chief traits of fruit quality, are derived from their high content in essential oils of most plant tissues, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. Accumulated in secretory cavities, most components of these oils are volatile terpenes. They contribute to defense against herbivores and pathogens, and perhaps also protect tissues against abiotic stress. In spite of their importance, our understanding of the physiological, biochemical, and genetic regulation of citrus terpene volatiles is still limited. The availability of the sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis  L. Osbeck) genome sequence allowed us to characterize for the first time the terpene synthase (TPS) family in a citrus type.  CsTPS  is one of the largest angiosperm TPS families characterized so far, formed by 95 loci from which just 55 encode for putative functional TPSs. All TPS angiosperm families, TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, TPS-e/f, and TPS-g were represented in the sweet orange genome, with 28, 18, 2, 2, and 5 putative full length genes each. Additionally, sweet orange β-farnesene synthase, ( Z )-β-cubebene/α-copaene synthase, two β-caryophyllene synthases, and three multiproduct enzymes yielding β-cadinene/α-copaene, β-elemene, and β-cadinene/ledene/allo-aromandendrene as major products were identified, and functionally characterized via  in vivo  recombinant  Escherichia coli  assays.","['Sesquiterpene', 'Citrus', 'Orange', 'Volatile', 'Monoterpene', 'Defense', 'Β-caryophyllene']","['Figure', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Supplementary Table', 'predicted', 'TPS', 'amino acids', 'Supplementary', 'genes', 'amino', 'TPS genes']","[β-terpinene, β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene, CAP 1, CCD 13 resources, TPS-characteristics, PF03936, TPS N-terminal, PLN02279, PLN02150, TPS/cyclase, PLN02592, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, IX, V, Cs3g21590, 60S ribosomal, Cs3g21590, CAP, Cs3g21590, 12–14, Cs5g15530, Cs5g31210, class I, class III, TPS-g (acyclic MonoTPS, class III TPSs, class I TPSs, R/GT, 3′, Cs3g07850, Cs5g15530, Cs4g12120.1, Cs4g12120.2, 729–851 amino acids, class I, class III TPS, Cs4g11320, class III CsTPS, KDa, MonoTPS, CsTPSs, SesquiTPSs, class III CsTPSs, metal ion cofactor, CsTPSs, DDIYD, Cs2g22150, Cs7g18530, CsTPSs, CAP, CsTPSs, class I, SAYDTAW, QXXDGSWG, Cs5g31210, CsTPSc, Cs2g06470, ent-kaurene synthase, Cs2g06470, TPS-b/g, TPS-a1, Cs4g11320, orange1.1t02448/orange1.1t03307, Cs5g12880, Cs5g12900, SesquiTPSs, SesquiTPSs, β-farnesene synthase, δ-elemene synthase (, germacrene-A synthase, CuSesquiTPS1, nerolidol/linalool synthase, BAP75561, Q94JS8 subcluster, Cs4g11320, orange1.1t03302.1, Cs4g12480, Cs4g12220, class III, R(D/N)R, Cs4g12220, Cs2g24110.1, Cs4g11320, orange1.1t03302, DD(I/T)(Y/F)D, CsTPS-a, Cs4g11320, orange1.1t03302, MonoTPSs, Cs2g22100, Cs3g07880, Cs3g04360, Cs3g04190, BAD27256, BAD27257, BAF73932, AAM53944, AAM53946, BAM29049, AAM53943, BAD27258, BAD27259, β-pinene (AAM53945, BAD27260, CsTPSb, R(R/Q)SA(N/D)YXP(S/T/N)IW, R(D/N)(R/S, DD(I/V)YD, CsTPSs, Cs3g04170, Cs3g04360, MonoTPS, R(D/E)Q., DDIFD, DDLGSAKDE, CsTPS-g, Cs2g22180, DDLGTAREE, Cs2g22180, BAP75559, BAP75560, CsTPSs, CsSesquiTPS, CsTPSs, CAP RNA-seq, MonoTPS, CsSesquiTPS1, CAP, CsSesquiTPS2, Acc., CAP, Cs4g12120.2, Cs4g12120.1, CsSesquiTPS3, Acc N°, CAP, CsSesquiTPS4, CAP, CAP database (, b, Cs4g12400, CsSesquiTPS5a, CsSesquiTPS5b, CsSesquiTPS5a, Cs4g12400, orange1.1t004360.1, orange1.1t004360.2, CsSesquiTPS6c, orange1.1t004360.2, CsSesquiTPS7, CAP, SesquiTPSs, CsSesquiTPS1, CsSesquiTPS2, ±, ±, β-maaliene (16.07 ±, ±, ±, CsSesquiTPS4, β-caryophyllene (6.22 ±, α-, β-, ±, ±, ±, ±, b, ±, ±, b, ±, b, CsSesquiTPS6b, β-caryophyllene (73.51 ±, Clone CsSesquiTPS6c, CsSesquiTPS6b, CsSesquiTPS7, β-caryophyllene, GMQE, CsSesquiTPS5a, b, α-helices, E134A, L243H, Y369C, S129P, R191C, Q458H, Q482A, N453, Mg 2, CsSesquiTPS5, CsSesquiTPS7, CsSesquiTPS6b, I260R, CsSesquiTPS6b, α-helix, N-terminal, E41D, N-terminal, CsSesquiTPS6c, Mg 2, CsSesquiTPS6b, α-helix 14, CsSesquiTPS6a, α-15, α-16, Mg 2, α-helix, α-helix-13, α-20, α-21]","['TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS-characteristics,', 'TPS', '(TPS/cyclase),', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CsTPS', 'CsTPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'SesquiTPS,', 'SesquiTPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS-a', '(SesquiTPS),', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'MonoTPS).', 'II-TPS,', 'TPSs', 'CsTPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'CsTPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CsTPS', 'MonoTPS', 'CsTPSs', 'SesquiTPSs.', 'CsTPSs', 'TPS', 'CsTPSs,', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'CsTPSs', 'TPSs', 'CsTPSs', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS,', 'TPS', 'TPSc', 'CsTPSc', 'TPS-e,', 'TPS-f,', 'TPS-b/g', 'TPS-a1', 'TPS-a1', 'SesquiTPSs', 'SesquiTPSs,', '(CuSesquiTPS1),', 'TPSs', 'CsTPS-a,', 'TPS-b', 'MonoTPSs,', 'CsTPSb', 'TPS', 'CsTPSs,', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'MonoTPS,', 'CsTPS-g,', 'CsTPSs.', 'CsSesquiTPS', 'CsTPSs,', 'CsTPSs', 'CsTPS', 'TPS-a', 'MonoTPS', 'CsSesquiTPS', 'CsSesquiTPS1,', 'CsSesquiTPS2,', 'CsSesquiTPS3,', 'TPS', 'CsSesquiTPS4,', 'CsSesquiTPS5a', 'CsSesquiTPS5a', 'CsSesquiTPS5b', 'CsSesquiTPS5a.', 'CsSesquiTPS6a', 'CsSesquiTPS6b', 'CsSesquiTPS6c,', 'CsSesquiTPS7,', 'SesquiTPSs', 'CsSesquiTPS1', 'CsSesquiTPS2', 'CsSesquiTPS3', 'CsSesquiTPS4', 'CsSesquiTPS5', 'CsSesquiTPS6', 'CsSesquiTPS6a', 'CsSesquiTPS6b', 'CsSesquiTPS6c', 'CsSesquiTPS6b,', 'CsSesquiTPS7', 'CsSesquiTPS5,', 'CsSesquiTPS6', 'CsSesquiTPS7', 'TPS', 'CsSesquiTPS5a', 'CsSesquiTPS5', 'CsSesquiTPS7,', 'CsSesquiTPS6b', 'CsSesquiTPS6b', 'CsSesquiTPS6c,', 'CsSesquiTPS6b,', 'CsSesquiTPS6a']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']","['Citrus', 'Citrus']",terpene synthase
53,53,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5583216\eupmc_result.json,PMC5583216,"Results Infection and symptoms Ten doubly-inoculated trees became positive for both mild CTV-B2 and severe CTV-B6 based on RT-PCR after 2–4 months (Figure  1). Symptoms developed 5–6 months after inoculation. Trees infected with CTV-B2/CTV-B6 were much smaller and stunted than the healthy controls, with leaf chlorosis, vein corking, and vein curling (Figure  2) increasing as time passed. Symptoms of the co-inoculated plants 12 months after co-inoculation were indistinguishable from those produced by plants infected with CTV-B6 alone. In the plants co-inoculated with CTV-B2 and CTV-B6, the p23 transcript of CTV-B6 was found 300 times more frequently than the CTV-B2 homolog. Sequences homologous to p23 were not found in the mock-inoculated controls, nor when other libraries that contained only CTV-B2 or CTV-B6 were searched for the heterologous p23 sequence. Overview of RNA-seq 38 to 47 million raw reads were obtained from each inoculated tree with approximate 61% (average of three replicates) of these reads successfully aligned to the  C. sinensis reference genome (Xu et al.,  2013; Figure  S1). Compared with mock-inoculated healthy trees, a total of 767 transcripts were differentially expressed: 411 were induced and 356 were repressed (Padj ≤ 0.1; Figure  S2). DETs were found to be enriched for different biological processes (level 2) with Panther based on orthologs of  Arabidopsis thaliana. The distribution of functional categories for up- and down-regulated genes was similar: metabolic processes, cellular processes, localization, biological regulation, and response to stimulus (Figure  3). The set of down-regulated genes had relatively more genes related to cellular component organization/biogenesis but less for localization (Figure  3). In an overview of metabolic and biotic stress pathways, genes related to light reactions, oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP), tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), tetrapyrrole synthesis, nucleotide metabolism, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism were mostly repressed (Figure  4), whereas the genes associated with cell wall synthesis, secondary and hormone metabolism, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, and signaling were mostly induced (Figure  5). A full list of differentially expressed transcripts is shown in more detail (Table  S2). The expression levels of selected DETs ranged from −2 to 8 (log 2 FC). Similar expression patterns were obtained for all evaluated transcripts by both RNA-seq and RT-qPCR techniques. The dissociation pattern and single peak obtained after RT-qPCR verified the specificity of RT-qPCR primers (Figure  S3). A high Spearman's rho value (0.82) indicated good correlation of gene expression between the RNA-seq and RT-qPCR results and confirmed the reliability and accuracy of the RNA-seq data in our study (Figure  6). Photosynthesis, nucleic acid, and iron metabolism The expression of several photosynthesis-related genes was down-regulated in response to CTV-B2/CTV-B6. These genes included  LHCA4 (light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex I subunit A4),  PPL1 (PsbP-like protein 1), thylakoid lumenal 20 kDa protein,  PSAD-1 (photosystem I subunit D-1), photosystem II reaction center  PsbP family protein, and  PTAC14 (plastid transcriptionally active14; Table  1). Genes in the tetrapyrrole synthesis pathway were also repressed, including  GSA2 (glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2, 1-aminomutase 2),  HEMC (hydroxymethylbilane synthase),  HEME2 (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase), and  HEMF1 (coproporphyrinogen oxidase; Table  1). Genes encoding enzymes for nucleotide metabolism  PYR4 (pyrimidine 4),  NDPK2 (nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2), and  RNR1 (ribonucleotide reductase 1) were repressed. Genes related to DNA synthesis were also down-regulated, as were some genes that encode DNA repair proteins  MCM2 (DNA replication licensing factor),  MCM3, FAS1 (fasciata 1),  RPA70B (rpa70-kda subunit B),  PRL (prolifera), and genes for several histones, including  H3, H4, and  HTA7 (Table  1). Alteration of ribosomal composition A large group of genes encoding ribosomal proteins were repressed, including components of the 30S, 40S, 50S, and 60S subunits, indicating an extensive reprogramming of ribosomal synthesis (Table  2). Ribosomal proteins (RPs) play roles in metabolism, growth and cell division, but also function in developmental processes as regulatory components (Byrne,  2009). Cell wall barriers were enhanced The expression of a majority of genes for cell wall metabolism was up-regulated: Genes encoding  CESA9 (cellulose synthase A9) and  PRP4 (cell wall proline-rich protein 4), as well as  XTH28 (xyloglucan endotransglycosylase) and  XTH30 were all up-regulated and the expression level of  EXLB3 (expansin-like B3 precursor) was up-regulated ~7 fold (Table  3). Transportation system Transcription of genes related to transport and metal binding were largely up-regulated. These included transporters for nucleotides, sugars, amino acids, sulfate, phosphate, peptides, and oligopeptides and ABC transporters, such as,  AAP6 and  AAP7 (amino acid trans membrane transporter),  AST56 and  AST68 (sulfate transporter),  NRT1.1 (nitrate transporter),  ZIP1, ZIP5, and  ZIP11 (zinc ion trans membrane transporter; Table  3). Transcripts encoding phloem protein PP2-B13 were somewhat down-regulated in response to co-infection with CTV-B2/CTV-B6, but were strongly down-regulated by CTV-B2 alone, whereas transcripts for PP2-B15 were slightly up-regulated by single infection with CTV-B6 (Fu et al.,  2016). Up-regulation of hormone and secondary metabolism and signaling associated defense responses Genes involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites and hormone metabolism were induced, such as,  TPS21 (terpene synthase 21),  CER3 (ceriferum 3),  TT4 (transparent testa 4),  AFB5 (auxin F-Box protein 5),  GA5 (gibberellin 20-oxidase),  EIN4 (ethylene insensitive 4), and  ERS1 (ethylene response sensor 1). Genes for biotic stress associated proteins  RLP21 (Receptor Like Protein 21),  CHIB1 (acidic endochitinase) and  EDS1 (enhanced disease susceptibility 1), and disease resistance proteins in the CC-NBS-LRR class were also induced (Table  3). Genes for receptor kinases, calcium and light related signaling were mostly induced, such as,  RLP1 (receptor like protein 1),  RLP6, and  RLP15, CSE101 (callus expression of rbcs 101),  IQD23 (IQ-domain 23) binding calmodulin, and  FRS5 (FAR1-related sequence 5) binding zinc ions (Table  3).","Citrus tristeza is one of the most destructive citrus diseases and is caused by the phloem-restricted Closterovirus,  Citrus tristeza virus . Mild strain CTV-B2 does not cause obvious symptoms on indicators whereas severe strain CTV-B6 causes symptoms, including stem pitting, cupping, yellowing, and stiffening of leaves, and vein corking. Our laboratory has previously characterized changes in transcription in sweet orange separately infected with CTV-B2 and CTV-B6. In the present study, transcriptome analysis of  Citrus sinensis  in response to double infection by CTV-B2 and CTV-B6 was carried out. Four hundred and eleven transcripts were up-regulated and 356 transcripts were down-regulated prior to the onset of symptoms. Repressed genes were overwhelmingly associated with photosynthesis, and carbon and nucleic acid metabolism. Expression of genes related to the glycolytic, oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP), tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) pathways, tetrapyrrole synthesis, redox homeostasis, nucleotide metabolism, protein synthesis and post translational protein modification and folding, and cell organization were all reduced. Ribosomal composition was also greatly altered in response to infection by CTV-B2/CTV-B6. Genes that were induced were related to cell wall structure, secondary and hormone metabolism, responses to biotic stress, regulation of transcription, signaling, and secondary metabolism. Transport systems dedicated to metal ions were especially disturbed and ZIPs (Zinc Transporter Precursors) showed different expression patterns in response to co-infection by CTV-B2/CTV-B6 and single infection by CTV-B2. Host plants experienced root decline that may have contributed to Zn, Fe, and other nutrient deficiencies. Though defense responses, such as, strengthening of the cell wall, alteration of hormone metabolism, secondary metabolites, and signaling pathways, were activated, these defense responses did not suppress the spread of the pathogens and the development of symptoms. The mild strain CTV-B2 did not provide a useful level of cross-protection to citrus against the severe strain CTV-B6.","['Citrus sinensis', 'Transcriptome', 'Closterovirus', 'defense response', 'Host–pathogen Interaction']","['Figure', 'genes', 'Ten doubly-inoculated', 'Table', 'symptoms Ten', 'genes related', 'metabolism', 'protein', 'expression', 'Genes encoding']","[CTV-B2, CTV-B6, 2–4, CTV-B2/CTV-B6, CTV-B6, CTV-B2, CTV-B6, p23, CTV-B6, CTV-B2 homolog, p23, CTV-B6, p23, RNA-seq, ≤, −2, RNA-seq, rho, CTV-B2/CTV-B6, light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complex I subunit A4, PsbP-like protein 1, photosystem I subunit D-1, photosystem II, active14, glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2, 1-aminomutase 2, hydroxymethylbilane synthase, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, coproporphyrinogen oxidase, ribonucleotide reductase 1, rpa70-kda subunit B, histones, H4, ribosomal, 50S, 60S subunits, RPs, cellulose synthase A9, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, expansin-like B3, ABC transporters, sulfate transporter, nitrate transporter, ZIP5, PP2-B13, CTV-B2/CTV-B6, CTV-B2, PP2-B15, CTV-B6, Fu et, terpene synthase 21, auxin F-Box, gibberellin 20-oxidase, Receptor Like Protein 21, acidic endochitinase, CC-NBS-LRR, receptor like protein 1, CSE101, IQ-domain 23, calmodulin, FAR1-related sequence]",['TPS21'],['C.'],[],terpene synthase
56,56,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5684173\eupmc_result.json,PMC5684173,"Results Identification, semi-quantitation and genome-wide association of volatiles in leaves and roots The isolation and separation of VOCs from the two plant organs, leaves and roots, were done by headspace SPME-GC. A full multi-compound quantitation using the SPME technique is impossible in complex organic matrices like homogenates of carrot leaves and roots (Schieberle and Molyneux,  2012) and in addition not essential for the aim of this research. Therefore, the data are given as semi-quantitative, relative concentrations (peak areas in counts). The information for phenotyping is contained in the data differences or standardized values for the individual compounds. Table  1 lists the 31 VOCs which were measured either in roots or leaves, or which were identified in both organs. The phenotypic variability of terpene contents among the 85 carrot accessions is shown in Figure  1. The quantitation of the identified terpene volatiles in each carrot accession is presented in Supplementary Table  4. These VOCs belong to the chemical classes of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and several different terpene-derivatives such as terpene alcohols. In leaves 26 out of these 31 VOCs were identified, while only 20 VOCs were identified in roots. Altogether 15 VOCs were identified and semi-quantified in both organs, but also large qualitative differences were found (11 compounds are unique for leaves and also 5 compounds for roots). The quantitative range of the VOC variation in the carrot collection is tremendous. The mean quantitative level of the data (relative concentrations) differs between leaves and roots as a result of the different sample preparations protocols used (mean value 2,542.79 vs. 6,232.39, Supplementary Table  4). The most abundant compounds in the chromatograms are β-myrcene, β-caryophyllene and germacrene D in leaves and terpinolene, β-caryophyllene and bornyl acetate in roots. Noticeable are the differences between the samples with the maximum and minimum total level of volatiles which are the samples 07 (Purple Haze) and 47 (Nana W 561) (5,930.51 vs. 951.10) in leaves and 55 (Purple Stem Selection) and 50 (Stratova) (28,712.74 vs. 982.35) in roots (Supplementary Table  4). These are factors of 6.2 for leaves and 29.2 for roots, respectively. Supplementary Table  5 shows the results of a correlation analysis of 15 VOCs which are identified in both organs. Five of the compounds (sabinene, β-caryophyllene, ocimene, a-pinene and terpinen-4-ol) show correlations which are significant at a level of  p < 0.05. This is in accordance with earlier results for sabinene and β-caryophyllene (Ulrich et al.,  2015), the substances with the highest correlation between leaves and roots. Genotyping of the 85 genotypes and data pre-processing resulted in a dataset of 281,394 bi-allelic SNP markers. In total, 112,731 markers were excluded from further analyses, due to minor allele frequency < 5% (106,581 markers) or heterozygosity > 90% (6,150 markers). The remaining 168,663 polymorphic and high-quality markers were used to calculate kinship matrix. Based on these data GWAS was implemented. Compressed mixed linear model approach in GAPIT (Lipka et al.,  2012; R Core Team,  2014) with K-matrix as correction for relatedness was conducted and resulted in the identification of 25 and 9 marker trait associations (MTAs) significantly (LOD ≥ 5.91) associated with 11 and 6 VOCs in roots and leaves, respectively (Supplementary Table  6). These significantly associated MTAs were assigned to 21 and 9 QTL regions, respectively (Table  2). The QTL regions are distributed over the whole genome, whereby the majority of QTLs for VOCs were detected on chromosome 7, 8, and 9 in roots and on chromosome 7 in leaves (Table  2). The number of significantly associated markers per QTL region ranged between 1 and 3 (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  6). Most QTLs were detected for the monoterpene compounds ocimene, sabinene, β-pinene, borneol and bornyl acetate.  QTL_r_SABI_4.1 and  QTL_r_TERPol_4, QTL_r_BORNAc_5.1 and QTL_r_BORN_5.1 or QTL_r_BORNAc_5.2 and QTL_r_BORN_5.2 are located in the same chromosomal region, respectively (Table  2 and Supplementary Table  6). The volatile compounds borneol (BORN) and bornyl acetate (BORNAc) showed significantly associated MTAs for both roots and leaves; however detected QTL regions are not identical. For all other VOCs significantly associated MTAs were only detected either for roots or leaves. The TPS gene family in  D. carota Bioinformatic searches of the assembled carrot whole genome sequence (Iorizzo et al.,  2016) with the homology-based gene prediction program GeMoMa (Keilwagen et al.,  2016) and subsequent manual curation and evaluation of transcript predictions identified a total number of 65 TPS candidate gene models in carrot (Table  3, Supplementary Material  1). These 65 TPS gene models do not contain obvious pseudo-genes, since all start with correct start codon, have no frame-shift or internal stop codon, and end with a stop codon. Based on the transcript intron evidence (tie) obtained from GeMoMa using RNA-seq data, the predictions were split in 49 conservative genes with tie ≥ 0.8 and 16 putative genes with tie < 0.8. Comparing the predictions with the annotation (Iorizzo et al.,  2016), only 32 have a partial overlap with some annotated transcripts, while 33 do not overlap with any annotation (Table  3). Only 3 out of these 32 overlapping predictions are identical with the annotated transcript ( DcTPS01, DcTPS02, DcTPS29). The remaining 29 predictions show diverse deviations compared to the annotation—often with additional exons. This might be a reason why these transcripts have not been identified as TPS before. Utilizing RNA-seq data (Iorizzo et al.,  2016), we determined the expression profile of these 65 TPS candidate gene models (Supplementary Table  2) and found diverse patterns of expression within the 20 RNA-seq samples (Supplementary Figure  1). For instance,  DcTPS28 shows stable expression over all 20 samples, whereas  DcTPS03, DcTPS21, and  DcTPS37 show mainly specific expression for stressed whole storage root, opened whole flowers, and germinating seed at the beginning of germination.  DcTPS11 appears to be the gene with the strongest expression of all carrot TPS candidates. Only two genes ( DcTPS51 and  DcTPS64) didn't show any transcriptional activity in all 20 transcriptomes. The 65 TPS candidate genes comprise the previously published sesquiterpene synthase gene  DcTPS1 ( DcTPS01), the monoterpene synthase gene  DcTPS2 ( DcTPS02) and four additional full-length EST contigs (Yahyaa et al.,  2015). The four ESTs have been preliminary named by their contig number (Yahyaa et al.,  2015), however, we propose the gene names  DcTPS03, DcTPS05, DcTPS06, DcTPS07 (Table  3). Based on their sequence similarity to representative TPS from other plant species, the 65 candidate  DcTPS sequences represent six of the eight plant TPS subfamilies (Table  3, Supplementary Table  7). Phylogenetic analysis of the carrot TPS genes indicates that 22 belong to the TPS-a subfamily which contains predominantly sesquiterpene synthases (Figure  2). A total of 32 genes were found to belong to the TPS-b subfamily of angiosperm monoterpene synthases, and five genes were identified representing the TPS-g subfamily. Another three genes are assigned to subgroup TPS-c, two genes are in TPS-e, and a single TPS gene ( DcTPS29) was assigned to subfamily TPS-f. The only subgroups with no representative carrot genes were, as expected, the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily and TPS-h, which is specific to  S. moellendorffii. The (sub-)classification of DcTPS genes was supported by their alignment with TPS genes identified and characterized in the  Eucalyptus grandis genome (Külheim et al.,  2015) and, concerning the TPSs of subfamilies TPS-c, TPS-e and TPS-f, also with selected TPS genes from  A. thaliana and  Populus trichocarpa used also by Külheim et al. ( 2015) for phylogenetic analyses (Supplementary Figure  2). The prediction as TPS candidate gene required a TPS open reading frame (ORF) to be of the expected size and that it displays typical structural characteristics such as the intron-exon structure (i.e., generally seven exons for genes of subfamilies TPS-a, TPS-b and TPS-g) and the presence of conserved C-terminal domains such as the Mg 2+ -binding DDXXD and the NSE/DTE motifs. As shown in Supplementary Table  7, most putative sesquiterpene synthases (TPS-a) have a length of about 540–560 amino acids. More than 20 out of 32 putative monoterpene synthases of subfamily TPS-b are longer than 580 amino acids. This was expected because these proteins are most likely targeted to the plastids due to the presence of a N-terminal transit peptide. All but six of the  Daucus TPS genes of the subfamilies TPS-a, TPS-b and TPS-g contain seven coding exons (Supplementary Table  7), whereas for the remaining genes 8 exons were predicted. The six genes of the subfamilies TPS-c, TPS-e and TPS-f are characterized by longer sequences and consist of 12–15 exons. Almost all carrot TPS candidate genes showed the sequence motifs characteristic of TPSs, notably the double arginine motif RRX 8W which is present in most members of subfamilies TPS-a and TPS-b but completely missing in the remaining subfamilies (Supplementary Table  7, Supplementary Figure  3). This motif is known to be involved in producing cyclic monoterpenes and is absent in TPSs that produce acyclic products (Chen et al.,  2011). Especially the TPS-g subfamily contains synthases for acyclic monoterpenes known to be involved in floral scent (Dudareva et al.,  2003). The three TPS-c genes did also not show the two highly conserved C-terminal motifs (DDXXD, NSE/DTE). However, these motifs appeared to be present in all other TPS subfamilies, with a single exception ( DcTPS64). The majority of carrot TPS genes, i.e., the members of subfamilies TPS-a, TPs-b and TPS-g may function as enzymes involved in volatile terpene production. NCBI BlastP searches showed that members of subfamilies TPS-c ( DcTPS25, DcTPS57, DcTPS59) and TPS-e ( DcTPS28, DcTPS56) have a predicted putative function as ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase or ent-kaurene synthase and are probably involved in biosynthesis of plant hormone (gibberellin) precursors. The putative function of the single TPS-f gene  DcTPS29 was predicted as a nerolidol-geranyl linalool synthase. When the candidate gene  DcTPS16 was compared with known TPSs of the  Eucalyptus grandis genome, we found an assignment to the subfamily TPS-b2 (Supplementary Figure  2). TPS-b2 was reported to contain putative isoprene/ocimene synthases (Külheim et al.,  2015). The predicted function of  DcTPS16 as a putative isoprene synthase was also indicated by a NCBI BlastP search (data not shown). As demonstrated by Sharkey et al. ( 2012) isoprene synthase genes form a monophyletic clade of acyclic TPSs in the TPS-b subfamily. The chromosomal positions of the carrot TPS genes were identified for 64 out of the 65 genes on the nine assembled carrot chromosome sequences (Table  3, Figure  3). Only a single gene ( DcTPS16) was not linked to the nine carrot chromosomes based on the carrot whole genome sequence. Large differences were found for the number of genes per chromosome. Chromosome 3 comprises 14 TPS genes, whereas chromosome 6 contains a single TPS gene ( DcTPS01). A majority of the TPS genes were found to co-locate on the same chromosomal genomic region. The largest clusters of TPS sequences were found on chromosome 4 (five genes spanning around 100 kb) and chromosome 9 (six genes spanning about 200 kb, see Table  3, Figure  3). In addition, on chromosome 1 six genes occurred in the region around 45 Mbp. Together with a TPS cluster of 4 genes, on chromosome 3 a total number of 10 TPS genes were located at the end of the assembled pseudomolecule. The large cluster on chromosome 9 contains 6 TPS genes ( DcTPS36, DcTPS35, DcTPS63, DcTPS64, DcTPS07, and  DcTPS34) all encoding putative sesquiterpene synthases (TPS-a subfamily). The second-largest cluster on chromosome 4 (with the 5 genes  DcTPS26, DcTPS04, DcTPS54, DcTPS55, and  DcTPS27) contains only mono-TPS genes, and the cluster on chromosome 3 ( DcTPS51, DcTPS05, DcTPS12, DcTPS18) contains also 4 TPS-b genes. The similarity of the sequences of clustered genes is also reflected by their positions in the phylogenetic tree (Figure  2) and suggests the occurrence of multiple gene duplications. Candidate gene analysis Chromosomal start and end positions of the QTL intervals were utilized to compare the QTL regions detected via GWAS in the first subsection with the chromosomal position of TPS candidate genes described in the previous subsection. In total, only 4 out of 30 QTL regions comprise TPS candidate genes. In roots, 6 TPS candidate genes are located in 3 QTL regions, whereas 1 TPS candidate gene is located in 1 QTL region in leaves (Table  4). The number of TPS candidate genes per QTL regions varies between 1 and 5.  QTL_r_SABI_4.1 and  QTL_r_TERPol_4 are located in the same chromosomal region and therefore associated with the same TPS candidate gene cluster ( DcTPS04, DcTPS26, DcTPS27, DcTPS54, and  DcTPS55) on chromosome 4. The example of sabinene (SABI) illustrates that it was possible to identify QTL regions which are associated with TPS candidate genes ( QTL_r_SABI_4.1) as well as QTL regions which carry no TPS candidate genes ( QTL_r_SABI_4.2, QTL_r_SABI_7) (Figure  4). Hence, Dcarota v2.0 gene annotation (Iorizzo et al.,  2016) and the homology-based reannotation (cf. Methods, Supplementary Material  1) were scanned for all genes located within the QTL regions (Supplementary Table  8). Based on this analysis each QTL region comprises at least 9 genes. Focusing on the cytochrome P450 gene family, which is known to modify terpenes, the genes located within the QTL regions were filtered yielding between 0 and 13 cytochrome P450 genes per QTL region (Supplementary Table  8). In total, 14 (Dcarota v2.0 gene annotation) or 13 (homology-based reannotation) out of 30 QTL regions comprise TPS or cytochrome P450 candidate genes, respectively. To verify predicted gene models and to examine the putative roles of carrot TPS genes in terpene volatile production, we investigated the expression patterns in leaves and roots of three differently colored cultivars. For this approach, specific PCR primers were developed based on the CDS of seven TPS gene models which have been associated by GWAS to QTL regions (Table  4) and for 5 additionally selected TPS candidate genes representing subfamilies TPS-a ( DcTPS11, DcTPS38), TPS-b ( DcTPS05, DcTPS12) and TPS-g ( DcTPS60). As reference genes for semiquantitative RT-PCR, β -actin and  elongation factor 1α ( EF1α) were used. The totally 12 DcTPS genes were amplified by RT-PCR and studied for differential expression (Supplementary Figure  4). Sequencing of the PCR main products (with the expected fragment size) confirmed the amplification of the right TPS gene (not shown).  DcTPS04, DcTPS05, and  DcTPS11 seemed to be strongly transcribed in all tested samples. This is in accordance with the expression data, where especially  DcTPS04 and  DcTPS11 showed strong expression in most RNA-seq samples (see Supplementary Table  2). For some genes, such as for instance  DcTPS03 or  DcTPS38 we found some indications, that root tissues have a stronger transcriptional activity than leaves. Interestingly,  DcTPS03 has shown a strong expression in a single transcriptome only (stressed root, Supplementary Table  2) suggesting that this gene might be involved in inducible responses such as resistance to abiotic or biotic stress, but might be stronger expressed due to the general stress induced by the harvest process. TPS genes that were exclusively expressed in leaves or roots were not found. Differences among the cultivars were also less expressed although roots of cv. Blanche showed slightly stronger expression in some genes ( DcTPS27, DcTPS38). In some cases no transcriptional activity was observed, even after repetition, in a single sample, as for instance for the genes  DcTPS54 (Rotin, leaves) or  DcTPS55 (Rotin, roots).","Terpenes are an important group of secondary metabolites in carrots influencing taste and flavor, and some of them might also play a role as bioactive substances with an impact on human physiology and health. Understanding the genetic and molecular basis of terpene synthases (TPS) involved in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids will provide insights for improving breeding strategies aimed at quality traits and for developing specific carrot chemotypes possibly useful for pharmaceutical applications. Hence, a combination of terpene metabolite profiling, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), and genome-wide association study (GWAS) was used in this work to get insights into the genetic control of terpene biosynthesis in carrots and to identify several TPS candidate genes that might be involved in the production of specific monoterpenes. In a panel of 85 carrot cultivars and accessions, metabolite profiling was used to identify 31 terpenoid volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in carrot leaves and roots, and a GBS approach was used to provide dense genome-wide marker coverage (>168,000 SNPs). Based on this data, a total of 30 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) was identified for 15 terpenoid volatiles. Most QTLs were detected for the monoterpene compounds ocimene, sabinene, β-pinene, borneol and bornyl acetate. We identified four genomic regions on three different carrot chromosomes by GWAS which are both associated with high significance (LOD ≥ 5.91) to distinct monoterpenes and to TPS candidate genes, which have been identified by homology-based gene prediction utilizing RNA-seq data. In total, 65 TPS candidate gene models in carrot were identified and assigned to known plant TPS subfamilies with the exception of TPS-d and TPS-h. TPS-b was identified as largest subfamily with 32 TPS candidate genes.","['Daucus carota', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'GC-MS', 'Monoterpenes', 'Genome-wide Association Study (Gwas)', 'Genotyping-by-sequencing (Gbs)', 'Homology-based Gene Prediction', 'Terpene Synthase (Tps) Gene']","['Supplementary Table', 'TPS genes', 'TPS', 'TPS candidate', 'Table', 'genes', 'QTL regions', 'TPS gene', 'QTL', 'Supplementary']","[terpene-derivatives, 2,542.79, 6,232.39, β-caryophyllene, 982.35, β-caryophyllene (Ulrich et al., 281,394, 168,663, 9, ≥, QTL_r_BORNAc_5.1, QTL_r_BORN_5.1, QTL_r_BORNAc_5.2, QTL_r_BORN_5.2, BORNAc, GeMoMa, GeMoMa, RNA-seq, ≥, DcTPS01, DcTPS02, DcTPS29, RNA-seq, DcTPS21, DcTPS51, DcTPS01, DcTPS02, Yahyaa, ESTs, Yahyaa, DcTPS05, DcTPS06, DcTPS07 (, TPS-e, TPS-h, DcTPS, Külheim, TPS-e, TPS-f, Külheim, Mg 2+ -binding DDXXD, 540–560 amino acids, TPS-e, 12–15, TPS-b, TPs-b, TPS-g, DcTPS57, TPS-e (, DcTPS28, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, ent-kaurene synthase, gibberellin), nerolidol-geranyl linalool, TPS-b2, TPS-b2, Külheim, chromosome 9, DcTPS35, DcTPS63, DcTPS64, DcTPS07, DcTPS04, DcTPS54, DcTPS55, DcTPS05, DcTPS12, DcTPS18, DcTPS04, DcTPS26, DcTPS27, DcTPS54, QTL_r_SABI_4.2, Dcarota v2.0, cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450, DcTPS11, DcTPS38, TPS-b ( DcTPS05, DcTPS12, DcTPS60, β -actin, factor 1α, DcTPS05, RNA-seq]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS01,', 'DcTPS02,', 'DcTPS29).', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS28', 'DcTPS03,', 'DcTPS21,', 'DcTPS37', 'DcTPS11', 'TPS', 'DcTPS51', 'DcTPS64)', 'TPS', 'DcTPS1', 'DcTPS01),', 'DcTPS2', 'DcTPS02)', 'DcTPS03,', 'DcTPS05,', 'DcTPS06,', 'DcTPS07', 'TPS', 'DcTPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS-e,', 'TPS', 'DcTPS29)', 'TPS-f.', 'TPS-d', 'TPS-h,', 'DcTPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS-e', 'TPS-f,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g)', '(TPS-a)', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS-e', 'TPS-f', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPSs', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-c', 'TPS', 'DcTPS64).', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-c', 'DcTPS25,', 'DcTPS57,', 'DcTPS59)', 'TPS-e', 'DcTPS28,', 'DcTPS56)', 'TPS-f', 'DcTPS29', 'DcTPS16', 'TPSs', 'TPS-b2', 'TPS-b2', 'DcTPS16', 'TPSs', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'DcTPS16)', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS01).', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS36,', 'DcTPS35,', 'DcTPS63,', 'DcTPS64,', 'DcTPS07,', 'DcTPS34)', '(TPS-a', 'DcTPS26,', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS54,', 'DcTPS55,', 'DcTPS27)', 'mono-TPS', 'DcTPS51,', 'DcTPS05,', 'DcTPS12,', 'DcTPS18)', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS26,', 'DcTPS27,', 'DcTPS54,', 'DcTPS55)', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'DcTPS11,', 'DcTPS38),', 'TPS-b', 'DcTPS05,', 'DcTPS12)', 'TPS-g', 'DcTPS60).', 'DcTPS', 'TPS', 'DcTPS04,', 'DcTPS05,', 'DcTPS11', 'DcTPS04', 'DcTPS11', 'DcTPS03', 'DcTPS38', 'DcTPS03', 'TPS', 'DcTPS27,', 'DcTPS38).', 'DcTPS54', 'DcTPS55']",['SPME-GC.'],[],terpene synthase
59,59,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5726760\eupmc_result.json,PMC5726760,"Results and discussion Identification of differentially expressed genes Around 44 million clean reads were obtained from infected and control plants and mapped to  Citrus sinensis genome [ 27], with approximately 62% success for  C.  hystrix, and 77%-78% for  C.  sinensis libraries ( S2 Table). Dramatic differences between the transcriptome profiles of  C.  hystrix and  C.  sinensis were observed in response to  CLas infection. Overall, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was greater in susceptible sweet orange than in tolerant kaffir lime when compared to their respective healthy control. Among these DEGs, 179 genes were up-regulated and 73 were down-regulated in  C.  hystrix, while 254 genes were up-regulated and 350 were down-regulated in  C.  sinensis ( Fig 1). Due to the differences in genetic background between the two citrus cultivars, the DEG number of infected/healthy  C.  hystrix in relation to infected/healthy  C.  sinensis was much greater than the number of the two infected cultivars in relation to their mock-inoculated healthy controls ( Fig 1). Gene ontology classification of DEGs The DEGs were enriched into different function categories through Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis ( Fig 2). Significantly enriched GO terms were extracted using TopGO [ 28]. For DEGs in HLB tolerant  C.  hystrix, the most significantly enriched GO terms in biological process were related to ‘threonine metabolic process’ (GO:0006566), ‘negative regulation of peptidase activity’ (GO:0010466), ‘regulation of proteolysis’ (GO:0045861), and ‘regulation of peptidase activity’ (GO:0052547). The most significant GO terms in molecular function included ‘terpene synthase activity’ (GO: 0010333), and ‘carbon-oxygen lyase activity, acting on phosphates’ (GO:0016838). No GO term in cellular component was enriched in DEGs in  C.  hystrix ( S2 Table). For DEGs in susceptible  C.  sinensis, only two GO terms in biological process, ‘reactive oxygen species metabolic process’ (GO: 0072593) and ‘cellular protein complex assembly’ (GO: 0043623) were enriched. The most significant GO terms in molecular function were related to ‘transferase activity’ (GO: 0016758), ‘cellulose synthase activity’ (GO: 0016759), and ‘glucuronosyltransferase activity’ (GO: 0015020). Only three GO terms in cellular component were enriched in DEGs in  C.  sinensis and the most significant one was ‘external encapsulating structure’ (GO: 0030312) ( S3 Table). DEGs within two infected cultivars were mainly enriched in nine biological process GO terms, including ‘drug transport’ (GO: 0015893), ‘response to drug’ (GO: 0042493) and ‘response to chemical’ (GO:0042221). Besides, nine molecular function GO terms were enriched, such as ‘catalytic activity’ (GO: 0003824), ‘oxidoreductase activity’ (GO: 0016491), ‘transferase activity’ (GO: 0016758, GO: 0016757), whereas only one cellular component GO term, ‘intrinsic component of membrane’ (GO: 0031224), was enriched in DEGs in the two cultivars in response to  CLas ( S4 Table). Gene pathway enrichment analysis of  CLas-modulated host pathways PageMan analysis showed that only three pathways significantly enriched were associated with the DEGs identified in  C.  hystrix ( Fig 3). Pathways related to major carbohydrates (CHO) metabolism was up-regulated, while pathways related to posttranslational modification and LRR XII receptor kinases were down-regulated in tolerant citrus plants. Instead, much more pathways were significantly enriched in  C.  sinensis ( Fig 3). The up-regulated pathways were starch synthesis, cell wall degradation, stress biotic, regulation of transcription, receptor kinases signaling, and metal transport in susceptible citrus plants. The down-regulated pathways included cellulose synthesis, hemicellulose synthesis, invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor family protein, GDSL motif lipase, and aspartate protease mediated protein degradation. MapMan software was applied to display and analyze the functional classes those were significantly different in  CLas-affected  C.  hystrix and  C.  sinensis. The results showed that DEGs were mainly involved in diverse cellular functions including carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, secondary metabolism, hormone metabolism, PR proteins and oxidation/reduction processes (Figs  4 and  5,  S5 Table). Carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis process Cytopathology in different stage of HLB infection revealed swelling of the middle lamella between cell walls surrounding sieve elements in non-symptomatic citrus new flushes at the early infection stage and then necrosis of sieve elements and companion cells and phloem plugging by the callose-like material and excessive starch at the later infection stage [ 29– 31]. It suggests that the disturbance of starch metabolism and the inhibition of the transport of photosynthate may contribute to HLB development in citrus hosts. Microarray or RNA-seq analysis also proved that carbohydrate metabolic process was significantly changed and photosynthesis was repressed in HLB-affected citrus [ 15,  17,  18,  30,  32]. From these studies, the key starch synthesis genes were generally up-regulated and the starch degrading genes were down-regulated in affected susceptible citrus. Recently, proteomic analysis suggested no clear correlation was observed from starch pathway regulation between moderately tolerant cultivar ‘Volkameriana’ and susceptible navel orange [ 33]. In this study, several genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were regulated in the early stage of infection with  CLas ( Fig 4,  S5 Table). The starch synthesis was induced while the starch degradation was depressed in  C.  sinensis. Two glycogen synthase (starch synthase,  glgA) geneswere significantly up-regulated, whereas beta-amylase ( BAM) gene was down-regulated in  C.  sinensis ( Fig 4,  S5 Table). However, the expression levels of these genes were not significantly changed in  CLas-affected  C.  hystrix. Instead, one gene encoding alpha-amylase ( AAM), associated with starch degradation, was slightly up-regulated in  C.  hystrix ( Fig 4,  S5 Table). Genes encoding light-harvesting complex II chlorophyll a/b binding protein 1, Photosystem II psbP domain-containing protein 1 and photosystem I subunit O, which involved in light action of photosynthesis, were all down-regulated in  C.  sinensis ( Fig 4,  S5 Table). The three genes were not significantly changed in  C.  hystrix, suggesting the photosynthesis process may not be depressed in tolerant  C.  hystrix. Taken together these findings showed that the repression of key proteins involved in photosynthetic light reactions and up-regulation of starch-related pathways in  C.  sinensis was in agreement with previous studies. Notably, no significant change in starch synthesis and photosynthesis process may play important roles in tolerance of  C.  hystrix. Anatomical evidences from different infection stage of kaffir limeare required to prove the transcriptome data. Genes involved in cell wall and cell organization The plant cell wall is comparable to an exoskeleton surrounding the plant cell and providing both structural support and protection from biotic as well as abiotic stresses [ 34]. It is well established that the plant susceptibility to pathogens depends on the cell wall composition and structure, which determines its recalcitrance to degradation by cell wall modifying enzymes (CWMEs) produced by pathogens [ 35]. Plant cell walls are composed of layers of cellulose microfibers embedded in a matrix of pectin and hemicellulose, plus some structural proteins [ 36– 38]. There were 44 and 13 genes found related to cell wall metabolism among the DEGs in HLB-susceptible and tolerant cultivars, respectively ( Fig 5,  S5 Table). Overall, most genes involved in cellulose synthesis, cell wall proteins and cell wall modification were depressed in diseased  C.  sinensis. For instance, several genes encoding expansin, which are related to cell wall breakdown, including EXLA1, EXPA5 and EXLB1, were down-regulated in  C.  sinensis, and EXLA1 was also down-regulated in  C.  hystrix. Expansin related genes were reported to exhibit high expressions in susceptible ‘Marsh’ grapefruit [ 19]. Down-regulation of these genes in both  C.  hystrix and  C.  sinensis indicates a host defense response to  CLas infection. A group of genes encoding xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase proteins (XTH22, XTH23), associated with cell wall degradation, were slightly up-expressed in  CLas-affected  C.  sinensis, whereas no significant difference was observed in  CLas-affected  C.  hystrix. Furthermore, DEGs involved in cellulose synthesis, such as cellulose synthase A (CESA), cellulose synthase-like protein A2 (CSLA2), cellulose synthase-like protein A9 (CSLA9) and cellulose synthase-like protein C5 (CSLC5) were all down-regulated in  CLas-affected  C.  sinensis, while CSLA2 and CSLA9 were up-regulated in  CLas-affected  C.  hystrix. Thus, kaffir lime responded to  CLas by activating enzymes that would work together to strengthen the cell wall, which may contribute to the reinforcement of physical barriers to restrict the invasion of  CLas. Secondary metabolism Secondary metabolism plays important roles in plant defenses. Previous studies revealed that most genes involved in secondary metabolites, including terpenoid, flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathways, were highly induced in  CLas-affected leaves [ 15,  17,  19,  39], whereas most of these genes were down-regulated in roots following HLB infection [ 16]. Here, most DEGs involved in secondary metabolism pathway were activated in  C.  hystrix, but were suppressed in  C.  sinensis. These DEGs were categorized into the biological processes of terpene biosynthesis, flavonoids biosynthesis and phenylpropanoids biosynthesis ( Fig 5,  S5 Table). Terpenoids are a structurally diverse group of natural products, which function as plant antioxidants, insect attractants or repellents [ 40,  41]. Flavonoids are anti-fungi substances and antioxidants [ 42]. Phenylpropanoids serve as structural polymers including lignins, provide protection from pests and UV light and attract pollinators as pigments [ 43]. Two genes encoding germacrene D synthase-like (GDSL) were up-regulated in both two cultivars in response to  CLas infection. Two genes encoding gamma-terpinene synthase (TPS2) were only up-regulated in HLB tolerant citrus trees. The expression level of one gene encoding (R)-limonene synthase 1 was increased in  C.  hystrix, while the other two genes related to this enzyme were suppressed in  C.  sinensis. GDSL, TPS2 and (R)-limonene synthase were involved in terpene biosynthesis. One gene encoding 2-oxoglutarate and Fe (II)-dependent (2OG-Fe (II)) oxygenases, which is associated with flavonoids biosynthesis, was strongly up-regulated in  C.  hystrix, whereas it was down-regulated in  C.  sinensis. Genes involved in phenylpropanoids biosynthesis such as isoflavone reductase (IRL) and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1 (CCR), were induced in  C.  hystrix, while phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and 4-coumarate—CoA ligase 1 (4CL1), which also play an important role in phenylpropanoids biosynthesis, were suppressed in  C.  sinensis. The tolerant cultivars contain relatively higher specific volatile compounds such as monoterpenes and aldehydes than susceptible cultivars [ 44]. It should be noted that Kaffir lime leaves contain various classes of phytochemical substances including terpenoids and polyphenolic which are known for their antimicrobial activities [ 7,  8]. The up-regulation of genes involved in secondary metabolism pathways, and high phytochemical substances containing in kaffir lime leaves may contribute to its tolerance to  CLas. Hormone metabolism Phytohormones play critical roles in helping the plants to adapt to adverse environmental conditions. The elaborate hormone signaling networks and their ability of crosstalk make them ideal candidates for mediating defense responses [ 45]. There were 35 hormone signaling genes in identified DEGs ( Fig 5,  S5 Table). Auxin was found to promote the expression of expansins in plants [ 46– 48], which contribute to breakage of plant cell walls. Of the seven auxin-related genes, three genes related to crocetin glucosyltransferase were up-regulated in  C.  hystrix, two auxin-responsive proteins, SAUR72 and IAA1, were down-regulated in  C. sinensis. SAUR was proved to act as a negative regulator of auxin synthesis in rice and may promote resistance to pathogens [ 49]. Transcription analysis showed that three SAUR-like genes were up-expressed in HLB tolerant ‘Jackson’ grapefruit, which may also contribute to the down expression of expansin [ 19]. A gene encoding the senescence-related gene (SRG1), involved in ethylene metabolism, was highly induced in response to  CLas in  C.  hystrix. The expression of ethylene-responsive transcription factor ERF07 was up-regulated in both cultivars, while ERF107 was down-regulated. Ethylene-responsive transcription factor and EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 were only up-regulated in  C.  sinensis. Notably, five genes involved in salicylic acid metabolism were suppressed in  C.  sinensis but not in  C.  hystrix. JA levels in response to pathogen infection clearly highlight its involvement in plant defense responses. The key enzyme involved in jasmonate synthesis, lipoxygenase 2 (LOX2) [ 50], were up-regulated in both cultivars. JA-responsive gene expression for defense response is mainly mediated by a transcription factor JASMONATE INSENSITIVE 1/MYC2 (JIN1/MYC2) [ 51]. Up-regulation of transcription factor MYC2 was only observed in  C.  hystrix. These results showed that JA signal transduction may be activated by infection with  CLas, especially in  C.  hystrix. Pathogenesis-related (PR) genes The pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins of plants are a group of host-encoded, inducible proteins whose synthesis is often associated with certain forms of resistance to pathogens and stresses [ 52]. Previous studies showed that most genes related to PR-proteins were induced by  CLas infection, including receptor-like protein kinase, TIR-NBS-LRR (Toll interleukin-1 receptor nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat) class and NB-ARC (nucleotide binding-adaptor shared by APAF-1, certain R gene products and CED4) domain proteins, and Kunitz family trypsin and protease inhibitor protein [ 11,  18,  32,  39]. In this work, more genes related to PR genes were induced in  C.  sinensis than in  C.  hystrix ( Fig 5,  S5 Table). Several genes related to kinases involved in biotic stress, including LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase GSO1, LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase ERL2, LRR receptor-like protein kinase At1g35710, and receptor-like protein 12, were slightly up-expressed in  C.  sinensis. A gene encoding leucine-rich repeat receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase (At2g24130) was up-regulated more than 8-fold in  C.  hystrix, but showed no significant difference in  C.  sinensis. Notably, two genes encoding miraculin, a Kunitz family trypsin and protease inhibitor protein which are associated with plant defenses, were only up-regulated in  C.  hystrix ( S5 Table). In addition, some genes related to disease resistance proteins, such as RPS4 and RPM1, exhibited higher expression level in  C.  hystrix. RPS4 and RPM1 act as R genes to participate in the effector-triggered immunity (ETI) process, which play an important role in plant defense response [ 53,  54]. Oxidation/Reduction processes 14 genes involved in oxidation/reduction processes were differentially regulated between the HLB-susceptible and tolerant cultivars. It should be noted that most of them were up-regulated in tolerant  C.  hystrix and down-regulated in  C.  sinensis. Up-regulation of several glutaredoxin genes such as GRXC6, GRXC9 and GRXS9, were only identified in  C.  hystrix. These proteins have activity of glutathione-disulfide bond oxidordeuctase, which can reduce the amount of micromolecular disulfide and proteins. A gene encoding thioredoxin M3, a thiol-disulfide bond oxidordeuctase which required for maintaining permeability of plant meristem and regulation of callose deposition in  Arabidopsis, was inhibited in  C.  sinensis. Besides, a group of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) genes were differentially expressed in both cultivars. Of them, Cu/Zn-SOD and POD4 were up-regulated in  C.  hystrix, whereas they were down-regulated in  C.  sinensis ( S5 Table). Proteins involved in oxidation/reduction processes, including peroxidases and glutathione-S-transferases, are usually associated with the prevention of oxidative stress, which are induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Proteomic studies revealed that a higher activation of glutathione-S-transferases, which include several isozymes that help detoxify xenobiotic compounds, was observed in tolerant cultivar ‘Volkameriana’ [ 33]. Therefore, activation of peroxidases, Cu/Zn-SOD and POD4, may also enhance the tolerance of  C.  hystrix to  CLas. RT-qPCR validation To validate the accuracy of the RNA-seq data, 16 genes classified in different function groups were tested by RT-qPCR. The expression profiles of 15 genes were consistent with the RNA-seq data, demonstrating the reliability of RNA-seq analysis. The RT-qPCR result of LHCb, encoding light-harvesting complex II chlorophyll a/b binding protein 1, did not agree with those obtained from the RNA-seq in  C.  hystrix. In addition, several genes showed no difference in RNA-seq data, but differentially expressed by RT-qPCR analysis. For example, glgA and XTH23 showed lower expression levels, PAL and RGA3 showed higher expression levels in  CLas-infected  C.  hystrix based on qRT-PCR analysis ( Fig 6).","Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), a highly devastating citrus disease, is associated with 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiacitus' (CLas), a member of phloem-inhabiting α-proteobacteria. HLB can affect all cultivated citrus and no cure is currently available. Previous studies showed that Kaffir lime (Citrus hystrix), primarily grown in South Asia and Southeast Asia, was tolerant to HLB but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study, gene expression profiling experiments were performed on HLB-tolerant C. hystrix and HLB-susceptible C. sinensis three months after inoculation with CLas using RNA-seq data. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the two citrus cultivars were mainly involved in diverse cellular functions including carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, secondary metabolism, hormone metabolism and oxidation/reduction processes. Notably, starch synthesis and photosynthesis process were not disturbed in CLas-infected C. hystrix. Most of the DEGs involved in cell wall metabolism and secondary metabolism were up-regulated in C. hystrix.

60,60,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5761147\eupmc_result.json,PMC5761147,"Results Annotated terpenome data The curated terpenome data was compiled as described in methods, involving retrieval of sequences from the NCBI Protein Database via keyword specific search for prenyl transferases (PTs) as well as all TPS functional classes (mono-, di- and sesqui-TPSs) as well as the sequence homology based gene-family classes, namely TPSa to TPSg [ 19]. The function-based (FB dataset) consisted of 401 representatives sequences, including 154 monoterpene synthases, 71 diterpene synthases and 176 sesquiterpene synthases, as shown in Table  1. These sequences represent diverse taxonomic classes of green plants, including land plants, which further include seed plants, with the exception of chlorophytes. For prenyl transferases, a total of 301 PT sequences were compiled as shown in the last column of Table  1, and this data was called the PT dataset. Mosses have not been reported to have any prenyl transferases at all. Additional file  1: Table 1 provides a detailed list of accession IDs for each sequence used in the FB and PT datasets. The gene-family based GB dataset was also compiled as described in methods and Table  2 shows the 326 sequences retrieved for this dataset. A detailed list of accession IDs for each sequence, along with species and sub-class information has been provided in Additional file  2: Table 2. As can be seen in Table  2, this dataset contains 113 TPSa, 49 TPSb, 35 TPSc, 48 TPSd, 50 TPSe_f and 31 TPSg sequences, mainly present in seed plants. No TPS has been annotated to date in chlorophytes. Lower plants like ferns and mosses also have very few PTs or TPSs. Similarly, genomes of ancient land plants like the magnoliales also appear to lack PTs or TPSs as per their current annotations. As expected, only gymnosperm sequences are present in the TPSd subfamily, known to be specific to this clade. In all, the FB, GB and the PT datasets consist of 116, 74 and 112 species respectively, the majority being monocots or dicots.  Profile hidden Markov models and predictive accuracy Profile HMMs were built for the prenyl transferase family and all 12 classes of TPS subfamilies, as described in methods. For TPSs, analysis was divided into two parts, function based analysis and gene family based analysis. In function-based analysis the input sequence is classified into a monoterpene, diterpene or sesquiterpene synthase using the six profile HMMs specific to function based (FB) dataset. In gene family based (GB) analysis, the test sequence is assigned to one of the six gene families described earlier from TPSa to g, with HMMs being generated from the GB dataset. In order to test the predictive accuracy of the program, benchmarking was done as described in methods, and this revealed a sensitivity of 100% in all cases, albeit with a relatively low accuracy range of 51–61%. This indicates that although each individual sub-family search profile is able to successfully identify true positives, the twelve HMMs also have a tendency towards false positives, i.e. acquisition of TPS sequences from other sub-families. The high rate of false positives severely affects sub-family annotation towards prediction of substrate specificity and may be ascribed to the strong homology between various TPS sub-classes, both at sequence and structural levels. Table  3 provides a sense of this overlap through an inter-family sequence and structural fold comparison. The various TPS sub-family representatives used for structural superimposition included the 1,8-cineole synthase from  Salvia fruticosa for Monoterpene synthases (PDBID 25JC), the Taxadiene synthase from Pacific yew for Di-TPSs (PDB ID 3P5P) and the 5-epi aristolochene synthase from  Nicotiana tabacum (PDBID 3M00) representing sesqui-TPSs. As a result, correct annotation and classification of newly identified TPSs becomes a significant challenge in view of conservation between the different TPS superfamilies. In order to overcome this challenge posed by high false positives without losing out the perfect sensitivity achieved by each sub-family profile, we developed a pipeline wherein all twelve profile HMMs would be allowed to scan a new sequence in parallel. We then based the final sub-family assignment on the premise that high sensitivity of the true sub-family profile would overshadow the false positive scores of the remaining eleven non-self HMMs. In this manner, even though a given test sequence may be identified by multiple sub-family HMMs, the highest scoring hit would still remain the true sub-family profile. In order to test the veracity of our selection premise, all 12 HMMs were combined into a pipeline for scanning the test set dataset, followed by sorting based on highest score obtained by each sub-family profile. As expected, benchmarking of the program in this manner significantly enhanced the accuracy of the search algorithm as can be seen in Table  4. This table shows the results of predictive performance of HMMs calculated using the statistical concepts of sensitivity and accuracy as discussed in methodology section, before and after the parallel-scan strategy. As can be seen from Table  4, the final accuracy of the search algorithm increases to 100% for a majority of sub-families, with the exception of dicot-specific profiles for Mono- and Sesqui-TPSs, both of which show accuracy above 85%.  Encouraged by the superior predictive power of the search algorithm, we proceeded to assess its performance in context with other online web resources. To our knowledge, there is no search tool specific to any category of phytochemicals, but we expected the global annotation databases, (such as Pfam, PANTHER and Interpro) to be able to identify terpene synthase family, and therefore adequate for a comparative performance test. However, we found that none of the currently existing programs could classify TPSs either based on their function i.e. into monoterpene, diterpene or sesquiterpene synthases, nor on the basis of gene family (TPSa-TPSe/f). The Terzyme hidden markov models, in contrast, achieve taxon-based distinction between identified TPSs. One reason for the failure of general annotation databases may be that available programs like Pfam identify TPSs by detecting either the N-terminal domain naming them as Terpene_synth (PF01397) or the metal binding domain designating it as Terpene_synth_C (PF03936) or both. Similarly PANTHER detects N-terminal domain designating it as PTHR31376, other Terpenoid synthase as PTHR31225, PTHR11439 or PTHR31739. Interpro also detects Terpenoid synthase, N terminal domain as IPR001906 and C-terminal metal binding domain as Terpene_synth_C (IPR005630). Hence, from a predictive viewpoint, it can be inferred that our search algorithm performs better than existing programs for TPS gene family identification in the plant kingdom. Novel terpenome identification Encouraged by this superior accuracy of prediction, we automated the TPS and PT search pipeline to design and develop the Terzyme interactive online server, available freely without any login requirement at  www.nipgr.res.in/terzyme.html. Figure  1 shows the query submission protocol of Terzyme. It has been configured to accept multiple fasta sequences to search for TPSs, and does not require download on local machines for processing. The Terzyme HMM pipeline was used to search for novel TPS and PT gene family members in the entire PSG dataset (containing 1,573,395 protein sequences from 42 plant genomes, as described in Methods), and the resulting identifications have been incorporated into the online web resource for browsing, download and further exploration. Figure  2 shows a few screenshots of the Terzyme prediction server including the browse-able terpenome database. In all, Terzyme identified a total of 3312 unique TPS sequences and 873 unique prenyl transferases. Some of the TPS sequences, as expected, were predicted by both function-based and gene-family based HMMs. These 3312 TPSs and 873 PTs are available for browsing, both by species name and taxonomic class, through the ‘Plant Genome Predictions’ menu of Terzyme website, as shown in panels B of Fig.  2. For each TPS, users can view or download the corresponding sequence in FASTA format, its alignment with the respective sub-family profile HMM, as well as the predicted secondary structure.  A total of 2040 TPSs were identified by the functional class based profile HMMs and these included 613 monoterpene synthases, 468 diterpene synthases and 959 sesquiterpene synthases. Similarly, 2987 TPSs were identified by gene family based profile HMMs which included 1797 TPSa, 432 TPSb, 218 TPSc, 81 TPSd, 270 TPSe_f and 189 TPSg gene family sequences. A complete list of these identifications along with sub-family assignment for each species, including PTs is provided in Tables  5,  6 and  7 respectively. Interestingly, our data shows identification of putative TPSs in three chlorophyte genomes even though none of the profile HMMs were trained on these species. A manual inspection of each sequence shows them to have sufficient length and presence of the requisite TPS motifs. From a functional point of view, all chlorophyte TPSs appear to be Diterpene synthases, the ancient TPS containing family, known previously to consist of both gymnosperm and angiosperm members. A detailed analysis of some of these DiTPSs indicated them to be closely related to Cycloartenol synthase and some were found to contain Squalene cyclase (SQCY) found in class II TPSs. Among bryophytes,  Physcomitrella patens shows only one known bifunctional TPSs with both CPS/KS activity has been reported till date [ 24]. The present analysis reveals the additional presence of at least nine bifunctional TPSs, and we have identified 15 prenyl transferases in the moss genome, suggesting a reasonably large terpenome family with more than 30 members, majority of these being previously unreported diterpene synthases. The gene family profiles assign most of these sequences to the TPSa and TPSc subfamilies. As anticipated, 64 of the 72 putative TPSs identified in the gymnosperm genome ( Picea abies) were assigned to TPSd subfamily, supporting the existing view that gymnosperm TPSs belong to a distinct clade [ 19]. Tables  5 and  6 also depict five gymnosperm TPS sequences representing the most ancient TPSc gene family, with mono/bifunctional CPSs, although we did not observe any bias of representation in case of functional class assignment; all three classes namely monoTPS, diTPS and sesqui-TPS are roughly equally present in this gymnosperm. It may be noted that Terzyme enables a distinction between Class II Copalyl diphosphate synthases (CPS) and the Class-I Kaurene synthases (KSL) also. Under the Plant Genome Predictions Tab, apart from the Diterpene TPS classification, for each genome, Terzyme shows the exact number of matches found for TPSc and TPSe_f classes, both of which represent largely, the CPS and KSL respectively. We believe this is a very useful feature that enables users to breakdown Di-TPS data for detecting better-resolved functional annotations. In general monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases outnumber the diterpene synthases in all seed plant domains. This may be due to the general mono functional activity of the former compared to bifunctional activity of latter enzymes. Terpenes are known to play significant roles defence responses against herbivores by emissions of several volatile blends, and volatile emissions are mainly composed of monoterpenes and sesquiterpene lactones owing to their low molecular weights (C 10 and C 15 respectively). It may also be noted that the identified TPS gene family size increases from lower plants (chlorophytes, bryophytes and pteridophytes) to land plants, suggesting expansion of the family during course of evolution. An average of 30–50 TPS sequences were identified across higher plants, with the maximum number of sequences detected in  Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), along with commercial fruit bearing dicot species like apple, grape and papaya. The Eucalyptus genome also contains over one hundred TPS sequences and it would be interesting to study these TPSs further and characterize their roles in the respective genomes. Present knowledge of completely characterized TPSs is limited to only few plant species and their classification based on functional roles or gene family is still an emerging field. Our data on the other hand opens up a huge repertoire of putative TPSs candidates throughout the plant kingdom, together with their functional, and gene family based classification. For example, the tomato terpenome was recently characterized with about 40 TPS [ 15], whereas our analysis reveals at least 60–100 TPSs in the  S. lycopersicum genome along with more than 20 PTs. In addition, Diterpene TPS classification has been performed based on class I (Aspartate rich motif (DDXXD/E) or Non-aspartate rich consensus motif of ( N, D)D(L,I,V)X( S, T)XXX E also called as ‘NSE/DTE’ motif and class II (DXDD) signature motifs present in the respective sequences. In house perl script were used to scan all the DiTPS annotations to assess the presence of these signature motifs for Class I and Class II TPSs. Accordingly, TERZYME classifies DiTPSs into the following four classes: (1) Class I DiTPS—If either Aspartate rich motif (DDXXD/E) or Non-aspartate rich consensus motif of ( N, D)D(L,I,V)X( S, T)XXX E, (2) Class II Diterpene synthases—If DXDD motif was present, (3) bifunctional—If both Class I and Class II motifs are present and (4) Noncanonical : If none are present. Details can be seen in Table  8. The presence of these sub-classes in available plants can also be assessed on the Terzyme database under the Plant Genomes Predictions tab. These examples reflect how a rigorous scientific pursuit can lead to new annotations and gene discovery for previously unknown, and even well-known families of conserved sequences.  Gene ontology analysis for the newly identified TPS genes was carried out in order to further validate our predictions for the plant kingdom, as well as to improve the resolution of functional role prediction, in terms of molecular function or subcellular localization. As described in methods, a total of 2040 TPSs were subjected to ontological analysis and as anticipated, the novel TPSs were found to be enriched in biological process terms like ‘response to stress’, ‘lipid metabolic pathway’ and ‘secondary metabolic process’. More than 900 TPSs were found to be enriched for primary metabolism, although this class of genes is mostly known for secondary/ specialized metabolism. An assessment of these TPSs revealed that they belong to the mono/bifunctional CPS of TPSc and highly divergent TPSe_f gene families. Among molecular function categories, highest enrichment was found for terpene synthase activity, catalytic activity and magnesium ion binding activity, as expected, but in few cases, the GO terms were able to resolve the exact catalytic function for a given TPSs, as in case of hydrolases (37 cases), transferases (65 cases) or protein binding activities. In eight cases, nucleic acid binding was found to be an enriched term and we looked at these cases in more detail in order to understand how TPSs may bind to DNA/RNA to carry out their function. It was interesting to note that nucleic acid binding term was found mainly in case of sesquiterpene synthases in response towards oxidative stress. It may be noted that some TPS genes have previously been known to show single-stranded DNA endo-deoxyribonuclease activity or DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity, and take part in double strand break repair via homologues recombination. Thus, the present eight cases may form part of purine or pyrimidine nucleobase metabolic process. In the sub-cellular compartmentalization category, a majority of mono- and di-TPSs were found to be localized in plastids, as expected, since these are synthesized by the methyl erythritol (MEP) pathway, which is plastidial in nature. In contrast, the sesquiterpene synthases were predominantly found to be located in cytoplasm, the site of occurrence of the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway that is known to synthesize sesquiterpene and triterpenes. 134 cases did not follow the expected localization trend, wherein a sesqui-TPS was localized to the plastid and, conversely a mono- or di-TPS was predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm, supporting the notion of crosstalk that has been previously hypothesized between MVA and MEP pathways [ 7]. In summary, the GO analysis further supports Terzyme predictions and the huge repertoire of new TPSs thus identified provides an opportunity for further functional characterization. Further analyses, as presented in the next section were performed to shed light on the roles and identities of these new TPSs. Analysis of the plant terpenome The newly identified TPS sequences were subjected to clustering, genome wide mapping and KEGG pathway analysis for understanding their evolution and also for assignment of substrate specificity, as described in Methods. Following GO assignment, the sequences with GO annotations were subjected to EC (Enzyme code) mapping and novel TPSs were mapped onto KEGG pathways, in order to assign putative catalytic roles. In this manner, 539 TPSs were assigned to specific enzymatic categories as shown in Table  9. These included 140 monoterpene synthases, 311 diterpene synthases and 88 sesquiterpene synthases. As can be seen from this table, ent-kaurene synthases were found in the highest number, followed by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthases, both DiTPSs. One each of bornyl-diphosphate synthase, levopimaradiene synthase and germacrene A synthase were predicted, these three representing one each of a MonoTPS, DiTPS and SesquiTPS respectively. Detailed information on accession IDs and substrate preferences for each of these 539 putative TPS sequences is provided in Additional file  3: Table 3. The IGMAP tool [ 25] was used for clustering the TPSs mapped to 19 plant genomes. Figure  3 depicts the genome-wide terpenome maps for selected monocots and a unicellular green alga, while Fig.  4 depicts the corresponding maps for selected dicotyledonous species. TPSs in both taxa can be observed in clusters often as large as 15 genes, with a tendency to be located towards the centromeres, as in case of rice and Arabidopsis, or towards the edges of the chromosomes, as in sorghum, maize, Brachypodium and most dicots. In  Zea mays, TPS clusters map both towards center and towards the end of chromosomes. Statistical tests reinforced the trend observed in the map images, viz., a significant number of sequences representing TPS genes are located in clusters within the genomes analyzed, based on an unranked independent samples  T-test at the 99% confidence level ( P value = 5.52E−08). Clustering data is presented in Table  10, it shows positive correlation bewteen TPS gene family size and the corresponding number of gene clusters. ","Background:Terpenoid hydrocarbons represent the largest and most ancient group of phytochemicals, such that the entire chemical library of a plant is often referred to as its 'terpenome'. Besides having numerous pharmacological properties, terpenes contribute to the scent of the rose, the flavors of cinnamon and the yellow of sunflowers. Rapidly increasing -omics datasets provide an unprecedented opportunity for terpenome detection, paving the way for automated web resources dedicated to phytochemical predictions in genomic data. Results:We have developed Terzyme, a predictive algorithm for identification, classification and assignment of broad substrate unit to terpene synthase (TPS) and prenyl transferase (PT) enzymes, known to generate the enormous structural and functional diversity of terpenoid compounds across the plant kingdom. Terzyme uses sequence information, plant taxonomy and machine learning methods for predicting TPSs and PTs in genome and proteome datasets. We demonstrate a significant enrichment of the currently identified terpenome by running Terzyme on more than 40 plants. Conclusions:Terzyme is the result of a rigorous analysis of evolutionary relationships between hundreds of characterized sequences of TPSs and PTs with known specificities, followed by analysis of genome-wide gene distribution patterns, ontology based clustering and optimization of various parameters for building accurate profile Hidden Markov Models. The predictive webserver and database is freely available at http://nipgr.res.in/terzyme.html and would serve as a useful tool for deciphering the species-specific phytochemical potential of plant genomes.","['Pathway Mapping', 'Phytochemicals', 'Terpene Synthase (Tps)', 'Hidden Markov Models (Hmm)', 'Terpenome', 'Go Clustering', 'Prenyl Transferase (Pt)']","['TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS sequences', 'gene family', 'sequences', 'synthases', 'Table', 'diterpene synthases', 'TPS gene', 'TPS genes']","[prenyl transferases, sesqui-TPSs, TPSa, prenyl transferases, prenyl transferases, TPSa, TPSb, TPSd, TPSe_f, PTs, PTs, TPSs, TPSd, HMMs, prenyl transferase, HMMs, TPSa, HMMs, HMMs, PDBID 25JC, Di-TPSs (PDB ID 3P5P, PDBID 3M00, sesqui-TPSs, HMMs, HMMs, HMMs, parallel-scan, Sesqui-TPSs, PANTHER, Terzyme, TPSs, Terpene_synth, Terpene_synth_C, PTHR31376, Terpenoid synthase, PTHR31225, PTHR11439, PTHR31739, Terpenoid synthase, N terminal domain, C-terminal metal binding domain, Terpene_synth_C (, Terzyme, Terzyme, Terzyme, 1,573,395, Terzyme, browse-able terpenome, Terzyme, prenyl transferases, ‘, ’, Terzyme, HMMs, HMMs, TPSa, TPSb, TPSd, PTs, HMMs, DiTPSs, Cycloartenol synthase, SQCY, class II TPSs, CPS/KS, prenyl transferases, TPSa, TPSd, mono/bifunctional CPSs, Terzyme, Class II Copalyl diphosphate, CPS, Class-I, Terzyme, TPSe_f, CPS, C, 30–50, class I, V)X, T)XXX E, ‘NSE/DTE, class II, Class I, Class II TPSs, TERZYME, DiTPSs, Class I DiTPS—, Aspartate rich motif (DDXXD/E, Non-aspartate, V)X, T)XXX E, Class II, Class I, Class II, Terzyme, ‘, ’, ’, ‘, ’, mono/bifunctional CPS, TPSe_f, hydrolases (37 cases, single-stranded DNA, sesqui-TPS, Terzyme, DiTPSs, bornyl-diphosphate synthase, germacrene A synthase, MonoTPS, DiTPS, SesquiTPS, IGMAP]","['TPS', 'sesqui-TPSs)', 'TPSa', 'TPSg', 'TPSa,', 'TPSb,', 'TPSc,', 'TPSd,', 'TPSe_f', 'TPSg', 'TPS', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPSd', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPSa', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'Di-TPSs', 'sesqui-TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'Sesqui-TPSs,', 'TPSs', '(TPSa-TPSe/f).', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS,', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSa,', 'TPSb,', 'TPSc,', 'TPSd,', 'TPSe_f', 'TPSg', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'DiTPSs', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPSs,', 'TPSa', 'TPSc', 'TPSs', 'TPSd', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSc', 'monoTPS,', 'diTPS', 'sesqui-TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSc', 'TPSe_f', 'Di-TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'DiTPS', 'TPSs.', 'DiTPSs', 'DiTPS—If', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSc', 'TPSe_f', 'TPSs,', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'di-TPSs', 'sesqui-TPS', 'di-TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs.', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'DiTPSs.', 'MonoTPS,', 'DiTPS', 'SesquiTPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS']",[],[],terpene synthase
64,64,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5802726\eupmc_result.json,PMC5802726,"Results and discussion Isolation of highly purified elaioplasts from kumquat peel with density gradient centrifugations Kumquat, a major citrus cultivar in southern China, bears the smallest fruits in the  Citrus genus. Ripened fruits can be eaten as a whole (Fig.  1a), and elaioplasts with several plastoglobules were frequently found in the outer peel (Fig.  1b). In this study, we initially isolated elaioplasts from the outer peel of kumquat. The recovered pellet containing elaioplasts was separated into four fractions on a discontinuous gradient comprising 0.75, 0.92, 1.20, 1.50 M sucrose (Fig.  2a). The elaioplasts pooled from band 1 were characterized by abundant colorless plastids with several sphere substructures clustering together, and their sizes ranged from 1 to 4 μm as measured under light microscopy and TEM (Fig.  2b, c). Analysis of the other bands indicated they were contaminated by either cell debris with few elaioplasts, or chloroplasts (Supplementary Figure  S1). The purity of the elaioplast-enriched protein fractions was monitored by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against marker proteins for the plastid stroma (RbcL), cytosol (UDPase), vacuole (V-ATPase), and mitochondrion (VDAC1), as well as chloroplast (Lhca1 and Lhca4). As shown in Fig.  3, proteins extracted from the purified elaioplast fraction readily reacted with the antibody of RbcL. By contrast, no reaction could be detected with the cytosolic UGPase, mitochondrial VDAC1, or vacuolar V-ATPase. Additionally, no reaction was detected with antibodies to PSI type I chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (Lhca1 and Lhca4) involved in photosynthesis within the chloroplasts. Reactions with these antibodies were observed in the total proteins extracted from the kumquat peel which contained both chloroplasts and elaioplasts. The above results suggest that the isolated elaioplasts used for the subsequent proteome analysis were of high purity without contamination by mitochondria, cytosol, vacuole, and chloroplasts. An inventory of proteins in elaioplasts by functional classification and subcellular localization We conducted a comprehensive proteomic analysis to characterize the proteins found in elaioplasts. A total of 1239 proteins with at least two detected peptides in two bio-replicates, were identified from purified elaioplasts. The raw data obtained from the elaioplast proteins were refined by searches against five plastid databanks (Plprot, AT-CHLORO, SUBA, PPDB, and Uniprot) and by three targeting predictors (WoLF PSORT, Predotar, and Target P). Based on the chosen criteria for plastid-localized proteins (Materials and Methods), an inventory of 655 putative plastid proteins was constructed, accounting for 52% of all identified proteins (Supplementary Table  S1). Among them, 562 proteins (accounting for 85.8% of these identified proteins) were predicted to be plastid targeted by at least one predictor program. WoLF PSORT, Target P, and Predotar predicted plastid-localization of 76.0% (498 proteins), 38.2% (250 proteins), and 31.9% (209 proteins) of the 655 identified proteins, respectively. Two hundred and twenty-nine proteins (35.0%) were predicted to be plastid targeted by at least two predictors, suggesting that these proteins are highly likely to be plastid localized. As shown in Supplementary Table  S1 and in Fig.  4, the 655 putative elaioplast proteins were categorized into 32 functional classes according to MapMan bins. Major metabolic functions in the citrus elaioplast proteome The identification of proteome profiles allows an overview of proteins involved in various metabolic pathways 8,  24–  28. As shown in Fig.  4, the major metabolic pathways in citrus elaioplasts are protein metabolism and process, transport, secondary metabolism, lipid metabolism, redox and stress, amino acid metabolism, photosynthesis, DNA and RNA, and miscellaneous. Elaioplasts are a type of heterotrophic plastid, wherein all the metabolic precursors are either generated via oxidative metabolism or actively imported from the cytosol to sustain anabolic reactions 29. The proteins of the Calvin cycle are involved in providing intermediates for glycolysis, and proteins of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP) serve as a major source of reducing power for various metabolic pathways. As expected, we identified several proteins involved in the Calvin cycle within elaioplasts, such as fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and transketolase. Furthermore, proteins participated in oxidative metabolism were well presented, including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconolactonase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Of note, transketolase and transaldolase (key enzymes of the non-oxidative part of OPPP), which are reported to feed the processes of anabolism or glycolysis 30, were also identified in the present study. Glycolysis also occurs in plastids to generate ATP and pyruvate in plants 31. Several glycolysis enzymes including aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, and pyruvate kinase were observed. Consistent with previous findings in non-photosynthetic plastids, a substantial number of proteins responsible for the generation of ATP and reducing power were observed 8, indicating their high conservation among different plastid types. Taken together, the observation of many proteins involved in essential biosynthetic activities suggests an active metabolism in elaioplasts to produce reducing power and energy, as well as the supply of precursors for the biosynthesis of metabolites. Several proteins involved in photosynthesis were found in elaioplasts although the presence of chloroplasts was not observed using light microscopy and there was no signal obtained by immunoblotting using two photosynthesis-related antibodies (Fig.  3a). This suggests that these proteins serve roles in processes other than photosynthesis in elaioplasts. It is no surprise to find photosynthetic proteins in elaioplasts, since similar observations have been made in other types of non-photosynthetic plastids, such as chromoplasts 6,  10 and amyloplasts 26. FA are known to be synthesized in plastids 28. We detected several enzymes for the synthesis of FA as well as glycolipids and phospholipids in elaioplasts, such as acetyl E1 beta pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, E2-dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, E3-dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase 1, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 7/8/9, and plastidial ketoacyl-ACP reductase (Supplementary Table  S1). The accumulated FA could be converted into phosphatidic acid and/or imported into plastids via the trigalactosyldiacylglycerol (TDG) complex transporter, which is targeted to the plastid envelope membrane 32. As expected, several key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and homeostasis were detected in elaioplasts, such as TDG2, phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase 1, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol synthase, as well as 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, phospholipase Dα1, and cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase. These results indicate that the elaioplasts have the ability to synthesize FAs and polar lipids that might relate to the formation of new membranes during elaioplast development 33. This finding is also in agreement with a recent metabolic analysis in isolated tomato fruit chromoplasts using radiolabeled precursors 34, which suggests a highly conservative mechanism for lipid biosynthesis and homeostasis in both chromoplasts and elaioplasts. It has been well documented that lipoxygenases (LOX), which are associated with generation of polyunsaturated FA hydroperoxides, could contribute to the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) 35 and FA-derived flavor compounds 36. In the present study, several enzymes involved in the LOX pathway (such as LOX1, LOX2, and LOX6) and JA metabolism (allene oxide cyclase 4) were detected. Therefore, it is possible that the presence of lipoxygenases in citrus elaioplasts and chromoplasts 10 may play a key role in generating odor or flavor through production of LOX-derived volatiles in the outer peel and flesh of a fruit, respectively. A similar role for lipoxygenases in chromoplasts of tomato has been proposed 6. Elaioplasts are also important sites for amino acids synthesis. A large number of proteins responsible for amino acid metabolism were identified in elaioplasts, such as threonine synthase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, argininosuccinate synthase, cystathionine beta-lyase, 3-dehydroquinate synthase, isopropylmalate isomerase, isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, and ketol-acid reductoisomerase (Supplementary Table  S1). Consistently, proteins of amino acid metabolism were also extensively found in non-photosynthetic plastids 8,  10,  26. Taken together, our data suggest that these proteins involved in the biosynthesis of several types of amino acids, including aromatic amino acids have important functions in the active synthesis of amino acids within the elaioplasts. Active redox system is a key regulator for plant development and fruit senescence and has a wide range of functions in gene expression, enzyme activities, and protein import in plastids 37. In the elaioplast proteome, proteins involved in redox & stress constituted one of the top five functional classes. Several essential components in maintaining homeostasis of cell redox were found in the elaioplast proteome. These include the proteins involved in ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle and antioxidant system of plastids, such as glutathione peroxidases, peroxiredoxins (PRXs), superoxide dismutases (SODs), and thioredoxin. Additionally, several key enzymes involved in second active oxygen species scavenging system were identified in elaioplasts, including the AsA-GSH cycle catalyzed by ascorbate peroxidases (APXs), as well as the AsA-dependent generation systems catalyzed by (momo)dehydroascorbate reductase 38. Like in photosynthetic chloroplasts, APXs encountered in elaioplasts may indicate the presence of the AsA-dependent system involves the reduction of H 2O 2 using AsA as reductant 39. The activation of plastid SOD expression was detected to be dependent on a copper chaperone for SOD 40. Thus, as expected, Fe-SOD and Mn-SOD were detected and their overexpression induced an enhancement of plant tolerance in response to environmental stresses 41,  42. The presence of a large number of enzymes involved in oxidative stress response indicates a functionally active redox system in citrus elaioplasts and suggests the roles of these proteins in ROS metabolism, allowing the plastid to adapt to various environmental signals and processes during elaioplast development as fruit maturation proceeds. Protein synthesis, degradation, and translocation regulate the biogenesis of plastids. In this study, proteins associated with import, ribosome assembly and proteases account for 16.9% of the total plastid proteins (Fig.  4). (1) Import of nuclear-encoded precursor proteins into plastids is mediated by translocon complexes at the outer and inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts (TOC/TIC complexes) 43, which is important for the biogenesis of either chloroplasts 44 or chromoplasts 1. However, the import machinery remains unclear in elaioplasts. In this study, numerous translocons including TOC33/75/159 and TIC62/55/40/22/110 in the protein import machinery were identified in elaioplast proteome (Supplementary Table  S1). Among the TOC complex members, TOC75, which is deeply embedded within outer membrane of plastid, plays a major role to form protein translocation channel 43. TIC110, the major translocon component for protein translocation, plays a critical role in protein import into plastids 45. The extensive identification of TOC/TIC complex likely plays an important role in elaioplast biogenesis on basis of protein import machinery. (2) Thirty ribosomal proteins of translation machinery were identified in citrus elaioplasts. These proteins are represented by plastid-encoded 30S and 50S subunit, together with nucleus-encoded 40S and 60S subunit. These findings suggest the presence of translation machinery in elaioplast biogenesis. (3) Maintaining a balance between protein synthesis, import, turnover, and processing is an important factor determining plastid fate and maintaining their homeostasis 1,  46. As expected, we identified numerous caseinolytic peptidase (Clp) proteases in the study (Supplementary Table  S1), which have been well reported to form a chaperone complex to drive protein import, processing, and recycle plastid components. The knock-out of most members of Arabidopsis Clp proteases resulted in variegated/pale-green leaf phenotype, indicating their crucial roles in chloroplast development 47. Elaioplast proteome also consists of several membrane-bound ATP-dependent metalloproteases (FtsH2, FtsH4, FtsH5, FtsH9, and FtsHi4), which have been described as critical for plastid development 48. The extensive presence of Clp protease family in elaioplasts might contribute to elaioplast biogenesis by processing and/or cleavage of transit peptides of proteins in the plastids. Abundant proteins in citrus elaioplasts The protein abundance for all proteins detected in kumquat elaioplasts was determined based on intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ). The 30 most abundant proteins of kumquat elaioplasts are listed in Table  1. Among them, we identified four enzymes involving in secondary metabolism. Three enzymes (i.e. DXS, HDS, and GGPS) belong to the 2-C-methyl- d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, which provides precursors to synthesize monoterpenes within plastids. The fourth (orange1.1t03905) was a putative terpene synthase, which might be responsible for the accumulation of  d-limonene (accounting for up to 90% among monoterpene compounds) in outer peel of citrus 49,  50. The importance of DXS in regulating MEP substrate flux in kiwifruit and grape has previously been reported 51,  52 and the identification of MEP pathway proteins and TPS genes in citrus elaioplasts indicates the key role that elaioplasts play in basic metabolism. Eight proteins involved in transport or electron transport categories, such as ADP, ATP carrier protein, ATP-binding cassette transporter, ATPase, as well as ATP synthase beta/epsilon chain were also detected in kumquat elaioplasts. ATPase acts as an essential regulator of membrane trafficking, which couples free energy generated from ATP hydrolysis to transport of substances across the membranes of many organelles 53. ATP synthases are involved in energy production and proton transport. The identification of these proteins at high abundance suggests they may play an important role in active energy production and transport during elaioplast development. The presence of an active ATP generation system that is also necessary for the formation of membranes in plastids 54. Elevated energy production has also be observed in other heterotrophic plastids, such as chromoplasts 6 and proplastids 55. The citrus elaioplast proteome compared with citrus chromoplast proteome To determine whether the ultrastructure was different between elaioplasts and chromoplasts, we purified chromoplasts from citrus flesh for comparison with elaioplasts. TEM analysis showed that the size of elaioplasts was 2.15 ± 0.70 μm in diameter, which was significantly smaller than that of chromoplast (2.59 ± 0.60 μm) (Fig.  5a; Supplementary Figure  S2). The number of plastoglobules (5.86 ± 2.65) per elaioplast was approximately half that per chromoplast (11.59 ± 6.94) (Fig.  5b). However, the size of plastoglobules within elaioplasts was 0.48 ± 0.25 μm in diameter, which was about threefold greater than the diameter of plastoglobules within a chromoplast (0.14 ± 0.06 μm) (Fig.  5c). Taken together, the above results suggest that there are differences in ultrastructure between elaioplasts and chromoplasts. Given the structural differences between elaioplasts and chromoplasts, it was not surprising that differences in protein distribution patterns on SDS-PAGE gels were also observed (Fig.  3b). We further explored these differences by comparing the elaioplast proteome with that of chromoplast at the mass spectrometric level (Supplementary Figure  S3). Distinct proteome profiles for the biosynthesis and accumulation of different secondary metabolites was observed between elaioplasts and chromoplasts. A total of 42 and 40 core enzymes involved in secondary metabolism were identified in elaioplasts and chromoplasts, respectively (Supplementary Table  S2). The MEP pathway provides substrates to synthesize terpenes, tocopherols, and carotenoids (Fig.  6). In this study, an entire set of enzymes responsible for the MEP pathway were found in both elaioplasts and chromoplasts, including DXS, DXR, CMK, MCT, MDS, HDS, and HDR. Terpenoids are specifically accumulated in elaioplasts. We found seven proteins involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, such as myrcene synthase, 1,8-cineole synthase, germacrene synthase, and limonene synthase which accounted for more than 16.7% of total proteins involved in secondary metabolism (Supplementary Table  S3). By contrast, only limonene synthase (accounting for 2.5%) was identified in chromoplasts. With regard to carotenoid metabolism, ten enzymes (accounting for 25%) involved in carotenoid synthesis were identified in the chromopasts, including the rate limiting enzyme phytoene synthase, ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS), phytoene desaturase, lycopene β-cyclase, carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO), and β-carotene hydroxylase. By contrast, only CRTISO and ZDS were identified in elaioplasts. The synthesis of volatile apocarotenoids enhances dramatically during plastid development 56,  57. Consistently, CCD1 was detected in elaioplasts and chromoplasts. The extensive formation of plastoglobules within chromoplasts of citrus flesh is the most representative feature during chromoplast biogenesis 9, which is confirmed by the present study (Fig.  5b). Thirty plastoglobule-localized proteins have been established in Arabidopsis 58, and in our previous chromoplast proteome analysis we identified citrus homologs for 24 of these 30 proteins 9. In this study, we identified five additional plastoglobule-localized proteins (Supplementary Table  S4). However, it remains unclear whether plastoglobules within elaioplasts have a protein composition similar to that in chromoplasts. In elaioplasts, we only identified eight proteins that are predicted to be plastoglobule-localized using the same method. They include fibrillin 1 (FBN1), FBN7, tocopherol cyclase, flavin reductase-related 1/2, PLAT/LH2-1, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase. The FBN family is required for the development of leaf and fruit, and is involved in regulation of the extension of plastoglobules 58. In pepper, it is reported to be important for the formation of carotenoid-lipoprotein sequestration substructures and contributes to elevated levels of carotenoid accumulation 59. Fibrillin and its homologs were identified at high abundance in elaioplasts (Table  1), suggesting a possible role in the formation of plastoglobules. Since lipid-rich colorless elaioplasts likely have specialized but unknown functions 60, they might possess a unique plastoglobule proteome. Therefore, the further determination of plastoglobule proteomes of this colorless, non-photosynthetic plastid is necessary and meaningful.","Elaioplasts of citrus peel are colorless plastids which accumulate significant amounts of terpenes. However, other functions of elaioplasts have not been fully characterized to date. Here, a LC-MS/MS shotgun technology was applied to identify the proteins from elaioplasts that were highly purified from young fruit peel of kumquat. A total of 655 putative plastid proteins were identified from elaioplasts according to sequence homology in silico and manual curation. Based on functional classification via Mapman, ~50% of the identified proteins fall into six categories, including protein metabolism, transport, and lipid metabolism. Of note, elaioplasts contained ATP synthase and ADP, ATP carrier proteins at high abundance, indicating important roles for ATP generation and transport in elaioplast biogenesis. Additionally, a comparison of proteins between citrus chromoplast and elaioplast proteomes suggest a high level of functional conservation. However, some distinctive protein profiles were also observed in both types of plastids notably for isoprene biosynthesis in elaioplasts, and carotenoid metabolism in chromoplasts. In conclusion, this comprehensive proteomic study provides new insights into the major metabolic pathways and unique characteristics of elaioplasts and chromoplasts in citrus fruit.",,"['elaioplasts', 'proteins', 'Supplementary Table', 'proteins involved', 'Fig.', 'citrus elaioplasts', 'elaioplast proteome', 'involved', 'protein', 'plastid']","[elaioplast-enriched, antibodies against marker proteins, RbcL, UDPase, V-ATPase, VDAC1, Lhca1, Lhca4, RbcL., vacuolar V-ATPase, PSI type I chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins, Lhca1, Lhca4, Plprot, AT-CHLORO, SUBA, PPDB, twenty-nine proteins (35.0%, Elaioplasts, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, transketolase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconolactonase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, transketolase, transaldolase (, aldolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, glycolipids, E2-dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, E3-dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase 1, plastidial ketoacyl-ACP reductase, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol (, TDG), TDG2, phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase 1, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, phospholipase Dα1, cyclopropane-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase, polar lipids, lipoxygenases (, LOX, LOX, LOX1, LOX2, LOX6, Elaioplasts, aspartate aminotransferase, argininosuccinate synthase, cystathionine beta-lyase, 3-dehydroquinate synthase, isopropylmalate isomerase, isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, ketol-acid reductoisomerase, glutathione peroxidases, peroxiredoxins, PRXs, superoxide dismutases, SODs, thioredoxin, ascorbate peroxidases, APXs, AsA-dependent, (momo)dehydroascorbate reductase, APXs, plastid SOD, Fe-SOD, Mn-SOD, nuclear-encoded precursor proteins, chloroplasts 44, TOC33/75/159, TIC62/55/40/22/110, TOC complex, TOC75, plastid, TIC110, plastid-encoded 30S, nucleus-encoded 40S, 60S, caseinolytic peptidase, membrane-bound ATP-dependent metalloproteases, FtsH2, FtsH4, FtsH5, FtsH9, FtsHi4, Clp protease, iBAQ, 2-C-methyl- d-erythritol 4-phosphate, ATP-binding cassette, ATPase, ATP synthase, beta/epsilon, ATPase, MCT, chromopasts, enzyme phytoene synthase, ζ-carotene desaturase, ZDS, carotenoid isomerase, CRTISO, β-carotene hydroxylase, CRTISO, ZDS, fibrillin 1, FBN1, FBN7, flavin reductase-related 1/2, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, carotenoid-lipoprotein, Fibrillin, plastoglobule, plastoglobule]",['TPS'],[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
65,65,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5853461\eupmc_result.json,PMC5853461,"Results Recombinant CitTPS16 protein catalyzes  in vitro formation of  E-geraniol To characterize genes that are associated with formation of  E-geraniol, members of the  TPS family were cloned and expressed in  E. coli. Enzymatic activity assay showed that multiple volatile terpenoids were produced from 10 recombinant sweet orange TPS proteins ( Table 1). One member of the TPS family, CitTPS16 ( Supplementary Fig. S1), was able to catalyze  in vitro formation of  E-geraniol using GPP as substrate ( Fig. 1), and had no activity toward FPP. The most abundant transcripts of  CitTPS16 were detected in fruit tissue when compared with flower, leaf, and callus of sweet orange ( http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/cgi-bin/orange/gene/Cs7g17670.1). CitTPS16 encodes a 292 amino acid protein, belonging to the TPS-b subfamily based on phylogenetic analysis ( Fig. 2). Members of the Arabidopsis TPS-b subfamily function as monoterpene synthases  in planta, using GPP as substrate in the presence of divalent Mg 2+ cations ( Aubourg   et al., 2002 ). CitTPS16 is clustered with plant TPSs that are associated with  E-geraniol formation, including rough lemon RlemTPS3 and rose CrGES, sharing 63% and 55% similarity at the amino acid level, respectively. Transient overexpression of  CitTPS16 in sweet orange increased production of  E-geraniol A rapid and efficient transient overexpression assay was chosen to examine the function of  CitTPS16 in vivo, due to the difficulty of stable transformation systems in perennial fruit. Efficient transient expression systems have been used in orange ( Yin   et al., 2016 ) and persimmon ( Min   et al., 2012 ). To understand further the role of  CitTPS16 in biosynthesis of  E-geraniol, homologous transient overexpression was carried out in both fruits and leaves of Newhall sweet orange. The  E-geraniol content of the peels and leaves infiltrated with  CitTPS16 was 6.85 μg g –1 and 111.32 μg g –1, respectively, representing a significant ( P<0.05) increase compared with peel (4.42 μg g –1) and leaves (78.50 μg g –1) infiltrated with empty vector. These results indicated that introducing  CitTPS16 in Newhall sweet orange accelerated  E-geraniol biosynthesis ( Fig. 3). Expression profile of  CitERF71 correlated with  CitTPS16 in sweet orange fruit AP2/ERFs have been reported to be involved in production of volatile terpenoids in plants ( Yu   et al., 2012 ;  Li   et al., 2015 ;  Shen   et al., 2016 ). To investigate regulation of  CitTPS16 expression and  E-geraniol formation, changes in transcript levels of  CitERF genes were analyzed in different varieties and during fruit development. The highest content of  E-geraniol was detected in Newhall sweet orange fruit, while hybrid Huyou and mandarin Ponkan fruit exhibited low levels ( Fig. 4). Correspondingly, the most abundant transcript levels of  CitTPS16 were observed in Newhall ( Fig. 4). The transcription factor gene  CitERF71 also exhibited the highest transcript levels in Newhall sweet orange, similar to that of  CitTPS16. To test further the correlation between  CitTPS16 and  CitERF71, transcript levels of these two genes were analyzed during Newhall sweet orange ripening. As shown in  Fig. 5A and  B, expression of  CitTPS16 and  CitERF71 increased from 60 DAFB, peaked at ~105 DAFB, and then decreased in ripe fruit at 195 DAFB. Regression analysis showed that transcript levels of  CitTPS16 was positively correlated with that of  CitERF71 ( R2=0.624,  P<0.05). These results suggested that  CitERF71 was a good candidate for having a role in regulating expression of  CitTPS16 in Newhall sweet orange fruit. Our previous study revealed 126 members of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family in Newhall sweet orange ( C. sinensis Osbeck) ( Xie   et al., 2014 ). Phylogenetic analysis showed that CitERF71 belongs to the ERF IX a subfamily, clustering with Arabidopsis AtERF1, 2, and 13,  Catharanthus roseus CrORCA3, and  Nicotiana tabacum NtERF189 ( Supplementary Fig. S3). Transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolites was observed by homologs of  CitERF71, such as involvement of  CrORCA3 in regulating the pathway of jasmonate-inducible terpenoid ( van der Fits and Memelink, 2000). These results prompted us to study a possible role for CitERF71 in transcriptional regulation of  CitTPS16 in sweet orange. Promoter activation of  CitTPS16 by CitERF71 To test if CitERF71 could regulate expression of  CitTPS16, a dual-luciferase assay was performed. As expected, a  trans-activation effect was observed for CitERF71 on  CitTPS16 expression ( Fig. 5C). In order to confirm further the specific activation effect of ERF71 on the  CitTPS16 promoter (base pairs –2473 to +1), the activities of 48 CitERFs with the cloned  CitTPS16 promoter were analyzed ( Supplementary Fig. S2). The strongest induction was observed for activation of  CitTPS16 by CitERF71, with ~25-fold induction. A Y1H verified that CitERF71 could directly bind to the  CitTPS16 promoter ( Fig. 5D). These results indicated that CitERF71 could interact with and activate the  E-geraniol biosynthetic gene  CitTPS16. Roles of the motif in CitERF71 and  CitTPS16 promoter interaction To study the roles of different motifs in the promoter of  CitTPS16, four deletions were produced ( Fig. 6A). A major effect of the deletions on  CitTPS16 promoter activity was observed, where the activity was reduced to 36.85% and 9.85% for P1 (base pairs –1185 to 0) and P2 (base pairs –832 to 0), respectively. Additionally, the P2 deletion (containing base pairs –832 to 0) and P3 deletion (containing base pairs –419 to 0) significantly reduced transcription factor and promoter interaction, but did exhibit a low level of expression. There are two hypothetical GCC-box-like motifs [GCC-like-box1, ACCCGCC (base pairs –1499 to–1493); GCC-like-box2, GGCGGG [base pairs –948 to –943)] 5' of the region contained in P2 and none in the P3 or P4 promoter region; some unknown motif within the P3 promoter fragment must be responsible for the low but significant activity observed in P3 ( Fig. 6B). In vitro binding of CitERF71 to the GCC-box-like sequence in the  CitTPS16 promoter To confirm the binding results, we conducted an EMSA using the CitERF71 recombinant protein together with two 59 bp promoter fragments of  CitTPS16 containing the GCC-like-boxes. GCC-like-box1 and 2 of the  CitTPS16 promoter were both recognized by CitERF71. However, the binding activity disappeared when the GCC-like-box1 core ACCCGCC was changed to AAAAGCC (mGCC-like-box1), and the GCC-like-box2 core GGCGGG was changed to GGCAAA (mGCC-like-box2), respectively ( Fig. 6C). These results demonstrated the specificity of binding CitERF71 to the GCC-like-boxes of the  CitTPS16 promoter  in vitro ( Fig. 6D).","The unique flavor of Citrus fruit depends on complex combinations of soluble sugars, organic acids, and volatile compounds. The monoterpene E-geraniol is an important volatile, contributing to flavor in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck). Moreover, antifungal activity of E-geraniol has also been observed. However, the terpene synthase (TPS) responsible for its synthesis has not been identified in sweet orange. Terpene synthase 16 (CitTPS16) was shown to catalyze synthesis of E-geraniol in vitro, and transient overexpression of CitTPS16 in fruits and leaves of Newhall sweet orange resulted in E-geraniol accumulation in vivo. Having identified the responsible enzyme, we next examined transcriptional regulation of CitTPS16 in the fruit. Among cloned members of the AP2/ERF transcription factor gene family, CitERF71 showed a similar expression pattern to CitTPS16. Moreover, CitERF71 was able to activate the CitTPS16 promoter based on results from transient dual-luciferase assays and yeast one-hybrid assays. EMSAs showed that CitERF71 directly binds to ACCCGCC and GGCGGG motifs in the CitTPS16 promoter. These results indicate an important role for CitERF71 in transcriptional regulation of CitTP16 and, therefore, in controlling production of E-geraniol in Citrus fruit.","['Transcription factor', 'Fruit', 'Ripening', 'Volatile', 'Terpene synthase', 'Ap2/erf']","['sweet orange', 'Newhall sweet', 'Fig.', 'E-geraniol', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'orange', 'sweet', 'Newhall', 'Promoter', 'E-geraniol formation']","[CitTPS16 ( Supplementary Fig. S1, http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/cgi-bin/orange/gene/Cs7g17670.1, Mg 2, Yin   , Min   , –1, μg g, –1, P<0.05, μg g –1, –1, R2=0.624, AP2/ERF, CitERF71, ERF IX, 2, jasmonate-inducible terpenoid, CitERF71, CitERF71, CitERF71, dual-luciferase, CitERF71, ERF71, CitERFs, CitERF71, CitERF71, CitERF71, CitERF71, –1185, P3, –419, GCC-like-box1, ACCCGCC, –1499 to–1493, GCC-like-box2, GGCGGG, –948, P3, P4, P3, P3 ( Fig. 6B, CitERF71, CitERF71, GCC-like-box1, CitERF71, GCC-like-box1, ACCCGCC, AAAAGCC (mGCC-like-box1, GCC-like-box2, GGCGGG, GGCAAA, CitERF71]","['CitTPS16', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-b', 'CitTPS16', 'TPSs', 'RlemTPS3', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16.', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16,', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16.', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16,', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16', 'CitTPS16']",['C.'],[],terpene synthase
66,66,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC5876372\eupmc_result.json,PMC5876372,"Results Changes of volatile compound emissions during flower developmental and circadian processes Volatile compounds emitted from flowers at four flowering stages were sampled by headspace collection and detected by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). More than 900 compounds were detected at every stage, respectively. By filtering that accounting for less than 0.01% of the total amount, about 65 compounds were obtained for each flowering stage, respectively. To find changes during flowering process, volatile profiles of the four stages were combined to compare (Supplementary Table  S2). By combining the four profiles, a total of 101 volatile compounds were obtained, of which 21 were identified as flower scent compounds of  Lilium ‘Siberia’ according to descriptions for flower scent 37,  62,  63, including cis-β-ocimene, linalool, methyl benzoate, cis-3-hexenyl tiglate, cis-3-hexenyl isovalerate, isoeugenol, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, ethyl benzoate, cis-3-hexenyl benzoate, α-farnesene, β-pinene, (+)-α-pinene, etc. Of the 21 compounds, 19 were found at FF stage, while the EF, SF and LF stages had only 6, 12 and 12, respectively. Moreover, most of the 21 flower scent compounds (18) had the highest emission rate at FF stage, while 3 got their peaks at EF stage, including cis-3-hexenyl acetate (Fig.  2; Supplementary Table  S2). These results revealed that the biosynthesis of floral volatiles is controlled developmentally in  Lilium ‘Siberia’. Previous studies have shown rhythmic patterns of scent emission in the flowers of lily ‘Siberia’ 37,  64. Flowers at FF stage were used to detect variation in flower volatile compound emission rates at all four circadian time points. Similar to the analysis during development,  cis-β-ocimene, linalool, and methyl benzoate had the highest the emission rates among all compounds at all four circadian time points. The other nine compounds described above were also detected, in addition to three other compounds: eugenol, benzyl salicylate, and benzyl benzoate. Unlike the pattern seen during flower development, floral volatile compound emission rates varied across time of day (Fig.  3, Supplementary Table  S3). However, within the 15 major components in lily floral scents, 8 of items have highest emission rates at 16:00 (including linalool, which represent ~12% of total amount of volatiles of lily, the largest compounds of lily volatiles), 4 for 22:00, 2 for 4:00 and 1 for 10:00. These results supported the previous finding that the generation of floral volatiles occurred in a circadian rhythm in  Lilium ‘Siberia’ 37,  64. Sequencing,  de novo assembly, and gene annotation in RNA-seq of ‘Siberia’ flowers Lily flower tissues from four flower developmental stages, including 12 samples, were first analyzed using RNA-seq, resulting in more than ten thousand DEGs. Since scent-related compound emission rates vary by time of day (Fig.  3) 37, flower tissues from four time points during the day, including 4 samples, were also analyzed using RNA-seq to allow a 2-D analysis (Fig.  4). Complete sequencing of 16 samples achieved a total of 1.6 billion 150 bp raw reads. After a stringent quality filtering process, 1.6 billion clean reads remained, resulting in 234.38 Gb of clean data with a Q30 percentage (an error probability lower than 0.1%) ranging from 94.98 to 97.58% (Table  1). For the 2-D analysis, all clean reads required assembly. After assembly, transcripts with equal or more than 10 counts were filtered and finally a total of 118,665 unigenes were obtained, of which N50 was 1,038 bp and the average length was 825 bp. All the unigenes were selected for functional annotation by searching against six public databases (NR, Pfam, KOG, Swiss-prot, KO and GO). A totalof 61,284 (51.64%) were successfully annotated based on similarity to sequences in at least one database (Table  2). Approximately 56,851 unigenes (47.91%) were annotated using sequences from the NR database. With respect to species, 14.05% of sequences had top hits to sequences from  Elaeis guineensis, followed by  Phoenix dactylifera (11.72%),  Brassica napus (7.14%), and  Brassica oleracea (5.58%) (Fig.  5). A total of 50,256 unigenes (42.35%) were annotated using the KOG databases and grouped into 26 potential functional classifications (Supplementary Figure  S1). In addition, 38,202 unigenes (32.19%) were classified into 57 GO functional terms among three main categories: biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF; Supplementary Figure  S2). A total of 13,481 unigenes (11.36%) were mapped to 129 KEGG pathways (Supplementary Table  S4), among which several pathways were enriched, including gluconeogenesis (ko00010), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (ko00020), pentose phosphate pathway (ko00030), fatty acid biosynthesis (ko00061), synthesis and fatty acid degradation (ko00071), and ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis (ko00130). Identification of DEGs and TFs associated with flower scent production DEGs between libraries were determined by pairwise comparisons: EF vs. SF, SF vs. FF, FF vs. LF, 04:00 vs. 10:00, 10:00 vs. 16:00, 16:00 vs. 22:00, and 22:00 vs. 04:00). A total of 13,860 DEGs were obtained for the flower developmental process (Fig.  6A). From EF to SF, 1,961 DEGs were up-regulated, which corresponded to the beginning of flower scent biosynthesis (except for  cis−3-hexenyl acetate; Fig.  2). From SF to FF, 1,418 DEGs were up-regulated, while from FF to LF, 4,851 DEGs were down-regulated (Fig.  6B), which corresponded to the increase and decrease of flower volatiles, respectively (Fig.  2). After accounting for overlapping DEGs across the three comparisons, a union atlas of 6,329 DEGs was obtained that represented candidate genes (Fig.  6C). During the circadian process, a total of 7,099 DEGs were identified (Fig.  6D,E). Because floral volatile compound emission rates varied by time of day (Fig.  3), all of the DEGs were selected to be candidates. An atlas with 3,426 DEGs common to both flowering development and circadian rhythm was obtained, representing a large reduction compared to either of the two processes alone (Fig.  6F). GO enrichment analysis was used to classify the potential functions enriched among these DEGs. In the BP category, oxidation-reduction (GO:0055114), lignin biosynthesis (GO:0009809), coumarin biosynthesis (GO:0009805), and cytoplasmic translation (GO:0002181) were among the top function terms. In the CC category, the function terms included cytosol (GO:0005829), plasmodesma (GO:0009506), and plasma membrane (GO:0005886), while the structural constituent of ribosomes (GO:0003735), protein binding (GO:0005515), and transcription factor activity (GO:0003700) were among the top terms of the MF category (Supplementary Figure  S3). The expressions of six unigenes in the development process and eight unigenes in the circadian process were verified using qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR results showed a positive correlation between qRT-PCR and RNA-seq results (Fig.  7, Supplementary Figure  S4), indicating good reproducibility of the RNA-seq data in this study. Notably, 24,379 TFs were found to be expressed in ‘Siberia’ flowers. During flower development, there were 2,302 differentially-expressed TFs, 1,270 of which overlapped the 2,955 differentially-expressed TFs identified from the circadian rhythmic analysis (Fig.  8A). The 1,270 differentially-expressed TFs in the combined atlas were classified into 55 families, of which the bHLH family (129 members) accounted for the largest portion, followed by the ERF (99), NAC (95), MYB-related (89), C2H2 (57), MYB (46), and bZIP (46) families (Fig.  8B). Analysis of putative genes related to biosynthesis of flower scent compounds To detail the biosynthesis of flower scent, the genes were filtered for those believed to be involved in the putative flower scent biosynthesis pathway for  Lilium ‘Siberia’, which was determined from previous research 63,  65. For terpenoids, eight unigenes encoding enzymes involved in the MEP pathway were identified in present transcriptome, including one each of 1-deoxy-Dxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) gene, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (MCT) gene, 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (CMK) gene, two 2-C-methyl-Derythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MDS) genes, and two 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase (HDR) genes. Six unigenes were identified for encoding enzymes involved in the MVA pathway, including two acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT) genes, one hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS) gene, two hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) genes and one mevalonate kinase (MK) gene (Supplementary Figure  S5, Supplementary Table  S5). Expressions of major unigenes above presented a concomitant change with flower scent during the flower development, while it was complex during the circadian process. After formation of IPP and DMAPP by the above enzymes, GPP and FPP were generated by GPP synthase (GPPS) and FPP synthase (FPPS), the precursors of mono- and sesqui-terpenes, respectively 66. One GPPS unigene and two FPPS unigenes were identified from the current assembly transcriptome. GPPS unigene had a similar expression trend with the emission of terpenes, while FPPS unigenes did not, which was consistent with foundings in  Hedychium coronarium65. An array of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are generated through the action of TPSs, which directly determine product specificity 67. Nineteen TPS unigenes were identified in the current transcriptome (Supplementary Figure  S5, Supplementary Table  S5), including unigenes for monoterpens linalool_synthase (LIS), (E)-beta-ocimene synthase, myrcene synthase, and sesquiterpenes (3 S,6E)-nerolidol synthase (NES). The majority of TPS unigenes presented expression changes correlated to terpenoids biosynthesis during flower development and circadian rhythm process. The first committed step in benzenoid biosynthesis was catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL), which deaminated phenylalanine to cinnamic acid 68. Seven PAL unigenes existed in the current transcriptome and the expressions were consistent with benzenoid emission during flower development but nearly constant during the circadian process. The formation of benzenoids from cinnamic acid proceeds via β-oxidative pathway and non β-oxidative pathway 18. The β-oxidative pathway in petunia flowers needed four reactions catalyzed by three enzymes, including cinnamate:CoA ligase/acylactivating enzyme (CNL/AAE), cinnamoyl-CoA hydratasedehydrogenase (CHD) and 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase (KAT) 69–  72. Only two KATs were found in present transcriptome, of which expressions escalated slightly following flower development (Supplementary Figure  S6). To non-β-oxidative pathway, NAD-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (BALD) accounted for the oxidation of benzaldehyde into benzoic acid 73. Three BALD homologs were identified, but the expressions did not show correlation with the emission of benzenoids. For the final step for benzenoid biosynthesis, twenty-two S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase (SAM-Mtases) unigenes were identified in the transcriptome (Supplementary Figure  S6, Supplementary Table  S5), several of which could be identified as that for benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BAMT), benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferases (BSMT), salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (SAMT), etc. Most of the SAM-Mtases unigenes presented expression trends correlated with benzenoid biosynthesis during flower development. In biosynthesis pathway of volatile fatty acid derivatives, four LOX unigenes were identified from the transcriptome (Supplementary Table  S5). Expressions of LOX unigenes had the highest level at the EF stages and decreased following the flower development (Supplementary Figure  S7). Similar pattern could be found to hydroperoxide lyase unigene, which was responsible for converting 9- and 13-hydroperoxy intermediates into volatile C6 and C9 aldehydes. Fourteen unigenes were identified from the transcriptome for alcohol dehydrogenases, which could convert the C6 and C9 aldehydes to volatile alcohols 25. Moreover, one unigene for stearoyl-acyl carrier protein 9-desaturase was identified (Supplementary Table  S5), which could desaturate fatty acids into produce 18:1Δ9 ( ω-9) fatty acid intermediate, from which 9-alkenes could be derived 74. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of DEGs We used WGCNA to further filter the DEGs by correlating them with emission level changes of floral volatile compounds. A total of 26,049 genes, including all the DEGs, were clustered into 43 modules by WGCNA. All genes with GO annotations in the modules are listed in Supplementary Table  S6. A correlation map between modules and flower scent compounds was generated (Supplementary Figure  S8), from which the top three modules were selected for each compound. By this method, we identified 12 modules related to the top 15 floral volatiles of  Lilium ‘Siberia’ (Table  3). Four modules were correlated with both monoterpene and sesquiterpenes, including brown, pale-turquoise, saddle-brown and dark-orange. In phenylpropanoids, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate as well as (iso)eugenol and eugenol all correlated with pale-turquoise and brown modules, while benzyl salicylate and benzyl benzoate shared the same modules of yellow, dark-orange, and brown. As fatty acid derivatives,  cis−3-hexenyl tiglate and  cis−3-hexenyl isovalerate both correlated with dark-turquoise, plum1, and dark-orange modules. As expected,  cis−3-hexenyl benzoate shared the same modules with the phenylpropanoid methyl benzoate. By this analysis, DEGs were further correlated to flower scent compounds through modules. Identification of putative genes regulating biosynthesis of flower scent compounds In order to narrow the range of candidate genes, we then searched the 3,434 DEGs common to flower development and circadian rhythm data sets against every WGCNA module. A total of 1,210 DEGs partitioned into the 12 modules selected above. Blue (241) contained the largest number of DEGs, followed by dark-orange (176), dark-turquoise (170), brown (138), yellow (136), light-steel-blue1 (75), pink (66), dark-grey (54), pale-turquoise (44), plum1 (38), green-yellow (38), and saddle-brown (34). We then generated heat maps of gene expression for each module (Supplementary Figure  S9). For cis-3-hexenyl acetate, which showed an emission pattern different from the other 14 compounds, DEGs were obtained individually from the two processes and then categorized into the related modules: dark-grey (84), pink (84), and green-yellow (70). All DEGs with annotations are listed in Supplementary Table  S7. We also screened the 1,273 differentially-expressed TFs that overlapped between development and circadian processes against the 12 modules. A total of 419 TFs partitioned into modules, including 74 TFs in the dark-turquoise module. The remaining TFs were distributed as follows: blue (70), yellow (39), brown (37), light-steel-blue1 (34), dark-orange (32), pink (32), dark-grey (26), pale-turquoise (21), saddle-brown (20), plum1 (17) and green-yellow (17). For  cis−3-hexenyl acetate, 43, 40 and 30 TFs partitioned into pink, dark-grey and green-yellow modules, respectively. All the TFs with annotations are listed in Supplementary Table  S7. Four common modules were associated with monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes based on the WGCNA results. A key gene in the last step for linalool biosynthesis,  linalool synthase (LIS 75), was found in the brown module (Fig.  9) together with an  alcohol acetyl transferase ( AAT) unigene (DN245787_c1_g3_i2) involved in monoterpene alcohol biosynthesis 76,  77 and the  (3 S, 6E)-nerolidol synthase unigene (DN251718_c0_g2_i1) involved in both nerolidol and linalool biosynthesis 78, which further confirmed the involvement of this module in terpenoid biosynthesis. From this module, we could find other candidate unigenes, such those encoding auxin-responsive protein (DN244632_c1_g2_i1), acyl transferase (DN226095_c0_g2_i1), gibberellin-regulated proteins (DN228276_c0_g1_i1, DN232815_c0_g1_i1), gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase (DN247305_c0_g1_i2, DN250921_c0_g2_i3), and adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) transporter (DN253634_c1_g2_i1). Thirty-seven TFs were involved in brown module, of which three belonged to the MYB family and five belonged to the bHLH family. Phenylpropanoids were related to seven modules in the WGCNA results. In the pale-turquoise module, unigenes encoding several known phenylpropanoid-related enzymes, including benzyl alcohol O-benzoyltransferase (BEBT, DN240712_c1_g4_i1), cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (DN236463_c1_g1_i1), anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase (DN244249_c0_g1_i2), and 4-coumarate–CoA ligase (DN248980_c2_g11_i1) were found, verifying role of this module in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Unigenes encoding other phenylpropanoid-related enzymes were found in the saddle-brown module, including for SAM-Mtases (DN87519_c0_g2_i1), phosphoenolpyruvate translocator in the shikimate pathway (DN248494_c1_g3_i1), arogenate dehydratase (DN252205_c0_g1_i1, DN252205_c0_g3_i1), together with an ABC transporter (DN235235_c0_g1_i1), and an ethylene-responsive transcription factor (DN242444_c0_g1_i1). Forty-one TF genes were involved in the two modules, including two encoding MYB TFs. A total of eight modules were associated with fatty acid derivatives based on the WGCNA results. In the green-yellow module, two unigenes involved in the LOX pathway were found: one encoding lipoxygenase (DN253294_c0_g7_i5) and one encoding fatty acid hydroxylase (DN247380_c2_g3_i2). Seventeen TF genes were identified in this module, including two MYBs, three bHLHs, and two B3s. In the dark-turquoise module, nine unigenes related to fatty acid derivatives were found, including three for acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] desaturase (DN248341_c1_g1_i1, DN219892_c0_g3_i1, DN253694_c7_g2_i1), one for a fatty acid transporter (DN233787_c1_g2_i2), one for both fatty acyl-CoA reductase and aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD; DN240253_c0_g2_i2), three for fatty-acyl-CoA synthase (DN248980_c2_g14_i1, DN248980_c2_g16_i1, DN248980_c2_g1_i1) and one for 2-alkenal reductase (DN252291_c1_g5_i1). In addition, four unigenes for auxin-responsive proteins (DN242854_c1_g2_i1, DN242854_c1_g3_i1, DN250599_c1_g1_i3, DN252722_c0_g9_i1) were also included. This module contained 73 TF genes, including nine MYBs, 15 bHLHs, five B3s, and six C2H2s. By combining results of 2-D and WGCNA analyses, we decreased the candidate number and several genes (TFs) were identified for the three classes of flower scent compounds, respectively.","Lily is a popular flower around the world not only because of its elegant appearance, but also due to its appealing scent. Little is known about the regulation of the volatile compound biosynthesis in lily flower scent. Here, we conducted an approach combining two-dimensional analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to explore candidate genes regulating flower scent production. In the approach, changes of flower volatile emissions and corresponding gene expression profiles at four flower developmental stages and four circadian times were both captured by GC-MS and RNA-seq methods. By overlapping differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) that responded to flower scent changes in flower development and circadian rhythm, 3,426 DEGs were initially identified to be candidates for flower scent production, of which 1,270 were predicted as transcriptional factors (TFs). The DEGs were further correlated to individual flower volatiles by WGCNA. Finally, 37, 41 and 90 genes were identified as candidate TFs likely regulating terpenoids, phenylpropanoids and fatty acid derivatives productions, respectively. Moreover, by WGCNA several genes related to auxin, gibberellins and ABC transporter were revealed to be responsible for flower scent production. Thus, this strategy provides an important foundation for future studies on the molecular mechanisms involved in floral scent production.",,"['Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Supplementary', 'flower scent', 'Fig.', 'flower', 'unigenes', 'Table', 'flower development', 'compounds']","[’, SF, LF, ’, ’, ’, ‘, RNA-seq, RNA-seq, 234.38 , 118,665, KOG, Swiss-prot, 56,851 unigenes, 50,256, 38,202, SF, SF, LF, SF, SF, LF, GO:0009809, GO:0009805, GO:0002181, GO:0009506, GO:0003735, RNA-seq, ‘, MYB, bZIP (46, ’, MCT, 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase, 2-C-methyl-Derythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl diphosphate reductase, AACT, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, HMGS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, mevalonate kinase, DMAPP, GPP synthase, GPPS, FPP synthase, FPPS, sesqui-terpenes, GPPS, FPPS, GPPS, FPPS, phenylalanine ammonialyase, β-oxidative, CoA ligase/acylactivating enzyme, CNL/AAE, cinnamoyl-CoA hydratasedehydrogenase, KATs, NAD-dependent benzaldehyde dehydrogenase, BSMT, SAMT, SAM-Mtases, LOX, LOX, hydroperoxide lyase, 9-, C9 aldehydes, alcohol dehydrogenases, C9 aldehydes, stearoyl-acyl, 9-desaturase, 18:1Δ9, 9-alkenes, 26,049, pale-turquoise, saddle-brown, (iso)eugenol, pale-turquoise, plum1, pale-turquoise (44, plum1, green-yellow (38, green-yellow (70, pale-turquoise (21, saddle-brown, plum1 (17), green-yellow (17), AAT, DN245787_c1_g3_i2, 6E)-nerolidol synthase, DN251718_c0_g2_i1, DN244632_c1_g2_i1, DN226095_c0_g2_i1, gibberellin-regulated proteins, DN228276_c0_g1_i1, DN232815_c0_g1_i1, gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase, DN247305_c0_g1_i2, DN250921_c0_g2_i3, adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette (ABC) transporter (DN253634_c1_g2_i1, MYB, pale-turquoise, BEBT, DN240712_c1_g4_i1, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, DN236463_c1_g1_i1, anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase, DN244249_c0_g1_i2, 4-coumarate–CoA ligase, DN248980_c2_g11_i1, phenylpropanoid-related enzymes, saddle-brown, DN87519_c0_g2_i1, phosphoenolpyruvate translocator, DN248494_c1_g3_i1, arogenate dehydratase, DN252205_c0_g1_i1, DN252205_c0_g3_i1, DN235235_c0_g1_i1, DN242444_c0_g1_i1, MYB, LOX, lipoxygenase (, DN253294_c0_g7_i5, bHLHs, B3s, acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] desaturase, DN248341_c1_g1_i1, DN219892_c0_g3_i1, DN253694_c7_g2_i1, fatty acyl-CoA reductase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, NAD, DN240253_c0_g2_i2, DN248980_c2_g14_i1, DN248980_c2_g16_i1, DN248980_c2_g1_i1, 2-alkenal reductase, DN252291_c1_g5_i1, DN242854_c1_g2_i1, DN242854_c1_g3_i1, DN250599_c1_g1_i3, DN252722_c0_g9_i1, TF, bHLHs, B3s, C2H2s]","['TPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPS']",[],[],

Screening and Isolation of Sesquiterpene Synthase Gene from P. minus Two new candidates of sesquiterpene synthase genes,  PmSTPS1 (comp62410_co_seq6) and  PmSTPS2 (comp47018_c0_seq1), were successfully identified through the sequence analysis of  P. minus transcriptome [ 40]. The 1098 bp  PmSTPS1 transcript contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1047 bp, encoding 348 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 40.9 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6. 15 ( Figure S1). The ORF of  PmSTPS1 started from the nucleotide position at 25 and ended at position 1071. The deduced amino acid sequence of  PmSTPS1 (GenBank accession no. MG921605) showed no signal peptide. A ProtParam analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of  PmSTPS1 revealed 47 negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) and 52 positively charged residues (Arg and Lys), which represented the aliphatic index of this protein. This was a positive factor for the increased thermostability of the globular protein. The second sesquiterpene synthase transcript,  PmSTPS2 (GenBank accession No: MG921606), was 1974 bp long and had an ORF of 1695, which encoded a polypeptide of 564 amino acids ( Figure S2). The ORF of  PmSTPS2 started from the nucleotide position at 97 and ended at position 1798. The calculated molecular mass of the mature protein was approximately 65.96 kDa, with a predicted pI of 5.75. A ProtParam analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of  PmSTPS2 identified 83 negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) and 70 positively charged residues (Arg and Lys). Based on the BLASTx analysis, the predicted amino acid sequences of  PmSTPS1 ( Table 1) and  PmSTPS2 ( Table 2) had the closest hit to drimenol synthase from  Persicaria hydropiper, with a 96% and 46% identity, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence of  PmSTPS2 was consistent with those of other sesquiterpene synthases encoding proteins of 550–580 amino acids, with molecular weights of 60–70 kDa. Conversely, the length of  PmSTPS1, with only 348 amino acids, was much shorter than that of the other sesquiterpene synthases. Therefore, only  PmSTPS2 met the range of other reported plant terpene synthases [ 21, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. The presence of the conserved domains in the  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 proteins was consistent with and similar to that of the other terpene synthase features. The terpene synthase family N-terminal domain (PF01397) and the synthase family C-terminal metal-binding domain (PF03936) contained highly conserved aspartate-rich motifs (DDxxD), which were essential for enzyme-substrate binding and catalytic function. The first aspartate-rich motif played a role in the determination of the chain length for the resulting prenyl pyrophosphate.  Based on the multiple sequence alignment of  PmSTPS1 ( Figure 1), several conserved motifs that were found in typical terpene synthases were identified, including the DDxxD (residue 100–104) and NSE/DTE (residue 245–253) motifs. The DDxxD and NSE/DTE motifs flanked the entrance of the active site. In addition to these motifs, there was a highly conserved arginine-rich RxR motif, which was involved in the complexing of the diphosphate group, after the ionisation of FPP [ 18, 39]. The RxR motif was located at 45 amino acids, upstream of the first DDxxD motif. For  PmSTPS2, the conserved arginine-rich (RxR) region at amino acid position 278–281 was conserved in all of the terpene synthases [ 19]. Moreover, the aspartate-rich motif of DDxxD, which might have been the Mg 2+ binding site, was located at position 314–318 of the amino acid sequence. Another metal binding motif, the NSE/DTE motif, was detected at amino acid position 461–467 ( Figure 1). The less conserved motif NSE/DTE, apparently evolved from a second motif that was conserved in prenyl transferase. In general, these motifs were located on the opposite sides of the active site [ 6, 7]. The metal binding residues appeared as NSE in most microbial and fungal cyclases and as DTE in most plant cyclases.  2.2. Phylogenetic Analysis of P. minus Sesquiterpene Synthase (PmSTPS) The  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 amino acid sequences were aligned and compared with other flowering plant terpene synthase sequences, using Clustal Omega ( Figure 2), and they showed a low sequence similarity (42.94%). The phylogenetic analysis showed a particularly close relationship between the  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 amino acid sequences. The  PmSTPS1 was clustered in the same clade with sesquiterpene synthase ( PmSTS) from  Persicaria minor and drimenol synthase from  Persicaria hydropiper. The results showed that the  PmSTPS1 from  P. minus was grouped into a single clade with a 43.04% identity, which suggested a monophyletic origin of the gene. Additionally,  PmSTPS2 was placed in the same clade with (+) delta-cadinene synthase from  Ricinus communis. Moreover,  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 were grouped together with the terpene synthases from the Santalum and  Vitis vinifera species. Multiple sequence alignments of  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 amino acid sequences, with sesquiterpenes from other plants species, showed a high sequence similarity (42–96%). 2.3. Expression of PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 in E. coli For the analysis of the protein expression, recombinant bacterial strains harbouring pQE2 in  E. coli M15 with  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 were compared with those harbouring the control empty pQE2 vector. The cells were harvested at different times (1, 3, and 5 h) post-induction. After sonication and centrifugation of the bacteria, soluble and insoluble crude fractions were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE analysis ( Figure S3) showed unclear corresponding protein bands at the expected size at different post-induction times, as well as in the control sample. However, Western Blotting ( Figure S4) confirmed the correct size of recombinant proteins. There was no band was observed in the control sample as expected. Correct protein sizes of 40.9 and 65.9 kDa were obtained for  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2, respectively. From these findings, the recombinant  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 proteins from  P. minus were successfully expressed in  E. coli, and the activities of these enzymes were further investigated via enzymatic assays. 2.4. Identification of PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 Assay Products A functional characterisation of the  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 genes was performed by an in vitro enzyme assay of the recombinant proteins. In this crude protein assay, the  E. coli strain harbouring empty pQE-2 vector was used as the control strain. A GC-MS analysis showed that  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 produced β-farnesene, α-farnesene, and farnesol as the final products. Additionally,  PmSTPS2 also produced nerolidol. For  PmSTPS1, the products formed were β-farnesene (14.49 min), α-farnesene (15.79 min), and farnesol (16.98 min). Additionally, the principle products from  PmSTPS2 enzyme were β-farnesene (14.49 min), α-farnesene (15.83 min), farnesol (16.84 min), and nerolidol (17.25 min). Based on the GC-MS analysis, both extracts from  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 showed multiple peaks for corresponding sesquiterpene products, compared with no peaks observed in the control sample, which did not exhibit any major products, although exogenous substrates were added ( Figure 3). These findings therefore demonstrated the successful production of sesquiterpenes in the recombinant  E. coli strains overexpressing  PmSPTS1 and  PmSTPS2 enzymes, respectively. All of the peaks were further confirmed by comparison with NIST and Wiley libraries, mass spectra, authentic sesquiterpene standards, and control ( Figure S5). Interestingly, although the sizes of  PmSTPS1 and  PmSTPS2 were different, the two enzymes were capable of producing similar sesquiterpene products, β-farnesene, α-farnesene, and farnesol ( Figure 3), but they did so at different levels.  PmSTPS1 successfully converted the precursor FPP to produce 9.50% β-farnesene as the main product, followed by 8.86% α-farnesene, and 5.08% farnesol.  PmSTPS2 showed synthesises nerolidol (48.33%) as a major product, followed by farnesol (15.30%), β-farnesene (5.07%), and α-farnesene (2.76%). Although the (E,E)-farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) substrate was added to the enzymatic assay, the control pQE-2 sample did not produce any significant products, indicating that endogenous metabolites did not affect the protein expression and analysis in this study."," Polygonum minus  (syn.  Persicaria minor ) is a herbal plant that is well known for producing sesquiterpenes, which contribute to its flavour and fragrance. This study describes the cloning and functional characterisation of  Pm STPS1 and  Pm STPS2, two sesquiterpene synthase genes that were identified from  P. minus  transcriptome data mining. The full-length sequences of the  Pm STPS1 and  Pm STPS2 genes were expressed in the  E. coli  pQE-2 expression vector. The sizes of  Pm STPS1 and  Pm STPS2 were 1098 bp and 1967 bp, respectively, with open reading frames (ORF) of 1047 and 1695 bp and encoding polypeptides of 348 and 564 amino acids, respectively. The proteins consist of three conserved motifs, namely, Asp-rich substrate binding (DDxxD), metal binding residues (NSE/DTE), and cytoplasmic ER retention (RxR), as well as the terpene synthase family N-terminal domain and C-terminal metal-binding domain. From the in vitro enzyme assays, using the farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) substrate, the  Pm STPS1 enzyme produced multiple acyclic sesquiterpenes of β-farnesene, α-farnesene, and farnesol, while the  Pm STPS2 enzyme produced an additional nerolidol as a final product. The results confirmed the roles of  Pm STPS1 and  Pm STPS2 in the biosynthesis pathway of  P. minus , to produce aromatic sesquiterpenes.","['Farnesol', 'Nerolidol', 'Polygonum Minus', 'Sesquiterpene Synthase']","['amino acid', 'amino', 'acid sequence', 'Sesquiterpene Synthase', 'Figure', 'Synthase', 'acid', 'sequence', 'Sesquiterpene', 'analysis']","[comp62410_co_seq6, comp47018_c0_seq1, MG921605, Arg, MG921606, Arg, 550–580 amino, enzyme-substrate, 278–281, Mg 2, prenyl transferase, NSE, PmSTPS1, PmSTPS2, pQE2, pQE2, PmSTPS1, PmSTPS2 Assay, pQE-2, Wiley, E)-farnesyl pyrophosphate, pQE-2]","['PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1,', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2,', '(PmSTPS)', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2,', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1,', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2', 'PmSTPS1', 'PmSTPS2']",[],[],terpene synthase

The transcriptome of infested plants was compared with that from non-infested ones (control) at 6 h after infestation (hai), 2 and 6 days after infestation (dai). Overall, 995 million paired-end reads were obtained by Illumina sequencing, with an average of 41.5 million per library and higher average number of reads in samples from the infested treatment ( Supplementary Table   S1 and  Figure   1A). Roughly 94% of the reads mapped against the  A. thaliana reference genome, with a 91% average of uniquely mapped reads ( Supplementary Table   S1 and  Figure   1B). Biological variability between samples was verified by principal component analysis (PCA) using the normalized count data ( Figure   1C). Infested and control samples grouped separately, suggesting a globally distinct expression profile, as expected. Even though a classification of the first principal components as treatment or time of infestation was not clear, the first component (PC1), which accounts for 52% of the variance, apparently separated the samples by the intensity of stimuli. Except for two out of four control samples at 6 dai, all control samples grouped together with those of mite-infested treatments from 6 hai, whose plants were stimulated by a short period of mite feeding. Samples from plants challenged by longer mite feeding period (2 and 6 dai) grouped separately. Hierarchical clustering of samples within each time point confirmed a clear separation between mite-infested and non-infested treatments over the course of the experiment ( Figure   1D). By using the negative binomial-based DESeq2 package and FDR correction of  p-values for multiple comparisons, 5005 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, α ≤ 0.05) were detected ( Supplementary Table   S2). Mite infestation deregulated 1755, 3069 and 2680 genes at 6 hai, 2 dai, and 6 dai, respectively ( Figure   1E). At the earliest stage of the interaction (6 hai), the majority of the DEGs was up-regulated. The number of down-regulated genes progressively increased during the interaction reaching its highest rating at 6 dai ( Figures   1E,F). Analysis performed here show an intense modulation of the plant transcriptome in response to  Brevipalpus mite infestation. To validate the RNA-Seq data, 10 genes were selected for Real Time RT-qPCR analysis. Expression of these genes was assessed in a new experiment with mite-infested and non-infested Arabidopsis plants at 6 hai, 2 dai, and 6 dai ( Supplementary Figure   S1). Altogether, expression profiles of selected genes obtained by RT-qPCR were consistent with those obtained by the RNA-Seq, supporting the results described in this work. Additionally, some of these genes had an expression profile similar to that revealed by a qPCR-driven analysis during a comparable experiment previously described ( Arena et al., 2016). The Plant Immune System Is Modulated by  Brevipalpus Mite Infestation Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed with all 5005 DEGs to identify the most relevant biological processes (BPs), molecular functions (MFs) and cellular components (CC) disturbed during  Brevipalpus mite-plant interaction. This study identified 264 BPs, 83 MFs and 78 CCs that were over-represented (hypergeometric test, α ≤ 0.001) in the list of DEGs ( Supplementary Table   S3). Enriched BPs were further visualized as a network using the app BinGO from Cytoscape, where color and size of the nodes identify  p-values and number of DEGs from each category, respectively ( Supplementary Figure   S2). The GO network revealed a striking deregulation of plant defensive responses. BP categories were clustered in two major groups comprising metabolism and response to stimuli. BP-metabolism was sub-clustered into two branches separately harboring the primary and secondary metabolisms. Secondary metabolism group was represented by processes related to the biosynthesis and metabolism of “flavonoids,” “glucosinolates,” “toxins,” and “camalexins,” which are known to exert anti-herbivory roles and be induced by SA or JA. Primary metabolism included categories associated to the metabolism of: (i) “aminoacids” and “proteins,” connected to processes involved in the control of gene expression (such as “protein modification,” “phosphorylation,” and “transcription”); (ii) “organic acid,” whose sub-categories included the “SA metabolism” and “JA biosynthesis and metabolism”; and (iii) “carbohydrates,” edged to several photosynthesis-associated categories and processes related to “cell wall modification” such as “callose deposition,” a well-known defense against herbivores ( Jander, 2014). Biological processes cluster centralized in “response to stimulus” was fully represented by processes associated with defense responses. Nodes from the cluster included response to “stress,” “abiotic,” and “biotic” stimulus (linked to “defense response” and to the subcategories of response to “wounding,” “insects,” and other pathogens). A large “response to hormone” branch displayed all main hormone-mediated pathways, including SA and JA, but also abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ET), auxins (IAA), cytokinins (CK) and gibberellins (GA). Other nodes included in the “response to stimuli” group were “response to chitin,” commonly triggered in plants colonized by chitin-rich organisms such as arthropods and fungi ( Libault et al., 2007), and “oxidative stress,” typically induced in plant-biotic interactions ( Arena et al., 2016;  Camejo et al., 2016). Several processes related to defense response were also present in “biological regulation” nodes, such as “regulation of hormone levels,” “defense response,” “immune response,” and, “JA pathway.” Specific and Common Transcriptomic Changes Occur at Different Time Points After  Brevipalpus Mite Infestation of Plants A comparison of the DEGs deregulated across the experiment revealed both common and specific changes at each time points ( Figure   2A). Few DEGs were common to all time points, whereas the highest percentage of them were found to be exclusively modulated at 2 or 6 dai suggesting intense reprogramming steps of plant transcriptome throughout the course of the  Brevipalpus mite infestation ( Figure   2A). Most of the BPs (84 terms) over-represented during mite infestation overlap at all time points ( Figure   2B and  Supplementary Table   S4). These processes included most of the general terms of plant response to stresses and hormones, indicating a continuous and lasting reprogramming of the plant immune system since the beginning of the interaction until at least 6 dai. Several categories were common between 6 hai and 2 dai (75 terms), and 2 dai and 6 dai (20 terms), but no biological process was shared between the first and the last evaluated time points ( Figure   2B). Even though processes related to plant defense responses were markedly enriched over the time course of the experiment, time point-specific ontologies were also identified. From all the over-represented BP categories, 49, 47, and 24 were uniquely identified at 6 hai, 2 dai, and 6 dai, respectively ( Figure   2B and  Supplementary Table   S4). Hormone biosynthesis (“salicylic acid biosynthetic process,” “oxylipin biosynthetic process”), early signaling (“activation of MAPK activity”), and structural defenses (“callose deposition,” “cell wall thickening,” and “lignin biosynthetic process”) were processes exclusively enriched at 6 hai ( Figure   2C). At 2 dai, unique categories were related to the metabolism of defense-related secondary metabolites (“indole glucosinolate metabolic process,” “pigment,” and “flavonoid biosynthetic and metabolic process”), photosynthesis and oxidative stress (“photosynthesis,” “carbon fixation,” “photosynthetic electron transport,” “response to light intensity,” “response to oxidative stress”) ( Figure   2C). Exclusive ontologies that came up with the late infestation state (6 dai) were detoxification processes (“cellular detoxification,” “cellular response to toxic substance”), and other associated to cell wall components and structure (“plant-type cell wall organization,” “cell wall loosening,” and “pectin,” “galacturonan,” “glucan,” “carbohydrate,” and “polysaccharide” metabolic process) ( Figure   2C). Brevipalpus Mite Infestation Induces Plant Defensive Responses and Represses the Plant Growth-Related Processes The vast majority of DEGs detected in more than one time point were strictly kept up- or down-regulated. Among the 5005 DEGs identified throughout the analysis, only 201 of them (4%) shift their expression patterns across the experiment ( Supplementary Table   S2). In agreement with this, results of the hierarchical clustering analysis revealed two major clusters of DEGs, which mainly encompassed 2762 and 2243 up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively ( Figure   3A). Gene ontology enrichment analysis separately performed with DEGs within each of the predefined clusters identified only 31 common categories between the up- and down-regulated groups ( Figure   3B and  Supplementary Table   S5). These categories represented higher GO levels and included general BPs such as “regulation of biological quality,” “response to stimulus,” “metabolic process,” “signal transduction,” among others. BPs such as “response to hormones” and “hormone-mediated signaling pathway” were also shared between the up- and down-regulated clusters but GO-terms identifying a particular hormonal pathway were always detected in just one of the two groups. The up-regulated cluster was enriched in 264 exclusive BPs ( Figure   3C and  Supplementary Table   S5). Network topology was similar to that obtained using all the DEGs ( Supplementary Figure   S2), with two major clusters centralized in metabolic processes and response to stimuli. GO terms within metabolic process cluster involved several BPs related to secondary metabolism, whilst response to stimuli cluster presented terms associated to stress and defense and hormonal pathways. Over-represented categories were massively typified by defensive responses. Besides broad immune system-related terms (e.g., “immune response”), other common categories displayed by the general network ( Supplementary Figure   S2) included responses to hormones, oxidative stress and the production of secondary metabolites, e.g., glucosinolates, flavonoids, and camalexin. Only SA, JA, ET, and ABA-mediated hormonal pathways were represented in the up-regulated cluster network. Induced GO network also included other over-represented processes that were unidentified in the general network ( Supplementary Figure   S2). Among these are included: “response to herbivore,” “response to virus,” “multi-organism process,” “modification of morphology/physiology of other organism,” “lignin biosynthetic and metabolic process,” “defense response by callose deposition,” and “phytoalexin biosynthetic and metabolic process.” The down-regulated cluster was enriched in 76 exclusive BPs, which were predominantly associated with the plant growth and development ( Figure   3D and  Supplementary Table   S5). Over-represented terms included broad categories, for instance “developmental process” and “regulation of growth,” and also those directly related to plant growth such as “cytokinetic process,” “cell cycle process,” “mitotic cytokinesis,” or indirectly related to growth such as “cell wall organization or biogenesis” and “cytoskeleton organization”. Among the enriched BPs there were also processes associated to morphogenesis and development of specific plant components such as “root morphogenesis,” “cuticle development,” and “cotyledon development.” The other major class of over-represented BPs uniquely detected in the down-regulated cluster comprised photosynthesis-related processes such as “photosynthesis,” “electron transport chain,” “carbon fixation,” “photosynthesis, dark and light reaction,” “light harvesting,” “photosynthetic electron transport,” and “chlorophyll biosynthetic process.” Finally, the only hormones represented in the down-regulated cluster network were the major growth regulators IAA, CK and brassinosteroids (BR). Co-expression of Genes Correlates With Classes of Transcription Factors (TFs) Involved in SA, JA and Developmental Processes Since transcriptional reprogramming is mainly controlled by TFs, the regulation of the expression dynamics of DEGs by specific classes of TFs was tested by two different approaches. First, over-represented TF families were searched based on up- and down-regulated DEGs that encode TFs ( Figure   4A and  Supplementary Table   S6). Within the cluster of up-regulated DEGs, 254 (9.2%) TFs from 30 different families were identified. From those, 16 over-represented families were detected (hypergeometric test, α ≤ 0.001). The largest and most significant of them were the WRKY (33 genes,  p-value = 2.47E-33) and the AP2/ERF (40 genes,  p-value = 8.46E-34), known to act as regulators of SA pathway and ERF-branch of the JA pathway, respectively. From the analysis using the cluster of down-regulated DEGs, 141 (6.3%) TFs belonging to 30 families were detected. Twenty-three of these families were also found in the cluster of up-regulated DEGs. TFs were evenly distributed among 18 over-represented families (hypergeometric test, α ≤ 0.001), with lower significance (higher  p-values). The largest and most significantly over-represented families were bHLH (22 genes,  p-value = 3.21E-25), which comprises the regulators of the MYC-branch of the JA pathway, and C3H family (17 genes,  p-value = 1.46E-17). Second, TF families that potentially regulate the expression of the DEGs were searched based on over-represented target genes within the DEGs ( Figure   4B and  Supplementary Table   S7). Enriched target genes and their corresponding TFs were identified by using a TF enrichment tool that takes advantage of previously identified  cis-regulatory elements and regulatory interactions from literature mining ( Jin et al., 2017). As a result, WRKY was the largest identified family with potential targets within the up-regulated DEGs. Twenty-one out of its 42 TF members were also induced during  Brevipalpus mite-plant interactions. Targets from WRKY TFs were exclusively enriched in the up-regulated cluster. The next largest families with targets within the induced DEGs were MYB, bZIP, and bHLH, with 29, 26, and 24 TFs, respectively. Targets for MYB, bZIP, and bHLH, however, were not exclusively enriched in the analysis of the cluster of up-regulated DEGs. These families represented by 34, 24, and 14 TFs, respectively, were also among the largest with potential targets within down-regulated DEGs. MYC2, the marker TF from the MYC-branch of the JA pathway, was one of the bHLH TF with targets exclusively enriched in the down-regulated cluster. Notably, the analysis of the down-regulated cluster also revealed the TCP family, which is typically involved in the control of plant development. This family involved 15 and 4 TFs that potentially regulate targets within the assortment of repressed and induced DEGs, respectively. Overall, the analysis of co-expressed genes with its corresponding TFs showed a correlation of up- and down-regulated genes with TFs that regulates SA, JA and developmental processes. The SA-related WRKY family was the largest one with target genes exclusively enriched in the up-regulated cluster and most of its TF members were also up-regulated. The analysis of enriched TFs settles the involvement of plant hormonal pathways and developmental processes in the plant response to  Brevipalpus mites, with highlight on the participation of the SA pathway solely on the up-regulated responses. Focus on Defense Pathways: SA- and JA-Mediated Responses Are Induced in  Brevipalpus Mite-Infested Plants Over-represented genes from GO-terms associated with SA and JA-dependent responses were thoroughly reviewed to confirm their induced status. Data from genes included in the categories “response to SA” and “SA metabolic process,” or “response to JA,” “regulation of JA-mediated pathway,” and “JA metabolic process” were processed by a Hierarchical cluster analysis. The SA-dependent pathway was represented by 103 DEGs ( Supplementary Table   S8). Eighty-one of these DEGs were up-regulated in at least one of the experimental time points. Some of these genes were induced at either early or late stages of the response, but they were not down-regulated in any of the other analyzed time points ( Figures   5A,B). Examples of these expression patterns are the genes coding for the signaling protein for SA activation  EDS1 ( enhanced disease susceptibility 5) and the SA-biosynthetic enzyme  ICS1 ( isochorismate synthase 1) that were up-regulated at the beginning of the interaction, whilst the SA-responsive proteins  PR1 ( pathogenesis-related protein 1) and  GLIP1 were induced at later time points. Moreover, the expression profile analysis of some DEGs revealed the quick regulation of some SA-responsive genes since the initial steps of the plant-mite interaction. For instances,  PR2/BGL2 ( pathogenesis-related protein 2/beta-1,3-glucanase 2) was up-regulated as soon as 6 hai and remained activated at least till 2 dai. Among the induced genes associated to the SA pathway there were also several signaling kinases such as the receptor-like kinase (RLK)  CRK9 ( cysteine-rich RLK 9), the  wall-associated kinases WAK1 and  WAKL10, and the  L-type lectin receptor kinase LCRK-S.2, LCRK-IV.1 and  LCRK-IX.2. Other up-regulated DEGs from this cluster were genes encoding the SA biosynthetic enzymes  ICS2 and  PAL1 ( Phenyl ammonia lyase 1), the transporter of SA from chloroplast to cytoplasm  EDS5 ( enhanced disease susceptibility 5), the regulator of SA responses  GRX480 ( glutaredoxin 480), the methyl-salicylate (MeSA) esterase proteins  MES7 and  MES9 ( methyl esterase 7 and  9), the defense protein  PR5, and several TFS from WRKY and MYB families. Another small cluster of SA-related genes comprised a group of 22 DEGs that were mainly down-regulated, particularly at the two latest time points of the experiment ( Figure   5A). This cluster was largely formed by TFs that are also responsive to JA. Repressed TFs included members of the ERF/AP2, MYB and GRAS/DELLA families. Other repressed genes beyond TFs were  UGT1 ( UDP-glucose transferase 1), involved in the callose formation, and the genes encoding the  GRP23 and  GRP5 proteins  (glycine-rich proteins 23 and 5), which are components of the plant cell wall. The JA-mediated pathway was composed by 137 DEGs that, similarly to what was observed in the SA-pathway analysis, were mainly up-regulated ( Supplementary Table   S8) ( Figures   6A,B). DEGs were subdivided in three clusters: two larger groups formed by 60 and 54 highly and mildly up-regulated genes, respectively, and a small one composed by 23 genes that were mostly down-regulated ( Figure   6A). Highly induced JA-related genes ( Supplementary Table   S8) at the beginning of the infestation code for proteins acting upstream on the JA pathway such as the DAMP receptor  PEPR2 ( PEP1 receptor 2) and the JA-biosynthetic and modifying enzymes  AOS ( allene oxide synthase) , AOC2 and  AOC3 ( allene oxide cyclase 2 and  3) , LOX2, LOX3, and  LOX4 ( lipoxygenase 2,  3, and  4),  OPCL1 ( OPC-8:0 CoA ligase 1) and  JMT ( JA carboxyl methyltransferase) ( Supplementary Table   S8). DEGs induced at the two first experimental time points also included terpene synthases ( TPS03,  TPS04, and  TPS10), several JAZ (  jasmonate-zim-domain) proteins ( JAZ1, JAZ2, JAZ5, JAZ7, JAZ8, JAZ9/TIFY7, and  JAZ10) and the TFs  MYC2 and  ERF1. Genes with high expression at later time points encode proteins directly involved in defense such as the marker responsive protein of the ERF-branch  PDF1.2 ( plant defensin 1.2), and proteins involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis such as  UF3GT ( UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase). Other highly up-regulated DEGs included MYB TFs, the DELLA protein  RGL3 that contributes to JA/ET-mediated defenses, the ERF-branch TFs  ERF2 and  ORA59 ( octadecanoid-responsive Arabidopsis AP2/ERF59), the responsive gene  THI2.1 ( thionin 2.1), and the JA oxidases  JOX1 and  JOX2 that down-regulate plant immunity by hydroxylation and inactivation of JA. Genes from the JA pathway that were mildly induced ( Supplementary Table   S8) at the first time points included those coding for the JA-biosynthetic enzymes  ACX1 ( acyl-CoA oxidase 1) and  AOC4, the TF  WRKY70 that acts on the SA-JA antagonism, the negative regulators of JA-responsive genes  NINJA ( novel interactor of JAZ) and  JAZ3, and the proteins  MYB34 and  SOT16 ( sulfotransferase 16) involved in the synthesis of glucosinolates. Later in the infestation, the group of mildly induced genes included those coding for the proteins  MYB75/PAP1 and  TT4 that act in the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanin, the  MYB51 and  FMOGS-OX7 proteins involved in the synthesis of glucosinolates, and the responsive marker genes of the MYC-branch  VSP1 and  VSP2 ( vegetative storage proteins 1 and  2), which directly act during the anti-herbivory defense. Two essential modulator genes of the JA signaling, i.e.,  RGLG3 (ring domain ligase 3) and the  MYC3 TF were induced at all the assessed time points although at low expression levels.  RGLG3 encodes for a RING-ubiquitin ligase acting upstream of JA-Ile recognition and MYC3 operates together with MYC2 coordinating the expression of responsive genes from the MYC-branch. The down-regulated JA cluster comprised DEGs that were mainly repressed at 2 and 6 dai ( Supplementary Table   S8). Some of them encode TF commonly acting in the SA-pathway such as members of the families: ERF ( RAP2.6 and  DREB26), MYB ( MYBS1,  MYB28,  MYB29, and  MYB16), and GRAS/DELLA ( RGL1 and  RGL2). Other repressed genes were those encoding the  BAT5 ( bile acid transporter 5) protein and the  MYB76 TF, both required for the biosynthesis of glucosinolates, the DAMP receptor  PEPR1, and the JA-repressed protein  AGP31 (arabinogalactan protein 31). SA and JA Levels Increase in Mite-Infested Plants Both SA and JA biosynthetic and responsive genes were induced in  Brevipalpus mite-infested plants. To confirm the consistency of the observed molecular data, the profiles of the SA and JA hormones were determined in Arabidopsis plants challenged with  Brevipalpus mites. SA ( Figure   5C) and JA ( Figure   6C) levels were 1.5- and 2.8-fold higher, respectively, on infested leaves when compared to the control ones (Student’s  t-test, α ≤ 0.05). Salicylic acid and JA levels were also verified in systemic leaves of mite-infested plants. No difference was observed between the levels of both hormones in systemic and non-infested control leaves, suggesting a local rather than a systemic response to  Brevipalpus mite infestation. Brevipalpus Mites Have a Decreased Performance on Plants Impaired in SA Responses Salicylic acid- and JA-mediated pathways were clearly induced upon  Brevipalpus mite infestation. To further explain the functional relevance of the plant hormonal pathways on the interaction, the performance of  B. yothersi mites was evaluated on Arabidopsis plants impaired in SA or JA-mediated response. Mite oviposition was assessed on mutants defective in SA biosynthesis ( salicylic acid induction deficient2, sid2) and signaling ( non-expressor of pathogenesis-related protein1, npr1), and JA signaling ( jasmonate resistant1, jar1 and  coronatine-insensitive1, coi1). Plants were infested with adult female mites and the number of laid eggs was counted after 6 days. The number of eggs per plant was 2.4- and 1.5-fold lower on SA-mutants  sid2 and  npr1, respectively, when compared to the mite’s performance in the infested wild-type  A. thaliana Col-0 plants used as control (Student’s  t-test, α ≤ 0.05) ( Figure   5D). No difference was observed between the number of eggs on the mutants affected in the JA pathway ( jar1 and  coi1) and the wild-type control (Student’s  t-test, α ≤ 0.05) ( Figure   6D). These results point to a role of SA-mediated response promoting the  Brevipalpus mite colonization.","False-spider mites of the genus  Brevipalpus  are highly polyphagous pests that attack hundreds of plant species of distinct families worldwide. Besides causing direct damage, these mites may also act as vectors of many plant viruses that threaten high-value ornamental plants like orchids and economically important crops such as citrus and coffee. To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind plant-mite interaction we used an RNA-Seq approach to assess the global response of  Arabidopsis thaliana  (Arabidopsis) plants along the course of the infestation with  Brevipalpus yothersi , the main vector species within the genus. Mite infestation triggered a drastic transcriptome reprogramming soon at the beginning of the interaction and throughout the time course, deregulating 1755, 3069 and 2680 genes at 6 hours after infestation (hai), 2 days after infestation (dai), and 6 dai, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a clear modulation of processes related to the plant immune system. Co-expressed genes correlated with specific classes of transcription factors regulating defense pathways and developmental processes. Up-regulation of defensive responses correlated with the down-regulation of growth-related processes, suggesting the triggering of the growth-defense crosstalk to optimize plant fitness. Biological processes (BPs) enriched at all time points were markedly related to defense against herbivores and other biotic stresses involving the defense hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Levels of both hormones were higher in plants challenged with mites than in the non-infested ones, supporting the simultaneous induction of genes from both pathways. To further clarify the functional relevance of the plant hormonal pathways on the interaction, we evaluated the mite performance on Arabidopsis mutants impaired in SA- or JA-mediated response. Mite oviposition was lower on mutants defective in SA biosynthesis ( sid2 ) and signaling ( npr1 ), showing a function for SA pathway in improving the mite reproduction, an unusual mechanism compared to closely-related spider mites. Here we provide the first report on the global and dynamic plant transcriptome triggered by  Brevipalpus  feeding, extending our knowledge on plant-mite interaction. Furthermore, our results suggest that  Brevipalpus  mites manipulate the plant defensive response to render the plant more susceptible to their colonization by inducing the SA-mediated pathway.","['Salicylic acid', 'Tetranychus', 'plant hormones', 'jasmonic acid', 'Rna-seq', 'Cross-talk', 'Plant–herbivore Interaction', 'Defense Pathways']","['Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Figure', 'Supplementary', 'genes', 'response', 'Brevipalpus mite', 'DEGs', 'Table', 'Mite infestation']","[mite-infested, mite-infested, DESeq2, α ≤, mite-infested, qPCR-driven, BPs, mite-plant, BPs, MFs, α ≤, BPs, BinGO, ” “, ” “, ”, “camalexins, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, ”, “SA, ”, “JA, ”, ”, “cell wall, ”, “callose, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “biotic”, “, ”, “, ”, “, SA, JA, abscisic acid, ABA, CK, GA, “, ”, “, chitin, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “, ” “, ”, “JA, ”, BPs, “salicylic acid, ”, “, MAPK, ”, ” “cell wall, ”, “lignin, ”, ”, “flavonoid, ”, “, ” “, ” “, ” “, ” “cellular, ”, “plant-type cell wall, ”, “pectin, ” “, ” “glucan, ” “carbohydrate, ”, “polysaccharide”, BPs, “, ” “, ” “, ”, BPs, “, ”, “hormone-mediated, ”, BPs, “immune, ”, SA, ABA-mediated, “, ” “, ”, “phytoalexin, ”, BPs, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “cell wall, ”, “cytoskeleton, ”, BPs, ”, “cotyledon, ”, BPs, “, ” “electron, ” “, ” “, ”, “chlorophyll, ”, CK, BR, SA, JA, α ≤, 2.47E-33, AP2/ERF (40, SA, α ≤, MYC-branch, WRKY, mite-plant, WRKY, MYB, bZIP, MYB, bZIP, MYC2, MYC-branch, SA, JA, SA-, Mite-Infested, SA, “, ”, “SA, ”, “, ” “, ”, “JA, ”, SA, isochorismate synthase 1, pathogenesis-related protein 1, plant-mite, pathogenesis-related protein 2/beta-1,3-glucanase 2, receptor-like kinase, cysteine-rich RLK 9, WAK1, L-type lectin receptor kinase LCRK-S.2, LCRK-IV.1, LCRK-IX.2, Phenyl ammonia lyase 1, SA, glutaredoxin 480, MeSA) esterase proteins, WRKY, MYB, ERF/AP2, MYB, GRAS/DELLA, UDP-glucose transferase 1, glycine-rich proteins 23, JA-related, DAMP receptor, PEP1 receptor 2, JA-biosynthetic, AOC2, LOX2, lipoxygenase 2, CoA ligase 1, TPS03, JAZ, JAZ1, JAZ2, JAZ5, JAZ7, JAZ8, JAZ9/TIFY7, MYB TFs, DELLA, octadecanoid-responsive Arabidopsis AP2/ERF59, JA-biosynthetic enzymes, acyl-CoA oxidase 1, TF  , JAZ, MYC-branch  VSP1, TF, RING-ubiquitin ligase acting upstream, MYC3, MYC2, MYC-branch, MYB, MYBS1, GRAS/DELLA ( RGL1, DAMP receptor, arabinogalactan protein 31, JA, Mite-Infested, SA, JA, mite-infested, SA, α ≤, JA, mite-infested, deficient2, non-expressor, pathogenesis-related protein1, JA, jasmonate resistant1, ’s, α ≤, α ≤]","['TPS03,', 'TPS04,', 'TPS10),']",[],[],terpene synthase
72,72,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6117411\eupmc_result.json,PMC6117411,"Results and Discussion Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Terpenoids in  R. tomentosa Leaves Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) technique was used to analyze volatile compound composition of the young and mature leaves in  R. tomentosa. We identified four monoterpenes ((+)-α-pinene, (−)-α-pinene, (+)-β-pinene and (−)-β-pinene) and two sesquiterpenes (β-caryophyllene and α-humulene) by virtue of authentic standards and GC–MS database ( Table   1 and  Supplementary Figure   S1). Among them, (+)-α-pinene and β-caryophyllene were most abundant in the leaves, representing 88.43 and 6.68% of total terpenoids in the young leaves, and 85.42 and 10.24% in the mature leaves. With the exception of β-caryophyllene, other compounds were more abundant in the young leaves than in the mature leaves. These results suggest that young leaves are more efficient in terpenoids biosynthesis. Plant terpenoids can be divided into inducible and constitutive compounds. Inducible terpenes (e.g., β-ocimene) are synthesized  de novo in response to herbivore damage ( Paré and Tumlinson, 1997), whereas constitutive terpenes (e.g., α-pinene and β-caryophyllene) are stored in subepidermal pigment glands, and are immediately released upon herbivore feeding and leaf damage ( Elzen et al., 1985;  McCall et al., 1994;  Röse et al., 1996;  Paré and Tumlinson, 1997). Usually, glandular trichomes are more abundant in the young leaves, thus explaining why the young leaves of  R. tomentosa possess more mono- and sesqui-terpenes. Illumina Sequencing,  de novo Assembly and Function Annotation In order to further understand the molecular mechanism of terpenoid biosynthesis in  R. tomentosa, a comprehensive transcriptome in  R. tomentosa leaves were performed, which generated a total of 202,153,314 clean reads (total length of 30,431,756,559; 30.4 Gb) after removing the adaptor sequences, ambiguous reads, and low-quality reads (Q20 < 20) ( Supplementary Table   S1). The Q20 (sequencing error rate < 1%) and GC percentages were 97.50 and 48.45%, 97.47 and 48.96%, 95.92 and 50.17%, respectively ( Supplementary Table   S1). The high-quality reads were deposited in the NCBI SRA database (accession number:  SRP132648). Considering unavailable reference genome for  R. tomentosa, Trinity (Trinityrnaseq_r20131110) were used to  de novo assemble all of the clean reads ( Grabherr et al., 2011). A total of 146,480 contigs ranging from 201 to 21,224 bp, with a mean length of 1,379 bp and an N50 length of 2,161 bp were assemble ( Supplementary Table   S1). Overall, these transcripts represented 83,175 unigenes with an average length of 888 bp and an N50 length of 1,702 bp, among which 53,334 coding DNA sequences (CDS) were detected ( Supplementary Table   S1). By searching against five public protein databases, a total of 53,742 unigenes (64.61%) were annotated. Among them, the unigenes matched to NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), SWISS-PROT, eukaryotic ortholog groups (KOG), kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) and gene ontology (GO) databases were 49,545 (59.57%), 42,547(51.15%), 35,016 (42.09%), 26,096 (31.37%) and 8,902 (10.7%), respectively ( Supplementary Table   S2). The KEGG pathway-based analysis could help in understanding the biological functions of genes. A total of 12,533 unigenes were annotated and assigned to 132 KEGG pathways. The category with the largest number of unigenes was metabolism, which included amino acid metabolism (1,991 unigenes, 16.41%), biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites (710, 5.85%), carbohydrate metabolism (3,683, 30,36%), energy metabolism (2,016, 16.62%), glycan biosynthesis and metabolism (229, 1.89%), lipid metabolism (1,225, 10.10%), metabolism of cofactors and vitamins (672, 5.54%), metabolism of other amino acids (618, 5.09%), metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides (439, 3.62%), and nucleotide metabolism (549, 4.53%) ( Supplementary Figure   S2A). With regards to terpenoid and polyketide metabolism, the most represented category was terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (168, 38.27%), followed by carotenoid biosynthesis (92, 20.96%); limonene and pinene degradation (42, 9.57%); diterpenoid biosynthesis (38, 8.66%); brassinosteroid biosynthesis (31, 7.06%); sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis (28, 6.38%); monoterpenoid biosynthesis (22, 5.01%); and zeatin biosynthesis (18, 4.10%) ( Supplementary Figure   S2B). Candidate Genes Encoding Enzymes Involved in Terpenoid Biosynthesis According to the GC–MS results, α/β-pinene, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene constitute the major active components in  R. tomentosa. Among them, (+)-α-pinene and β-caryophyllene were most abundant in the leaves ( Table   1). α-pinene, a monocyclic monoterpene, is an important raw material in the spice synthesis, while β-caryophyllene has antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticarcinogenic properties, enhanced skin penetration properties, and is also an approved food additive ( Cornwell and Barry, 1994;  Kubo et al., 1996;  Lourens et al., 2004;  Singh et al., 2006,  2014;  Huang et al., 2012). Therefore, biosynthesis pathway of α/β-pinene and β-caryophyllene were focused. The synthesis of IPP and its isomer DMAPP known as GPP and FPP precursors involves multistep enzyme catalytic reaction in the MVA and MEP pathways. Interestingly, 138 potential genes encoding these enzymes were identified by blasting the known protein database, including acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase (AACT); hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS); hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR); mevalonate kinase (MK); phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK); diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase (MPD); 1-deoxy- D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS); 1-deoxy- D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR); 2- C-methyl- D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (MCT); 4-diphosphocytidyl-2- C-methyl- D-erythritol kinase (CMK); 2- C-methyl- D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (MCS); ( E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase (HDS); 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HDR); isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase (IPPI) ( Table   2,  Figure   1, and  Supplementary Table   S3). Finally, IPP and isomer DMAPP synthesize GPP and FPP by geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), respectively, which are then diverted to different mono- (e.g., α-pinene) and sesqui-terpenes (e.g., β-caryophyllene), respectively, after a single step enzymatic reaction mediated by TPS ( Keszei et al., 2010;  Koo et al., 2016;  Piechulla et al., 2016) ( Figure   1). Therefore, identifying the function of TPS enzymes in the last step are important for understanding the molecular mechanism of terpenoid synthesis in  R. tomentosa. A total of seven unigenes encoding TPS were identified from the RNA-seq data. The amino acid comparison showed 63–65% similarity and 41–42% identity among RtTPS1 to 4, while RtTPS4-7 have high similarity with 92% and similarity with 91%. Compared with other species, RtTPS1 and RtTPS2 are more homologous to PINS from  G. hirsutum and  Quercus ilex, whereas RtTPS3 to 7 shares high homology with CARS from  Cucumis sativus and  S. lycopersicum ( Supplementary Table   S4). Alignment of the amino acid sequences indicated that RtTPS1 to 7 contain highly conserved motifs along with other known TPSs ( Fischbach et al., 2001;  Lücker et al., 2002;  Mercke et al., 2004;  Schilmiller et al., 2010;  Huang et al., 2013;  Yang et al., 2013) ( Figure   2). An aspartate-rich motif DDxxD is crucial for substrate binding, while DDxxxxxxE functions in metal cofactor binding ( Köllner et al., 2004). Both are required for GPP and FPP ionization ( Rynkiewicz et al., 2001;  Degenhardt et al., 2009). It was reported that RxR motif located 35 amino acids upstream of DDxxD motif has been implicitly involved in the complexation of diphosphate group after substrate ionization, while RR(X)8W motif present in the N-terminal region might participate in the isomerization of the substrate and is characteristic of the majority of TPS-a and TPS-b subfamilies ( Starks et al., 1997;  Bohlmann et al., 1998;  Williams et al., 1998). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that RtTPS1-2 and RtTPS3-7 clustered closely with their orthologs from other plants, belonging to the TPS-b and TPS-a subfamily, respectively ( Figure   3). Enzyme Activity of RtTPS1-4 According to phylogenetic tree analysis, RtTPS1 and RtTPS2 are clustered in the branch of pinene synthase, while RtTPS3 to 7 are clustered in the branch of β-caryophyllene synthase ( Figure   3). Therefore,  RtTPS 1-4 were selected to perform enzyme activity  in vitro by heterologous expression and GC-MS detection. The results showed that RtTPS1-4 produce mainly (+)-α-pinene and (+)-β-pinene, as well as small amounts of (−)-α-pinene and (−)-β-pinene with GPP, while RtTPS1 and RtTPS3 are also active with FPP, producing β-caryophyllene, along with a smaller amount of α-humulene ( Figure   4). RtTPS 1-4 contain all the conserved domains of the TPS family, including the RR(P)X 8W, RXR, and DDXXD (X is any amino acid) motifs, and absolutely conserved arginine, cysteine and histidine residues in active-site ( Bohlmann et al., 1998). However, our results indicated that RtTPS1, RtTPS3-4 can catalyze the formation of α/β-pinene, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene ( Figure   4). The amino acid number of RtTPS1, RtTPS3-4 at upstream of conserved RRX8W motif is 38, 52, and 48, respectively, which result in an incomplete plastidial targeting sequence (62–64 aa) ( Figure   2).  Bohlmann et al. (1998) suggested that short N-terminal sequence may play a role in the isomerization step of the terpenoid cyclization reaction, thus producing multiple pinene isomers and enantiomers. In addition, differences in amino acids between loop and helix in domains may also lead to diverse products.  Phillips et al. (2003) reported that these differences could conceivably determine substrate folding, thereby providing a stereochemical switch. Domain swapping and directed mutagenesis in (−)-(4 S)-limonene synthase (LS) and (−)-(4 S)-limonene/(−)-(1 S, 5 S)-α-pinene synthase (LPS) from  Abies grandis suggested that amino acids in the predicted D through F helix regions are critical for product determination ( Katoh et al., 2004). The chiral analysis showed that RtTPS1-4 can produce more (+)-α-pinene and (+)-β-pinene than (−)-α-pinene and (−)-β-pinene, which may be related to the pH conditions of enzyme activity. TPSs preferentially form (+)-pinenes under acidic conditions, whereas (−)-pinenes is easily formed under alkaline conditions ( Phillips et al., 1999). A pinene synthase from  A. grandis that produces both (−)-α- and (−)-β-pinene in pH 7.5 assay buffer ( Bohlmann et al., 1997). In our experiments, the neutral conditions of pH 7 may contribute to (+)-/(−)-pinenes. The results of enzyme activity are consistent with those detected in volatile oil from leaves. Interestingly, RtTPS1 and RtTPS3 were also able to catalyze FPP to produce β-caryophyllene (65.71% for RtTPS1 and 93.05% for RtTPS3) and α-humulene (34.29% for RtTPS1 and 6.95% for RtTPS3) ( Figure   4B and  Supplementary Table   S7). In previous reports,  G. hirsutum TPS1 (GhTPS1) and OkBCS from  O. kilimandscharicum were also reported to produce mainly β-caryophyllene and smaller amounts of α-humulene ( Huang et al., 2013;  Jayaramaiah et al., 2016). Moreover, the ratio of two substances catalyzed by OkBCS is similar to our results ( Jayaramaiah et al., 2016). In addition, CsTPS4FN, CsTPS5FN and CsTPS9FN in  Cannabis sativa could also collectively catalyze GPP and FPP. Especially, CsTPS5FN was an unusual TPS-b member lacking a N-terminal plastidial targeting sequence, which was able to produce sesquiterpenes when incubated with FPP ( Booth et al., 2017). It is well known that monoterpenes are synthesized in plastids, while sesquiterpenes are synthesized in cytosol ( Jayaramaiah et al., 2016;  Ruan et al., 2016). TPS1 and TPS3 produced monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes simultaneously, but they did not have N-terminal plastid-targeting sequences ( Figures   2,  4). This requires the transport of IPP/DMAPP (GPP and FPP precursor) between plastid and cytosol, as occurs in hop trichomes and snapdragon flowers ( Dudareva et al., 2005;  Wang et al., 2008). Overall, diverse structure and extensive catalytic activities of RtTPS1-4 suggested divergent and convergent functions of  R. tomentosa TPSs in terpene biosynthesis. Expression Patterns of RtTPS1-7 To study the TPS gene expression in the young and mature leaves of  R. tomentosa, we measured the accumulation of  RtTPS 1-7 transcripts using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) ( Figure   5). The expression levels of  RtTPS3, RtTPS4 and  RtTPS7 had significantly expressed levels in the young leaves than in the mature leaves, while  RtTPS1 were more highly expressed in the mature leaves than in the young leaves, and  RtTPS2, RtTPS5 and  RtTPS6 showed similar expression in the two tissues. These results suggest that candidate TPS genes involved in pinene and caryophyllene were differentially regulated at transcriptional level. In terms of the four candidate genes encoding to RtTPS1-4, the expression levels of RtTPS3 and RtTPS4 in the young leaves were higher than that of RtTPS1 and RtTPS2, contributing probably to more pinene biosynthesis in the young leaves. Similarly, high expression level of RtTPS3 may also contribute to high biosynthesis of caryophyllene in the young leaves. However, the expression levels of these genes did not correlate well with the synthetic level in the old leaves, suggesting that other TPS transcripts which failed to identify in our study can lead to accumulation of pinene and caryophyllene in the old leaves, since transcriptome only represents a set of transcripts of a period.","Plant-derived terpenes are effective in treating chronic dysentery, rheumatism, hepatitis, and hyperlipemia. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of terpene biosynthesis in some terpene-abundant Chinese medicinal plants is of great importance. Abundant in mono- and sesqui-terpenes,  Rhodomyrtus tomentosa  (Ait.) Hassk, an evergreen shrub belonging to the family Myrtaceae, is widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, (+)-α-pinene and β-caryophyllene were detected to be the two major components in the leaves of  R. tomentosa , in which (+)-α-pinene is higher in the young leaves than in the mature leaves, whereas the distribution of β-caryophyllene is opposite. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of leaves identified 138 unigenes potentially involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. By integrating known biosynthetic pathways for terpenoids, 7 candidate genes encoding terpene synthase (RtTPS1-7) that potentially catalyze the last step in pinene and caryophyllene biosynthesis were further characterized. Sequence alignment analysis showed that RtTPS1, RtTPS3 and RtTPS4 do not contain typical N-terminal transit peptides (62-64aa), thus probably producing multiple isomers and enantiomers by terpenoid isomerization. Further enzyme activity  in vitro  confirmed that RtTPS1-4 mainly produce (+)-α-pinene and (+)-β-pinene, as well as small amounts of (-)-α-pinene and (-)-β-pinene with GPP, while RtTPS1 and RtTPS3 are also active with FPP, producing β-caryophyllene, along with a smaller amount of α-humulene. Our results deepen the understanding of molecular mechanisms of terpenes biosynthesis in Myrtaceae.","['Biosynthesis', 'Rhodomyrtus tomentosa', 'Terpenoids', 'Transcriptome', 'Terpene Synthases']","['Gas Chromatography', 'Supplementary Table', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Discussion Gas', 'young leaves', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Leaves', 'mature leaves', 'Leaves Gas', 'Figure']","[GC–MS, β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene, Paré, α-pinene, sesqui-terpenes, 30,431,756,559, Trinityrnaseq_r20131110, 146,480, 21,224, SWISS-PROT, 49,545, 35,016 (, 26,096, β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene has antimicrobial, Cornwell, β-caryophyllene, acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase, AACT, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, HMGS, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase, C-methyl- D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, MCT, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2- C-methyl- D-erythritol kinase, C-methyl- D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase, E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase, isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase, geranyl diphosphate synthase, GPPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, FPPS, α-pinene, sesqui-terpenes, TPS enzymes, 63–65, RtTPS4-7, RtTPS1, RtTPS2, TPSs, DDxxxxxxE, metal cofactor binding (, RR(X)8W, RtTPS1-2, RtTPS3-7, RtTPS1-4, RtTPS1, RtTPS2, RtTPS3, β-caryophyllene synthase, RtTPS1-4, RtTPS1, RtTPS3, β-caryophyllene, RXR, DDXXD (X, RtTPS3-4, RtTPS3-4, (−)-(4 S)-limonene synthase, (−)-(4 S)-limonene/(−)-(1 S, LPS, D, RtTPS1-4, (+)-pinenes, (−)-pinenes, (−)-α-, RtTPS1, RtTPS3, β-caryophyllene (65.71, hirsutum TPS1, GhTPS1, OkBCS, OkBCS, CsTPS4FN, CsTPS5FN, CsTPS9FN, CsTPS5FN, TPS1, TPS3, RtTPS1-4, RtTPS1-7, RtTPS4, RtTPS5, RtTPS1-4, RtTPS3, RtTPS4, RtTPS1, RtTPS2, RtTPS3]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS4-7', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS2', 'RtTPS3', 'RtTPS1', 'TPSs', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'RtTPS1-2', 'RtTPS3-7', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-a', 'RtTPS1-4', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS2', 'RtTPS3', 'RtTPS', 'RtTPS1-4', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS3', 'RtTPS', 'TPS', 'RtTPS1,', 'RtTPS3-4', 'RtTPS1,', 'RtTPS3-4', 'RtTPS1-4', 'TPSs', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS3', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS3)', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS3)', 'TPS1', '(GhTPS1)', 'CsTPS4FN,', 'CsTPS5FN', 'CsTPS9FN', 'CsTPS5FN', 'TPS-b', 'TPS1', 'TPS3', 'RtTPS1-4', 'TPSs', 'RtTPS1-7', 'TPS', 'RtTPS', 'RtTPS3,', 'RtTPS4', 'RtTPS7', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS2,', 'RtTPS5', 'RtTPS6', 'TPS', 'RtTPS1-4,', 'RtTPS3', 'RtTPS4', 'RtTPS1', 'RtTPS2,', 'RtTPS3', 'TPS']",[],[],

Flower Developmental Stages and Major Volatile Compound Emissions Flowers of  J. sambac ‘Bifoliatum’ were divided into five developmental stages: (1) Bud stage where all petals were close together; (2) initial-flowering stage, i.e., outside petals started reflex outwardly; (3) flower opening stage in which all petals became reflex and were ready to fully open; (4) flower fully opening stage, all petals completely opened with half of the petals becoming droopy; and (5) initial senescence stage, i.e., petals start withering ( Figure 1). The GC-MS analysis showed that a total of 30 volatile organic compounds were emitted from flowers of  J. sambac ‘Bifoliatum’.  Table 1 presents 13 major compounds (higher chromatographic areas) emitted from living flowers at the five developmental stages. The concentrations were determined relative to the internal control of ethyl decanoate except for α-farnesene which was calculated based on standard curve. Compounds released from closed buds were low except for linalool, a monoterpene, which was 3.89 mg/kg FW (fresh weight). Linalool drastically increased to 41.86 mg/kg FW at stage 2, then dropped to about 22 mg/kg FW at stages 3 and 4, and further decreased to 8.38 mg/kg FW. On the other hand, α-farnesene, a sesquiterpene was detected at stage 2 and increased from 12.08 mg/kg FW to 53.86 mg/kg FW at stage 3, then decreased to 39.03 mg/kg FW at stage 4 and 20.71 at stage 5. Another compound, benzyl acetate exhibited the same emission pattern as α-farnesene but at much lower concentration than α-farnesene. The rest compounds had concentrations much lower than the previously mentioned ones. The 13 compounds identified from living flowers were also the major compounds emitted from excised flowers ( Table 2). Linalool emission was 15.76 mg/kg FW 2 h after excision, increased to 19.52 at 4 h, 22.03 at 8 h, and decreased to 12.66 mg/kg FW at 16 h after excision. The emission of α-farnesene increased from 1.45 mg/kg FW at 2 h after excision to 12.20 mg/kg FW at 4 h, 30.66 mg/kg FW at 8 h and sustained 30.71 mg/kg FW at 16 h after excision. Emitted benzyl acetate was low after excision to 2 h later, but its emission increased to 3.69 mg/kg FW at 4 h, 16.68 mg/kg FW at 8 h, and then decreased to 12.66 mg/kg FW at 16 h. Similar to the living flowers, other compounds in excised flowers were lower. 2.2. Analysis of Key Genes Related to α-Farnesene Biosynthesis Results from the analysis of both living flowers and excised flowers suggested that ( E, E)-α-farnesene was the predominant volatile compound emitted from  J. sambac ‘Bifoliatum’. The biosynthesis of α-farnesene occurs through an isoprenoid pathway, commonly known as Mevalonate pathway (MVP) [ 14]. The α-farnesene biosynthesis uses acetyl CoA as precursor; hydroxymethylglutaric acid (HMG), mevalonic acid, and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) are important intermediates [ 14, 15, 16]. As shown in  Figure 2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (HMGS, EC 2.3.3.10) catalyzed acetyl coenzyme A to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR, AIY26014.1) is a rate-limiting step in the pathway [ 17], and its activity was positively correlated with terpenoid biosynthesis [ 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS, AIY24422.1), another key enzyme of MVP for terpene metabolism in plants, catalyzes sequential condensation reactions of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) with two units of 3-isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) to form 15 carbon farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) [ 24]. Sesquiterpene synthases have been found to use the C15-diphosphate intermediate ( E, E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) [ 25]. Terpene synthase (TPS, EC 4.2.3.20) is responsible for the synthesis of the various terpene molecules from two isomeric 5-carbon precursor ‘building blocks’, leading to 5-carbon isoprene, 10-carbon monoterpenes, 15-carbon sesquiterpenes, and 20-carbon diterpenes, including α-farnesene. Thus, an attempt was made to isolate  HMGS,  HMGR,  FPPS, and  TPS from  J. sambac ‘Bifoliatum’. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for  HMGS,  HMGR,  FPPS, and  TPS were isolated from a cDNA library constructed using flowers of  J. sambac ‘Bifoliatum’. The flank sequences of ESTs were amplified by RACE (rapid-amplification of cDNA ends) PCR to obtain the full length cDNA. GenBank accession numbers for  JsHMGR and  JsFPPS are AIY26014.1 and AIY24422.1, respectively. The isolated full-length cDNA of  JsHMGS has 1808 bp and contains a 1389 bp open reading frame (ORF) ( Table S1). The deduced amino acid sequence of the  JsHMGS shares 70% to 85% similarity with  Zea mays L.,  Brassica rapa L.,  Malus domestica Mill.,  Gossypium raimondii L.,  Glycine max (L.) Merr.,  Nicotiana tabacum L., and  Solanum tuberosum L. ( Figure 3). Phylogenetic analysis showed that  JsHMGS was much closer to  HGMS from  Glycine max than other homologue genes. The full-length cDNA of  JsHMGR is 2274 bp long with 1785 bp ORF. The deduced amino acid sequence of the JsHMGR share 78% to 82% homolog with  Panax ginseng C.A.Mey.,  Litchi chinensis Sonn.,  Panax quinquefolius L.,  Coffea arabica L.,  Gentiana lutea L.,  Solanum tuberosum,  Nicotiana tabacum, and  Withania somnifera L. ( Figure 3). Phylogenetic analysis showed that JsHMGR was rather independent from the homologs in the other species but more closely related to those from  Nicotiana tabacum,  Withania somnifera,  Solanum tuberosum,  Coffea arabica, and  Gentiana lutea ( Figure 3). The cloned full-length cDNA of  JsFPPS is 1394 bp long and contains a 1050 bp ORF. The deduced amino acid sequence of the JsFPPS shares 85%–94% homolog with  Gentiana lutea,  Artemisia annua L.,  Hevea brasiliensis Mull. Arg.,  Bacopa monnieri (L.) Pennerll,  Mentha x  piperita L., and  Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge ( Figure 3).  JsFPPS is more closely associated with  Bacopa monnieri,  Mentha x  piperita, and  Salvia miltiorrhiza. The full-length cDNA of  JsTPS is 1884 bp long and contains a 1491 bp ORF ( Table S2). The deduced amino acid sequence of the  JsTPS shares 49%–75% homology with  Malus domestica,  Pyrus communis L.,  Olea europaea L.,  Lavandula angustifolia Mill.,  Mentha spicata L.,  Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton,  Zingiber offcinale Roscoe.  Citrus junos Siebold ex Tanaka, and  Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A. Gray ex. Hook. Phylogenetic analysis showed that  JsTPS was much closer to  TPS from  Olea europaea and also closer to  TPS from  Malus domestica and  Pyrus communis than from the other mentioned species ( Figure 3). 2.3. Relative Expression of Genes Related to α-Farnesene Biosynthesis The expression patterns of four genes involving α-farnesene biosynthesis at the five flower developmental stages are present in  Figure 4.  JsHMGS expression was low at the flower bud stage and drastically increased at stage 2 and then decreased from stages 3 to 5 ( Figure 4A). The expression of  JsHMGR was also low at the bud stage, gradually increased at stage 2, peaked at stage 4, and then decreased ( Figure 4B).  JsFPPS expression was higher at stage 2, peaked at stage 3, slightly reduced at stage 4, and dramatically reduced at stage 5 ( Figure 4C). The expression pattern of  JsTPS was similar to  JsHMGR, increased from stage 2 to 4 and decreased at stage 5 ( Figure 4D). The analysis of  JsHMGR and  JsTPS in excised flowers showed lower expressions after flowers were excised; however, their expressions sharply increased at 8 h after excision ( Figure 5). 2.4. Effects of Lovastatin on Gene Expression and Volatile Compound Emission Time-course expressions of  JsHMGS,  JsHMGR,  JsFPPS, and  JsTPS in flowers sprayed with lovastatin were compared to those without lovastatin treatment. The spraying signficantly reduced  JsHMGS expression 2 h after spraying ( Figure 6A) and also decreased  JsFPPS expression from 2 to 6 h after spraying ( Figure 6C). The most significant reduction happened in  JsHMGR and  JsTPS expression, and the suppression sustained from 2 to 6 h after lovastatin application ( Figure 6B,D). The suppression of α-farnesene biosynthesis related gene expression also resulted in significant reduction in biosynthesis of volatile compounds including α-farnesene, isoledene, caryophyllene, humulene, copaene, muurolene, and trans-farnesene ( Figure 7). The reductions in α-farnesene, isoledene, muurolene, and trans-farnesene were not just at 4 h but also 6 h after lovastatin application. In fact, the sweet fragance was diminished from flowers 2 h after lovastatin-application.","Fresh jasmine flowers have been used to make jasmine teas in China, but there has been no complete information about volatile organic compound emissions in relation to flower developmental stages and no science-based knowledge about which floral stage should be used for the infusion. This study monitored volatile organic compounds emitted from living flowers of  Jasminum sambac  (L.) Ait. 'Bifoliatum' at five developmental stages and also from excised flowers. Among the compounds identified, α-farnesene, linalool, and benzyl acetate were most abundant. Since α-farnesene is synthesized through the Mevalonate pathway, four genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and terpene synthase were isolated. Their expression patterns in living flowers at the five stages and in excised flowers coincided with the emission patterns of α-farnesene. Application of lovastatin, a HMGR inhibitor, significantly reduced the expression of the genes and greatly decreased the emission of α-farnesene. The sweet scent was diminished from lovastatin-treated flowers as well. These results indicate that α-farnesene is an important compound emitted from jasmine flowers, and its emission patterns suggest that flowers at the opening stage or flower buds 8 h after excision should be used for the infusion of tea leaves.","['Lovastatin', 'jasmine', 'Α-farnesene', 'Terpene Synthase (Tps)', '3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase (Hmgr)', '3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Synthase (Hmgs)', 'Jasminum Sambac (L.)

74,74,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6198442\eupmc_result.json,PMC6198442,"Results Identification and characterization of putative terpene synthase genes in C . puteana A Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis of fungal genomes with conserved terpene synthases sequences resulted in the identification of a large number of putative terpene synthases (TPSs). However, for the majority of TPS candidates, a biochemical and functional characterization remains to be established. In order to gain insight into their catalytic function, three putative TPSs (Copu1: XP_007772164.1; Copu2: XP_007771895.1; Copu3: XP_007765978.1) from  C. puteana were selected for cloning and functional characterization. The specific selection was made on the basis of characteristic conserved sequence motifs. Moreover, Copu1-3 showed closely related amino acid (AA) sequences (55–62% similarity). A comparison of the AA sequence of Copu1 and Copu2 with the public database showed < 50% similarity to other listed enzymes, covering all biological realms. By contrast, Copu3 showed 65% similarity to putative TPS sequences, which were not functionally characterized. The AA sequences of all three enzymes contained typical sequence motifs common to the TPS family, such as the highly conserved (N/D)D(L/I/V)x(S/T)xxxE (NSE) triad and the aspartate-rich D(D/E)xxD motif, coordinating a trinuclear Mg 2+ cluster, which is catalytically essential for the initial hydrolysis of the FPP-derived pyrophosphate group [ 22] (see Additional file  1). A highly conserved arginine residue, indicated as the pyrophosphate sensor, is located 46 positions upstream of the NSE triad. Additionally, the catalytically important RY-dimer, which is involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds to the substrate-derived pyrophosphate, is found 80 AA downstream of the NSE triad and close to the C-terminus [ 23– 25]. Heterologous expression of  C. puteana TPS genes resulted in the generation of diverse sesquiterpenes in  E. coli To study the product profile of Copu1-3, their predicted coding sequences were codon-optimized and synthesized for transfer into  E. coli expression vectors. For the heterologous expression, an adapted production system based on a single operon with a constitutive promoter was constructed. Reported bottleneck enzymes from  E. coli’s native non-mevalonate pathway (MEP) were selected for co-expression (DXS; WP_099145004.1 and idi; AAC32208.1) to increase the precursor supply and enhance the general isoprenoid production (Fig.  1). The resulting plasmids were transformed into  E. coli HMS174 (DE3) for recombinant gene expression and subsequent analysis of new, potential terpene compounds. In the first series of experiments, a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase ( Pantoea ananatis; crtE; ADD79325.1) was additionally integrated into the operon to study a potential function as diterpene synthases.  E. coli cultures co-expressing Copu2 or Copu3 with the MEP bottleneck enzymes for 48 h produced a mixture of exclusively 12 and 18 terpene products, respectively. A cultivation temperature of 30 °C and reduced shaking (90 rpm) ensured an adequate bacterial growth rate and the requirements for the production of potentially volatile compounds. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of the liquid extract revealed new product peaks in both cultures with typical mass fragmentation patterns at 161, 207, 222 m/z and 105, 161, 204 m/z (Fig.  2), illustrating the mass patterns for cyclic C 15 hydrocarbons with and without a single hydroxyl group. Copu3 appeared to be quite selective for the generation of one major STP alcohol (RT: 15.4 min; parent ion at 222 m/z). In contrast, Copu2 appeared to convert FPP into a smaller and slightly different set of cyclization products. The major product of Copu2 fermentations (RT: 14.3 min) was identified as an unhydroxylated STP compound (parent ion at 204 m/z). By contrast, no terpenoid products were detected in  E. coli cultures expressing Copu1. Neither the co-expression with a GGPP synthase to enable a possible formation of diterpenes nor the evaluation of different fermentation temperatures to avoid eventual evaporation of volatile compounds (e.g., monoterpenes) showed any product formation. Therefore, Copu1 was classified as a non-functional TPS sequence.  Terpene purification and structure elucidation A putative identification of the newly generated STPs was performed by comparing their detailed mass spectra to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Database. The comparison of the GC–MS metabolite profiles of  E. coli cultures expressing Copu2 revealed the putative tricyclic STP β-copaene (RT: 14.3 min; parent ion at 204 m/z; major daughter ions at 105, 161 m/z) as the major product. β-Copaene accounted for about 62% of the total STPs detected by GC-FID.  E. coli strains expressing Copu3 accumulated the putative tricyclic STP alcohol cubebol (RT: 15.4 min; parent ion at 222 m/z; major daughter ions at 105, 161, 207 m/z) as the major product, representing 75% of the total terpene fraction (Fig.  2). Other minor compounds from both cultures encompassed δ-cadinene, β-elemene, germacrene D and germacrene D-4-ol, whose GC–MS spectra were consistent with NIST database references. Notably, several minor STPs did not match any NIST reference spectra and could therefore not be assigned. In addition to GC–MS analyses, the main products of Copu2 and Copu3 were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Organic extraction allowed HPLC-based β-copaene and cubebol purification from 1-L fermentations. The HPLC separation of the Copu2 fermentation products allowed for the extraction of the main product but could not resolve several other STPs, which most likely represent a mixture of different product isoforms. However, another minor product was isolated from the Copu3 fermentation broth. A comparison of NMR spectra to reported references confirmed the presence of β-copaene [ 26,  27], cubebol [ 28] and δ-cadinene [ 29] as products of Copu2 and Copu3, respectively. Based on the NMR data, we designated Copu2 as a new β-copaene synthase. Conversely, Copu3 was designated as a new, highly selective cubebol synthase. Interestingly, a rearrangement of β-copaene to the better described α-isomer could be observed in this context. The complete conversion took place by storing the pure compound in chloroform for < 12 h (Fig.  3). α-Copaene has been shown to possess important biological properties, including anticarcinogenic as well as antioxidant activity in the field of neurodegenerative diseases [ 30,  31], or serves as an insect attractant [ 32]. Phylogenetic synthase evolution At present, the identification and characterization of terpene cyclases from the group of Basidiomycota is limited. Protein sequence-based phylogenetic analysis of the 29 genetically and biochemically characterized STPSs derived from Basidiomycota revealed four distinct clades (clade I–IV) (Fig.  4). The clustering by sequence conservation suggests that STPSs within one specific clade may catalyze the same or a related cyclization reaction. It also revealed that Copu2 and Copu3 clustered in clade I together with all other Basidiomycota-derived STPSs, generating either β-copaene or cubebol (ACTPS9, Cop4 and Stehi_128017). Additionally, most enzymes that generated cadinene isoforms clustered in clade I. For several candidate enzymes constituting this clade (Cop4, Omp4, Omp5a and 5b), a substrate cyclization mechanism has already been postulated, involving a 1,10-cyclization of (3R) nerolidyl diphosphate (NPP). The conversion of initial FPP involves the formation of a cis-germacradienyl cation, followed by a subsequent 1,6-cyclization. The final result is various STPs derived from a cadinyl cation (Fig.  5) [ 14,  33,  34]. By contrast, the clade II STPS mechanism involves a 1,10-cyclization of (2E,6E)-FPP to an E,E-germacradienyl cation (Omp1–3, Cop 1–3) [ 35], generating predominantly α-muurolene and germacrene A as well as different types of cadinol. Clade III STPSs share a 1,6-cyclization mechanism of (3R)-NPP or (3S)-NPP, leading to a bisabolyl cation [ 33,  36], forming mainly barbatene or α-cuprenene. Finally, clade IV STPSs share a common 1,11-cyclization mechanism of (2E,6E)-FPP [ 37]. Except for GME9210, all enzymes in this clade exclusively represent functionally characterized Δ6-protoilludene synthases.  In silico homology modeling [ 38] of Copu1-3 as well as Cop4 and structural alignments with the selinadiene cyclase (4OKM), a monomeric STPS from  Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, as a nearest neighbor reference structure were carried out (see Additional file  1). Interestingly, the sequence identity analyses strictly differentiates sequences from distinct organisms while the structural analysis (RMSD calculation) reveals a close structural relation between Copu3 and Cop4. Both enzymes produce δ-cadinene, β-copaene and cubebol. Technical scale, fed-batch production of β-copaene and cubebol To investigate the production performance of Copu2 and Copu3 in an optimized microbial system, fed-batch fermentation experiments were carried out in 1.3-L fermenters. This production scale provided for technically relevant amounts of β-copaene and cubebol.  E. coli HMS174 (DE3) strains co-expressing either Copu2 or Copu3 and the corresponding MEP bottleneck enzymes were cultured at 30 °C under controlled conditions (Fig.  6). The Copu2-expressing culture reached its stationary phase after 46 h with a final calculated OD 600 of 130, providing a final β-copaene titer of 215 mg/L. Based on these data, the specific β-copaene production and productivity were 4.4 mg/g dry cell weight (DCW) and 4.7 mg/L/h, respectively. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of any quantitative biotechnological production of β-copaene. In comparison, the Copu3-based fermentation generated a cubebol titer of 497 mg/L (calculated OD 600 of 182), and the specific cubebol production and productivity even reached 7.2 mg/g DCW and 11.2 mg/L/h, respectively. The reported titers in this study exceeded concentrations of alternative approaches obtained by equivalent fermentations based on a plant-derived cubebol synthase (titers of 10 mg/L cubebol) [ 48] by 50-fold. "," Background Terpenes are an important and extremely versatile class of secondary metabolites that are commercially used in the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics sectors. Genome mining of different fungal collections has revealed the genetic basis for a steadily increasing number of putative terpene synthases without any detailed knowledge about their biochemical properties. The analysis and research of this rich genetic source provides a precious basis for the advancing biotechnological production of an almost endless number of valuable natural metabolites. Results Three annotated terpene synthases from the little investigated Basidiomycota Coniophora puteana were studied in this work. For biochemical characterization, the heterologous expression in E. coli was conducted leading to the identification of two sesquiterpene synthases capable of the highly selective generation of β-copaene and cubebol. These compounds are commercially used as food and flavor additives. The new enzymes show the highest reported product selectivity for their main compounds and therefore represent the first exclusive synthases for β-copaene (62% product selectivity) and cubebol (75% product selectivity) generation. In combination with an optimized heterologous microbial production system, we obtained product titers of 215 mg/L β-copaene and 497 mg/L cubebol. Conclusion The reported product selectivity and our generated terpene titers exceed all published biotechnological data regarding the production of β-copaene and cubebol. This represents a promising and economic alternative to extraction from natural plant sources and the associated complex product purification.","['Fermentation', 'Sesquiterpene', 'Phylogenetic analysis', 'heterologous expression', 'Basidiomycota', 'Copaene', 'Cubebol', 'Coniophora Puteana']","['Search Tool', 'Basic Local', 'β-copaene', 'cubebol', 'Fig.', 'product', 'STPs', 'coli', 'Local Alignment', 'Alignment Search']","[TPSs, Copu1, XP_007772164.1, Copu2, XP_007771895.1, Copu3, Copu1-3, Copu1, Copu2, Copu3, (N/D)D(L/I/V)x(S/T)xxxE, NSE, FPP-derived pyrophosphate, NSE, RY-dimer, NSE, Copu1-3, WP_099145004.1, AAC32208.1, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, Copu2, Copu3, Copu3, Copu2, Copu2, Copu1, GGPP synthase, Copu1, Copu2, Copu3, alcohol cubebol, GC–, Copu2, Copu3, Copu2, Copu3, δ-cadinene [ 29], Copu2, Copu3, Copu2, Copu3, α-isomer, Copu2, Copu3, Basidiomycota-derived, ACTPS9, Stehi_128017, Cop4, Omp4, Omp5a, nerolidyl diphosphate, cis-germacradienyl cation, cadinyl cation, Fig.  5) [ 14, (2E,6E)-FPP, E, E-germacradienyl cation, Omp1–3, (3R)-NPP, (3S)-NPP, (2E,6E)-FPP [ 37], GME9210, Copu1-3, Copu3, β-copaene, Copu2, Copu3, Copu2, Copu3, MEP, Copu2-expressing, ’, Copu3-based, cubebol synthase]","['(TPSs).', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'STPSs', 'STPSs', 'STPSs,', '(ACTPS9,', 'STPS', 'STPSs', 'STPSs', 'STPS']","['C.', 'C.']",[],terpene synthase
79,79,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6299004\eupmc_result.json,PMC6299004,"Results Root herbivory leads to elevated monoterpene emission in poplar As part of our ongoing research on volatile-mediated defenses in poplar, we analyzed the volatiles emitted from undamaged and  M. melolontha (cockchafer)-damaged roots of  P. trichocarpa, a species native to North America, and  P. nigra, an indigenous European species. Trees were grown in sand-filled pots and a push-pull system was used to collect root volatiles from air pumped through the soil (Supplementary Fig.  S1). Volatile analysis was conducted with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Root damage caused by the larvae was monitored after the experiment by measuring the total root biomass. For  P. trichocarpa, cockchafer herbivory led to a significantly reduced root mass in comparison to undamaged controls (Supplementary Fig.  S2). For  P. nigra, however, we could not observe significant differences, although a slight trend of root biomass reduction in the grub treatments was visible (Supplementary Fig.  S2). Undamaged roots of both poplar species released considerable amounts of monoterpenes, including (−)-α-pinene, (−)-camphene, (−)-β-pinene, and 1,8-cineole (Table  1). Two further monoterpenes,  p-cymene and an unidentified compound with a molecular mass of 136, could only be detected in the volatile bouquet of  P. trichocarpa. Herbivory significantly increased the emission of 1,8-cineole from  P. trichocarpa, while (−)-camphene and an unidentified monoterpene were significantly induced in herbivore-damaged roots of  P. nigra (Table  1). Beside monoterpenes, both species also constitutively emitted the aromatic compounds benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, and salicylaldehyde, however, emission of these compounds was not influenced by the herbivore treatment (Supplementary Table  S1). Considering that the plastics pots and the moist sand in the volatile collection system both might adsorb plant-released volatiles, our quantification of constitutive and herbivore-induced root volatiles in  P. trichocarpa and  P. nigra is likely an underestimation of the total volatile release. To measure the potential accumulation of volatile compounds in the roots, we extracted plant material with hexane and analyzed the extracts using GC-MS. While the aromatic volatiles benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, and salicylaldehyde accumulated in root material collected from  P. trichocarpa and  P. nigra, monoterpenes (camphene) could only be detected in the extracts of  P. nigra (Supplementary Table  S2). Interestingly, salicylaldehyde and benzaldehyde showed significantly increased accumulation after cockchafer herbivory, although their emission rates were not influenced by the treatment as already mentioned above (Supplementary Tables  S1 and  S2). Identification and characterization of three monoterpene synthases in  P. trichocarpa and  P. nigra The recently identified terpene synthase PnTPS1 produces camphene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene and has been shown to be involved in herbivore-induced monoterpene formation in the leaves of  P. nigra22. Another monoterpene synthase, the 1,8-cineole synthase PtTPS13, was reported to be expressed in herbivore-damaged leaves of  P. trichocarpa20. Since products of both enzymes were found in the volatile bouquets of herbivore-induced  P. trichocarpa and  P. nigra roots (Table  1), we hypothesized that these or similar enzymes are also involved in the formation of root terpenes. To identify potential orthologues of  PnTPS1 and  PtTPS13 in  P. trichocarpa and  P. nigra, respectively, we amplified the open reading frames from cDNA made from  M. melolontha-damaged root material. Amplification and cloning were successful and the resulting genes were designated  PtTPS21 ( P. trichocarpa genome version 3.0 accession, Potri.001G308300) and  PnTPS4, respectively, according to the poplar TPS nomenclature initiated in previous studies 19,  20,  22. Sequencing of several amplicons revealed another  P. trichocarpa gene with 97% nucleotide similarity to  PtTPS21 that was designated  PtTPS16 (Potri.001G308200). A sequence comparison and dendrogram analysis of predicted monoterpene synthase genes in the  P.  trichocarpa genome showed that  PtTPS16 and  PtTPS21 were part of a gene cluster comprising four members highly similar to each other (Fig.  1). Heterologous expression of the N-terminal truncated open reading frames of the identified sequences lacking their putative signal peptides and subsequent enzyme assays confirmed monoterpene synthase activity for all tested enzymes. As expected, PtTPS21 and PnTPS4 had the same activity as their putative orthologues, PnTPS1 and PtTPS13, respectively, and produced camphene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene (PtTPS21) and 1,8-cineole and a few minor products (PnTPS4) (Fig.  2). Interestingly, PtTPS16, although highly similar to PtTPS21, showed different product specificity and produced γ-terpinene together with a mixture of minor monoterpene products (Fig.  2). Chiral analysis of PtTPS21 enzyme products showed that all of the produced monoterpenes were exclusively formed as (−)-enantiomers (Fig.  3). When tested with the sesquiterpene precursor ( E,E)-FPP, PnTPS4 showed activity and produced a mixture of sesquiterpens including ( E)-α-bergamotene, ( E)-β-farnesene, ( E,E)-α-farnesene, sesquiphellandrene, ( Z)-α-bisabolene, and nerolidol (Supplementary Fig.  S3). However, since PnTPS4 was found to possess a signal peptide that targets the protein to the plastids (Supplementary Fig  S4), it functions most likely as monoterpene synthase in planta. In contrast to PnTPS4, PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 were not active with ( E,E)-FPP. The diterpene substrate ( E,E,E)-GGPP was not accepted by the tested enzymes. Homology modeling of PtTPS16 and  in vitro mutagenesis of active site residues To identify the amino acid residues that determine the observed differences in product specificity of PtTPS16 and PtTPS21, we performed homology modeling of the three-dimensional structure of PtTPS16 using the crystal structure of (+)-limonene synthase from  Citrus sinensis23 as a template. Visualization of the resulting model and an amino acid sequence comparison of PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 revealed four amino acid substitutions within the active site pockets of the two proteins (Fig.  4; Supplementary Fig.  S5).  In vitro mutagenesis of the single residues isoleucine 335, valine 441, and valine 483 in PtTPS16 revealed no or only marginal changes in product specificity of the resulting mutant enzymes PtTPS16 I335V, PtTPS16 V441I, and PtTPS16 V483L, while a mutation of threonine 336 to asparagine led to an enzyme able to produce camphene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene in addition to γ-terpinene (Fig.  5). Different combinations of single amino acid changes finally showed that the quadruple mutant PtTPS16 I335V, T336N, V441I, V483L had a product specificity highly similar to PtTPS21, although there were still minor quantitative differences in the product profiles of the mutant and PtTPS21 (Fig.  5). Gene expression analysis of terpene synthases in poplar roots The expression levels of  P. trichocarpa PtTPS13,  PtTPS16, and  PtTPS21 and  P. nigra PnTPS4 and  PnTPS1 were measured in undamaged and  M. melolontha-damaged roots using qRT-PCR. The 1,8-cineole synthase genes  PtTPS13 and  PnTPS4 were less expressed in undamaged roots than the other genes, but showed significant upregulation upon root herbivory (Fig.  6). Expression of  PnTPS1 was also significantly induced by the herbivore treatment.  PtTPS21 and  PtTPS16 showed a trend towards higher expression levels in damaged-roots, although it was not significant when compared to expression levels in undamaged control roots (Fig.  6). 1,8-Cineole reduces the growth of the plant pathogen  Phytophthora cactorum in vitro Phytophthora cactorum (Oomycetes) is a widespread plant pathogen that can infest numerous plant species including crops and trees 24. Infection by this pathogen often results in root rot and causes massive yield losses or even plant death. To prove the hypothesis that herbivore-induced root monoterpenes might play a role in protecting wounded roots against soil-borne pathogens, we tested the influence of volatile 1,8-cineole, (−)-β-pinene, and (−)-limonene on the growth of  P. cactorum in vitro. 2-Phenylethanol, a common plant volatile known to have antifungal activity 25, was also included into the experiment. While 2-phenylethanol, (−)-limonene, and mineral oil as negative control had no influence on the growth of  P. cactorum, 1,8-cineole and (−)-β-pinene significantly reduced the growth of this pathogen when present in the headspace (Fig.  7).","Volatiles are often released upon herbivory as plant defense compounds. While the formation of volatiles above-ground has been intensively studied, little is known about herbivore-induced root volatiles. Here, we show that cockchafer larvae-damaged roots of Populus trichocarpa and P. nigra release a mixture of monoterpenes, including (-)-α-pinene, (-)-camphene, (-)-β-pinene, p-cymene, and 1,8-cineole. Three terpene synthases, PtTPS16 and PtTPS21 from P. trichocarpa and PnTPS4 from P. nigra, could be identified and characterized in vitro. PnTPS4 was found to produce 1,8-cineole as sole product. PtTPS16 and PtTPS21, although highly similar to each other, showed different product specificities and produced γ-terpinene and a mixture of (-)-camphene, (-)-α-pinene, (-)-β-pinene, and (-)-limonene, respectively. Four active site residues were found to determine the different product specificities of the two enzymes. The expression profiles of PtTPS16, PtTPS21, and PnTPS4 in undamaged and herbivore-damaged poplar roots generally matched the emission pattern of monoterpenes, indicating that monoterpene emission in roots is mainly determined at the gene transcript level. Bioassays with Phytophtora cactorum (Oomycetes) revealed inhibitory effects of vapor-phase 1,8-cineole and (-)-β-pinene on the growth of this important plant pathogen. Thus herbivore-induced volatile monoterpenes may have a role in defense against pathogens that cause secondary infections after root wounding.",,"['North America', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'Fig.', 'Supplementary', 'Supplementary Table', 'Root', 'trichocarpa', 'indigenous European', 'roots', 'nigra']","[(−)-camphene, nigra (, PnTPS1, α-pinene, β-pinene, nigra22, trichocarpa20, nigra roots, Potri.001G308300, Potri.001G308200, PtTPS21, PnTPS4, PnTPS1, PtTPS13, α-pinene, β-pinene, PtTPS21, PtTPS16, PtTPS21, PtTPS21, (−)-enantiomers (Fig.  3, E)-FPP, PnTPS4, PnTPS4, PnTPS4, PtTPS16, PtTPS21, E, E)-FPP, E, E)-GGPP, PtTPS16, PtTPS16, PtTPS21, PtTPS16, sinensis23, PtTPS16, PtTPS21, PtTPS16 V441I, PtTPS16 V483L, α-pinene, β-pinene, PtTPS16 I335V, T336N, V483L, PtTPS21, PtTPS21 (, PtTPS13, damaged-roots, crops]","['PnTPS1', 'PtTPS13,', 'PnTPS1', 'PtTPS13', 'PtTPS21', 'PnTPS4,', 'TPS', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS21', 'PnTPS4', 'PnTPS1', 'PtTPS13,', '(PtTPS21)', '(PnTPS4)', 'PtTPS16,', 'PtTPS21,', 'PtTPS21', 'PnTPS4', 'PnTPS4', 'PnTPS4,', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS21,', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS16', 'PtTPS21,', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS13,', 'PtTPS16,', 'PtTPS21', 'PnTPS4', 'PnTPS1', 'PtTPS13', 'PnTPS4', 'PnTPS1', 'PtTPS21', 'PtTPS16']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
83,83,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6421710\eupmc_result.json,PMC6421710,"Results The monoterpene synthases (MTS) selected for this study are listed in Table  1. Codon optimized MTS genes were cloned into a binary vector designed for  Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation (ATMT) where expression is driven by the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter ( pGAPDH). An example of the vector harboring the  Hypoxylon sp.  E74060B Hyp3 1,8-cineole MTS gene is shown in Fig.  2a. These constructs can be used to randomly integrate transgenes into the genome of  R. toruloides IFO0880 by ATMT or electroporation depending on how they are prepared, which adds flexibility to the engineering strategies. Sixteen constructs harboring MTS genes for the production of nine different monoterpenes were transformed into  R. toruloides by either ATMT or electroporation and at least twenty individual transformants from either transformation approach were analyzed for production of target monoterpenes by GC–MS. The relative efficiency of these two transformation methods was compared using the 1,8-cineole MTS and is described in detail below.  Two different analytical approaches were used to maximize the chances of detecting monoterpene product: (i) the use of an organic dodecane overlay to extract monoterpenes from liquid cultures and (ii) Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) of monoterpenes from the headspaces of solid medium cultures (Table  1). The first approach has a monoterpene detection sensitivity of greater than 1 mg/L, while the SPME analysis is more sensitive and can detect trace levels of monoterpenes. The production and analysis of each monoterpene is described in detail in the following sections. Comparison of electroporation and ATMT transformation methods using the 1,8-cineole MTS Two types of transformation methods have been established in  R. toruloides, electroporation and ATMT, each using a fundamentally different method for introducing recombinant DNA into the cell. The  Hypoxylon fungal 1,8-cineole  Hyp3 MTS gene (described in more detail in the next section) was transformed using both methods in order to select the most reliable method for subsequent transformations. Since both transformation methods established in  R. toruloides randomly integrate variable copies of heterologous DNA into the genome via NHEJ, a number of transformants must be screened in order to identify the integrant with the optimal copy number and integration site to produce the maximum detectable amount of the target monoterpene. To compare the two transformation methods, 1,8-cineole titers were determined for 40 and 50 independent transformants from ATMT and electroporation, respectively. It was found that all of the ATMT transformants and 70% of electroporation transformants produced 1,8-cineole in dodecane overlaid liquid cultures (Fig.  2b). Despite the difference in the number of productive transformants, both methods generated transformants that produced the same maximum titer of 1,8-cineole (see below). These results suggest that fewer transformants need to be screened using the ATMT method to identify highly productive strains, so ATMT method was employed to transform the remaining MTS constructs. Monoterpene production in  R. toruloides The  Hypoxylon fungal 1,8-cineole synthase  Hyp3 is the first identified fungal monoterpene synthase that has the conserved critical asparagine residues commonly found in plant synthase [ 58]. Overexpression of  HYP3 in  R. toruloides yielded many transformants that produced 1,8-cineole in dodecane overlay cultures. The highest cineole titer obtained by electroporation was 15.45 mg/L, and 15.81 mg/L by ATMT (Fig.  2b). A single major product was detected at a retention time (RT) of 6.42 min with a MS spectrum that is identical to an authentic 1,8-cineol standard, indicating that 1,8-cineole is the sole product of this MTS (Fig.  2c). Shaw et al. illustrated that  Hyp3 produced minor amounts of  d-limonene (about 5% of the total product) in  E. coli, but only 1,8-cineole was detected in  R. toruloides. A second 1,8-cineole synthase encoded by the  Streptomyces clavuligerus gene  SSCG_00536 CnsA was also screened.  CnsA is the first identified bacterial monoterpene cyclase that catalyzes the direct conversion of GPP into 1,8-cineole [ 59]. When the  CnsA gene was expressed in  R. toruloides, only trace amounts of 1,8-cineole were detected in the dodecane overlay of a liquid culture. By SPME analysis, a major 1,8-cineole product with RT of 6.38 min was detected (Fig.  2d). A truncated Snapdragon  Antirrhinum majus (E)-β-Ocimene Synthase ( ama0a23) was expressed in  R. toruloides, producing (E)-β-ocimene as a major product, and (Z)-β-ocimene and myrcene as minor products, detected by SPME (Fig.  3a). These results are consistent with a study in which the cell free extracted MTS protein produced by  E. coli was incubated with GPP and formed (E)-β-ocimene (97%), (Z)-β-ocimene (2%), and myrcene (1%) [ 60]. The  Licea cubeba ocimene synthase  LcTPS was also overexpressed in  R. toruloides, but no product could be detected by either dodecane overlay or SPME analysis.  The grand fir ( Abies grandis) (4S)-Limonene synthase  Ag10 was overexpressed in  R. toruloides and SPME analysis detected a major peak of limonene and minor peaks of α-pinene and β-pinene (Fig.  2b). Two additional compounds with mass fragmentation patterns indicative of monoterpenes were detected, but their identities could not be clearly determined due to a lack of authentic standards. Bohlmann et al. functionally characterized  Ag10 and also detected limonene, α-pinene, and β-pinene, as well as β-phellandrene [ 61]. The mass spectrum of one of the unidentified products in  R. toruloides was examined with the Wiley MS database library probability-based matching algorithm, and the results suggest that it is likely β-phellandrene. No match could be found for the second unidentified compound found. Two pinene synthases,  Pinus taeda PT30 and  Abies grandis AG3.18, were expressed in  R. toruloides and examined by SPME as shown in Fig.  3c and d, respectively. A single compound, α-pinene, was produced by  R. toruloides transformants expressing  PT30 gene, while both α-pinene and β-pinene were produced by transformants expressing the  AG3.18 gene. These results are consistent with previous characterizations of cell-free extracts of these enzymes expressed in  E. coli supplied with GPP as substrate [ 61,  62]. Two sabinene synthases,  Citrus jambhiri RlemTPS2 and  Salvia pomifera Sabs1, were expressed in  R. toruloides. No detectable sabinene was produced by strains expressing  RlemTPS2, while SPME analysis of the  Sabs1 strains detected sabinene and several other minor products (Fig.  3e). The three minor peaks could not be identified but produced mass fragmentation patterns indicative of monoterpenes (Fig.  3e). In a previous study of the  Sabs1 recombinant protein using GPP as substrate, several olefin monoterpenes were identified, including sabinene (63%), γ-terpinene (21%), terpinolene (7.0%), and limonene (6.5%) [ 63]. In contrast, Kampranis et al. reported that  Sabs1 produced sabinene and myrcene [ 64], indicating that this enzyme can produce different products depending on the experimental conditions, making it difficult to speculate on the identity of other monoterpenes produced in  R. toruloides along with sabinene. Two carene synthases,  Picea abies PaJF67 and  Salvia stenophylla TpsB, were expressed in  R. toruloides and only transformants expressing  TpsB produced monoterpenes (Fig.  3f). A major peak of 3-carene was detected and verified with an authentic standard, while minor amounts of mycene, 4-carene, and limonene were also produced. Three additional compounds with monoterpene mass fragmentation patterns were also detected but could not be identified. And examination of the mass spectrum using the Wiley MS database library probability-based matching algorithm suggests that one of these unidentified peaks may be β-phellandrene, which agrees with a previous study of characterization of this enzyme. In that study, cell free enzyme assay of recombinant  TpsB expressed in  E. coli revealed that this enzyme can convert GPP to (+)-3-carene (73%), (−)-limonene (13%), myrcene (6%), 4-carene (4%), and β-phellandrene (1%) [ 65]. Measuring the GPP and FPP pools in  R. toruloides by over-expression of the FaNES1 gene The expression of 16 MTS genes that are able to produce 9 different major monoterpenes in  R. toruloides revealed that most of the MTS enzymes did not produce significant amounts of product. Only the  Hypoxylon Hyp3 enzyme could drive the production of appreciable amounts of 1,8-cineole, and even then, only in mg/L quantities. These results suggest that, like  S. cerevisiae, the GPP pool in  R. toruloides may have been limiting monoterpene production. In  S. cerevisiae GPP is converted directly to FPP by  ERG20. To assess whether this phenomenon also occurs in  R. toruloides, the ratio of these two metabolites was determined. A low GPP/FPP ratio would indicate that GPP is limiting. A bifunctional linalool (monoterpene/GPP) and nerolidol (sesquiterpene/FPP) synthase  FaNES1 from strawberry was expressed and the ratio of these GPP/FPP-derived products was determined. A total of 20 independent transformants were examined, and while nerolidol was detected in several of them (up to 24 mg/L), no linalool was detected (Fig.  4). This observation is consistent with what was found in  S. cerevisiae and suggests that the low level of GPP in  R. toruloides is limiting monoterpene production and further engineering of the MEV pathway would be required to elevate monoterpene titers beyond what was observed in this study [ 40].  Conversion of lignocellulose hydrolysate to 1,8-cineole To evaluate the ability of  R. toruloides to convert lignocellulose into monoterpenes, the strain producing the highest levels of 1,8-cineole in rich media (15.81 mg/L) was cultivated in the corn stover DMR-EH (Deacetylated, Mechanically Refined, Enzymatically Hydrolyzed) hydrolysate supplemented with synthetic defined medium (SD). The hydrolysate was diluted with water to different percent volumes to determine the optimal hydrolysate concentration for 1.8-cineole production. The highest 1,8-cineole titer of 27.64 mg/L was achieved in 75% (v/v) DMR-EH hydrolysate (Fig.  5a, b). Overall, the production of 1,8-cineole in hydrolysate medium was higher than in mock medium containing equivalent amounts of sugars or in YPD medium. The 1,8-cineole production titer in 90% (v/v) DMR (21 mg/L) was found to be lower than in 75% (v/v) DMR (Fig.  5a–c), indicating possible mild growth inhibition or nutrient limitation.  R. toruloides grew slower in 90% hydrolysate than in the 75% (v/v) hydrolysate, with a final OD 600 of 11.9 and 13.3, respectively (Fig.  5b, c). 1,8-cineole production was also tested in 75% (v/v) DMR hydrolysate supplied with different nitrogen sources, using either 10 g/L yeast extract (YE) or SD with additional 2 g/L ammonium sulfate. Although  R. toruloides grew faster initially in both media compared with the original hydrolysate, it eventually reached a similar OD 600 in each medium (Fig.  5b–e). Finally, production of 1,8-cineole from lignocellulose was demonstrated in a 2L batch fermenter with 75% (v/v) DMR-EH hydrolysate or a mock hydrolysate containing 10 g/L YE. Both glucose and xylose consumption was observed in the cultivation, and 1,8-cineole titers reached 34.6 mg/L in DMR-EH hydrolysate and 47.3 mg/L in mock hydrolysate (Fig.  6).  Fuel properties of 1,8-cineole Previous research suggests that 1,8-cineole is potentially a good CI and SI fuel [ 12– 16]. To explore the SI fuel properties of this compound in more detail, two important metrics relevant to SI fuels, research octane number (RON) and motor octane number (MON) were measured. Comparisons of these and other relevant fuel properties between 1,8-cineole and the well-known SI fuel additive ethanol, are shown in Table  2. While ethanol has a higher RON (109) and Sensitivity (19) relative to 1,8-cineole (99, 8), its high oxygen content, low energy density, and hygroscopic nature are less ideal for drop-in fuels. The fact that 1,8-cineole has low water solubility (3.5 g/L), high energy density (33.5 MJ/L), and RON/MON/Sensitivity values within the range of modern gasolines suggests that it is a good potential drop-in SI fuel. With an AKI defined as (RON + MON)/2 of ~ 95, pure 1,8-cineole would qualify as a “premium” fuel under the current gasoline standards. "," Background Due to their high energy density and compatible physical properties, several monoterpenes have been investigated as potential renewable transportation fuels, either as blendstocks with petroleum or as drop-in replacements for use in vehicles (both heavy and light-weight) or in aviation. Sustainable microbial production of these biofuels requires the ability to utilize cheap and readily available feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass, which can be depolymerized into fermentable carbon sources such as glucose and xylose. However, common microbial production platforms such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not naturally capable of utilizing xylose, hence requiring extensive strain engineering and optimization to efficiently utilize lignocellulosic feedstocks. In contrast, the oleaginous red yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides is capable of efficiently metabolizing both xylose and glucose, suggesting that it may be a suitable host for the production of lignocellulosic bioproducts. In addition, R. toruloides naturally produces several carotenoids (C40 terpenoids), indicating that it may have a naturally high carbon flux through its mevalonate (MVA) pathway, providing pools of intermediates for the production of a wide range of heterologous terpene-based biofuels and bioproducts from lignocellulose. Results Sixteen terpene synthases (TS) originating from plants, bacteria and fungi were evaluated for their ability to produce a total of nine different monoterpenes in R. toruloides. Eight of these TS were functional and produced several different monoterpenes, either as individual compounds or as mixtures, with 1,8-cineole, sabinene, ocimene, pinene, limonene, and carene being produced at the highest levels. The 1,8-cineole synthase HYP3 from Hypoxylon sp. E74060B produced the highest titer of 14.94 ± 1.84 mg/L 1,8-cineole in YPD medium and was selected for further optimization and fuel properties study. Production of 1,8-cineole from lignocellulose was also demonstrated in a 2L batch fermentation, and cineole production titers reached 34.6 mg/L in DMR-EH (Deacetylated, Mechanically Refined, Enzymatically Hydorlized) hydrolysate. Finally, the fuel properties of 1,8-cineole were examined, and indicate that it may be a suitable petroleum blend stock or drop-in replacement fuel for spark ignition engines. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that Rhodosporidium toruloides is a suitable microbial platform for the production of non-native monoterpenes with biofuel applications from lignocellulosic biomass.","['Biofuel', 'Monoterpene', 'Rhodosporidium toruloides', '1,8-Cineole']","['Fig.', 'toruloides', 'MTS', 'GPP', 'ATMT', 'monoterpene', 'MTS genes', 'detected', 'transformants', 'SPME']","[MTS, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pGAPDH, ATMT, MTS, toruloides, ATMT, GC–MS, ATMT, toruloides, ATMT, toruloides, NHEJ, ATMT, toruloides, ATMT, CnsA, toruloides, ama0a23, toruloides, (E)-β-ocimene, MTS, toruloides, toruloides, α-pinene, β-pinene (Fig.  2b, α-pinene, toruloides, toruloides, α-pinene, α-pinene, β-pinene, toruloides, TpsB, toruloides, β-phellandrene (1, toruloides, MTS enzymes, toruloides, toruloides, GPP/FPP, GPP/FPP-derived, toruloides, Deacetylated, toruloides, toruloides, DMR-EH hydrolysate, hydrolysate (, RON, RON, 8), RON , “, ”, gasoline]","['LcTPS', 'RlemTPS2', 'RlemTPS2,']",[],['Citrus'],terpene synthase
84,84,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6437863\eupmc_result.json,PMC6437863,"Results Differences in content and composition of volatiles among four tissues To understand the distribution pattern and differences in components of  S. album volatiles, we examined the metabolic compounds from pentane extracts of young leaves (YL), sapwood (SW) and HW from mature trees and immature wood (IW) from immature trees by GC-MS. There were significant differences in the volatile content among the four tissues. As shown in Fig.  1, the most abundant volatile was detected in HW (Fig.  1a-d). Major sesquiterpenols, α- and β-santalol, were detected in these four tissues, and sesquiterpenes, α- and β-santalene, and  epi-β-santalene were identified in YL and HW, but not in IW and SW (Fig.  1e-i, Additional file  1: Table S1). It was curious that trace amounts of α- and β-santalene,  epi-β-santalene and α-santalol (peaks 1, 3, 5 and 8, respectively) were found in almost the same proportion in YL (Fig.  1e). Of these, the distribution of the first three compounds matched that in HW (Fig.  1h, peaks 1, 3 and 5). Moreover, ( E)-α-bergamotene, ( E)-β-farnesene, and β-bisabolene were also detected from leaf extracts of  S. album. Almost the same distribution of sesquiterpenols as those in SW and HW was observed in IH (Fig.  1 f, g and i, peaks 8–15), indicating that the accumulation of sandalwood oil occurs at an early developmental stage of the stems and that more essential oil is biosynthesized in HW as the sandalwood tree grows older. Identification of new terpene synthases in  S. album We combined transcriptome sets downloaded from NCBI, including transcripts from leaves, stems and roots as described in the Methods. D e novo assembly yielded 164,548 unigenes from the three tissues (Additional file  1: Figure S1, Additional file  1: Table S2). Many unigenes were identified as  SaTPS genes, including 38 core terpene synthase genes and nine triterpene-specific synthase genes (Additional file  1: Table S3). Of these, six unigene sequences were completely aligned with those of  S. album submitted to NCBI [ 40,  42,  45]. Three unigenes contained full-length ORFs encoding TPSs, designated as  SaTPS1 to  3. In order to confirm that the assembled unigenes generated using the Trinity assembler were accurate, we designed primers to anneal around the predicted start and stop codons of unigenes to amplify ORFs of the three predicted  SaTPS genes (Fig. S2). Subsequent sequencing of these nucleotides demonstrated that they were exactly as predicted by the unigene assembly. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of three SaTPSs Three predicted proteins encoded by  SaTPS1 to  3 with a range of 564 to 604 amino acids had predicted  pIs of 6.01, 5.02 and 5.03, respectively (Additional file  1: Table S4). As shown in Fig.  2, SaTPS1 to 3 contain the arginine-tryptophan motif, R(R) X8W, which is conserved in most mono-TPSs and in some sesqui-TPSs near the N-terminus. The highly conserved aspartate-rich motif (DDXXD) and NSE/DTE motif, which are crucial for chelating divalent cations, typically Mg 2+, in the C-terminal domain [ 49], were present in these three SaTPSs. One of the distinguishing structural features between mono- and sesqui-TPSs is the presence of an N-terminal plastid transit peptide sequence. Using the signal sequence analysis program ChloroP ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP), a putative N-terminal plastid transit peptide (Tp) sequence of 44 amino acids for SaTPS1 was predicted, indicating that it is likely a mono-TPS. However, SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 did not contain a plastid Tp sequence, suggesting that they are sesqui-TPSs (Additional file  1: Table S4). A phylogenetic tree based on the deduced amino acid of sandalwood TPSs and other plant species showed that all  Santalum TPSs clustered in the TPS-b clade, with the exception of SasesquiTPS and sesquiTPSs in  S. spicatum (SspicsesquiTPS) and  S. austrocaledonicum (SaustsesquiTPS) (Fig.  3; Additional file  1: Table S5), among which the majority of angiospermous monoterpene synthases reside [ 15]. The most similar TPS sequence to SaTPS1 is that of (−)-α-terpineol synthase from  V. vinifera with 63% identity (Additional file  1: Figure S3; Additional file  1: Table S6) (Martin and Bohlmann, 2004). SaTPS2 clustered most closely to SaSSY, SspicSSY and SaustSSY, with a 100% bootstrap (Jones et al., 2011), and its amino acid sequence had highest identity with SaspiSSY (72%). SaTPS3 formed a clade with several previously characterized TPSs from  Santalum species, including SaMonoTPS, SaSQS1, SaSQS2, SaBS, SspicBS and Sspicsesquisabinene [ 42,  45,  50]. Bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses suggests that SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 might be involved in the production of essential oil in  S. album. Expression patterns of three  SaTPS genes differ from  SaSSY The tissue-specific expression of  SaTPS1 to  3 genes was determined by qRT-PCR in four key tissues, i.e., YL, IW, SW and HW. The transcript abundance of  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 genes showed a similar expression pattern, with highest expression in YL (Fig.  4).  SaTPS3 showed three-fold higher expression in IW than in YL, SW and HW. In contrast,  SaSSY was 100- and 250-fold higher in SW and HW, respectively. Additionally, comparisons of the expression levels among these  SaTPSs in specific tissues showed that  SaTPS3 showed higher expression than  SaTPS1 and Sa TPS2 in the four corresponding tissues (Additional file  1 :Figure S4). Of note, the level of  SaSSY transcript showed a 200- and 1200-fold increase relative to  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 in SW and HW, respectively. These results suggest that  SaTPS3 might play a role in the accumulation of HW essential oil whereas  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 play a minor role in the formation of terpenoids in  S. album HW. Subcellular localization of SaTPSs To elucidate the function of SaTPS1 to 3, subcellular localization of each SaTPS-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) fusion protein provided preliminary evidence. Phylogenetic and bioinformatics-based analyses in an attempt to classify TPSs indicated that SaTPS1-YFP, which has the N-terminal plastid transit peptide sequence, was localized in chloroplasts, whereas SaTPS2-YFP and SaTPS3-YFP were distributed throughout the cytosol (Fig.  5). Based on the results of subcellular localization, it was concluded that SaTPS1 is likely involved in monoterpene biosynthesis in plastids, whereas SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 might produce sesquiterpenes in the cytosol. Functional characterization of the enzymes encoded by  SaTPS1 to  3 All cDNAs subcloned into pET28a vector with 6His-tagged were successfully expressed in  E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) competent cells and recombinant proteins were then purified with a Ni-NTA agarose affinity column (Additional file  1 :Figure S5). We found that this cDNA without the transit peptide sequence could improve the expression of  SaTPS1 in  E. coli. Following an in vitro enzyme activity assay,  SaTPS1 was confirmed to encode a mono-TPS enzyme that catalyzed the formation of mostly α-terpineol (45.7%), while sabinene (14.9%), linalool (11.7%) and myrcene (10.8%), as well as a few minor monoterpenes, were also produced with GPP as the substrate and Mg 2+, as detected by GC-MS analysis (Fig.  6a, Additional file  1: Table S7). Although the same compounds were produced when Mg 2+ was replaced by Mn 2+, levels of product formation were 5-fold lower and the three major compounds, linalool (35.8%), α-terpineol (25.7%), and geraniol (12.9%) were formed (Additional file  1: Figure S6, Additional file  1: Table S7). No terpene product was observed in the reaction of SaTPS1 with FPP as a substrate and Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ (Fig.  6b). This enzyme was designated as α-terpineol synthase because it is a major monoterpene product and due to its preference for the metal ion, Mg 2+. GC-MS analysis of the reaction products catalyzed by SaTPS2 with FPP as a substrate in the presence of Mg 2+ identified at least 15 sesquiterpenoids, with ( E)-α-bergamotene (24.8%) and sesquisabinene (33.0%) as the two major products, β-bisabolene (9.0%), γ-bisabolene isomer (7.9%), and minor compounds, 7- epi-sesquithujene, ( E)-β-farnesene, α-zingiberene, and others at relative proportions less than 5% (Fig.  7a; Additional file  1: Table S7). A similar product profile comprising the major compounds, ( E)-α-bergamotene (22.4%) and sesquisabinene (35.6%), were detected when Mg 2+ was replaced with Mn 2+, but overall yield was relatively lower (Additional file  1: Figure S7, Additional file  1: Table S7). Incubation of SaTPS2 with GPP as a substrate and Mg 2+ ion led to the production of nine monoterpenes (Fig.  7b; Additional file  1: Table S7). The most abundant compound was linalool (64.9%). Likewise, assays with Mn 2+ instead of Mg 2+ showed that almost the same compounds were observed, but overall yield was 5-fold lower (Additional file  1: Figure S8, Additional file  1: Table S7). Taken together, these results indicate that SaTPS2 is a multifunctional sesqui-TPS producing major ( E)-α-bergamotene and sesquisabinene in the cytosol. SaTPS3 converts FPP and GPP substrates to sesqui- and monoterpene products, respectively. When assayed with FPP and Mg 2+, recombinant SaTPS3 catalyzed the synthesis of seven compounds, including ( E)-β-farnesene (20.7%), ( E)-nerolidol (29.8%) and ( E,E)-farnesol (21.3%) as the three major products, while a high proportion of γ-bisabolene (13.8%) was also produced (Fig.  8a, Additional file  1: Table S7). In the presence of Mn 2+, SaTPS3 recombination enzyme showed no activity, suggesting that SaTPS3 prefers Mg 2+ in the reaction with FPP. Analysis of the reaction products formed after incubation of SaTPS3 with GPP showed that the main product linalool (44.8–53.3%) was formed with Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ in considerable yield (Fig.  8b, Additional file  1: Figure S9, Additional file  1: Table S7). For the three SaTPSs tested in this study, extracts prepared from  E. coli transformed with PET28a lacking a cDNA insert and heat-denatured enzyme preparations served as controls, and no terpene products were observed. In all cases, expressed proteins incubated with GGPP did not produce detectable products. The  Km value of purified SaTPS1 with GPP was 9.08 ± 1.26 μM and the  Kcat/ Km value was 0.0171 (Table  1; Additional file  1 :Figure S10). The SaTPS2 and SaTPS3 enzymes not only accept substrate FPP but also accept the precursor of monoterpenes, GPP, as analyzed above. Enzyme kinetic properties of SaTPS2 showed that catalysis with FPP and GPP resulted in a similar  Km and  Kcat/ Km. The  Km value of the recombination SaTPS3 with FPP was 16.29 ± 1.48 μM, which was slightly higher than with GPP. The  Kcat/ Km with FPP was relatively lower than with GPP, indicating that the efficiency of this sesqui-TPS catalysis is higher when incubated with GPP. Elevated antioxidant enzyme activity under multiple stress treatments The phytohormones JA and SA play crucial roles in regulating the defensive signaling network by elevating the levels of ROS [ 51,  52]. Moreover, the mechanism by which terpenes alleviate abiotic stress suggests a general antioxidant mechanism by which harmful ROS can be quenched by reacting with unsaturated isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes [ 38]. In our study, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a key contributor in the conversion of O − to H 2O 2 in the presence of elevated levels of ROS, increased significantly under all treatments, except for a decrease in leaves exposed to 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity (approx. 250 μmol m − 2 s − 1) (Fig.  9a). Catalase (CAT) plays an important role in the antioxidant system because it enables plants to eliminate H 2O 2 by converting H 2O 2 into O 2 and H 2O (Miller et al., 2008). CAT activity was strongly elevated by these two elicitors. When the three tissues were exposed to temperature and light stresses, CAT activity was upregulated, the only exception being a slight decreased in leaves in response to high light intensity (Fig.  9b). Similarly, peroxidase (POD), which detoxifies H 2O 2 in the chloroplasts and cytosol of plant cells, also constitutes the main H 2O 2-scavenging system in cells [ 53]. POD activity increased in all treatments and roots had two-fold higher POD activity than leaves (Fig.  9c). Conversely, SOD and CAT activities were relatively higher in leaves than in stems and roots, independent of whether they were treated or untreated, suggesting differential endogenous activities of SOD, CAT or POD among different tissues. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) plays a key role in protecting plants against oxidative stress by scavenging H 2O 2 in different cell compartments [ 54]. As shown in Fig.  9d, APX activity increased significantly in most tissues under MeJA, SA, cold, heat and high light intensity treatments. Thus, the increase in SOD, CAT, POD and APX activities indicate that  S. album seedlings respond to external stresses to protect cellular membranes against oxidative stress, suggesting that these enzymes play roles in tolerance to elicitors and environmental stresses in  S. album. In addition, the effect of different adverse stresses on antioxidant enzyme activities will vary among tissues. Activation of  SaTPS1 to  3 gene expression in response to MeJA and SA To explore the responses of the three  SaTPS genes under elicitors as well as temperature and high light intensity treatments, transcript levels for  SaTPS1 to  3 and  SaSSY were determined by qRT-PCR.  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 exhibited similar expression patterns in response to the two elicitors. As shown in Fig.  10a and b, exogenous MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 genes in leaves at 24 h, with more than a 170- and 130-fold increase, respectively, when compared with the controls.  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 transcripts also increased significantly in stems and roots after the application of MeJA.  SaTPS3 expression was activated in leaves, stems and roots with an approximately 5-, 3-, and 4-fold increase, respectively compared to the corresponding controls (Fig.  10c). In contrast,  SaTPS3 was significantly up-regulated in leaves by SA, but decreased in stems and roots. Moreover, the accumulation of  SaSSY transcript were similar to that of  SaTPS3 in leaves under MeJA and SA treatments. However, the two exogenous hormones led to a decrease in  SaSSY expression in roots compared with the control (Fig.  10d). Adverse temperature and high light induced differential accumulation of  SaTPS1,  SaTPS2 and  SaTPS3 SaTPS1 to  3 expression levels were inhibited in leaves at 4°C and 38°C, but were significantly activated in roots when compared to the controls (Fig.  10e-g), suggesting that oxidative damage in leaves was more severe than in stems and roots. When exposed to high light intensity,  SaTPS1 and  SaTPS2 transcripts showed higher expression in stems and roots than in leaves, particularly  SaTPS1, with a 25-fold increase in stems. The level of  SaTPS3 transcripts was highest in roots under 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity stresses, with approximately 2-, 6-, and 8-fold increases, respectively, compared to the control. Conversely,  SaSSY transcript only increased by about 2-fold in roots at 4°C compared to the control. In all other cases, the expression level of  SaSSY was down-regulated to some extent in all tissues examined (Fig.  10h)."," Background It is well known that aromatic essential oils extracted from the heartwood of Santalum album L. have wide economic value. However, little is known about the role of terpenoids in response to various adverse environmental stresses as other plants do in the form of signals during plant-environment interactions. Results In this study, trace amounts of volatiles consisting of α-santalene, epi-β-santalene, β-santalene, α-santalol, β-santalol, (E)-α-bergamotene, (E)-β-farnesene and β-bisabolene were found in the leaves of mature S. album trees. We identified more than 40 candidate terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes by mining publicly-available RNA-seq data and characterized the enzymes encoded by three cDNAs: one mono-TPS catalyzes the formation of mostly α-terpineol, and two multifunctional sesqui-TPSs, one of which produces (E)-α-bergamotene and sesquisabinene as major products and another which catalyzes the formation of (E)-β-farnesene, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol as main products. Metabolite signatures and gene expression studies confirmed that santalol content is closely related with santalene synthase (SaSSY) transcripts in heartwood, which is key enzyme responsible for santalol biosynthesis. However, the expression of three new SaTPS genes differed significantly from SaSSY in the essential oil-producing heartwood. Increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, were detected in different tissues of S. album plants after applying 1 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 1 mM salicylic acid (SA), or exposure to 4°C, 38°C and high light intensity. MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of SaTPS1 and SaTPS2 in leaves. SaTPS1 to 3 transcripts were differentially activated among different tissues under adverse temperature and light stresses. In contrast, almost all SaSSY transcripts decreased in response to these environmental stresses, unlike SaTPS1 to 3. Conclusions Multifunctional enzymes were biochemically characterized, including one chloroplastic mono-TPS and two cytosolic sesqui-TPSs in sandalwood. Our results suggest the ecological importance of these three new SaTPS genes in defensive response to biotic attack and abiotic stresses in S. album.","['Salicylic acid', 'Sesquiterpene', 'Methyl jasmonate', 'Abiotic stress', 'Santalum album', 'Terpene synthase']","['Additional file', 'Fig.', 'Additional', 'file', 'Table', 'Expression', 'GPP', 'Figure', 'FPP', 'leaves']","[α-, β-santalol, α-, α-, α-santalol, HW, 8–15, NCBI, 164,548, triterpene-specific synthase, TPSs, SaTPSs, SaTPS1, X8W, sesqui-TPSs, Mg 2, SaTPSs, sesqui-TPSs, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP, N-terminal plastid, SaTPS1, SaTPS2, SaTPS3, SasesquiTPS, sesquiTPSs, SspicsesquiTPS, SaustsesquiTPS, S5, SaTPS1, (−)-α-terpineol synthase, SspicSSY, SaustSSY, SaspiSSY, SaMonoTPS, SaSQS1, SaSQS2, SaBS, SspicBS, SaTPS2, SaTPS3, SaTPSs, SaTPS1, yellow fluorescent protein, SaTPS1-YFP, SaTPS2-YFP, SaTPS3-YFP, SaTPS1, SaTPS2, SaTPS3, pET28a, 6His-tagged, S5, α-terpineol, Mg 2, Mg 2, Mn 2, α-terpineol, SaTPS1, Mg 2, α-terpineol synthase, Mg 2, SaTPS2, Mg 2, Mg 2, SaTPS2, Mg 2, Mg 2, SaTPS2, SaTPS3, Mg 2, SaTPS3, E)-nerolidol, E, E)-farnesol, Mn 2, SaTPS3, Mg 2, SaTPS3, 44.8–53.3, Mg 2, SaTPSs, PET28a, GGPP, SaTPS1, SaTPS2, SaTPS3 enzymes, SaTPS2, SA, superoxide dismutase, O −, °C, °C, − 2 , − 1, Catalase, CAT, O 2, CAT, CAT, peroxidase, CAT, CAT, POD, APX, APX, SA, CAT, POD, APX, SA, b, SA, SA, SA, °C, °C]","['SaTPS', 'TPSs,', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS', 'SaTPSs', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS1', 'mono-TPSs', 'sesqui-TPSs', 'SaTPSs.', 'sesqui-TPSs', 'SaTPS1', 'mono-TPS.', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'sesqui-TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS-b', 'SasesquiTPS', 'sesquiTPSs', '(SspicsesquiTPS)', '(SaustsesquiTPS)', 'TPS', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'TPSs', 'SaMonoTPS,', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPSs', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS1', 'TPS2', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPSs', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS-YFP', 'TPSs', 'SaTPS1-YFP,', 'SaTPS2-YFP', 'SaTPS3-YFP', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS1', 'mono-TPS', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS2', 'sesqui-TPS', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPSs', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'sesqui-TPS', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS1,', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS3', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS1', 'SaTPS2', 'SaTPS1,', 'SaTPS3']",[],[],terpene synthase

Anthocyanin Level in the Different Tepal Development Stages of Lycoris longituba In the small bud stage, the red color of  L. longituba ‘Pink’ tepal was very deep, and then the color intensity was significantly decreased with the rapid elongation of tepals, as shown in  Figure 1a. In contrast, the tepal color of  L. longituba ‘White’ was always white, as shown in  Figure 1a. As shown in  Figure 1b, the anthocyanin content in  L. longituba ‘Pink’ was dramatically reduced from S1-P to S3-P, and nearly no anthocyanin was detected in S3-W, as shown in  Figure 1b. These results suggested that content changes of anthocyanin could be the main reason that led to the tepals’ red color fading of  L. longituba ‘Pink’. 2.2. Transcriptome Sequencing and de Novo Assembly Twelve total RNA samples were isolated from different  L. longituba tepal developmental stages S1-P, S2-P, S3-P, and S3-W. These RNA samples were at concentrations of about 200–500 ng/μL with OD260/280 ≥ 1.9 and the RNA Integrity Numbers (RINs) of 8.6–10.0 were used for cDNA library construction. The Illumina HiSeqTM 4000 platform was used to obtain the dataset of 12 cDNA libraries. About 663.25 million raw sequencing reads with a length of 150 bp were generated, and after discarding the low-quality reads, we obtained about 85.23% (565.28 million) clean reads. For all 12 samples, the quality score above 20 (Q20) was ~98.20% and the GC percentages were 45.55–46.88%. Using Trinity software, the de novo assembly totally generated 144,922 unigenes, of average length 941 bp, from the twelve tepal transcriptomes, as shown in  Table 1. In this research, the N50 was determined to be 1527 bp, which indicated that the quality of sequence assembly was good. All raw high throughput sequence data have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Reads Archive (SRA) with the accession number PRJNA490415. 2.3. Functional Classification of Genes during Tepal Development Stages The assembled unigenes were annotated using blastx against NCBI nonredundant protein (Nr), Swiss-Prot, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) protein sequence databases with an E-value ≤10 −5. A total of 85,563 (59.04%) unigenes could be annotated while other unigenes had no significant BLAST hit, as shown in  Table 2, indicating that numerous new genes specific to  L. longituba are still functionally unknown and need to be further studied in the future. Remarkably, the plant species with the top three numbers of blastx hits were  Elaeis guineensis (23,200 transcripts; 29.62%),  Phoenix dactylifera (19,045 transcripts; 24.31%), and  Musa acuminata (6512 transcripts; 8.31%), as shown in  Table S1. These results implied that the assembled  L. longituba transcripts shared similarity with transcripts from several monocotyledons and were reliable. Based on sequence homology, gene ontology (GO) assignment analysis was performed. Of the 85,563 annotated unigenes, 44,813 (52.37%) sequences were assigned into three main categories (biological process, cellular components, and molecular function), which could be further distributed under 58 GO terms, as shown in  Figure S1. Metabolic process, cell, and catalytic activity were the most highly enriched GO terms in biological process, cellular components, and molecular function categories, respectively. 2.4. Identify Differentially Expressed Unigenes between Tepal Transcriptomes To identify differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) during tepal color fading, the unigenes that were differentially expressed between developmental stages and opening tepals with different colors were compared and shown in  Figure 2. Among the four comparisons, the smallest number of DEGs was between the S1-P and S2-P libraries (4674), of which 2330 were up-regulated and 2344 were down-regulated, and the largest number of DEGs was between the S3-P and S3-W libraries (9958), with 5786 up-regulated and 5463 down-regulated unigenes. As the tepals faded from S2-P to S3-P, 8110 unigenes were differentially expressed, with 3526 up-regulated and 4584 down-regulated unigenes. In the S1-P vs. S3-P comparison, 11,024 DEGs were detected, including 5335 up-regulated and 5689 down-regulated unigenes. The comparison between S1-P and the other tepal developmental stages (S2-P and S3-P) showed that the number of up and down-regulated unigenes were both significantly increased as the tepals developed. 2.5. KEGG Pathway Enrichment According to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis ( p-value < 0.05), the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (96 DEGs, ko00940), flavonoid biosynthesis (58 DEGs, ko00941), flavone and flavonol biosynthesis (23 DEGs, ko00944), and anthocyanin biosynthesis (4 DEG, ko00942) pathways which related to color formation were significantly different as compared to S3-P and S3-W. Interestingly, except for the anthocyanin biosynthesis and flavonol biosynthesis pathways, the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways were also identified in the S1-P vs. S2-P, S2-P vs. S3-P, and S1-P vs. S3-P comparisons. These results suggested that the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways could play critical roles during red color fading and aroma formation. The statistically enriched pathways between each two transcriptomes are shown in  Figure S2. 2.6. Validation of the Gene Expression Profiles by qRT-PCR To validate the transcription profile revealed by RNA-Seq data, the expression levels of 21 genes from the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were also assessed using qRT-PCR, as shown in  Figure 3a. Linear regression analysis was used to obtain the overall correlation coefficient between RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR data, which showed a good correlation ( R = 0.89) between these two data, as shown in  Figure 3b, indicating that the 12 transcriptomics data were reliable. 2.7. Metabolome Analysis of Lycoris longituba Tepal Development Stages by GC-MS To investigate the volatile metabolic components changes of  L.longituba tepals in the opening processes, we obtained the GC-MS total ion current (TIC) chromatograms for nine  L. longituba tepal samples from three typical developmental stages (S1-P, S2-P, and S3-P), as shown in  Figure 1a. The obvious differences of chromatographic peaks were observed between sample groups, and the retention times were fairly consistent and reproducible, as shown in  Figure 4a. In this study, a total of 29 metabolites were identified in our sample libraries across all samples, as shown in  Table 3. To assess the volatile components profile changes during  L. longituba tepal development, the orthogonal partial least-squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) plot was generated from the GC-MS metabolite data of S1-P, S2-P, and S3-P tepals and showed clear metabolic differences between two stages. Remarkably, S1-P, S2-P, and S3-P tepals could be completely separated sufficiently by use of two principal components. The first principle component (PC1, accounting for 49.89%) and the second component (PC2, accounting for 32.96%) of the variation in the data could separate all three types of tepals with no outliers, as shown in  Figure 4b. The contribution of each variable to PC1 and PC2 was also calculated by giving each variable a weight value. The top two core differential metabolites of PC1 and PC2 discrimination were caryophyllene and  trans-β-ocimene, as shown in  Figure 4c. Interestingly, the  trans-β-ocimene, which had a high content in S3-P, was not detected in S1-P and S2-P, as shown in  Table 3. 2.8. Analysis of Candidate Genes Related to Color and Fragrance Metabolics To explore the genetic regulation of  L. longituba tepal color fading and aroma emission, the genes which have been reported to be involved in these two metabolic pathways were selected. With the development of tepals, several anthocyanin biosynthesis structural genes had the lowest expression levels in S3-P, such as the DFRs, CHIs, CHS2, F3’H1, and FLSs, as shown in  Figure 3a. Especially, the DFR-annotated unigenes ( DFR2-1 and  DFR2-2) which had more than a 7-fold down-regulated expression level in S1-P vs. S3-P, as shown in  Figure 3a. Five  TPS genes were also identified from the DEGs, and interestingly three ( Unigene81776,  CL6106.Contig2, and  Unigene3859) of them were predominantly expressed in S3-P, as shown in  Figure 5c. The spatial and temporal expression of pigment structural and aroma genes were usually controlled by transcription factors from MYB and bHLH [ 14, 25]. In this study, 35 MYBs and 29 bHLHs with fragments per kilobase per million fragments (FPKM) ≥ 5 were identified from DEGs, as shown in  Figure 5a,b. Among them, six MYBs and four bHLHs (in black frames) had the similar down-regulated expression trends with  DFR2-1 and  DFR2-2, and four MYBs and one bHLH (in red frames) had the similar up-regulated expression patterns with the above three  TPSs, as shown in  Figure 5.","Lycoris longituba, belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family, is a perennial bulb bearing flowers with diverse colors and fragrance. Selection of cultivars with excellent colored and scented flowers has always been the breeding aim for ornamental plants. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying color fading and aroma production during flower expansion in L. longituba remain unclear. Therefore, to systematically investigate these important biological phenomena, the tepals of L. longituba from different developmental stages were used to screen and analyze the metabolic components and relevant genes. Utilizing the Illumina platform, a total of 144,922 unigenes were obtained from the RNA-Seq libraries. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicated that the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways might play important roles during color and aroma changes. Metabolomic analysis identified 29 volatile organic components (VOCs) from different developmental stages of L. longituba tepals, and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed that trans-β-ocimene-a terpene-was the most important aroma compound. Meanwhile, we found the content of anthocyanin was significantly reduced during the tepal color fading process. Then, we identified two dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) and three terpene synthase (TPS) genes, for which expression changes coincided with the production patterns of anthocyanins and trans-β-ocimene, respectively. Furthermore, a number of MYB and bHLH transcription factors (TFs) which might be involved in color- and aroma-formation were also identified in L. longituba tepal transcriptomes. Taken together, this is the first comprehensive report of the color and fragrance in tepals of L. longituba and these results could be helpful in understanding these characteristics and their regulation networks.","['volatile organic compounds', 'Lycoris longituba', 'Tepals', 'Aroma Formation', 'Color Fading']","['Figure', 'shown', 'longituba tepal', 'Tepal', 'unigenes', 'longituba', 'Tepal Development', 'tepals', 'biosynthesis', 'tepal color']","[’, ’, S3-P, S3-W, S2-P, S3-P, ≥, 8.6–10.0, 663.25, 565.28, ~98.20, 45.55–46.88, SRA, PRJNA490415, Swiss-Prot, 85,563, 85,563, 44,813, S2-P, S3-W libraries, S2-P, S3-P, S3-P, S2-P, S3-P, S3-W., S2-P, S2-P, S3-P, S3-P, S2-P, S2-P, S2-P, PC2, PC2, PC2, S2-P, S3-P, DFRs, F3’H1, FLSs, DFR-annotated unigenes, DFR2-1, S3-P, Unigene81776, S3-P, MYB, bHLH [ 14, bHLHs]","['TPS', 'TPSs,']",[],[],

Leaf Transcriptome Sequencing and De Novo Assembly Illumina sequencing generated 140 GB of data containing ca. 182 million paired-end reads. Trinity assembly resulted in 78,807 transcripts with fragment sizes ranging from 224 to 12,395 bp ( Figure 1a) and a median contig length of 595 bp.  Table 1 presents assembly statistics of the transcriptome, including transcripts that were retained with an exN50 length of 1145 bp, which represents the shortest transcript length at which half the assembled base pairs can be found. The exN50 statistic for the  P. copal suggests the Trinity assembly is of high quality. Furthermore, comparison of BUSCO analyses for all three transcriptomes ( P. copal,  B. sacra and  B. simaruba) suggest that the  P. copal assembly is the highest quality of the three with slightly better scores than  B. sacra and significantly better scores than  B. simaruba ( Figure 1b). Of the 2121 single-copy orthologs included in the BUSCO analysis, 1292 (60.9%) were found to be complete, of which 563 (26.5%) were duplicated. Five hundred and fifteen orthologs (24.3%) were fragmented, and 314 (14.8%) were missing. Of the three Burseraceae transcriptomes,  Protium copal was the most complete, with the fewest missing and fragmented orthologs ( Figure 1c). 3.2. Functional Annotation and Similarity with Other Plant Genomes The Trinotate annotation identified 38,042 nucleotide sequences (48.27%) and 24,250 protein sequences (30.77%) that showed significant homology with Viridiplantae when compared to the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database using BLASTx and BLASTp searches, respectively. Furthermore, 20,271 (25.72%) unique Pfam protein motifs were assigned ( Table S1). These protein domains can be involved in various biological processes and molecular function such as protein–protein interactions, transcription regulation, and organic compound biosynthetic processes. In contrast, Blast2GO annotation retrieved 48,951 transcripts (69.91%) were successfully matched to homologous sequences for Viridiplantae in the NR database (e-value < 1 × 10 −5). Out of the blasted transcripts, 18,822 transcripts (26.87%) were mapped to at least one gene ontology (GO) term using Blast2GO. The vast majority of BLAST hits for the transcripts came from the genus  Citrus, also a member of the order Sapindales ( Figure 2a). Our transcript dataset displayed 26,223 (37.44%) hits with the NR database and to  Citrus sinensis, followed by  Citrus clementina (10,185 top-hits, 14.54%),  Theobroma cacao (2010 top-hits), and  Hevea brasiliense (1623 top-hits) and  Vitis vinifera (1484 top-hits) ( Figure 2A). 3.3. Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) GO analysis revealed 4532 unique GO terms related to plant gene ontology. Among the three main categories, Biological processes (BP) category was the most abundant (2340 GOs), followed by molecular function (MF, 1750 GOs) and cellular component (CC, 104 GOs) categories ( Figure 2b). Within the BP category, metabolic processes (34.02%), cellular process (29.07%), and single-organism processes (16.28%) were most represented. Likewise, genes encoding binding proteins (33.40%) and genes encoding proteins related to catalytic activities (31.95%) were most abundant in the MF category. In the CC category, membrane (22.26%), membrane part (18.78%), cell (16.70%), and cell part (16.49%) were abundantly represented GO terms. In total, 10,960 (45% of the transcripts with NR blast hits for Viridiplantae) transcripts were assigned to different COG functional categories ( Table S1). The largest group is represented by the serine theorine protein kinase (COG0515, 2014 hits, 18%), followed by leucine rich repeat (COG4886, 491 hits, 13%), ankyrin repeat (COG0666, 192 hits). A few other clusters, such us chromatin structures and dynamics, cell motility, extracellular structures are underrepresented or absent. 3.4. Abundance of Transcripts Related to Terpene Functional Annotation  A total of 186 transcripts were identified as being part of monoterpenoid biosynthetic processes (GO:0016099), triterpenoid biosynthetic processes (GO:0016104), including pentacyclic (GO:0019745) and tetracyclic triterpenoids (GO:0010686), terpenoid transport (GO:0046865), terpene synthase activity (GO:0010333) and terpene/terpenoid biosynthetic processes (GO:0046246 and GO:0016114, respectively). The lengths of these transcripts varied between 232 bp and 4278 bp, with a median contig length of 736 bp. In total, we found approximately 540.2 transcripts per million (TPM) expressed for all terpene and terpenoid functional annotation ( Figure 3). Transcripts associated with the synthesis of monoterpenoids and terpenoid transport were relatively highly expressed with single transcripts having double the abundance relative to the mean TPM expressed in  Protium copal. 3.5. Phylogenetic Validation of Terpene Synthase Gene Annotations Fifty-seven  P. copal transcripts were identified as putative TPS genes ( Figure 4). With the exception of the outgroup specimens in TPSd all of the subfamilies were monophyletic. While support values are low within the TPSa and b subfamilies, the topology of the phylogeny is congruent with previous phylogenetic studies of the TPS gene family (see [ 4, 7, 30]). We conclude that the terpene genes identified in the  P. copal transcriptome are consistent with the annotation of other model terpene-rich plant species (e.g., Citrus and Arabidopsis). 3.6. Relative Diversity of Orthologous Terpene Gene Clusters in  P. copal Comparison of inferred proteins among the three species in OrthoVenn identified 107 gene clusters, with 58 clusters being shared by at least two of the three species. Protium copal was found to share a relatively high number of terpene genes with both  B. simaruba and  B. sacra transcriptome assemblies (32 terpene genes were shared with B. sacra and 35 genes were shared with  B. simaruba,  Figure 5a). More unique terpene gene clusters were identified in  P. copal and  B. simaruba relative to B. sacra. In addition,  P. copal shared more orthologous gene clusters with  B. simaruba than  B. sacra. Finally,  P. copal exhibited the highest diversity of terpene orthologous gene clusters in comparison to the other two Burseraceae species ( Figure 5b). 3.7. Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) Marker Identification A total of 11,480 repeat regions were identified across 9496 transcripts (15%). In addition, 1610 transcripts contained multiple SSRs (2.5%), and a total of 770 compound SSRs were identified in the  P. copal transcriptome. Out of the 11,480 SSRs, 7308 mono-nucleotide (64%), 1936 di-nucleotide (17%), 2010 tri-nucleotide (18%), 112 tetra-nucleotide (1%), 53 penta-nucleotide (0.5%), and 61 hexa-nucleotide markers (0.5%) were identified. Seven SSRs were identified which were found within transcripts putatively involved in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway and 3 of which were found in transcripts putatively involved in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. Of these, five were mono-nucleotides, two were di-nucleotides, one was a tri-nucleotide, and two were compound SSR regions. The list of SSR markers identified are presented in  Table S2. 3.8. SNP Discovery A total of 64,510 SNPs was identified across 25,505 transcripts ( Table S3). 36,893 SNPs were located in coding regions (CDS). 22,292 SNPs were classified as non-synonymous (35%), of which 22,159 are located in CDS regions. 74 SNPs were located across 30 transcripts involved in terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. Of these 74 SNPs, 28 were located in CDS regions and 14 SNPs were classified as non-synonymous, all of which were located in CDS regions. Fifty-seven were involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis genes, 16 in terpene synthase genes, and 1 in terpenoid biosynthesis genes.","Plants in the Burseraceae are globally recognized for producing resins and essential oils with medicinal properties and have economic value. In addition, most of the aromatic and non-aromatic components of Burseraceae resins are derived from a variety of terpene and terpenoid chemicals. Although terpene genes have been identified in model plant crops (e.g.,  Citrus ,  Arabidopsis ), very few genomic resources are available for non-model groups, including the highly diverse Burseraceae family. Here we report the assembly of a leaf transcriptome of  Protium copal , an aromatic tree that has a large distribution in Central America, describe the functional annotation of putative terpene biosynthetic genes and compare terpene biosynthetic genes found in  P. copal  with those identified in other Burseraceae taxa. The genomic resources of  Protium copal  can be used to generate novel sequencing markers for population genetics and comparative phylogenetic studies, and to investigate the diversity and evolution of terpene genes in the Burseraceae.","['Terpenoid', 'Rna-sequencing', 'De Novo Assembly', 'Protium', 'Copal Resin']","['Figure', 'transcripts', 'Gene Clusters', 'Terpene', 'copal', 'gene', 'genes', 'identified', 'terpene genes', 'clusters']","[exN50, exN50, BUSCO, single-copy, BUSCO, Trinotate, protein–, serine theorine protein kinase, COG0515, ankyrin repeat, COG0666, GO:0019745, GO:0010686, terpene/terpenoid, GO:0046246, GO:0016114, Terpene Synthase Gene, TPSd, TPSa, b, OrthoVenn identified 107, Burseraceae species, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, 1936 di-nucleotide, SSRs, 64,510, 22,292, 22,159]","['TPS', 'TPSd', 'TPSa', 'TPS']",[],"['Citrus,', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus']",terpene synthase
91,91,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6614452\eupmc_result.json,PMC6614452,"Results Comparative transcriptomic profile along peel ripening between Navelate and its Pinalate mutant Physiological and biochemical data suggest that Breaker (Bk) stage is a turning point in the regulation of ordinary sweet orange ripening not only because of the peel color change but also because the sharp increase in ABA content and the later increase in maturity index (Supplementary Fig.  S1). Fruit of Navelate and Pinalate at Bk and Full Colored (FC) stages were selected to compare changes in transcriptomic profiles with those occurring at Mature Green (MG) stage in order to identify the molecular mechanisms associated with citrus peel ripening. Venn diagrams in Fig.  1A indicated that major changes in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEG, FDR < 0.01) were found at Bk in both cultivars, being this number higher in Pinalate fruit (2513 respect to 1594). In both genotypes, Bk and FC stages shared a low number of DEG, which indicates that molecular changes involved in citrus peel ripening are regulated in a stage-specific manner. Interestingly, at the color change (Bk) the number of induced genes in the mutant was about 4-fold higher than in the parental (1210 respect to 278), whereas that of down-regulated genes between genotypes was similar. On the contrary, at FC stage the number of repressed genes in mutant fruit almost doubled that of the parental (1206 respect to 668) while induced genes were half of those found in Navelate (445 respect to 856) (Fig.  1A). Principal Component (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analyses (HCA) were performed to validate the repeatability of the microarray data across replications and to cluster samples according to their global gene expression profiles. Under all conditions, the transcriptional profiles of the three separate RNA replicate samples were tightly clustered together (Fig.  1B). The reliability of the transcriptomic results was further confirmed by comparing microarray expression values with those obtained by real-time quantitative PCR on a list of selected genes (Supplementary Table  S1, Fig.  S2). In addition, PCA revealed marked differences in gene expression patterns among the selected ripening stages ( X-axis explaining the 53.5% of the total variation). Differences between genotypes were lower at FC and MG stages but remarkable at Bk stage ( Y- and  Z-axes explaining a 28.6% of the total variation). Accordingly, HCA revealed that samples were grouped in a ripening stage- and genotype-dependent manner (Fig.  1C). The gene-clustering in the heatmap analysis indicated that DEG responsible for the separation of genotypes and developmental stages in the PCA may be divided into two main branches: The first cluster grouped genes decreasing transcript levels from MG to FC stage, and the second is composed of genes whose expression is induced as ripening progresses (Fig.  1D). Heatmap also revealed similarity between cultivars at MG stage and substantial differences in the expression patterns of Navelate and Pinalate Bk fruit (Fig.  1D). Some clusters of genes showed high inductions in Pinalate but repression in Navelate Bk fruit, while others were repressed in both cultivars but more intensely in the mutant (Fig.  1D). At FC stage, those genes whose expression was repressed as ripening progressed showed similar transcript levels in both genotypes while those experiencing induction along maturation in the parental were still mostly repressed in the mutant at the full mature stage. Notably, some of those genes repressed in Pinalate were highly induced in the FC parental fruit (Fig.  1D). Alterations in peel ripening-related events in Pinalate fruit as compared to its parental Navelate Functional categorization analysis on the DEG identified biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components and KEGG pathways significantly (P < 0.05) under- or over-represented along peel maturation in the parental and its mutant. Gene ontology analyses revealed that the high number of DEG in Navelate and Pinalate Bk fruit were only enriched in the chlorophyll binding molecular function and in the fructose and mannose metabolic pathway, both repressed in either genotype (Table  1). The number of DEG at Bk in both cultivars suggests that a large number of molecular events are being regulated at this stage, while GO analysis indicates that they are probably involved in a wide range of responses since they are not grouped in specific biological processes. At FC stage, repressed genes in the flavedo of Navelate fruit were related to photosynthesis and syncytium formation, while those induced were enriched in the response to water deprivation and to fungus, and in the metabolism of glucan (Table  1). In contrast, down-regulated genes in FC Pinalate fruit were statistically enriched in photosynthesis and lipid biosynthetic processes, whereas the response to hypoxia was the only biological process over-represented in the set of induced genes. Therefore, biological processes induced in the peel of FC parental fruit were not found in the mutant at any developmental stage, and the down-regulation of the photosynthesis, the chlorophyll binding and the fructose and mannose metabolism were the only events in common between both genotypes (Table  1). In line with this, genes encoding light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins, which are part of the antenna proteins KEGG pathway and function in the thylakoid, were repressed in both genotypes (Table  1). However, the carbon fixation pathway, tightly related to the energy metabolism involving chloroplast and mitochondria cellular components, was only repressed in the mutant fruit, as well as the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Last, the ribonucleoprotein complex and the intracellular non-membrane-bound organelle cellular components were over-represented in the set of Navelate FC induced genes (Table  1), suggesting an enhancement of the transcriptional activity in the parental but not in the mutant fruit. To further uncover biological processes related to peel maturation and how Pinalate mutation might interfere in their regulation, we performed a more restrictive ontology analysis, considering only those DEG responsible for the separation of genotypes and ripening stages observed in the multivariate analyses. The 1116 genes satisfying the ANOVA test (P < 0.001) were enriched in a high number of biological processes that might be classified into two different groups. The first group would include biological processes related to primary and secondary metabolism and those involved in the redox potential and energy generation. This group is composed of the lignin, wax, and starch biosynthetic processes and of the transmembrane and photosynthetic electron transport categories. Secondly, we identified 12 different biological processes that may be grouped as biotic and abiotic stress responses (Table  2). Therefore, the next subsections will delve into the molecular mechanisms included in each group separately. Effects of carotenoid biosynthetic blockage and reduced ABA levels on the regulation of metabolism-related pathways, redox potential and energy generation along peel ripening To get a deeper insight into how Pinalate mutation interferes with the regulation of the molecular mechanisms controlling the lignin, wax, starch and lipid biosynthetic processes and the transmembrane and photosynthetic electron transport along fruit ripening, genes included in the most specific biological processes for each category were studied. Belonging to the lignin biosynthesis category, we identified the  HYDROXYCINNAMOYL-COA TRANSFERASE ( HCT),  CUMARATE-3-HYDROXYLASE ( C3H),  CINNAMOYL-COA REDUCTASE ( CCR2),  O-METHYLTRANSFERASE1 ( OMT1) and  FERULIC ACID 5-HYDROXYLASE1 ( F5H) genes. Only minor differences between genotypes were found among the expression values of these genes. In fact,  OMT1 and  F5H, acting downstream in the pathway, were repressed in both cultivars and no significant differences were observed when compared Navelate and Pinalate FC fruit (Table  3). However,  HCT and  C3H, encoding the enzymes that catalyze the three first steps of the lignin biosynthetic pathway and hence regulate the accumulation of caffeic and coumaric acids, displayed opposite expression patterns during ripening in both genotypes and higher transcript levels in the parental than in the mutant at FC stage (Table  3). Similarly, the expression values of the genes belonging to the wax biosynthetic process barely differed between Navelate and Pinalate FC fruit. Thus, among the  LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE2 ( LACS2),  3-KETOACYL-COA SYNTHETASE6 ( KCS6),  3-KETOACYL-COA SYNTHETASE1 ( KCS1) and  ECERIFERUM1 ( CER1) genes identified in this category, only  KCS1, which participates in the catalysis of several steps for the formation of very long chain fatty acids, showed opposite regulation between genotypes and a two-fold induction in Navelate compared to Pinalate FC fruit (Table  3). Genes belonging to the starch biosynthetic process encoded for proteins with ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase ( APL1,  APL2,  APL4) and starch branching ( SBE2.1,  SBE2.1) activities, involved in the production of ADP-alpha-glucose and in the formation of branches in amylopectin and alpha-amylose, respectively, were induced in the parental but not in the mutant FC fruit (Table  3). On the other hand, all genes included in the photosynthetic electron transport process were repressed in Pinalate as compared to Navelate fruit (Table  3). These genes included two subunits of the photosystem I ( PSI-G,  PSI-P), the delta subunit of the ATP synthase ( ATPD) and two proton pumps ( PGR5,  PGRL1B) involved in the electron flow in the photosystem I (Table  3). These lacks of induction and enhanced repressions in the mutant as compared to parental fruit were also found in the regulation of the transmembrane transport-related genes. Thus, Pinalate fruit was unable to induce the expression of  MULTI-ANTIMICROBIAL EXTRUSION ( MATE),  ABC TRANSPORTER39 ( ABCG39) or  VACUOLAR ATP SYNTHASE F and  H ( AHA-F,  AHA-H) genes, and showed higher repression values than its parental for the  ABC TRANSPORTER32 ( ABCG32) and a  PUTATIVE SUGAR TRANSPORTER 1 ( ESL1) (Table  3). Taking into account the partially overlapping results obtained separately after the two functional categorization analyses performed in this work (Tables  1 and  2), we considered that the lipid biosynthetic process (Table  1) must be included in the group of events related to primary and secondary metabolism, and deserved a deeper investigation because of this process is known as a canonical response of fruit ripening 3. The lipid biosynthesis was statistically repressed only in the Pinalate mutant FC fruit as compared to its MG stage (Table  1), although the genes belonging to this process did not show differences between genotypes at FC stage (Table  3). This category included genes related to the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway such as  HYDROXYMETHYLBUTENYL DIPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE ( HDR),  DEOXYXYLULOSE 5-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE2 ( DXS2) and  GERANYLGERANYL PYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE1 ( GGPPS1), and to the carotenoid metabolism such as  PHYTOENE SYNTHASE ( PSY) and  PHYTOENE DEHYDROGENASE ( PDS), genes related to wax and cutin biosynthesis such as  LACS2,  KCS6,  3-KETOACYL-COA SYNTHETASE10 ( KCS10) and  SQUALENE SYNTHASE1 ( SQS1), genes encoding terpene synthases involved in the generation of volatile compounds ( TPS23,  TPS21 and  TPS3), and genes involved in the catabolism of fatty acids to generate jasmonic acid such as  ALLENE OXIDASE CYCLASE4 ( AOC4),  ALLENE OXIDASE SYNTHASE ( AOS),  JASMONIC ACID CARBOXYL METHYLTRANSFERASE ( JMT),  FATTY ACID OXYGENATION UPREGULATED2 ( FOU2) and  LIPOXYGENASE1 and 2 ( LOX1 and  LOX2). Effects of ABA on the regulation of biotic and abiotic stress responses along peel ripening The response to biotic and abiotic stresses group included 12 different biological processes (Table  2). Among them, the response to water deprivation, the response to ABA stimulus, the defense response to fungus and the response to blue light, belonging to the most specific GO levels, were selected to assess transcriptional differences between parental and mutant FC fruit (Table  4). Notably, all the genes accounting for the responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses were significantly repressed in FC Pinalate as compared to FC Navelate fruit (Table  4). Indeed, parental FC fruit induced most of the genes belonging to these processes while mutant FC fruit was unable to carry out such inductions or even enhanced the repressions that eventually occurred in the parental fruit (Table  4). Within the context of this work, the response to ABA stimulus merits special mention. Among genes belonging to this process we identified a gene involved in the ABA catabolism ( CYP707A1), components of the ABA-signalosome ( PP2CA,  CPK32 and  MPK2), several transcription factors ( MYBST1,  MYB6,  ERF3b,  ABF4,  MYB102 and  GBF3) and a number of loci described as ABA-responsive genes in the  Arabidopsis model plant ( RD26,  SYP121,  ANNAT4,  LTP4,  ELF3,  ERD14,  ATAF1, PC5S,  PGL35 and  ALDH3-H1) (Table  4). We selected 8 of these genes categorized as ABA-dependent ( CsCYP707A1,  CsSYP121,  CsABF4,  CsATAF1,  CsRD26,  CsERD14,  CsGBF3 and  CsALDH3-H1) and conducted their expression analysis by qRT-PCR on Navelate and Pinalate fruit harvested at 6 ripening stages in order to investigate how Pinalate mutation affects their regulation along fruit maturation (Fig.  2). To better understand this question, two genes ( CsDREB2A and  CsSTZ) described as ABA-independent and belonging to the response to water deprivation biological process (Table  4) were also included in the analysis. Overall, expression patterns for a high number of the genes, including those described as ABA-independent, paralleled ABA accumulation along ripening in both cultivars (Fig.  2, Supplementary Fig.  S1). Thus, expression remained at low levels at green stages and sharply increased after color break to bottom down again at the end of the ripening (FC stage). Nevertheless, these genes showed higher expression values in the parental than in the mutant fruit at FC stage, when ABA levels were still 2-fold higher in Navelate than in Pinalate fruit (Fig.  2, Supplementary Fig.  S1). It should be noticed that the  CsGBF3 transcription factor and the  CsERD14 dehydrin did not follow this pattern and showed the maximum expression at the most immature stage to decrease thereafter in both cultivars (Fig.  2). On the other hand, marked differences between genotypes along all ripening stages were detected for the  CsSYP121 syntaxin and the  CsALDH3 aldehyde dehydrogenase. To narrow down the participation of ABA regulating these stress-related responses, the transcriptional regulation of the same set of genes studied along ripening was assessed in Navelate and its mutant Pinalate FC fruit after applying an ABA treatment. ABA application increased the ABA levels in Navelate FC fruit by about a 3-fold (from 0.57 to 1.73 μg/g fresh weight) and about a 10-fold in the mutant FC fruit (from 0.2 to 1.93 μg/g fresh weight), which means that ABA was efficiently uptaken by the fruit and similar levels of the hormone were reached in fruit of both cultivars upon 1 week of treatment. Consistently with data reported in Fig.  2, most of the genes were statistically repressed in the mutant as compared to control (non-treated) Navelate fruit (Fig.  3). After ABA treatment, all studied genes but  CsSTZ and  CsRD26 were induced in Navelate fruit as compared to control fruit (Fig.  3). In ABA-treated Pinalate fruit, however,  CsALDH3H,  CsERD14,  CsSYP121,  CsATAF1, CsDREB2A and  CsRD26 transcripts accumulation was increased as compared to control non-treated fruits (Fig.  3). In addition, not all these genes reached the same (or higher) transcript levels in Pinalate fruit after ABA treatment than in the parental. In fact, only  CsALDH3H,  CsERD14,  CsSYP121,  CsATAF1 and  CsDREB2A expression levels were similar between ABA-treated Navelate and Pinalate fruit; the expression of other genes such as  CsCYP707A1,  CsABF4,  CsSTZ,  CsGBF3 and  CsRD26 were still reduced in ABA-treated Pinalate as compared to control Navelate fruit, highlighting the partial ability of the mutant fruit after exogenous ABA application to recover the transcript levels found in the parental fruit.","Citrus fruit ripening is a complex process involving biochemical, physiological and molecular events that differ between the flesh and the peel of the fruit. We characterized sweet orange peel maturation by means of a comparative transcriptomic analysis between Navelate orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) and its mutant fruit Pinalate, which presents a severe blockage at early steps of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and consequently reduced ABA levels. Peel ripening involved the decrease of the photosynthetic activity and the transmembrane transport processes, as well as the buildup of starch and cuticular waxes and the cell wall modification. In addition, a number of biotic and abiotic stress responses, including the defense response, and the response to blue light, water deprivation and abscisic acid stimulus were modulated in a ripening-stage specific manner. The regulation of energy-related processes and secondary metabolism pathways was attenuated in Pinalate, while the molecular mechanisms underlying stress responses displayed dependency on ABA levels. These results indicate that ABA is a key signal inducing stress responses along orange peel ripening, which might determine the fruit postharvest performance.",,"['Pinalate fruit', 'Fruit', 'Pinalate', 'genes', 'Navelate fruit', 'Fig.', 'Table', 'Navelate', 'ABA', 'mutant fruit']","[ABA, Bk, Green (MG, DEG, Bk, Bk, DEG, Bk, HCA, Pinalate Bk fruit (Fig.  1D, Navelate Bk, DEG, Pinalate Bk fruit, DEG, Bk, light-harvesting chlorophyll, lignin, ABA, lignin, CCR2, 5-HYDROXYLASE1, Pinalate FC fruit (Table  3, Pinalate FC fruit, SYNTHETASE2, SYNTHETASE6, KCS6, KCS1, CER1, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, SBE2.1, ADP-alpha-glucose, alpha-amylose, photosystem I, PSI-G, delta, PGR5, photosystem I, TRANSPORTER39 (, ABCG39, AHA-F, ABCG32, DXS2, SYNTHETASE10, KCS10, SQS1, CYCLASE4, AOC4, UPREGULATED2, FOU2, 2, LOX1, ABA, ABA, ABA, ABA, ABA-signalosome (, PP2CA, MYBST1, RD26, PC5S, CsCYP707A1, CsDREB2A, ABA-independent, ABA, ABA, syntaxin, ABA, ABA, ABA, ABA, μg/g, μg/g, ABA, ABA, CsDREB2A, ABA, ABA]","['TPS23,', 'TPS21', 'TPS3),']",[],[],terpene synthase

Identification of TaPS as a Sesquiterpene Synthase Terpenes play important roles in plant growth and environmental adaptation. Although a few diterpene synthases have been characterized in wheat, no sesquiterpene synthase was identified. Based on the wheat genome sequence released on Phytozome, we cloned one terpene synthase gene. Transit and/or signal peptide predication indicated no transit/signal peptide sequence in its encoded protein. Recombinant expression in  E. coli through metabolic engineering enabled to supply isoprenoid precursors for potential terpene synthase [ 35, 39]. This wheat terpene synthase successfully catalyzed a single sesquiterpene production while FPP was supplied through co-expression of an  E. coli FPP synthase ( Figure 1). This sesquiterpene was tentatively identified to be β-patchoulene by the retention index and mass spectrum comparison with that in NIST MS library. GGPP and GPP were also provided to test the potential diterpene or monoterpene synthase activity, respectively; however, this terpene synthase did not exhibit any capacity to catalyze monoterpene or diterpene formation. In combining all these evidences, this wheat terpene synthase gene encoded a β-patchoulene synthase, accordingly named as TaPS. 3.2. Inducible TaPS Gene Expression and β-Patchoulene Accumulation To explore the biological function of TaPS, its gene expression pattern was analyzed. As indicated in  Figure 2A,  TaPS exhibited low constitutive expression in wheat leaves, stems and roots. Upon elicitation,  TaPS gene expression was induced differentially in response to various treatments. UV irradiation and MeJA treatment elevated  TaPS gene expression only slightly. Alamethicin treatment and  F. graminearum spore inoculation drastically induced  TaPS gene expression, suggesting involvement of TaPS in biotic stress response. Consistently, herbivory with beet armyworm larvae feeding also strongly induced  TaPS gene expression in wheat leaves. Based on the gene expression analysis, alamethicin was the powerful elicitor to induce  TaPS gene expression, which then was used to treat wheat leaves for terpene analysis by GC-MS. β-patchoulene was clearly detected in treated wheat tissues (~24 ng/g FW), this for the first time, but not in controls ( Figure 2B), consistent with inducible gene expression of  TaPS. In addition, we also detected other sesquiterpenes in wheat leaves, suggesting the presence of unknown sesquiterpene synthases that await their identification in future investigation ( Figure 2B and  Figure S2). 3.3. Arabidopsis Overexpressing TaPS Produced β-Patchoulene to Repel S. Exigua Larvae To explore the biological function  in planta,  TaPS was overexpressed in Arabidopsis under control of the 35S promoter. The RT-PCR analysis indicated that  TaPS was successfully expressed in Arabidopsis ( Figure 3A). Further GC-MS analysis also showed β-patchoulene production (~130 ng/g FW) in two transgenic Arabidopsis lines ( Figure 3B,C). These results proved that TaPS catalyzed β-patchoulene formation as a sesquiterpene synthase  in planta, consistent with its biochemical activity in microbial metabolic engineering system ( Figure 1). Sesquiterpenes have been reported to exhibit various functions particularly anti-herbivory activity in plants, being repellent and/or antifeedant or attracting predators or parasitoids [ 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. β-patchoulene is the component of essential oil from  P. cablin and has not been identified to be involved in plant defense. We used transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing  TaPS to investigate the anti-herbivory activity of β-patchoulene. In the dual-choice feeding preference assay,  S. exigua larvae preferred WT over transgenic leaves ( Figure 4A). After 24 h, leaf consumption by larvae on WT leaves was significantly higher than  TaPS overexpression lines ( Figure 4B), indicating repellent activity of β-patchoulene produced by  TaPS overexpression in Arabidopsis. The potential toxicity of β-patchoulene on larvae was also explored and no significant growth inhibition was observed when larvae fed transgenic Arabidopsis ( Figure S3), suggesting that β-patchoulene might not exert a direct toxicity to  S. exigua larvae. 3.4. Exploring TaPS Catalytic Mechanism by Homology Modeling and Mutagenesis To explore the catalytic mechanism of TaPS, homology modeling and docking was performed. As shown in  Figure 5A, the residues I392 and C393 were closely localized to the final product β-patchoulene in the kink of Helix G, which was proposed to be involved in stabilization of carbocation in Nt5EAS [ 40]. Amino acid sequence alignment indicated that both residues of I392 and C393 in TaPS were distinct from equivalent residues of other sTPSs ( Figure 5B and  Figure S4). Particularly, the patchoulol synthase from  P. cablin (PatTPS177) has a Cys and Gly at the equivalent positions, respectively [ 41]. Patchoulol has only one more hydroxyl group than β-pathchoulene and their corresponding biosynthetic enzymes should involve some key residues to generate these two similar products. We mutated I392 and C393 of TaPS to the equivalent C and G of PatTps177, respectively. The product profiles of both mutants were changed with FPP as the substrate ( Figure 5C and  Figure S5). Notably, some hydroxylated sesquiterpenoids were produced by TaPS mutants. Although none of them was identified as (−)-patchoulol by comparing with the authentic standard, generation of hydroxyl products by these mutants suggests involvement of I392 and C393 in TaPS catalysis and further investigation is needed to clarify the underlying mechanism.","Terpenoids play important roles in plant defense. Although some terpene synthases have been characterized, terpenoids and their biosynthesis in wheat ( Triticum   aestivum  L.) still remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the identification of a terpene synthase gene in wheat. It encodes a sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes β-patchoulene formation with  E,E -farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrate, thus named as TaPS. TaPS exhibits inducible expression in wheat in response to various elicitations. Particularly, alamethicin treatment strongly induces  TaPS  gene expression and β-patchoulene accumulation in wheat. Overexpression of  TaPS  in Arabidopsis successfully produces β-patchoulene, verifying the biochemical function of TaPS in planta. Furthermore, these transgenic Arabidopsis plants exhibit resistance against herbivory by repelling beet armyworm larvae feeding, thereby indicating anti-herbivory activity of β-patchoulene. The catalytic mechanism of TaPS is also explored by homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. Two key amino acids are identified to act in protonation and stability of intermediates and product formation. Taken together, one wheat sesquiterpene synthase is identified as β-patchoulene synthase. TaPS exhibits inducible gene expression and the sesquiterpene β-patchoulene is involved in repelling insect infestation.","['Resistance', 'Arabidopsis', 'Sesquiterpene', 'Wheat', 'herbivory', 'Patchoulene']","['Figure', 'TaPS', 'Gene Expression', 'TaPS Gene', 'Synthase', 'gene', 'terpene synthase', 'expression', 'β-patchoulene', 'Arabidopsis']","[TaPS, terpene synthase, terpene synthase [, wheat terpene synthase, FPP synthase ( Figure 1, wheat terpene synthase, TaPS, TaPS, TaPS, 2A, TaPS, TaPS, C, TaPS, cablin, TaPS, TaPS, Nt5EAS [ 40, TaPS, sTPSs, cablin (PatTPS177, TaPS, C, PatTps177, S5, TaPS, (−)-patchoulol, TaPS]","['sTPSs', '(PatTPS177)']",[],[],terpene synthase

Volatile Profiling of Finger Citron In order to obtain comprehensive information about volatile components of finger citron, flowers, leaves and fruits at different developmental stages were subjected to SPME-GC-MS analysis ( Figure 1A). Finger citron fruit weight increased from 68.33 g to 260.77 g during development ( Figure 1B). A total of 62 volatiles were detected in finger citron throughout these developmental stages ( Figure 1C and  Table S1). Major volatile classes of finger citron included 17 monoterpene hydrocarbons, 23 oxygenated monoterpenes, 13 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, one oxygenated sesquiterpene, and 8 others including aldehydes, alkanes, ketones, and olefins ( Table S1). Among these 62 volatiles identified, 33 chemicals (53.2%) were detected in all three organs (flower, leaf, and fruit). A total of eight chemicals (12.9%) were only detected in flower. Three chemicals (4.8%) were specifically produced by fruit and no unique volatiles were detected in finger citron leaf ( Figure 1C). Monoterpene was the most abundant class, accounting for 64.82% to 90.97% of the total content, followed by monoterpene derivative accounting for 6.84% to 32.47% ( Figure 1D). Finger citron accumulated volatile compounds during organ development, with the highest content of volatiles detected in fruit, followed by leaf and flower. Among all the volatiles detected, the most abundant chemical was limonene (3.88 mg/g to 16.73 mg/g), followed by γ-terpinene (0.92 mg/g to 7.22 mg/g) ( Table S1). A heat map was constructed to provide an overall view of volatiles detected in finger citron organs at different developmental stages ( Figure 2). In brief, volatiles could be clustered into three groups based on their profiles in finger citron organs. Group I volatiles were enriched in young leaf (F1). Volatiles in group II were enriched in fruit, including the two most abundant compounds, limonene and γ-terpinene. A total of 20 volatiles from group II were mainly detected in fruit and the contents of 17 volatiles accumulated during fruit development. In contrast, the content of the major volatile limonene tended to decrease during finger citron fruit ripening, declining from 16.73 mg/g to 13.41 mg/g ( Figure 2 and  Table S1). Group III consisted of 13 volatiles that mainly accumulated in fully opened flowers. The most notable change was observed for β-caryophyllene, whose contents increased more than 90-fold during flower maturation ( Table S1). 2.2. Identification of Key Volatiles Variation in contents of volatiles observed in  Figure 2 prompted us to investigate if finger citron organs could be distinguished based on volatile profiles. A PLS-DA model was constructed to explore the separation of organs using volatiles as variables. Permutation and cross validation tests validated the significance of the treatment differences with  p < 0.01 ( Figure S1A,B), indicating that the obtained PLS-DA model is reliable. A separation of the finger citron leaf, flower, and fruit was observed in the PLS-DA score plot ( Figure 3A) with no points overlapped. In order to identify biomarkers for discriminating finger citron samples, variable importance in projection (VIP) scores were calculated for each volatile. It has been reported that variables with value exceeding 1.0 play important roles in the PLS-DA discriminant process [ 48]. A total of 24 volatiles with VIP > 1.0 were identified ( Figure S1C), indicating these were volatiles responsible for clustering and separation of finger citron samples. Among the top 10 compounds, nine were monoterpenoids, including γ-terpinene, α-terpinene, camphene, terpinolene, α-pinene, α-thujene, β-pinene, terpineol, and β-terpineol. Compared to flower and leaf, the concentrations of these monoterpenoids were higher in fruit, and they tended to accumulate during fruit ripening ( Figure 2,  Table S1). For volatiles mentioned above, terpinene isomers γ-terpinene and α-terpinene were the top two volatiles with high VIP values of 1.78 and 1.76, respectively. Our previous study observed distinct volatile profiles of finger citron fruit compared to various other Citrus species and varieties [ 25]. PLS analysis was used in order to distinguish the six species by their volatile profiles ( Figure 3B). The first two PLS-factors were able to explain 99% variance of citron relative to pummelo, hybrids, sour orange, mandarin, and sweet orange and the clustering results were in agreement with classic Citrus taxonomy. Volatile compounds that have important roles in discriminating citrus fruit samples were identified by Shen et al. and the VID-coefficients were calculated [ 25]. As an arbitrary threshold, a VID coefficient with absolute value of 0.70 was taken [ 49]. By comparing the VID-coefficient and VIP values for each volatile compound, 6 volatiles with VID score exceeding 0.70 and VIP score exceeding 1.0 were observed ( Figure 3C). These volatiles are suggested to be characteristic compounds of finger citron separating it from other Citrus species ( Figure 3). 2.3. A Transcriptome Atlas of Finger Citron In an attempt to understand the changes in gene expression causing metabolite diversity during development, we sequenced the RNA libraries extracted from flower, leaf and fruit. Information about RNA-Seq quality is summarized in  Table S2. The correlation coefficients of tested samples were listed in  Figure S2. The correlation of the three biological replicates is above 0.7, with false discovery rate (FDR) value < 0.01 indicating the reliability of sampling. The relatively low correlation between organs indicates a selectively expression pattern of finger citron genes. A total of 1.5G clean data was generated, 95.80% of which was successfully mapped to the reference genome of C. medica. We assembled 32,579 genes, which were expressed in finger citron. For functional annotation, unigenes were searched against the Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG). About 76% of the unigenes were assigned to GO terms and 42% of them were annotated with KEGG entries. This information establishes the foundation for further investigation into target genes. Fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (FPKM) values were calculated to represent gene expression levels and the gene number and FPKM distribution are summarized in  Figure S3. Most genes were expressed in the 0.3~3.57 and 3.57~15 intervals ( Figure S3). In general, flowers had the most genes expressed and fruit had the least. As mentioned above, plant terpenoids are synthesized from two independent pathways and the upstream genes and their functions are well studied [ 2]. Hence, we screened key structural genes involved in terpene biosynthesis by KEGG annotation. The values of their expression fold changes are listed in  Table 1. Table 1 shows the DEGs in MEP and MVA pathways during organ development. In total, 12 DEGs were identified. No gene transcripts changed significantly during flower development. In the MEP pathway, two DXSs (catalyzing the formation of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate), Cm152440, and Cm165980 were significantly down-regulated in fruit. DXS/Cm152440 was down-regulated in leaf while another DXS/Cm104830 showed an opposite trend. MDS/ Cm051360 and HDS/ Cm131750 were up-regulated in fruit and flower, respectively. In the MVA pathway, there were four genes differentially expressed: two were down-regulated in leaf and two up-regulated in fruit. During fruit development, the expression level of HMGR, which is considered as the rate limiting enzyme in the MVA pathway [ 50], was up-regulated by 5.5-fold. 2.4. Changes in Transcript Levels of TPS Gene Family Terpene synthases catalyze the final pathway steps converting the universal substrates GPP, FPP, and GGPP into terpenoids. There are many members of the TPS family and their complex catalytic mechanisms contribute to the terpenoid diversity in the plant kingdom [ 4]. A total of 58  TPS genes were identified from finger citron based on KEGG annotation. A schematic diagram of TPSs gene structure ( Figure S4) shows that finger citron  TPS gene lengths ranged from about 200 bp to 16,000 bp. Some of these sequences are predicted to be inactive partial fragments in comparison to characterized TPSs in tomato and sweet orange [ 9, 15]. In order to provide an overview of expression profiles of the  TPS gene family, their transcript levels were presented and visualized as a heat map ( Figure 4). As found for volatiles in  Figure 2, the  TPS genes in  Figure 4 were also clustered into groups based on their expression patterns, named TPS-Cluster1 to 4. For flower, genes in TPS-Cluster1 were mainly accumulated ( Figure 4). The expression of six  TPS genes (Cm105420, Cm186730, Cm269930, Cm126620, Cm257250, and Cm050840) increased during flower development, while four genes (Cm294730, Cm105550, Cm116860, and Cm257230) decreased. Genes from TPS-Cluster2 and TPS-Cluster3 were predominantly expressed in young and mature leaves, respectively. These two clusters together contain 25 genes, accounting for 38% of  TPS gene family members. For TPS-Cluster4, genes were mainly expressed in fruit. During fruit development, transcript levels of two  TPS genes (Cm186720 and Cm269920) increased markedly from S1 to S2 and then remained constant afterwards. High transcript levels of  TPS genes Cm107350 and Cm285480 were detected in ripe fruit at S6 stage ( Figure 4). The spatial and temporal expressing pattern implies the diverse function of TPSs and the regulating mechanism behind terpenoid metabolism, although extremely complex, can now be probed thanks to the developing of modern techniques. To evaluate expression pattern based on RNA-Seq, RT-qPCR analysis was performed. Four fingers citron TPS genes were randomly selected for gene expression analysis during fruit ripening. As shown in  Figure S5, RT-qPCR results matched the expression pattern produced by RNA-Seq. These results indicated that the RNA-Seq data of the present study were accurate and reliable.  2.5. Changes in Transcript Levels of Transcription Factors The transcript levels of  TPS genes were regulated by a number of different TFs. So far, six TF families in plants associated with terpenoid metabolism have been identified, including AP2/ERF [ 25, 26, 32, 33], bHLH [ 31], MYB [ 27], NAC [ 28], WRKY [ 29], and bZIP [ 30]. Their gene IDs are summarized in  Table S3. Changes in the transcript levels of these six TF families from developing finger citron tissues were analyzed and presented as heat maps ( Figure S6). The AP2/ERF family with 251 members was the largest, followed by the NAC family with 184 members and bHLH family with 169 members. As shown in  Figure S5, TFs from different families had unique expression patterns. For the AP2/ERF family, members were grouped into clusters according to expression profiles in developing tissues of finger citron ( Figure S6). There were 88 (35%)  AP2/ERFs mainly expressed in developing fruit, where nine members had the highest expression level in ripe fruit at the S6 stage. For flowers, 36  AP2/ERFs had the most abundant transcripts in full flower stage at F2. For finger citron leaves, higher transcript levels of 18  AP2/ERFs were observed in young leave L1 than mature leave L2 ( Figure S6). Among the 169 members in the bHLH family, 58 genes were mainly expressed in fruit, 43 genes in flowers and 68 genes in leaves ( Figure S6). For fruit, 11  bHLHs had the highest expression level in young fruit at the S1 stage. During flower development, expression of 21  bHLHs increased from F1 to F2, while 22 members decreased. Of the  bHLHs mainly expressed in leaves, 58 genes had higher transcript abundance in young leaves L1 than mature leaves L2 ( Figure S6). A total of 76 bZIP members were identified in finger citron, where 31 (41%) members were mainly expressed in leaves ( Figure S6). For MYB family, 58 (37%) of the total 155 family members were enriched in flower tissue. A total of 44  MYBs exhibited higher transcript levels in young flower at F1 ( Figure S6). We observed that  NAC genes were enriched in flowers, where 52 (28%) members were expressed mainly in young flowers ( Figure S6). Nearly half of the  WRKYs (27 out of 66 genes) were enriched in fruit tissues. All of these TF expression profiles, together with those of the  TPS genes, were used for the gene co-expression analysis. 2.6. Analysis of Gene Correlation Network Both volatiles and genes showed dynamic changes in developing organs of finger citron. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to get a better understanding of the relationships between them and their place in the complex signaling networks regulating terpenoid metabolism. A total of 45 gene modules from the dynamic hierarchical tree cut were obtained after a series of matrix transformation procedures and network construction ( Figure 5). The largest module was Module Turquoise, containing 1954 genes, and the smallest, 30 genes each, was observed for Module Ivory and Module Floralwhite. To evaluate the biological importance of the modules, the Pearson correlation between Module eigengenes and external sample traits (in this case, volatile concentrations) [ 44] were calculated and visualized in  Figure 6. The most abundant two components (limonene and γ-terpinene) with the six characteristic components identified in  Figure 3C were selected as interesting traits. The terpene synthase gene numbers in each module are shown on the left. In  Figure 6, the 58  TPSs were assigned to 22 modules according to their transcript profiles. Finger citron  TPSs occurred in more than twenty modules. This result is predictable because  Figure 4 already implied a diversity of  TPS expression patterns. The modules with the highest number of  TPS genes were Module Red (11) Module Green (7) and Module Blue (5). In addition to the only sesquiterpene, β-bisabolene, the remaining volatiles showed similar correlation coefficients with a certain module. For example, the correlation coefficients between Module Red and seven monoterpenoids fell in a narrow interval (−0.62 to −0.52) and these monoterpenoids have similar accumulation patterns in finger citron tissues ( Figure 2). Module Red, Module Green and Module Blue were large modules, comprising 661, 707, and 1406 nodes, respectively. Connections of genes were hard to distinguish in the co-expression networks constructed on all nodes ( Figure S7). So, to get a better view of genes strongly correlated to  TPS genes, subnetworks were extracted from these three modules using TPSs as seed nodes. Subnetworks constructed from Module Red and Module Blue were visualized as  Figure 7 and  Figure 8, respectively. Although Module Blue is the largest of the three analyzed modules, no TF was identified in its subnetwork ( Figure S8). In these subnetworks, two categories of genes which are the main focus of this work:  TPS genes (red nodes) and transcription factors (blue nodes). Edges in figures indicate the interactions between the node gene and surrounding TFs in a module. The subnetwork of Module Red contains four  TPSs: Cm105420, Cm186730, Cm207000, and Cm269930 ( Figure 7). Cm186730 was located on the right of the network, while the other three genes gathered in the center. A total of five TFs were observed in this subnetwork. As a member of NAC family, Cm303080 was connected to two  TPSs, Cm207000 and Cm105420 ( Figure 7). These two  TPS genes were also connected to MYB family member Cm258540. The  TPS gene Cm105420, transcript levels were also suggested to be related to transcription factor C2H2 family member Cm279030 and G2-like family member Cm127980. For  TPS gene Cm269930, transcription factor CPP family Cm308600 was connected ( Figure 7,  Table S4). No transcription factors were observed to be connected to TPS Cm186730. Based the information in  Table S4, Cm070050, Cm269580, and Cm264610 were all predicted to be polygalacturonase genes. This result indicates that, terpenoid metabolism and cell wall metabolism appear to be related in this specific module.  There were six  TPSs (Cm310520, Cm252580, Cm074160, Cm257260, Cm116770, and Cm028750) in the Module Green subnetwork. Four of them clustered together, including Cm252580, Cm074160, Cm257260, and Cm116770.  TPS gene Cm257260 was connected to four TFs, including MYB family Cm028420, bHLH family Cm110180 and Cm027020, and ARR-B family Cm022190 ( Table S5). For the other two  TPS genes, Cm028750 was localized at the right edge, while Cm310520 on the left connected to 27 genes. Cm3102520, whose expression was suggested to be related to six TFs ( Figure 8). These six TFs included MIKC_MADS family Cm111830, ARR-B family Cm022190, AP2 family Cm215520, ARF family Cm061930, bHLH family Cm227880, and HD-ZIP family Cm175400 ( Table S5). Functions of other genes were also investigated ( Figure S5). There were genes predicted to participate in secondary metabolism: Cm112960 and Cm107930. Cm093530 and Cm023630 was related to hormone signal transduction. 2.7. Phylogenetic Tree Analysis of Finger Citron TPS The functions of the TPSs remained unknown, so we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on their amino acid sequences ( Figure 9) together with the Citrus TPS reported by Alquézar et al. In  Figure 9,  TPS genes in the phylogenetic tree were highlighted by red dots. Finger citron  TPS genes were assigned to four subfamilies: 20 in TPS-a, 18 in TPS-b, 2 in TPS-e/f, and 4 in TPS-g. Genes in the TPS-a subfamily are predicted to catalyze the formation of sesquiterpenes [ 12]. There were 20 finger citron  TPS belong to this subfamily. Genes in TPS-b usually encode proteins that function as monoterpene synthases. TPS-g is a clade closely related to TPS-b and there is evidence that monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes can be formed by genes from the TPS-g clade [ 10, 51]. Despite their diverse functions, they share the common feature that all their products are acyclic. There are two finger citron TPSs that belong to the e/f clade. To get a more precise prediction of finger citron TPS function, sequence identities compared with characterized  TPS genes from other  Citrus species were calculated and are summarized in  Figure S9. Since the correlated volatiles to Module Red and Module Green were monoterpenoids ( Figure 6), attention was paid to genes in TPS-b and g subfamilies. The extracted Subnetwork of Module Red contains 4  TPS genes. Cm269930 and Cm186730 shared 97.66% identity and they both belonged to TPS-b subfamily ( Figure 9). Cm269930 was the hub gene, highly connected node, in Module Red. Sequence analysis showed that Cm269930 shared high amino acid sequence identity with  C. unshiu γ-terpinene synthase BAD27258 (72.78%) and  C. limon γ-terpinene synthase AAM53943 (71.01%) ( Figure S9). Low sequence identity (29.26%–40.00%) was observed between Cm105420 and  Citrus TPSs ( Figure S9). Module Green contains 6  TPSs. TPS family member Cm310520 was ruled out for the phylogenetic analysis because of its inadequate length. Three members (Cm028750, Cm074160, and Cm257260) belong to TPS-b family. Sequence analysis showed that Cm257260 had 90.7% identity with  C. limon (+)-limonene synthase AAM53944 and  C. jambhiri limonene synthase BAF73932 ( Figure S9). Cm116700 and Cm252580 belong to TPS-a family ( Figure 9) and the Cm116700 sequence was 95.02% identical with  C. sinensis sesquiterpene synthases Cs4g12350 ( Figure S9). Cm028750 and Cm074160 sequence identities were less than 50% homolgous to  Citrus TPSs sequences. For three  TPS genes from Module Blue, Cm206970 and Cm279170 belong to TPS-a subfamily, while Cm107390 belong to TPS-g subfamily ( Figure 9). Sequence analysis revealed that Cm206970 and Cm279170 had 96.17% and 97.76% identity with  C. unshiu linalool synthase BAP75561, respectively ( Figure S9). For Cm107390, sequence identities to characterized  Citrus TPSs were less than 45%. These results indicated possible roles of finger citron TPSs from three Modules (Red, Green, and Blue) in biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids, although their functions need to be further investigated.","Finger citron ( Citrus medica  var.  sarcodactylis ) is a popular ornamental tree and an important source of essential oils rich in terpenoids, but the mechanisms behind volatile formation are poorly understood. We investigated gene expression changes combined with volatile profiling of ten samples from three developing organs: flower, leaf, and fruit. A total of 62 volatiles were identified with limonene and γ-terpinene being the most abundant ones. Six volatiles were identified using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) that could be used as markers for distinguishing finger citron from other citrus species. RNA-Seq revealed 1,611,966,118 high quality clean reads that were assembled into 32,579 unigenes. From these a total of 58 terpene synthase (TPS) gene family members were identified and the spatial and temporal distribution of their transcripts was measured in developing organs. Transcript levels of transcription factor genes  AP2/ERF  (251),  bHLH  (169),  bZIP  (76),  MYB  (155),  NAC  (184), and  WRKY  (66) during finger citron development were also analyzed. From extracted subnetworks of three modules constructed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), thirteen  TPS  genes and fifteen transcription factors were suggested to be related to volatile terpenoid formation. These results provide a framework for future investigations into the identification and regulatory network of terpenoids in finger citron.","['Citrus', 'Transcription factor', 'Limonene', 'Rna-seq', 'Wgcna', 'Γ-terpinene', 'Terpene Synthase Gene']","['Finger Citron', 'Figure', 'TPS genes', 'TPS', 'genes', 'TPS Gene', 'citron TPS', 'Citron', 'Finger', 'module']","[Citron, 260.77, S1A, VIP, VIP >, α-pinene, VIP, PLS-factors, VID-coefficients, VID-coefficient, VIP, VIP, Citron, 32,579, 3.57~15, Cm152440, Cm165980, DXS/Cm104830, MDS/ Cm051360, HDS/ Cm131750, HMGR, GGPP, TPS-Cluster1 to 4, TPS-Cluster1, Cm105420, Cm186730, Cm269930, Cm126620, Cm257250, Cm294730, Cm105550, Cm116860, Cm257230, TPS-Cluster2, TPS-Cluster3, TPS-Cluster4, Cm186720, Cm269920, Cm107350, S5, AP2/ERF, MYB [ 27, WRKY [ 29, bZIP [ 30, IDs, AP2/ERF, S5, AP2/ERF, S6, L1, L2 ( Figure S6, F2, bZIP, MYB, Green (7, −0.62, −0.52, Blue, Blue, Blue, Cm105420, Cm186730, Cm207000, Cm269930 (, Cm186730, Cm303080, Cm207000, Cm105420, MYB, Cm258540, Cm105420, Cm279030, G2-like, Cm127980, Cm269930, Cm308600, Cm186730, Cm070050, Cm269580, Cm264610, polygalacturonase, Cm310520, Cm252580, Cm074160, Cm257260, Cm116770, Cm252580, Cm074160, Cm257260, Cm116770, Cm257260, MYB, Cm028420, Cm110180, Cm027020, ARR-B, Cm022190, S5, Cm028750, Cm310520, Cm3102520, MIKC_MADS, Cm111830, ARR-B, Cm022190, AP2, Cm215520, ARF, Cm061930, bHLH, Cm227880, HD-ZIP, Cm175400, S5, Cm112960, Cm107930, Cm023630, Citron, Cm269930, Cm186730, Cm269930, Cm269930, Cm105420, Cm310520, Cm074160, Cm257260, Cm257260, AAM53944, Cm252580, Cm116700, Cs4g12350, Cm074160, Cm206970, Cm279170, Cm107390, Cm206970, Cm279170, BAP75561, Cm107390, Blue]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-Cluster1', 'TPS-Cluster1', 'TPS', 'TPS-Cluster2', 'TPS-Cluster3', 'TPS', 'TPS-Cluster4,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPSs:', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-e/f,', 'TPS-g.', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPSs', 'TPSs.', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-a', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-g', 'TPSs', 'TPSs']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']","['Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus']",terpene synthase
98,98,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6742361\eupmc_result.json,PMC6742361,"Results Variation in terpene profile across cultivars To better understand how terpene content varies across  C.  sativa flower bound for the dispensary market in Washington state, GC-MS data for flower samples was filtered for samples with more than 0.5% total terpene to yield 475 samples. These were aggregated by cultivar to give a final data set of 240 cultivars. Note that while this data set represents a broad range of C. sativa samples, Jamaican Lion and Purple Kush (the source, respectively, of the assembly and transcriptome data we are using) are not in this set, so no direct correlations can be made between the oil profile data and the expression results shown below. This data set was used to construct a heat map of the twenty most abundant terpenes ( Fig 1). The heatmap has been ordered with the most abundant terpene (β-myrcene) at the top, and hierarchical clustering on the normalized and mean-centered columns (cultivars). This clustering brings together similar profiles and shows some of the patterns in terpene profile. Starting with overall terpene profile, while typically one or two terpenes dominate a particular sample, the terpene profile in  C.  sativa flowers tends to be complex, with an average of 11.2 terpenes present at above 1% of total terpene content, and 5.4 present at above 5% of the total terpenes ( S1 Fig). The dominant terpene on average constitutes just 35% of total terpene, and it’s rare, at least in this data set, for a single terpene to constitute more than 50% of total terpene. On average, the top four terpenes comprise just 72% of the total. The clustering shown in  Fig 1 suggests it would be possible to identify chemovars based on terpene profile, just grouping cultivars by the one or two most abundant terpenes. However, differences between cultivar profiles are more complex than this, and a simple classification scheme may miss potentially important variation. One of the driving features of this variability is the dynamic range of individual terpenes. Terpinolene, for example, a cyclic monoterpene with a very distinctive smell, is present at less than 0.01% fresh weight in 86% of the cultivars shown here, but in the remaining 14% of cultivars, it is either the dominant terpene, or close to it. A possible explanation for this would be to posit that there are two enzymes in  C.  sativa that produce terpinoline. The first makes terpinolene as it’s primary product, but a second enzyme produces terpinolene as a minor side product, accounting for the background level of terpinolene found in most cultivars. While variability in concentration is most pronounced with terpinolene, it is apparent across the full set of terpenes shown here. In fact, each of the top five terpenes (β-myrcene, α-pinene, D-limonene, β-caryophyllene and terpinolene) vary from being the single most abundant terpene in a cultivar to being a minor component, or in some cases not detectable. The less abundant terpenes, such as the acyclic monoterpenes β- and cis-ocimene (made by TPS6 and TPS13, respectively, [ 7]), or the acyclic sesquiterpenes α-and β-farnesene, also vary from undetectable levels to being major components in other cultivars. Another pattern visible in the heatmap is that some terpenes follow each other’s concentration very closely. The most visually obvious example of this is β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, plotted against each other in  Fig 2A. Data points are scattered around the regression line consistent with sample variability and perhaps measurement error, but there is a strong linear relationship (R^2 = 0.92). TPS9 has been shown to produce a mixture of β-caryophyllene and α-humulene at a ratio of about 2.5:1 [ 7]. In our data this ratio is 3.2:1, which is close enough to the  in vitro result that it could just represent the difference between  in vitro and  in vivo environments.  Fig 2B–2F show linear relationships between the rest of the top six most highly correlated terpene pairs. The linear relationship between the cyclic monoterpenes α-and γ-terpinene can be explained by the fact that TPS33 has been shown to make these two molecules in approximately equal proportions [ 7]. These striking linear relationships arise when molecules share a common enzymatic source, but correlation may be degraded when there are multiple enzymatic sources for a pair of molecules. The larger scale correlation structure of the data set is shown in the correlation plot in  Fig 3. Certain correlations like β-caryophyllene and α-humulene stand out, but some examples of lack of correlation are also informative. For example, β-myrcene is fairly independent in the correlation plot, with just a modest correlation to β-pinene (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.56). So far, two enzymes have been characterized that produce β-myrcene as sole product, TPS3 and TPS30 [ 7], which would lead you to suspect β-myrcene should be fairly isolated. But TPS5, which is a highly expressed gene in Purple Kush (see  Fig 4 below), has been shown to produce approximately equal amounts of β-myrcene and α-pinene [ 7]. This would seem sufficient to account for the amount of correlation we see. Further, many cyclic monoterpene synthases produce small amounts of β-myrcene as a side product [ 1]. The  C.  sativa β-pinene synthase is as yet unidentified, but it is common for α-and β-pinene synthases in other species to produce some amount of β-myrcene as a by-product [ 20]. Cis-ocimene is produced as a single product by TPS13 [ 7], and shows no correlation to other terpenes ( Fig 3). The cluster including terpinolene, α-and γ-terpinene, carene and α-phellandrene would be consistent with a yet to be identified terpinolene synthase enzyme that produces this whole group. This fits with current knowledge because all of these molecules could arise from the same carbocation intermediate [ 6], and are frequently seen as byproducts of synthases that make terpinolene, either as primary product or a byproduct [ 20, 21]. Terpene synthase family structure and genomic organization Twelve  C.  sativa TPS genes have been functionally characterized and described at the cDNA level, and in the same study about half of the TPS family was detected at least as an initial sequence similarity hit [ 7]. We conducted exhaustive reference protein-based gene discovery using a Jamaican Lion assembly, with a total size of 1.06 gb and an N50 of 2.6 mb. Our strategy started with blast searches to identify gene containing regions, followed by exonerate searches with the most similar reference TPS sequence as query in order to estimate gene models. This approach yielded 65 candidate genes which were filtered to remove those with multiple frameshifts, or that were otherwise fragmentary. This left 55 complete or essentially complete genes for further analysis. The total number of active TPS genes in  C.  sativa may be higher than this since some cultivars may carry active versions of genes we omitted for frameshifts, or because of gaps in the current genome builds, but given the relative completeness of this assembly, we expect this to represent all or most of the family.  Fig 4 shows a neighbor joining tree calculated from this set of 55 predicted proteins with ClustalW2 [ 22], with a bar plot on the right side of the figure showing expression in the Purple Kush RNA-Seq data set [ 13]. While product profile cannot yet be predicted from protein sequence [ 6], based on protein similarity we can classify by family, using the characterized TPS1 limonene synthase sequence from  C.  sativa [ 12] and the  Mentha spicata limonene synthase [ 23] as exemplars for classification of the TPS-b family, and the characterized TPS9 β-caryophyllene / α-humulene synthase from  C.  sativa [ 7] and the  Abies grandis γ-humulene synthase as exemplars for identification of TPS-a family members. The exemplar for the TPS-c family was KSG_ARATH, the  Arabidopsis ent-kaur-16-ene synthase. The TPS-a family is primarily responsible for sesquiterpene synthesis, TPS-b accounts for monoterpene synthesis and TPS-c accounts for diterpene synthesis [ 10]. These categories are labelled in the tree. The C. sativa TPS family breaks down into 26 TPS-b monoterpene synthases, 21 TPS-a sesquiterpene synthases and four TPS-c diterpene synthases. To get an idea of the sequence diversity of this family, the complete set of pairwise comparisons of the protein sequences was carried out with BLASTP to create a distance matrix. This family is extremely diverse with just 2% of pairwise comparisons having greater than 90% amino acid identity, and the median pairwise identity at just 42%. 54 of these genes had detectable transcripts in the Purple Kush RNA-Seq data set. Total expression in Purple Kush is dominated by just a few genes TPS1, TPS18 and TPS5, but there are 16 genes each accounting for at least 1% of total transcription, and 23 accounting for at least 0.5% of total TPS gene expression. While we lack detailed terpene profile data for Purple Kush, a pattern of expression like this, where a small number of synthases dominate, but the total set of expressed synthases is reasonably large would fit well with the oil profile data we report for dispensary bound samples. About half of the identified genes are in genomic arrays of various sizes, primarily containing closely related genes. These arrays are shown as blue bars on the dendrogram in  Fig 4. The largest TPS cluster contains 11 TPS-b genes, including characterized genes TPS1, TPS2, TPS3 and TPS33, spread over about a megabase, with sections of intervening unrelated genes. This would appear to be the oldest array, as on average these genes share just 66% identity, but there are three pairs of genes in this array that are nearly identical, suggesting more recent local duplications. There are two arrays of five genes each, one containing TPS-a genes, and the other TPS-b genes. The first of these spans 135kB, and contains four closely related sesquiterpene synthases, sharing an average of 90% amino acid identity, and including TPS8 (the γ-eudesmol, valencene synthase [ 7]), and a fifth gene, TPS32, that is slightly more distant at around 81% identity. From a sequence similarity standpoint, TPS7 would be expected to be found in this cluster, but no convincing candidate was found in the Jamaican Lion, Pineapple Banana Bubba Kush (GenBank accession GCA_002090435.1) or Cannatonic (GenBank accession GCA_001865755.1) contigs. The TPS7 gene is clearly expressed, however, in Purple Kush ( Fig 4), so failure to find a copy is most likely due to the incomplete nature of the genome assemblies. The second of these five gene arrays spans 225kB and includes TPS5, a β-myrcene / α-pinene synthase [ 7] and, four uncharacterized monoterpene synthases. These four are nearly identical (on average 97% identical at the protein level), and they have very similar gene structure, with seven coding exons separated by unusually compact introns, a 5’ UTR in a separate exon, and 3’ UTR in the last exon ( Fig 5). At 2650 bp in length, these are the shortest terpene synthase genes in  C.  sativa. Lastly they all show root specific expression in the Purple Kush data set (see below,  Fig 6). TPS5, on the other hand, is on average 73% identical to the four root specific synthases, is one of the longer TPS genes at about 8500 bp, including UTRs, and has a very different expression pattern (see below,  Fig 6). Interestingly, the first three coding exons are very similar both structurally and in terms of protein sequence across the entire set of five, with the length difference resulting from large additions into the last four introns. RNA-Seq expression analysis To assess tissue specific expression we used the Purple Kush RNA-Seq data [ 13], comprising samples from six tissues: root, stem, shoot, pre-flower, early flower, and midflower. This sample set contains no biological replicates for the tissue samples, so no statistical analysis can be done here, but large differences in fragment count can still be judged to be biologically significant. As discussed in Methods, sequence divergence between Purple Kush and Jamaican Lion was estimated at 0.36%, which is certainly compatible with accurate fragment alignment. Purple Kush reads were mapped onto a cDNA set representing the 55 predicted TPS genes using HISAT2 [ 24], and converted to RPMK values with the R ballgown module [ 14]. A heatmap of the 48 most abundant transcripts is shown in  Fig 6. Looking at total gene expression across the six tissue types, almost 45% of TPS gene expression occurs in the mid flower sample, while about 10% of expression occurs in roots. Transcripts are detected for 54 genes, but the top five TPS1, TPS5, TPS18, TPS7, TPS14 constitute about 70% of total TPS gene expression (this set includes synthases for D-limonene, β-myrcene and γ-eudesmol, [ 7]). One or two tissues tend to dominate expression for any given TPS, with the top tissue on average accounting for about 60% of total expression. The expression patterns fall into six clades, one for each of the six tissues in this data set, with the root specific set being the largest and having the highest degree of tissue specificity. Of the 23 genes expressed in root, ten show highly root-specific expression, meaning that roots account for greater than 80% of total expression (six of these roots are 100% root specific). TPS6, the β-ocimene synthase is the only functionally characterized synthase in this set, but nine out of the ten are TPS-b genes and thus expected to be monoterpene synthases. The flower specific clade (combining genes most highly expressed in early and mid-flower samples) accounts for most of the total expression, but these genes show less pronounced specificity than the root specific set. 44 genes have at least some expression in mid-flower plus early flower. These are a mix of mono- and sesquiterpene synthases (either demonstrated or predicted based on sequence similarity). Gene structure Gene models for 53 substantially complete terpene synthases (manually curated by combining Exonerate and StringTie outputs) are shown in  Fig 7. In terms of exon structure, the  C.  sativa TPS family shows consistent patterns that are highly conserved across angiosperms, gymnosperms, and even bryophytes [ 1, 25] The TPS-a and TPS-b subfamilies, encoding sesquiterpene and monoterpene synthases respectively, tend very strongly to have seven exons, (sometimes containing 5’- or 3’-UTRs in separate exons). Members of the TPS-c family, which is primarily responsible for diterpenes, typically have 15 exons [ 1], similar to what we observe. While the overall exon/intron structure in the  C.  sativa TPS family is conserved, gene sizes vary across a nearly eightfold range from TPS37 at 2223 bp to TPS4-like at almost 19 kbp. Most of this variation comes from intron size, from the very compact TPS37 at 135% of coding sequence length, to TPS4-like at 1150% of coding length. The average intron size for the TPS synthase genes is 984 bp with a median of 673 bp, but many of these genes have one or two exceptionally large introns. 70% of these genes have at least one intron longer than 1000 bp, and 11 have an intron longer than 5000 bp (the longest is in TPS4-like at 8672 bp). To investigate whether these introns are unusually long we needed to know more about the distribution of intron sizes in  C.  sativa. This is still a largely unannotated genome, so we constructed a high confidence reference guided transcriptome as described in the methods, requiring a read depth of 200 to call an intron junction. This yielded 10,913 transcripts across 9,173 genes with a median coverage of 730 reads. In total, this yields 80,229 introns, with an overall median length of 147 bp, and the most common length (or mode) at 88 bp. This is a highly skewed distribution, with 65% of introns shorter than 250 bp, but less common introns as large as 10 kbp (the maximum length cutoff set for this transcriptome assembly). A recently available assembly of the  C.  sativa genome includes annotation using a more comprehensive approach than we’ve used here, [ 26] and analysis of their annotation shows essentially the same overall intron length distribution. Finally, we compared the longest intron in each TPS gene against the longest introns per gene across the entire transcriptome. The length distribution for the longest introns is shown in  Fig 8 (median = 713 bp, mean = 1030 bp), with the longest TPS introns shown as red arrows. The mean length for the longest TPS introns, 2424 bp, is in the top 11% of longest introns across the whole transcriptome, and some TPS introns are among the longest in  C.  sativa. Active site variation Both the monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase active sites have been extensively studied through crystallographic, mutational, and functional activity assays [ 6]. For example, using the crystal structure of the  Mentha spicata D-limonene synthase 2ONH [ 26], alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to show that only residues within 5 angstroms of the substrate had a strong impact on enzyme output. The 24 monoterpene synthases identified in this study were aligned to the  Mentha spicata 2ONH sequence, and the aligned active site residues are shown in  Fig 9. Both the monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase active sites contain a set of completely conserved residues that, when mutated, result in complete loss of enzymatic activity [ 10]. The rest of the active site consists of highly variable positions, or plasticity residues, mutation of which can lead to a change in product profile of the enzyme [ 4, 8, 9, 27]. These are indicated in  Fig 9. Known major products from the published  C.  sativa characterization work are shown on the right hand side of the figure [ 7, 12]. Fig 10 shows an alignment of the active site residues from 25 sesquiterpene synthases, aligned to the  Abies grandis γ-humulene synthase (AAC05728), where similar studies, including a crystal structure and mutagenesis experiments have been done [ 8, 9]. There are several sets of two or even three of the  C.  sativa synthases that are identical for this set of active site residues, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they make the same products. Although TPS4 and TPS9 have identical active site residues, and are 97% identical at the protein level, TPS4 makes primarily alloaromadendrene with side products including α-humulene, while TPS9 produces β-caryophyllene and α-humulene [ 7].","Terpenes are responsible for most or all of the odor and flavor properties of Cannabis sativa, and may also impact effects users experience either directly or indirectly. We report the diversity of terpene profiles across samples bound for the Washington dispensary market. The remarkable degree of variation in terpene profiles ultimately results from action of a family of terpene synthase genes, only some of which have been described. Using a recently available genome assembly we describe 55 terpene synthases with genomic context, and tissue specific expression. The family is quite diverse from a protein similarity perspective, and subsets of the family are expressed in all tissues in the plant, including a set of root specific monoterpene synthases that could well have agronomic importance. Ultimately understanding and breeding for specific terpene profiles will require a good understanding of the gene family that underlies it. We intend for this work to serve as a foundation for that.",,"['Purple Kush', 'Fig', 'genes', 'TPS', 'TPS genes', 'TPS gene', 'terpene', 'set', 'data set', 'gene']","[’s, ’s, α-pinene, β-, TPS6, TPS13, α-and, ’s, 2A, β-caryophyllene, 2B–2F, TPS33, TPS3, TPS30 [ 7, TPS5, α-pinene [ 7], α-and, TPS13 [ 7, α-and γ-terpinene, TPS1, grandis γ-humulene synthase, TPS-a, KSG_ARATH, TPS1, TPS5, TPS1, TPS2, TPS3, TPS33, TPS-a, TPS32, TPS7, TPS7, 225kB, TPS5, α-pinene synthase [ 7, ’, TPS5, TPS, UTRs, pre-flower, midflower, HISAT2 [ 24], TPS1, TPS5, TPS7, TPS14, γ-eudesmol, root-specific, TPS6, mid-flower, StringTie, 5’-, 3’-UTRs, TPS37, TPS4-like, TPS37, TPS4-like, 80,229, grandis γ-humulene synthase, AAC05728, n’t, TPS4, TPS9]","['TPS6', 'TPS13,', 'TPS9', 'TPS33', 'TPS3', 'TPS30', 'TPS5,', 'TPS13', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS1', 'TPS-b', 'TPS9', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-c', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-c', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-c', 'TPS1,', 'TPS18', 'TPS5,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS1,', 'TPS2,', 'TPS3', 'TPS33,', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPS8', 'TPS32,', 'TPS7', 'TPS7', 'TPS5,', 'TPS5,', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS1,', 'TPS5,', 'TPS18,', 'TPS7,', 'TPS14', 'TPS', 'TPS,', 'TPS6,', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-c', 'TPS', 'TPS37', 'TPS4-like', 'TPS37', 'TPS4-like', 'TPS', 'TPS4-like', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS4', 'TPS9', 'TPS4', 'TPS9']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']",[],terpene synthase
99,99,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6804824\eupmc_result.json,PMC6804824,"Results Analysis and identification of novel floral scents from new  Lilium hybrids and cultivars Previous studies of lily fragrances have compared faint-scented or strong-scented flowers from a few different lily types, including OT hybrids “Belladonna”, “Conca D’ Or”, “Robina”, and “Yelloween”; Oriental hybrids “Marco Polo”, “Siberia”, “Sorbonne”, “Sunshine Borland”, “Love story”, “Pink Champion”, “Santander”, and “Tarrango”; Longiflorum hybrid “White Heaven”; Asiatic hybrids “Tresor”, “White Wizard”, and “Red Wizard”; and LA hybrids “Music” and “Ceb Dazzle” 14,  17,  18. In recent years, Trumpet hybrids, LO hybrids, and other new cultivars with distinct fragrances have become available. In this study, 41 cultivars of 12 different types (Table  1) were analyzed for volatile emissions, including 38 accessions that have not been investigated previously. A total of 46 individual volatile compounds were identified, ranging from 8 volatile components for “Pearl Melanie” to 34 components for “Regale album” (Supplementary Table  1). Of those components, 16 were identified for the first time in lilies, while the remainder had been identified in previous studies. Most newly identified compounds were either sesquiterpenes or derived from fatty acids (Supplementary Table  1). Grouping of lily cultivars based on their fragrance Each cultivar has a particular floral scent profile. There are 16 scent compounds that are considered major scent components and whose relative amounts are >10% in some accessions, including 5 monoterpenoids ((E)- β-ocimene, myrcene,  α-pinene, eucalyptol, and linalool), 1 sesquiterpene (caryophyllene), 3 benzenoids (methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, and toluene), 1 phenylpropanoid-related (naphthalene), and 6 fatty acid-derived compounds (3-hexen-1-ol, methyl 2-methylbutyrate, methyl tiglate, methyl hexanoate, methyl octanoate, and 2-ethenyl-1,1-dimethyl-3-methylenecyclohexane) (Supplementary Table  1). Methyl benzoate was the only component detected in all accessions. (E)- β-ocimene, naphthalene, and methyl 2-methylbutyrate were detected in 39 accessions. Myrcene was also widely detected in 36 accessions (Supplementary Table  1). Major scent compounds were classified into five groups (herbal, fruity, cool, floral, and spicy) based on their odor descriptions (Supplementary Table  2), and the scents of cultivars were classified into six groups based on the ratios of total amounts of scent compounds for each group (Table  2). Group 1, Faint scented Group 1, which had hardly any scent, comprised 14 cultivars, mainly belonging to Asiatic hybrids and AT hybrids. Although some important scent compounds such as linalool and methyl benzoate were detected in some cultivars (e.g., “Tiny Diamond”, “Levi”, “Rossella’s Dream”, and “Pearl Loraine”), most humans are unable to detect any fragrance from these flowers by nose, although a few subjects in this study were able to detect a faint fragrance from flowers of “Pink Flavour”, “Lady Alice”, “Surrender”, “Fusion”, and “Bright Diamond”, which had relatively high levels of methyl benzoate and (E)- β-ocimene. Group 2, Cool Group 2 had a weak scent with a cooling nuance and contained four cultivars, “Robert Swanson”, “Beverly Dreams”, “Mister Right”, and “Mister Cass”. All of these cultivars, which are TO hybrids, emitted a high percentage of eucalyptol and exhibited notable morphological characteristics, with dark green leaves and crooked stems, especially in young plants. Group 3, Fruity Group 3, consisting of “White Heaven”, “Golden Stone”, “Brindisi”, and “Pavia”, had a light fresh fruit odor, and methyl benzoate was the major scent compound. “White Heaven” is a Longiflorum hybrid, and the other three cultivars are LA hybrids. Compared to the other cultivars, “Pavia” had a high level of linalool in addition to methyl benzoate, which produced a fresh fruit scent with a floral note. Group 4, Musky Group 4 comprised of seven cultivars, five Trumpet hybrids (“Pink Perfection”, “Orange Planet”, “Golden Splendor”, “Regale Album”, “Regale”), one TA hybrid (“Night Rider”), and one OT hybrid (“Manissa”). All of those cultivars had a musky odor derived from high levels of eucalyptol and methyl benzoate, which many people find distasteful, especially in a confined space. Group 5, Fruity-honey Nine cultivars belonging to the OT and LO hybrids had fruity-honey odors with relatively high levels of methyl benzoate. “Triumphator” and “White Triumphator” had relatively high levels of methyl 2-methylbutyrate in addition to high levels of methyl benzoate, contributing a fruity and sweet odor. “Bell Song”, “Pink Brilliant”, and “Pink Heaven” had methyl benzoate and linalool as the major scent compounds, in addition to (E)- β-ocimene and myrcene. Linalool has a typical pleasant floral odor, (E)- β-ocimene and myrcene (ocimene-type) have herbaceous odors, and the three cultivars thus smelled fruity and sweet with a floral note. “Conca D’ Or”, “Pink Mist”, “Garden Affair”, and “Palazzo” emitted methyl benzoate in addition to eucalyptol and ocimene-type as the major scent compounds, generating a fruity odor with a sweet resinous nuance. Group 6, Lily Group 6 contained “Miss Feya” (OT hybrid) and “Sorbonne” and “Brasilla” (Oriental hybrids), which had high levels of ocimene-type and methyl benzoate, producing a strong fragrance with a cananga odor. This scent is very popular and was designated “lily”, being so reminiscent of odors from cut Oriental hybrid lily flowers. Sequence alignment of  TPS genes from different lily cultivars Methyl benzoate might be important for the formation of lily fragrance since it was detected in all lily accessions. However, monoterpenes were predicted to be the main contributors to the difference in floral scent between scented and faint-scented lilies 23. As shown in Supplementary Table  1, monoterpenes occur frequently in lilies but in different relative amounts. They are also present in some cultivars that are normally considered faint scented. Monoterpenes are known to be synthesized mainly by the MEP pathway 36, and monoTPSs encode the enzymes catalyzing the final steps of the MEP pathway. We tested the hypothesis that it was possible to identify polymorphic sites in lily flower-expressed monoTPSs related to the production of monoterpenes. Thirty-two monoTPS cDNAs with high similarity were identified and sequenced from 66 lily accessions, and the sequences were submitted to NCBI (Table  3). The cDNAs were divided into three groups: LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-3 (Fig.  1). LTPS-1 included the largest number of cDNAs (23 cDNAs in total) characterized by an ORF of 1761 bp encoding a putative LTPS protein of 586 amino acids. LTPS-3 included 7 cDNAs, with 97.71% homology to the LTPS-1 group, characterized by an ORF of 1647 bp encoding a putative LTPS protein of 548 amino acids. There were only two cDNAs belonging to LTPS-2, with 98.59% and 94.44% homology to LTPS-1 and LTPS-3, respectively. The ORF of LTPS-2 is 1773 bp and encodes a putative LTPS protein of 590 amino acids. Table  3 shows the distribution of three types of terpene synthase transcripts, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-2, found in different lily cultivars examined in this study. LTPS-1 was found in 52 (78.8%) lily cultivars. LTPS-3 was cloned from 18 cultivars, accounting for 27.3%, and 6 (9.1%) cultivars contained LTPS-2. “Sorbonne” was the only cultivar from which three types of LTPS were cloned. “Julius” was the only cultivar from which both LTPS-1 and LTPS-2 were cloned. LTPS-1 and LTPS-3 were cloned from seven cultivars, “Easy Life”, “Abbeville Pride”, “Red Life”, “Reeleeze”, “Pink Perfection”, “Amarossi”, and “Forever”. Ten cultivars had only LTPS-3, and four cultivars (“Annemarie’s Dream” “Orange Planet” “Conca D’ Or” and “Bright Diamond”) had only LTPS-2. Nucleotide diversity of LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-3, and haplotypes Sequence alignment of the 32 monoTPS sequences from lily showed 2 InDel polymorphisms (230, 873) and 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to LTPS-1, 12 base pairs were inserted in LTPS-2 (230), and 114 base pairs were deleted in LTPS-3 (873). Of the 64 SNPs, 25 were synonymous mutations, while the other 39 altered the amino acid sequences (Supplementary Table  3). Fifty-five, 8, and 41 SNP sites were identified for LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-3, respectively, of which 33, 6, and 17 were nonsynonymous substitutions. Nucleotide diversity ( π) was determined for LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-3 ORFs using the SNPs identified in the lily accessions. Overall, nucleotide diversity was higher for LTPS-1 ( π = 0.010) than for LTPS-3 ( π = 0.006) and LTPS-2 ( π = 0.001). Hd was approximately 1.0 for the three LTPS groups (Table  4). Comparison of lily genomic DNA sequences and LTPS flower transcripts The cultivar “Sorbonne” was the only accession from which three types of LTPS were cloned, and it was chosen for DNA cloning to investigate the InDel relationships between LTPS-2 and LTPS-3 at the DNA level. A total length of 2661 bp genomic LTPS DNA was cloned from “Sorbonne” ( LsoTPS–gDNA, NCBI accession number MH618207) and aligned with the cDNAs of  LsoTPS-1 (MH203231),  LsoTPS-2 (MH203303), and  LsoTPS-3 (MH203275) by the DNAMAN software. Seven exons and six introns were found for the LTPS genomic DNA. As shown in Fig.  2, the additional 12 bases of  LsoTPS-2, which are not present in  LsoTPS-1 and  LsoTPS-3, are not actually due to an insertion in the DNA-coding sequence but rather arise from the use of an alternative 5′ splice site in the first intron. Furthermore, the 114 bases missing from  LsoTPS-3 compared to  LsoTPS-1 and  LsoTPS-2 are not due to the deletion of any DNA sequence but rather arise from the use of an alternative 3′ splice site in the third intron. This suggests that the explanation for the presence of the  LTPS-1,  LTPS-2, and  LTPS-3 transcripts might be variable splicing of transcripts from an  LTPS gene. Correlation of scent compounds emitted and  TPS gene nucleotide substitutions Fifty-one SNPs were identified among the cDNA sequences from the 23 cultivars from which floral scent components were identified. Gray relational analysis was used to evaluate the gray relational degree (GRD) between the major monoterpene volatile compounds emitted and the 51  TPS nucleotide substitutions 38,  39 using the DPS V12.01 software. The compound that had the highest correlation with all nucleotide substitution sites (GRD > 0.57) was myrcene (Fig.  3). The substitution site 230–241, which corresponds to the insertion of 12 bp, was highly correlated with all major monoterpene volatile compounds (GRD > 0.59), especially (E)- β-ocimene (GRD > 0.72) (Fig.  3). Characterization of LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-3 The translation of all  LTPS cDNAs into amino sequences generated 14, 7, and 2 amino sequences for LTPS-1, LTPS-3, and LTPS-2, respectively. The amino acid sequences from “Sorbonne” lily LsoTPS-1, LsoTPS-2, and LsoTPS-3 were used for characterization of the encoded proteins. All three sequences contained the highly conserved N-terminal arginine-rich RRX8W signature sequence motif and the C-terminal aspartate-rich DDXXD and NSE/DTE substrate-binding motifs 32, with a predicted mass of ca. 66.3 kDa and a pI of ca. 5.8 (Fig.  4). The N-terminal 20 amino acids upstream of the conserved RRX8W motif were predicted to code for a transit peptide for import into plastids using the SignalP 4.1 peptide prediction tool. Although one highly conserved RX8W motif was found in the LsoTPS-1 and LsoTPS-2 amino sequences, a similar sequence was absent from the predicted LsoTPS-3 amino sequence (Fig.  4) because of the deletion produced by alternative splicing, as discussed above. Functional characterization of LTPS-1, LTPS-2, and LTPS-3 To determine the functional activity of the three structurally distinct types of TPS proteins, five cDNAs were expressed separately in  Escherichia coli. BL21, three from the scented lily  Lilium cv. “Sorbonne” ( LsoTPS-1,  LsoTPS-2, and  LsoTPS-3) and two from the faint-scented  Lilium cv. “Red life” ( LrlTPS-1, MH203231, and  LrlTPS-3, MH203298). The recombinant plasmid with the full-length  LsoTPS-1,  LsoTPS-2, and  LsoTPS-3 cDNA sequences resulted in successful expression of soluble Lso TPS-1, Lso TPS-2, and Lso TPS-3 proteins of approximately 67, 68, and 62 kDa, respectively. The recombinant plasmid with the full-length  LrlTPS-1 and  LrlTPS-3 cDNAs resulted in successful expression of soluble proteins of approximately 67 and 62 kDa, respectively. Each of the purified proteins was tested for the ability to convert GPP into monoterpenes, and the products generated were analyzed by gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The results showed that all five proteins were able to convert GPP into (E)- β-ocimene, α-pinene, and limonene, which were identified by retention time at 5.79, 5.56, and 5.47 min, respectively (Fig.  5 shows the results for  LrlTPS-3 as an example). As shown in Fig.  5, even if the transformed  E. coli cells were cultivated in buffer without isopropyl-β- d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and substrate (GPP), a small amount of eucalyptol was produced, as identified by retention time at 5.58 min.","Lily is a well-known ornamental plant with a diversity of fragrant types. Basic information on lily floral scent compounds has been obtained for only a few accessions, and little is known about Lilium aroma types, the terpene synthase genes that may play roles in the production of key volatiles, or the range of monoterpenes that these genes produce. In this study, 41 cultivars were analyzed for volatile emissions, and a total of 46 individual volatile compounds were identified, 16 for the first time in lilies. Lily accessions were classified into six groups according to the composition of major scent components: faint-scented, cool, fruity, musky, fruity-honey, and lily. Monoterpenes were one of the main groups of volatiles identified, and attention was focused on terpene synthase (TPS) genes, which encode enzymes that catalyze the last steps in monoterpene synthesis. Thirty-two candidate monoterpene synthase cDNAs were obtained from 66 lily cultivars, and 64 SNPs were identified. Two InDels were also shown to result from variable splicing, and sequence analysis suggested that different transcripts arose from the same gene. All identified nucleotide substitution sites were highly correlated with the amounts of myrcene emitted, and InDel site 230 was highly correlated with the emission of all major monoterpenoid components, especially (E)-β-ocimene. Heterologous expression of five cDNAs cloned from faint-scented and strong-scented lilies showed that their corresponding enzymes could convert geranyl diphosphate to (E)-β-ocimene, α-pinene, and limonene. The findings from this study provide a major resource for the assessment of lily scent volatiles and will be helpful in breeding of improved volatile components.","['secondary metabolism', 'Transcriptomics']","['Supplementary Table', 'Marco Polo', 'Sunshine Borland', 'Ceb Dazzle', 'methyl benzoate', 'cultivars', 'Table', 'methyl', 'White Wizard', 'scent compounds']","[faint-scented, strong-scented, OT hybrids, “Conca D’, ”, “Robina”, “, ”, Polo”, “Siberia, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “Pink, ”, “, ”, “Tarrango”, ”, ”, “, ”, “Red, ”, LA hybrids, ”, “Ceb, ”, LO hybrids, “, ”, “Regale, (E)-, (E)-, “, ”, “Levi”, “Rossella, ’s, ”, “Pearl Loraine”, “, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “Bright Diamond”, (E)-, “, “Beverly, ”, “Mister Right”, “Mister Cass”, “, ”, “, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, “, ”, Musky Group 4, ”, “Orange, ”, “, ”, “Regale, “Regale”, “, ”, OT hybrid, “Manissa”, Fruity-honey, OT, LO hybrids, fruity-honey, “Triumphator”, “White, ”, “Pink, Brilliant”, “Pink, ”, (E)-, (E)-, “Conca D’, ”, “Pink, ”, “, “Palazzo”, ocimene-type, “Miss Feya”, OT hybrid, “, ”, “Brasilla”, ocimene-type, cananga, “lily”, faint-scented lilies, monoTPSs, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-3 (Fig.  1, LTPS-1, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-2 is 1773 , LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, “, ”, ”, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-3, “Easy, ”, “, ”, “Red, ”, “Reeleeze”, “Pink, ”, “Amarossi”, “Forever”, “, ’s, ” “, ”, “Bright Diamond”, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-2 (230), SNP, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, π, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, π , π , LTPS-2 (, π , ”, LTPS-2, LTPS-3, “, ”, LsoTPS–, NCBI, MH203231, MH203275, 3′, GRD , 230–241, GRD , (E)- β-ocimene, GRD , LTPS-1, LTPS-2, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, “, ”, LsoTPS-2, LsoTPS-3, N-terminal arginine-rich, RX8W, LsoTPS-1, LsoTPS-2 amino, LsoTPS-3 amino, LTPS-1, LTPS-2, “, ”, LsoTPS-1, ”, LrlTPS-1, MH203231, Lso TPS-3, (E)-, α-pinene, isopropyl-β- d-thiogalactoside]","['TPS', 'monoTPSs', 'monoTPSs', 'monoTPS', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS-3,', 'LTPS-2', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-2.', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS-2', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-3,', 'LTPS-2.', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3,', 'monoTPS', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3,', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-1', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS-2', 'LTPS', 'LTPS', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-2', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS', 'LsoTPS–gDNA,', 'LsoTPS-1', 'LsoTPS-2', 'LsoTPS-3', 'LTPS', 'LsoTPS-2,', 'LsoTPS-1', 'LsoTPS-3,', 'LsoTPS-3', 'LsoTPS-1', 'LsoTPS-2', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3', 'LTPS', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-3,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LsoTPS-1,', 'LsoTPS-2,', 'LsoTPS-3', 'LsoTPS-1', 'LsoTPS-2', 'LsoTPS-3', 'LTPS-1,', 'LTPS-2,', 'LTPS-3', 'TPS', 'LsoTPS-1,', 'LsoTPS-2,', 'LsoTPS-3)', 'LrlTPS-1,', 'LrlTPS-3,', 'LsoTPS-1,', 'LsoTPS-2,', 'LsoTPS-3', 'TPS-1,', 'TPS-2,', 'TPS-3', 'LrlTPS-1', 'LrlTPS-3', 'LrlTPS-3']",[],[],terpene synthase
100,100,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6902048\eupmc_result.json,PMC6902048,"Results Four  OfUGTs Were Selected as Candidate  UGTs for Linalool and its Oxides Four candidate  OfUGT genes (Cluster 9575.22195.0, Cluster 9575.63104, Cluster 9575.37686, and Cluster 9575.35647) were selected for functional characterization based on their high similarity (> 40%) in amino acid sequence to the known terpenoid  UGTs ( Song et al., 2018). The ORF sequences were 1,458 bp, 1,449 bp, 1,422 bp, and 1,434 bp, respectively, and were designated as  UGT85A82,  UGT85A83, UGT85AF3, and  UGT85A84 (GenBank accession numbers: MG767214, MG767215, MG767216, and MG767217), respectively. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the known terpenoid UGT proteins ( Figure 1;  Table S4). A close relationship was observed between UGT85A82 and UGT85A23 from  Catharanthus roseus ( Nagatoshi et al., 2011), with the latter involved in iridoid glycosylation. UGT85A83 and UGT85A84 showed high amino acid identity to the UGT proteins from  A. thaliana and  Rubus suavissimus, including UGT85A1, UGT85A2, UGT85A5, UGT85A7, and UGT85A57, whose function was mainly to glycosylate monoterpenes and diterpenoid ( Song et al., 2018). UGT85AF3 belonged to UGT85AF subfamily. Only 7 genes were clustered into this subfamily to date ( Table S4). UGT85AF3 showed significantly high bootstrap value with UGT85AF5, UGT85AF6, and UGT85AF7 ( Figure 1). Massive Carbohydrate Biosynthesis Might Facilitate the Glycosylation of Aroma Compounds Since the Full Blossoming Stage According to Illumina Hiseq mRNA Sequencing Since the glycosylated linalool and its derivatives showed the maximum increase from the full blossoming stage ( Zeng et al., 2016), further DEG analysis was conducted based on the KEGG enrichment ( Figure S4). In terms of the DEG number, the most substantial differences between the initial and full blossoming stages were found in the categories of ‘hormone signal transduction’, ‘carbohydrate metabolism’, and ‘phenylpropanoid biosynthesis’ ( Figure S4A). Notably, 37 unigenes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, 26 unigenes involved in glycolysis, 25 unigenes involved in galactose metabolism, and 14 unigenes involved in fructose and mannose metabolism were up-regulated from the initial to full blossoming stage ( Figure S4A). In contrast, the unigenes associated with starch, sucrose, and galactose metabolism were significantly down-regulated from the full to late blossoming stage ( Figure S4B). We therefore hypothesized that the increase in the expressions of genes involved in the primary metabolism facilitated the glycosylation of aroma compounds since the full blossoming stage. UGT85A84 Expression Was Positively Correlated With the Glycosylation of Linalool and Its Oxides Transcriptome sequencing was applied to measure the expressions of genes responsible for linalool and its oxide glycosylation in the four blossoming stages ( Figure 2). Linalool and its oxides were synthesized through the MEP pathway and the expressions of a series of relevant genes including  DXS,  DXR,  CMK,  MCT,  MECPS,  HDS,  IDS,  IDI, and  GPPS, and terpene synthase genes ( TPSs) were investigated by transcriptome sequencing ( Figure 2A). The results showed that the expressions of all the upstream genes were basically increased from bud to initial or full blossoming stage and decreased in the late blossoming stage, directly leading to the massive biosynthesis of linalool and its oxides at the full blossoming stage ( Figure 2B,  Figure S8A). Unexpectedly, qRT-PCR results demonstrated that the expressions of all four candidate  OfUGTs presented a continuously decreasing trend through the blossoming stages ( Figure 3), which was opposite to the increasing trend of terpenoid glycosides ( Zeng et al., 2016). Taken together, despite the low expression of candidate  OfUGTs, the abundant aglycone and sugar donor supplies facilitated the conversion from volatiles to glycosides following the full blossoming stage ( Figure S8A). UGT85A82 expression showed obvious circadian rhythm during the full blossoming stage ( Figure 4). The expressions of four  OfUGTs simultaneously increased during the day and decreased during the night ( Figure 4). Further correlation analysis between their transcript levels and three forms of linalool and its oxides were conducted to screen the candidate terpenoid  OfUGTs. Only  UGT85A84 expression showed significantly positive correlation with the accumulation of glycosides ( Table 1). MEP pathway genes also exhibited the circadian expression patterns, which was in line with continuous increase of linalool and its oxide glycosides from 06:00–00:00 ( Zheng et al., 2017). Further correlation analysis also presented a positive association between MEP pathway gene expressions and glycoside accumulation ( Table S5). Over-Expression of  UGT85A84 Significantly Increased Linalool Oxide Glycoside  inPlanta The experiments of transient over-expression coupled with the substrate injection in  N. benthamiana leaves were conducted to investigate the glycosides produced by candidate  OfUGTs in planta. The leaves were infiltrated with Super1300-OfUGT or a control construct in the presence of linalool and its oxides. The glycosides were then extracted and purified after incubation. Subsequently, GC-MS analysis calculated the glycoside contents by quantifying the corresponding aglycones released from the glycosides. The results showed that considerable glycosides of linalool and its oxides were accumulated in the leaves with substrate injection (CK), while no glycoside was detected from wild-type tobacco leaves, indicating that the injection effectively promoted the absorption and conversion of the substrates by the leaves. It was worth noting that remarkable increase in glycoside of linalool oxide was only observed in  UGT85A84-infiltrated plants, suggesting that UGT85A84 was capable of catalyzing linalool oxides. All the four OfUGTs showed low activities towards linalool since no significant increase in linalool glycoside was observed in the transgenic plants ( Figure 5). This result was similar to the phenomenon in  O. fragrans flowers. Linalool glycoside was approximately 3 mg/g FW, whereas linalool oxide glycoside was more than 40 mg/g FW at the late blossoming stage ( Zeng et al., 2016), suggesting that linalool oxide was more likely to be glycosylated. Recombinant UGT85A84 Protein Glycosylated Linalool and Its Oxides Using UDP-Glc  in vitro Based on the transcript expression analysis and functional identification  in planta,  UGT85A84 was selected as the key  OfUGT and was subjected to further analysis. The recombinant protein of UGT85A84 was expressed in  E. coli and the purified protein was verified by SDS-PAGE ( Figure S6). Target analysis of LC-MS was an effective method for determining the specific product ( Takafumi et al., 2018). Thus, the biochemical characteristics of UGT85A84 were investigated with different sugar donors (UDP-Glc, UDP-Xyl, UDP-Rha) and aglycones (linalool, linalool oxides), respectively ( Figure S7). After 1 h or 16 h incubation, only two glycosylated products, with retention time of 6.50 min and 5.95 min, were formed in the UDP-Glc reaction mixtures ( Figure 6;  Figure S8C). No products were detected in the UDP-Xyl and UDP-Rha reactions, demonstrating that UGT85A84 had no catalytic activity towards these two sugar donors. Further full scan and MS/MS mass spectral data were used to identify and quantify the reaction products. Linalool-glycoside was shown to be the corresponding formate adduct based on the  m/z 361 [M + formate] -1 in full scan mode and the expected pseudo-molecular ion at  m/z 315 in MS 2 ( Figure 6) in the UDP-Glc + linalool reactions. Linalool oxide-glycoside was the corresponding formate adduct based on the  m/z 377 [M + formate] -1 in full scan mode and the expected pseudo-molecular ion at  m/z 331 in MS 2 ( Figure 6) in the UDP-Glc + linalool oxide reactions.  Km and  kcat values were obtained for the linalool and linalool oxide with a constant UDP-Glc concentration (0.5 mM) and for the UDP-Glc with a constant linalool and linalool oxide concentration (0.5 mM) from a hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten saturation curve, respectively ( Figure 7). The apparent  Km for linalool and linalool oxide were 136 µM and 202 µM ( Table 2), respectively, indicating that UGT85A84 had higher catalytic efficiency with linalool than with linalool oxide  in vitro. This result contrasts the catalytic performance in  N. benthamiana leaves, which might be explained by the fact that linalool is a low molecular weight compound that is highly volatile and thus might be easily released instead of being glycosylated in  N. benthamiana leaves. Taken together, the result demonstrated that UGT85A84 was capable of glycosylating linalool and linalool oxide using UDP-Glc as a specific sugar donor.","The monoterpenes linalool and its oxides are the key aroma-active compounds in  Osmanthus fragrans  Lour. flowers. The glycosides of these monoterpenes accumulate throughout flowering, leading to considerable storage of potential aroma constituents that account for the majority of non-volatile aroma compounds. However, the UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) responsible for the glycosylation of linalool and its oxides has not been clarified. Four candidate  OfUGTs  ( UGT85A82 ,  UGT85A83 ,  UGT85AF3 , and  UGT85A84 ) with high homology to the known terpenoid UGTs were screened by transcriptome sequencing. Over-expression of the candidate  OfUGTs  in tobacco showed that UGT85A84 glycosylated linalool oxides  in planta . Since the transcript levels of  UGT85A84  were positively correlated with glycoside accumulation, the recombinant UGT85A84 protein was subjected to reactions with aglycones and sugar donors. Two formate adducts were exclusively detected in UDP-Glc with linalool and linalool oxide reactions by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), indicating that UDP-Glc was the specific sugar donor. The kinetic parameters demonstrated that UGT85A84 glycosylated both linalool and lianlool oxides  in vitro . Further analysis demonstrated that the transcription levels of MEP pathway genes might play an important role in mediating terpenoid glycosylation. Our findings unraveled the mechanism underlying the glycosylation of essential aroma compounds in flowers. This study will facilitate the application of potential aroma contributors in future industries.","['Glycosylation', 'Linalool', 'Aroma', 'Osmanthus fragrans Lour.', 'Udp-glycosyltransferase', 'Linalool Oxide']","['Figure', 'Linalool Oxide', 'Linalool', 'Blossoming Stage', 'Full Blossoming', 'Cluster', 'Blossoming', 'oxide', 'Full', 'Oxides']","[9575.63104, 9575.35647, UGT85AF3, MG767214, MG767215, MG767216, MG767217, UGT, UGT85A82, UGT85A23, Nagatoshi, UGT85A83, UGT85A84, UGT, UGT85A1, UGT85A2, UGT85A5, UGT85A7, UGT85A57, UGT85AF3, UGT85AF5, UGT85AF6, UGT85AF7, ‘hormone, ’, ‘carbohydrate, ’, ‘, ’, Its Oxides, terpene synthase, S8A, S8A, UGT85A82, glycosides ( Table 1, S5, Super1300-OfUGT, CK, UGT85A84, OfUGTs, UGT85A84 Protein, Its Oxides, UGT85A84, UGT85A84, UDP-Rha, S8C, UDP-Rha, UGT85A84, Linalool-glycoside, M + formate], M + formate], UDP-Glc, µM ( Table 2, UGT85A84, UGT85A84]",['TPSs)'],[],[],terpene synthase
101,101,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6941427\eupmc_result.json,PMC6941427,"Results Analysis of Water, Total Polyphenol, Total Flavonoid, Catechin, Lignin, Volatile Compound, Jasmonic Acid, and Methyl Jasmonate Contents of Fresh Leaves, Indoor-Withered Leaves, and Solar-Withered Leaves The phenotypes of the FL, IW, and SW were recorded ( Figure 1). The FL were glossy, straight, and green, with a water content of 75%. In contrast, the IW were slightly curled and deformed, with a water content of 68%. The SW were obviously curled and dull green. The appearance of the SW may have been due to their relatively low water content (65%). A sensory evaluation revealed that the three leaf samples differed regarding taste and aroma. Specifically, the FL and IW were bitter and astringent, with a strong grassy aroma, whereas the SW were weakly astringent, with a mellow taste, slightly grassy flavor, and faint floral and fruity aromas. To explore the changes in the characteristic tea compounds in the FL, IW, and SW, we determined the contents of total polyphenols, total flavonoids, catechins, lignin, and volatiles in these samples. The total polyphenol contents were 235.47, 203.47, and 158.45 mg/g in the FL, IW, and SW, respectively ( Figure 2). The total flavonoid content in the SW was significantly lower than that in the FL and IW. Similarly, the total flavonoid content was significantly lower in the SW (132.89 mg/g) than in the FL (197.20 mg/g) and IW (171.83 mg/g). Moreover, the abundance of total catechins was significantly lower in the SW than in the FL and IW. An analysis of individual catechins identified EGCG as the most abundant catechin in all three leaf samples. The EGCG content was significantly higher in the FL (61.37 mg/g) and IW (57.55 mg/g) than in the SW (50.35 mg/g). Similarly, EGC, CG, GCG, and ECG were significantly more abundant in the FL and IW than in the SW. However, there were no significant differences in the C, GC, and EC contents between the FL and SW, the FL and IW, and the IW and SW. Additionally, the lignin content was significantly higher in the SW (542.10 mg/g) than in the FL (410.18 mg/g) and IW (449.65 mg/g). Thus, the total flavonoid and total catechin contents as well as the abundance of five individual catechins, especially the galloylated catechins (CG, GCG, ECG, and EGCG), were significantly lower in the SW than in the FL and IW, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for the lignin content. The contents of the top 20 volatiles in the FL, IW, and SW were detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry ( Table 1). The fatty acid-derived volatile contents were significantly affected by withering. Analyses indicated that ( Z)-3-hexenal and ( E)-2-hexenal were the most abundant volatile components in the FL. After withering, the ( Z)-3-hexenal and ( E)-2-hexenal contents were significantly lower in the IW and SW than in the FL. A further analysis revealed that the ( Z)-3-hexenal content of the SW (12.70%) was significantly lower than that of the IW (15.41%). Additionally, the ( E)-2-hexenal content of the SW (12.20%) was significantly lower than that of the IW (16.92%). The abundance of terpenoid volatiles, including β-ocimene, limonene, γ-terpinene, α-farnesene, and β-myrcene, was significantly greater in the IW and SW than in the FL. A comparison of the terpenoid volatile contents in the IW and SW indicated that all five terpenoid volatiles were present at significantly higher levels in the SW than in the IW. Similarly, glycosidically bound volatiles (benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, and methyl salicylate) and a carotenoid-derived volatile (β-ionone) were more abundant in the IW and SW than in the FL. Therefore, the combined actions of various volatile compounds may be responsible for the formation of aromas during withering. Among these compounds, the ( Z)-3-hexenal, ( E)-2-hexenal, and terpenoid volatiles, which represent a large proportion of the volatiles in oolong tea, may be the most affected by the withering process, especially solar-withering, which can trigger a significant increase in the content of these terpenoid volatiles and a decrease in the abundance of hexenal volatiles. Phytohormones, especially JA and MeJA, function as signaling molecules that promote the synthesis of related volatiles ( Dudareva et al., 2013;  Zeng et al., 2017). To clarify the accumulation of JA and MeJA during the withering process, we determined the JA and MeJA contents in fresh and withered leaves. The JA contents in the FL, IW, and SW were 0.92, 1.81, and 3.14 μg/g, respectively. The JA content was significantly higher in the SW (3.14 μg/g) than in the FL (0.92 μg/g) and IW (1.81 μg/g). Similarly, the MeJA content was also significantly higher in the SW (0.45 μg/g) than in the FL (0.08 μg/g) and IW (0.21 μg/g). The differences in the JA and MeJA contents among the three leaf samples may be related to the accumulation of volatiles. Sequencing and Assembly of Transcriptome Data To investigate the regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs during the withering of oolong tea leaves, three biological replicates of the FL, IW, and SW underwent a transcriptome sequencing analysis with the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform. After removing rRNA, low-quality reads, adapter sequences, and contaminating reads, an average of 12.66 Gb of clean data were obtained per sample ( Supplementary Table S2). All clean reads were aligned to the tea reference genome. A total of 82,077 transcripts were detected, including 32,036 lncRNAs and 50,041 mRNAs. An analysis of the length distribution and exon number for the lncRNAs and mRNAs indicated that most of the lncRNAs (72.36%) were shorter than 1,000 bp and only 3.94% were longer than 3,000 bp. In contrast, 40.46% of the mRNAs were 0–1,000 bp and 10.07% of the mRNAs exceeded 3,000 bp. Moreover, 68.22% of the lncRNAs contained only one exon, whereas 85.98% of the mRNAs comprised more than two exons. These observations are consistent with the findings of studies on maize ( Li et al., 2014), kiwifruit ( Tang et al., 2016), and longan ( Chen et al., 2018a), which confirmed that lncRNAs contain fewer exons than the annotated mRNAs and that most plant lncRNAs contain one exon. The transcriptome dataset revealed that 28,677 lncRNAs were expressed. Additionally, 26,740 expressed lncRNAs were identified in the FL, which was more than the 26,508 expressed lncRNAs in the IW and the 26,479 expressed lncRNAs in the SW. Further analyses of lncRNA expression indicated that the expression levels of most of the lncRNAs in the FL, IW, and SW were low (FPKM ≤ 1), with no more than 5% of the total number of lncRNAs detected as highly expressed (FPKM ≥ 10) ( Supplementary Figure S1). Identification of Differentially Expressed Long Non-Coding RNAs and Their Target Genes During the Tea-Withering Process To identify the DE-lncRNAs during the tea-withering process, we analyzed the following comparisons: FL vs. IW, FL vs. SW, and IW vs. SW. The expression profiles based on the normalized FPKM values revealed 12,487 DE-lncRNAs in the FL, IW, and SW. Additionally 9,847 DE-lncRNAs were identified in the FL vs. IW comparison, of which 4,243 were up-regulated and 5,604 were down-regulated; 6,506 DE-lncRNAs were identified in the FL vs. SW comparison, of which 2,659 were up-regulated and 3,847 were down-regulated; and 4,964 DE-lncRNAs were identified in the IW vs. SW comparison, of which 2,443 were up-regulated and 2,521 were down-regulated. The lncRNAs mediate the expression of some protein-coding genes through a  cis- or  trans-regulatory mechanism. Thus, the genes targeted by the DE-lncRNAs were predicted, which resulted in the identification of putative target genes for 2,892 DE-lncRNAs, including 2,180  cis-regulated and 1,096  trans-regulated target genes. Moreover, 1,694 DE-lncRNAs targeted only one protein-coding gene, whereas 14 DE-lncRNAs targeted more than six genes. A further analysis of the target genes revealed that 1,904 were regulated by only one DE-lncRNA, whereas 15 were regulated by more than six DE-lncRNAs. Functional Annotation of the Genes Targeted by Differentially Expressed Long Non-Coding RNAs Based on Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Databases The target genes were functionally characterized by aligning them to the sequences in the GO database with the BLAST algorithm. The 3,543 DE target genes in the FL vs. IW comparison were grouped into the three major GO categories ( Supplementary Figure S2), namely, biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. The top three biological process subgroups were cellular process, metabolic process, and biological regulation. In the cellular component category, most of the DE target genes were annotated with the membrane, membrane part, and cell GO terms. Regarding the DE target genes in the molecular function category, most were classified into the following three subgroups: binding, catalytic activity, and transporter activity. In the FL vs. SW comparison, 2,085 target genes were grouped into the three main GO categories ( Supplementary Figure S2). The top three biological process subgroups (cellular process, metabolic process, and biological regulation) for the FL vs. SW comparison were consistent with the results for the FL vs. IW comparison. Regarding the IW vs. SW comparison, only 890 target genes were annotated with the cellular process, metabolic process, and biological regulation GO terms ( Supplementary Figure S2). In the biological process category, the three most enriched subgroups were cellular process, metabolic process, and response to stimulus. The top three enriched subgroups in the remaining two categories were consistent with the enrichment results for the FL vs. IW and FL vs. SW comparisons. We then identified the enriched KEGG pathways among the target genes of the DE-lncRNAs. In the FL vs. IW comparison, 3,543 DE target genes were enriched in 129 pathways ( Figure 3A). The top 20 enriched pathways were as follows: plant–pathogen interaction; sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis; alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism; amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism; brassinosteroid biosynthesis; plant hormone signal transduction; pentose phosphate pathway; monoterpenoid biosynthesis; terpenoid backbone biosynthesis; stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis; glucosinolate biosynthesis; photosynthesis; DNA replication; flavonoid biosynthesis; diterpenoid biosynthesis; metabolic pathways; glycosphingolipid biosynthesis; fructose and mannose metabolism; folate biosynthesis; and lysine biosynthesis. In the FL  vs. IW and FL  vs. SW comparisons, seven of the top 20 enriched KEGG pathways were consistent ( Figure 3B). These seven pathways were plant–pathogen interaction; plant hormone signal transduction; stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis; flavonoid biosynthesis; sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis; glucosinolate biosynthesis; and monoterpenoid biosynthesis. Considering the effects of flavonoids and terpenoids on tea taste and aroma, respectively, we focused on the flavonoid and terpenoid metabolic pathways. The plant hormone signal transduction pathway is also involved, with linoleic acid metabolism related to the biosynthesis of JA and MeJA. Regarding plant hormone signal transduction, JA and MeJA induce the formation of terpenoid volatiles. An analysis of the transcriptome differences between the IW and SW ( Figure 3C) indicated that 13 of the top 20 enriched KEGG pathways were consistent between the FL vs. IW and FL vs. SW comparisons. The terpenoid metabolic pathways, including sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, and diterpenoid biosynthesis, were identified as crucial metabolic pathways. Additionally, the pathways related to flavonoid metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction also warrant further study. Analysis of the Differentially Expressed Genes and Differentially Expressed Long Non-Coding RNAs Involved in the Flavonoid Metabolic Pathway During Tea Withering The KEGG analysis identified the flavonoid metabolic pathway as one of the main enriched pathways. A total of 63 DEGs were assigned to flavonoid metabolic pathways. The following 11 gene families involved in flavonoid metabolic pathways were differentially expressed in the FL vs. IW, FL vs. SW, and IW vs. SW comparisons:  PAL ( phenylalanine ammonia-lyase),  C4H ( cinnamate 4-hydroxylase),  4CL ( 4-coumarate CoA ligase),  CHS ( chalcone synthase),  CHI ( chalcone isomerase),  F3H ( flavanone 3-hydroxylase),  F3′H ( flavonoid 3′ -hydroxylase),  FLS ( flavonol synthase),  DFR ( dihydroflavonol 4-reductase),  ANS ( anthocyanidin synthase), and  ANR ( anthocyanidin reductase) ( Supplementary Table S3). Moreover, lignin and flavonoids are parallel secondary metabolites, and flavonoid biosynthesis and lignin biosynthesis may compete for the same substrates ( Wang et al., 2017b). Thus, the following three lignin metabolism-related gene families were also identified:  CCR ( cinnamoyl-CoA reductase),  CAD ( cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase), and  HCT ( hydroxycinnamoyltransferase). A potential flavonoid metabolic pathway was constructed based on these identified DEGs ( Figure 4). The expression trends of 124 DEGs involved in the flavonoid and lignin metabolic pathways were compared based on the normalized FPKM values ( Figure 4). All of the DEGs in six gene families ( C4H,  4CL,  F3H,  F3′H,  FLS, and  HCT) were more highly expressed in the FL and IW than in the SW. Additionally, most of the DEGs in six other gene families ( PAL,  CHS,  CHI,  ANS,  ANR, and  DFR) were also more highly expressed in the FL and IW than in the SW. Moreover, nine DEGs belonging to the  CCR family were most highly expressed in the SW, as were more than half of the DEGs in the  CAD family. Furthermore, 83 DEGs in the flavonoid metabolic pathway were more highly expressed in the IW than in the SW. These results implied that the flavonoid metabolism in the SW may have been in flux more weakly than that in the IW. Therefore, solar-withering may inhibit the accumulation of flavonoids in the withered leaves. To decipher the regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs in flavonoid metabolism and lignin metabolism, the related DE-lncRNAs and their target genes were analyzed. A total of 31 DE-lncRNAs and eight DE target genes involved in the flavonoid and lignin metabolic pathways were identified in the FL, IW, and SW transcriptome dataset. The target genes included  4CL,  CHI,  F3H,  F3’H,  FLS,  CCR,  CAD, and  HCT. Additionally, the lncRNAs did not have a one-to-one regulatory relationship with the target genes. Specifically, 43 pairs of regulatory relationships (a lncRNA regulating an mRNA) were identified for these DE-lncRNAs and their target genes ( Supplementary Figure S3). A correlation analysis indicated that 39 lncRNAs were positively correlated with target genes, whereas only four lncRNAs were negatively correlated with target genes ( Supplementary Table S4). Moreover, the  HCT and  CAD genes were regulated by the most lncRNAs, with both gene families regulated by 10 lncRNAs. This was in contrast to  4CL,  CHI,  F3H, and  F3’H, which were regulated by only one lncRNA. To further investigate the expression patterns of lncRNAs related to flavonoid and lignin metabolism, the expression patterns of 31 DE-lncRNAs were analyzed in the FL, IW, and SW based on the normalized FPKM values ( Supplementary Figure S4). Similar lncRNA expression levels were detected for the FL and IW. Among the regulatory relationships between the lncRNAs and their target genes, 39 were positive regulatory relationships, whereas four were negative regulatory relationships. Moreover, we determined that some target genes were regulated by multiple lncRNAs and some lncRNAs simultaneously regulated multiple target genes. Thus, the lncRNAs may help regulate flavonoid contents by affecting the expression level of genes related to flavonoid metabolism  via complex regulatory mechanisms. To confirm the expression of the lncRNAs and their target genes in the transcriptome dataset, the expression patterns of 16 structural genes and 10 related lncRNAs involved in flavonoid metabolism in the FL, IW, and SW were analyzed by qRT-PCR ( Figure 5). The correlation in the expression of the lncRNAs and their target genes was also analyzed ( Supplementary Table S5). In the scaffolds, the structures of all important  cis-regulated genes and their lncRNAs involved in flavonoid metabolism were plotted ( Supplementary Figure S5). The following 10 lncRNAs were analyzed: LTCONS_00054003 (targeting  4CL), LTCONS_00060939 (targeting  CHI), LTCONS_00056216 (targeting  F3H), LTCONS_00044497 (targeting  F3’H), LTCONS_00031811 (targeting  FLS), LTCONS_00001863 (targeting  CCR), LTCONS_00000233 (targeting  CAD), LTCONS_00090121 (targeting  CAD), LTCONS_00030131 (targeting  HCT), and LTCONS_00101116 (targeting  HCT). The expression patterns of the detected lncRNAs and their target genes were consistent with the transcriptome dataset, implying that lncRNAs help regulate flavonoid metabolism by altering the expression levels of related genes. These expression-level changes may be an important factor mediating the obvious differences in the flavonoid metabolite contents between the IW and SW. Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes and Differentially Expressed Long Non-Coding RNAs Involved in the Terpenoid Metabolic Pathway as Well as the Jasmonic Acid/Methyl Jasmonate Biosynthesis and Signal Transduction Pathway During Tea Withering To characterize the expression of DEGs involved in the terpenoid metabolic pathway in the FL, IW, and SW, we examined the 59 DEGs associated with this pathway ( Supplementary Table S6). Unlike the  DXR ( 1- deoxy- d- xylulose 5- phosphate reductoisomerase),  MCT ( 2- C- methyl- d- erythritol 4- phosphate cytidylyltransferase),  CMK ( 4- diphosphocytidyl- 2- C- methyl- d- erythritol kinase),  GPPS ( geranyl diphosphate synthase),  PMK ( phosphomevalonate kinase),  MDC ( mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase), and  FPS ( farnesyl diphosphate synthase) gene families, the following 11 gene families comprised more than two DEGs:  DXS ( 1- deoxy- d- xylulose- 5- phosphate synthase),  MDS ( 2- C- methyl- d- erythritol 2,4- cyclodiphosphate synthase),  HDS ( 4- hydroxy- 3- methylbut- 2- enyl- diphosphate synthase),  HDR ( 4- hydroxy- 3- methylbut- 2- enyl- diphosphate reductase),  IDI ( isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase),  GGPPS ( geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase),  AACT ( acetyl- CoA C- acetyltransferase),  HMGS ( hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA synthase),  HMGR ( hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA reductase),  MVK ( mevalonate kinase), and  TPS ( terpene synthase). An analysis of the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway uncovered 49 DEGs that were assigned to the following eight gene families:  LOX ( lipoxygenase),  AOS ( allene oxide synthase),  AOC ( allene oxide cyclase),  OPR ( oxophytodienoic acid reductase),  ACX ( acyl- CoA oxidase),  MFP2 ( enoyl- CoA hydratase/ 3- hydroxyacyl- CoA dehydrogenase),  JMT ( jasmonate O-methyltransferase), and  JAR ( jasmonic acid- amino synthetase) ( Supplementary Table S7). With the exception of the  JMT family, these gene families included more than two DEGs, with the  ACX family having the most DEGs. Moreover, changes in the hexenal content are related to the hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) pathway. This pathway along with the AOS pathway function downstream of the LOX pathway. Thus, we also analyzed three genes in the HPL pathway, namely,  HPL ( fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase),  ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase), and  AAT (alcohol acetyltransferase). A possible terpenoid metabolic pathway was constructed based on these identified DEGs ( Figure 6). Comparisons of the transcript levels (FPKM values) of these DEGs revealed that 17 DEGs were more highly expressed in the IW and SW than in the FL. Moreover, the  MDS genes exhibited complex expression trends. On the basis of the normalized FPKM values, we also compared the expression trends of the 49 DEGs involved in the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway between the fresh and withered leaves ( Figure 6). Most of the DEGs in these gene families were more highly expressed in the SW than in the IW. Specifically, all of the DEGs corresponding to  LOX,  AOS,  AOC,  OPR,  MFP2,  JMT, and  JAR were most highly expressed in the SW. Additionally, the expression levels of 17 DEGs corresponding to  ACX were also higher in the SW than in the IW. These results suggested that the high transcription levels for these six JA/MeJA biosynthesis-related genes in the SW may influence JA and MeJA accumulation. Moreover,  HPL,  ADH, and  AAT were also most highly expressed in the SW, which may be related to hexenal content changes. The high expression levels of most of the DEGs corresponding to the 17 gene families involved in the terpenoid metabolic pathway may be positively correlated with the terpenoid contents. Moreover, the high expression levels of eight gene families influencing the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway may promote the accumulation of JA and MeJA, which may induce the synthesis of terpenoid volatiles ( Dudareva et al., 2013). Thus, these results suggested that the transcript levels of these DEGs may be related to the terpenoid contents in the FL, IW, and SW. To further elucidate the regulatory effects of lncRNAs on the terpenoid metabolic pathway and the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway, we also predicted the DE-lncRNAs and their target genes related to these two pathways. The correlation analysis indicated that eight lncRNAs were positively correlated with the target genes, whereas 11 lncRNAs were negatively correlated with the target genes ( Supplementary Table S8). Moreover, we identified 10 DE-lncRNAs affecting 14  cis-target genes and four DE-lncRNAs affecting five  trans-target genes in the terpenoid metabolic pathway. A subsequent analysis revealed that  GGPPS and  TPS are regulated by three lncRNAs, whereas four genes ( DXS,  CMK,  AACT, and  PMK) are targeted by only one lncRNA ( Supplementary Figure S6). In the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway, 18 DE-lncRNAs and 18 DE target genes were identified in the FL, IW, and SW. Of the target genes, six associated with the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway ( LOX,  AOS,  AOC,  OPR,  ACX, and  MFP2) were regulated by lncRNAs. The correlation analysis demonstrated that 17 lncRNAs were positively correlated with the target genes, whereas five lncRNAs were negatively correlated with the target genes ( Supplementary Table S9). We also clarified the specific lncRNA–mRNA regulatory relationships. A total of 22 pairs of lncRNA–mRNA regulatory relationships were detected among these DE-lncRNAs and target genes involved in the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway. To analyze the relationship between the expression patterns of DE-lncRNAs and their target genes, we compared their expression levels in the FL, IW, and SW. The expression patterns of 32 DE-lncRNAs were analyzed in the FL, IW, and SW based on the normalized FPKM values ( Supplementary Figure S7). The overall expression levels of the DE-lncRNAs were similar in the IW and SW but varied in the FL. Among the 41 lncRNA–mRNA regulatory pairs, 25 pairs comprised a lncRNA and potential target gene that exhibited the same expression trend, whereas 16 pairs consisted of a lncRNA and target gene that exhibited the opposite expression trend. An examination of the regulatory relationships between the lncRNAs and mRNAs detected eight lncRNAs that targeted more than one gene and 24 lncRNAs with only one target gene. These findings implied that most of the lncRNAs associated with these two pathways have a single regulatory function regarding the expression of target genes. However, the few lncRNAs that target several genes may have multiple functions. To verify the accuracy of the lncRNA and target gene expression patterns, we conducted qRT-PCR analyses of 18 structural genes involved in the terpenoid metabolic pathway. The transcript levels of eight structural genes involved in JA/MeJA biosynthesis and three structural genes involved in the HPL pathway were also analyzed by qRT-PCR. We also conducted qRT-PCR analyses to determine the expression levels of the following lncRNAs involved in the terpenoid metabolic pathway and the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway: LTCONS_00093140 (targeting  DXS), LTCONS_00012676 (targeting  CMK), LTCONS_00002173 (targeting  HDS), LTCONS_00078708 (targeting  HDR), LTCONS_00039845 (targeting  GGPPS), LTCONS_00025739 (targeting  AACT), LTCONS_00091745 (targeting  MVK), LTCONS_00092790 (targeting  PMK), LTCONS_00043160 (targeting  TPS), LTCONS_00040667 (targeting  LOX), LTCONS_00087608 (targeting  AOS), LTCONS_00035664 (targeting  AOC), LTCONS_00032547 (targeting  OPR), LTCONS_00064473 (targeting  ACX), LTCONS_00087182 (targeting  ACX), and LTCONS_00061187 (targeting  MFP2). The correlations between the expression of the lncRNAs and their target genes were also analyzed ( Supplementary Table S5). In the scaffolds, the structures of all important  cis-regulated genes and their lncRNAs involved in terpenoid metabolism and JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction were plotted ( Supplementary Figure S5). The expression trends of selected genes and lncRNAs were similar between the qRT-PCR data and the transcriptome dataset ( Figure 7). These results confirmed the significant differences in the transcript levels of terpenoid metabolism-related lncRNAs and target genes in the FL vs. IW, FL vs. SW, and IW vs. SW comparisons. Relationships Between the Long Non-Coding RNAs and MicroRNAs Involved in Flavonoid Metabolism, Terpenoid Metabolism, and Jasmonic Acid/Methyl Jasmonate Biosynthesis and Signal Transduction To analyze the relationships between the lncRNAs and miRNAs involved in flavonoid metabolism, terpenoid metabolism, and JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction, the psRNATarget program was used to predict the potential regulatory relationships between lncRNAs and miRNAs. A total of 41 lncRNAs involved in these three metabolic pathways were predicted to be the targets of 76 miRNAs from 35 families. Additionally, 133 lncRNA–miRNA interacting pairs were identified ( Supplementary Table S10). These lncRNAs included 28 that were targeted by multiple miRNAs and 13 that were regulated by only one miRNA. Similarly, we identified 36 miRNAs that targeted only one lncRNA and 40 miRNAs with more than two target lncRNAs. Thus, most of the identified lncRNAs were regulated by multiple miRNAs. As novel regulatory factors, eTMs inhibit miRNA functions by binding to miRNAs, which indirectly affects the expression of miRNA targets. Some lncRNAs function as eTMs, thereby contributing to the regulation of miRNAs. In the present study, two lncRNAs detected in the transcriptome dataset were predicted to be potential eTMs (LTCONS_00026271 and LTCONS_00020084) for two miRNAs (novel_miR44 and miR169d-5p_1) associated with the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway, respectively ( Figure 8A). Moreover, we determined that novel_miR44 targets  LOX, whereas miR169d-5p_1 targets  ACX ( Supplementary Table S11). To identify the cleavage sites, the 5′ RLM-RACE PCR products for  LOX and  ACX were analyzed. The sequencing results were shown in  Supplementary Figure S8. The results indicated that  LOX can be regulated by cleavage in the binding region between the 10 th and 11 th bases from the 5′ end pairing of novel_miR44, and  ACX can be regulated by cleavage in the binding region between the 9 th and 10 th bases from the 5′ end pairing of miR169d-5p_1 ( Figure 8B). This proved that  LOX and  ACX are directly cleaved by miRNAs. To further explore the regulatory networks of eTMs with miRNAs and target genes, the expression patterns of selected eTMs (LTCONS_00026271 and LTCONS_00020084), miRNAs (novel_miR44 and miR169d-5p_1), and target genes ( LOX: MTCONS_00093153 and  ACX: MTCONS_00008303) were analyzed. According to qRT-PCR analyses ( Figure 8C), the expression levels of LTCONS_00026271 and  LOX were significantly higher in the SW than in the FL and IW, whereas the expression level of novel_miR44 was lower in the SW than in the FL and IW. Additionally, LTCONS_00020084 and  ACX expression levels were also higher in the SW than in the FL and IW, whereas miR169d-5p_1 expression exhibited the opposite pattern. Moreover, the expression profiles of novel_miR44 and miR169d-5p_1 were confirmed by RT-PCR. These profiles were consistent with the miRNA expression levels determined by qRT-PCR. To further validate the correlations among expression levels, the expression of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in diverse leaf samples (bud, first leaf, second leaf, and third leaf) was investigated by qRT-PCR ( Supplementary Figure S9). On the basis of these results, we detected negative relationships between eTMs and miRNAs, as well as between miRNAs and target genes. Conversely, the expression levels of eTMs and target genes were positively correlated. The lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA regulatory network in the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway was also constructed ( Figure 8D). Together, these results suggested that lncRNAs may affect the expression of related mRNAs through miRNAs.","Oolong tea is a popular and semi-fermented beverage. During the processing of tea leaves, withering is the first indispensable process for improving flavor. However, the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and the characteristic secondary metabolites during the withering of oolong tea leaves remain unknown. In this study, phytochemical analyses indicated that total polyphenols, flavonoids, catechins, epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin gallate (CG), gallocatechin gallate (GCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were all less abundant in the solar-withered leaves (SW) than in the fresh leaves (FL) and indoor-withered leaves (IW). In contrast, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) contents were higher in the SW than in the FL and IW. By analyzing the transcriptome data, we detected 32,036 lncRNAs. On the basis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, the flavonoid metabolic pathway, the terpenoid metabolic pathway, and the JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction pathway were enriched pathways. Additionally, 63 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) and 23 target genes were identified related to the three pathways. A comparison of the expression profiles of the DE-lncRNAs and their target genes between the SW and IW revealed four up-regulated genes (FLS, CCR, CAD, and HCT), seven up-regulated lncRNAs, four down-regulated genes (4CL, CHI, F3H, and F3'H), and three down-regulated lncRNAs related to flavonoid metabolism; nine up-regulated genes (DXS, CMK, HDS, HDR, AACT, MVK, PMK, GGPPS, and TPS), three up-regulated lncRNAs, and six down-regulated lncRNAs related to terpenoid metabolism; as well as six up-regulated genes (LOX, AOS, AOC, OPR, ACX, and MFP2), four up-regulated lncRNAs, and three down-regulated lncRNAs related to JA/MeJA biosynthesis and signal transduction. These results suggested that the expression of DE-lncRNAs and their targets involved in the three pathways may be related to the low abundance of the total polyphenols, flavonoids, and catechins (EGC, CG, GCG, ECG, and EGCG) and the high abundance of terpenoids in the SW. Moreover, solar irradiation, high JA and MeJA contents, and the endogenous target mimic (eTM)-related regulatory mechanism in the SW were also crucial for increasing the terpenoid levels. These findings provide new insights into the greater contribution of solar-withering to the high-quality flavor of oolong tea compared with the effects of indoor-withering.","['Secondary metabolites', 'Camellia sinensis', 'Transcriptome', 'Long Non-coding Rnas', 'Withering']","['Target Genes', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Genes', 'lncRNAs', 'Supplementary Table', 'LTCONS', 'Target', 'Figure', 'expression', 'Supplementary']","[lignin, 203.47, FL, IW (171.83 mg/g, CG, C, SW, FL (410.18 mg/g, IW (449.65, E)-2-hexenal, E)-2-hexenal, E)-2-hexenal, JA, μg/g, μg/g, μg/g, IW (1.81 μg/g, μg/g, μg/g, μg/g, 32,036, 50,041, 0–1,000, 2018a, 26,508, ≤ 1, DE-lncRNAs, 4,964 DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNA, DE-lncRNAs, glutamate, JA, JA, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, anthocyanidin synthase, anthocyanidin reductase, lignin, 2017b, lignin metabolism-related, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, alcohol dehydrogenase, C4H, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, S5, LTCONS_00054003, LTCONS_00060939, LTCONS_00056216, LTCONS_00044497 (, LTCONS_00031811 (, LTCONS_00001863, LTCONS_00090121, LTCONS_00030131, LTCONS_00101116, phosphate cytidylyltransferase, geranyl diphosphate synthase, phosphomevalonate kinase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, xylulose-, phosphate synthase, methylbut- 2- enyl- diphosphate synthase, methylbut- 2- enyl- diphosphate reductase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, acetyl- CoA, acetyltransferase, hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA synthase, hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA reductase, JA/MeJA, lipoxygenase, enoyl- CoA hydratase/, CoA dehydrogenase, jasmonate O-methyltransferase, hydroperoxide lyase, AOS, LOX, alcohol dehydrogenase, alcohol acetyltransferase, JA/MeJA, JA/MeJA biosynthesis-related, JA, JA/MeJA, JA, JA/MeJA, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, JA/MeJA, JA/MeJA, LOX, DE-lncRNAs, JA/MeJA, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, DE-lncRNAs, JA/MeJA, JA/MeJA, LTCONS_00093140, LTCONS_00012676, LTCONS_00002173, LTCONS_00078708, LTCONS_00039845, LTCONS_00025739, LTCONS_00091745, LTCONS_00092790, LTCONS_00043160 (, LTCONS_00087608, LTCONS_00035664, LTCONS_00032547 (, LTCONS_00064473, LTCONS_00087182, LTCONS_00061187 (, S5, JA/MeJA, JA/MeJA, eTMs, eTMs, eTMs, LTCONS_00026271, LTCONS_00020084, miR169d-5p_1, JA/MeJA, miR169d-5p_1, novel_miR44, miR169d-5p_1 (, eTMs, eTMs, LTCONS_00026271, LTCONS_00020084, miR169d-5p_1, LOX, MTCONS_00093153, LTCONS_00026271, novel_miR44, LTCONS_00020084, miR169d-5p_1, novel_miR44, miR169d-5p_1, eTMs, eTMs, lncRNA–, JA/MeJA]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS),']",[],[],terpene synthase
102,102,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6945444\eupmc_result.json,PMC6945444,"Results Volatile compounds detected in Citrus leaves In eight sour-orange and three sweet-orange germplasms, 88 and 64 volatile compounds were detected, respectively. Monoterpenes were the most abundant in both orange species (Additional file  4: Figure S1). As many as 52 compounds were detected in the leaves of Goutou Cheng (Table  1), with  β-pinene being the most abundant, followed by linalool, caryophyllene, sabinene and  trans- β-ocimene. The most abundant compounds were linalyl acetate in Xiaoye sour orange; linalool and (+)-bicyclogermacrene in Defuniya sour orange; and  trans- β-ocimene and sabinene in sweet orange (Additional file  1: Table S1 and Additional file  3: Table S3). A total of 196 volatile compounds (Additional file  1: Table S1) were tentatively detected in the leaves of 62 citrus germplasms (Table  1) based on the NIST Mass Spectral Library, among which 57 compounds were identified with authentic standards (Additional file  2: Table S2). The 196 compounds could be classified into 16 groups, including 19 monoterpenes, 15 monoterpene alcohols, five monoterpene aldehydes, five monoterpene ketones, five monoterpene oxides, six monoterpene esters, 72 sesquiterpenes, 16 sesquiterpene alcohols, one sesquiterpene oxide, two sesquiterpene aldehydes, five alcohols, 15 aldehydes, five acids, five esters, four ketones and 16 other compounds (Additional file  1: Table S1).  The total volatile content (TVC) of different citrus germplasms ranged from 0.13 ± 0.01 mg/g (Xingshan sour orange) to 28.69 ± 1.94 mg/g (Yaoxianggan, YXG, loose-skin mandarin), and the number of compounds in each germplasm ranged from 13 (HB pummelo) to 69 (YXG) (Table  1). There was higher diversity of the dominant compounds among different species in leaves than in peels. For example, the most abundant compounds were citronellal, geranyl acetate and  trans-β-ocimene in papeda;  trans-β-ocimene, linalyl acetate, α-pinene, ( E)- β-farnesene and  γ-elemene in  Citrus ichangensis; sabinene,  γ-terpinene,  D-limonene and germacrene D in  Citrus junos;  D-limonene, α-citral,  β-citral and citronellal in citron;  β-pinene, (+)-bicyclogermacrene,  trans-β-ocimene and caryophyllene in pummelo; linalool,  trans-β-ocimene and  β-elemene in loose-skin mandarin; sabinene,  trans-β-ocimene and 3-carene in sweet orange; and linalyl acetate, linalool, caryophyllene and  β-pinene in sour orange (Additional file  3: Table S3). A total of 43 compounds were commonly detected in at least 20 germplasms, including 34 terpenoids. Notably, among these terpenoids, 31 were found at the highest levels in wild or semiwild germplasms. For example, eight terpenoids (sabinene,  β-myrcene,  D-limonene,  allo-ocimene, α-elemene,  β-elemene, (−)-humulene and germacrene D) were the most abundant in YXG; seven terpenoids (camphene,  β-pinene, isospathulenol, germacrene D-4-ol,  trans-β-ocimene, α-copaene and terpinolene) were at the highest levels in Niedu wild tangerine (NDT, loose-skin mandarin);  γ-elemene and germacrene B were the most abundant in Indian sour tangerine (loose-skin mandarin); (+)- δ-cadinene and (+)-bicyclogermacrene were the most abundant in Wulong sour mandarin (loose-skin mandarin); and α-phellandrene and 3-carene were the most abundant in Muli citron (citron) and Newhall navel orange (sweet orange), respectively (Table  2).  All 62 investigated germplasms could be classified into seven species. The TVC level was > 10 mg/g for most papeda and loose-skin mandarin germplasms; 3–10 mg/g for most  C. ichangensis germplasms, citron, sweet orange and sour orange germplasms; and < 2.5 mg/g for most pummelo germplasms (Fig. 1). Among all seven citrus species, loose-skin mandarin and sweet orange had the largest and smallest numbers of volatile compounds, respectively.  A total of 140 volatile compounds were detected in the leaves of 15 loose-skin mandarin germplasms. The total content varied widely from 2.39 ± 0.33 mg/g in Guoqing No.1 (GQ.1) to 28.69 ± 1.94 mg/g in YXG, and more than 50 compounds were identified in most loose-skin mandarin germplasms (Table  1). Monoterpenes accounted for 42–78% of the TVC in loose-skin mandarin, except in Chachi and red-tangerine (Additional file  4: Figure S1); Chachi and red-tangerine leaves specifically accumulated methyl anthranilate, which accounted for 69.88 and 43% of the TVC, respectively, while  D-limonene, linalool, and sabinene were dominant volatile compounds in other loose-skin mandarin germplasms. Sesquiterpenoids only accounted for 5% of the TVC in Chachi, which was significantly lower than that in other mandarin germplasms (Additional file  1: Table S1 and Additional file  5: Figure S2). In 10  C. ichangensis germplasms, 128 volatile compounds were detected, including 76 sesquiterpenoids, which accounted for 30–50% of the TVC (Table  1; Additional file  4: Figure S1). In  C. junos, 55 compounds were identified, including 47 terpenoids. Among these volatile compounds, 73 and 13 compounds were unique in  C. ichangensis and  C. junos, respectively (Additional file  1: Table S1). Although the number of compounds detected in  C. junos was lower than that detected in  C. ichangensis,  C. junos exhibited a higher TVC level. Notably, sabinene, the levels of  β-cubebene, germacrene D and  β-elemene in  C. junos were significantly higher than those in most  C. ichangensis germplasms (> 10-fold),while  trans-β-ocimene and (+)- δ-cadinene were present at significantly higher levels in  C. ichangensis than in  C. junos(> 10-fold) (Additional file  1: Table S1). In the leaves from 9 citron germplasms, 119 volatile compounds were identified, with TVC ranging from 4.03 ± 0.44 mg/g (Yuanjiang citron) to 15.52 ± 0.84 mg/g (red-limonia, RL) and number of compounds ranging from 41 (Danna citron) to 65 (lime) (Table  1). Monoterpenes were the dominant compounds in citron germplasms (Additional file  4: Figure S1). RL leaves contained 60 volatile compounds and had the highest TVC, with  D-limonene being the most abundant, followed by  β-pinene, ( Z, Z)-α-farnesene, and caryophyllene (Additional file  1: Table S1). In 12 pummelo germplasms, 73 volatile compounds were detected. The TVC ranged from 0.22 ± 0.03 mg/g (Kaopan pummelo) to 2.15 ± 0.12 mg/g (Shatian pummelo) (Table  1), with monoterpenes being the most abundant in most pummelo germplasms and accounting for more than 50% of the TVC (Additional file  4: Figure S1). The TVC of HB pummelo leaves was low (1.90 ± 0.26 mg/g), and sesquiterpenes were almost undetectable (Additional file  1: Table S1). CPCoA of Citrus species based on leaf volatile profiles CPCoA grouped the 62 citrus germplasms into six clusters based on the leaf volatiles: cluster 1, loose-skin mandarin; cluster 2,  C. ichangensis; cluster 3, sour orange; cluster 4, pummelo; cluster 5, papeda; and cluster 6, citron. Generally, different accessions of the same species were clustered together. Three  C. junos germplasms (GuanXian xiangcheng No.3, Qianjiang xiangcheng No.3 and Ziyang xiangcheng) were clustered with loose-skin mandarin (Fig. 2).  Mono- and Sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis in wild and cultivar Citrus Germplasms There were higher levels and a greater variety of volatile compounds, especially monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, in the leaves of most wild or semiwild germplasms than in the leaves of cultivars (Fig. 3c), which was consistent with the volatile profiles of the flavedo and juice sacs (Additional file  6: Figure S3). Comparison of the expression levels of terpenoid-related genes was conducted in two wild germplasms (JYYJ and DXYJ) and two cultivars (BTJ and QTJ). In the wild germplasms, the expression of  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoAsynthase-2 ( HMGS-2),  mevalonate kinase ( MVK),  phosphomevalonate kinase ( PMK) and  farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase ( FPPS) in the MVA pathway and  geranyl pyrophosphate synthase ( GPPS) in the MEP pathway was significantly higher than that in the cultivars. In addition,  geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase ( GGPPS) in the MEP pathway, which is involved in the metabolism of carotenoids, abscisic acid (ABA) and diterpenes, showed significantly lower expression in the wild germplasms than in the cultivars (Fig. 3)ab.  To further clarify the expression level of terpenoid-related genes in the MVA and MEP pathways in wild and cultivar germplasms, leaf samples from 10 wild and 10 cultivar citrus germplasms were used for RT-qPCR analysis. (Additional file  7: Table S4). The expression levels of most genes showed the same tendency between the wild and cultivar citrus germplasms by RT-qPCR and transcriptome data analysis. RT-qPCR results showed that the expression levels of most genes in the MVA pathway in the wild citrus germplasms were higher than those in the cultivars, while most genes in the MEP pathway were not significantly different between the wild and cultivar germplasms. In the wild germplasms, the expression of  GPPS ( GPPS-1 and GPPS-2) was higher than that in the cultivars, while  GGPPS showed lower expression in the wild germplasms than in the cultivars (Fig. 4 and Additional file  8: Figure S4).  Volatile profiles in flowers A total of 82 volatile compounds were detected in citrus flowers from 25 germplasms at two opening stages (balloon stage, F1; fully open stage, F2), including 60 terpenoids and 22 other compounds (Additional file  9: Table S5). The TVC ranged from 1414.33 ± 51.39 μg/g (GQ1, F1) to 6235.60 ± 142.94 μg/g (Star Ruby grapefruit, SRG, F1), and the number of compounds ranged from 19 (Fenghuang pummelo, FHP, F1&F2) to 45 (SRG, F2) (Additional file  9: Table S5). Terpenoids were the most abundant volatiles in citrus flowers, accounting for more than 80% of the TVC in most citrus germplasms, with the exception of red-tangerine (approximately 39%) (Additional file  10: Table S6). The dominant compounds in flowers varied among different species: sabinene was the major compound in sweet orange, followed by  D-limonene and linalool; γ-terpinene was the most abundant in most loose-skin mandarin germplasms, with the exception of red-tangerine (dimethyl anthranilate);  D-limonene and  β-ocimene were dominant in pummelo; and  D-limonene,  β-pinene and  β-ocimene were the most abundant in lemon (Additional file  9: Table S5 and Additional file  10: Table S6). In contrast to the volatiles in leaves, 8-hydroxylinalool was unique to flowers, and the levels of α-sinensal, sabinene, nerolidol and farnesol in flowers were much higher than those in leaves, while the linalool content was similar to that in leaves. However, for most volatiles, such as caryophyllene and germacrene D, lower levels were detected in flowers (Additional file  11: Figure S5). Within the same germplasm, flower volatile profiles were generally similar between the two investigated stages (Additional file  12: Table S7). However, at the fully open stage, the levels of linalool, 8-hydroxylinalool, nerolidol, and farnesol significantly increased in sweet orange, whereas that of sabinene decreased (Additional file  13: Figure S6). Pummelo showed significant increases in linalool, nerolidol, and farnesol levels, whereas decreases in  β-myrcene,  β-pinene and sabinene levels were observed. Loose-skin mandarin and lemon showed increases in farnesol levels (Additional file  9: Table S5). DEG profile in Cara Cara navel Orange flowers and characterization of  STPS A total of 36 volatile compounds were detected in the flowers of Cara Cara navel orange, including 27 terpenoids (Additional file  9: Table S5), with sabinene as the most abundant compound. The flowers at two opening stages were used for transcriptomic analysis, and a total of 35.8 G high-quality base pairs (at least 5.2 G for each sample) were obtained. Approximately 96.16–98.19% of the total reads were aligned to the sweet orange genome. Among the aligned reads, 89.67–92.41% were uniquely aligned, and 5.64–6.59% were mapped to multiple loci (Additional file  14: Table S8). In total, the expression patterns of 18,654 and 18,267 expressed genes in F1 and F2, respectively, had FPKM values higher than 0.5. The average FPKM values were 33.17 and 44.53, and the expressed genes with FPKM values ranging from 1 to 100 were 86.71 and 85.24% of all the unigenes in F1 and F2, respectively. There were 1013 and 626 genes expressed in only F1 and F2, respectively (Additional file  15: Figure S7). A total of 2528 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by RNA-Seq analysis (| Log 2FC | > 1.5 and  P-value < 0.05) (Additional file  16: Table S9). GO annotation and enrichment results were mainly associated with plant metabolites, such as lignin, phenylpropanoids, second metabolites and aromatics (Additional file  17: Figure S8). Compared with balloon-stage flowers, 1281 and 1247 genes were significantly up- and downregulated, respectively, in fully open flowers. Among these DEGs, 47  TPS and 65  CYP450 genes were found (Additional file  18: Table S10). Correlation analysis between the terpene profiles and gene expression levels revealed that the content of sabinene and the expression level of  Cs3g04360 had the highest Pearson correlation coefficient (0.95). The Pearson correlation coefficient was higher than 0.9 between linalool content and 10  TPS genes (Cs5g23540, Cs5g22980, Cs2g03570, Cs3g21560, Cs2g22180, Cs2g07250, Cs2g07240, Cs2g06470, Cs2g07230 and Cs7g17670) (Additional file  17: Figure S8 and Additional file  18: Table S10). The Pearson correlation coefficient was higher than 0.9 between 8-hydroxylinalool and 36  CYP450 genes, including seven CYP76C subfamily genes. Those candidate genes maybe contribute to the production of the corresponding volatile terpenes. According to the high Pearson correlation coefficient, a  TPS candidate gene named  STPS in this study was cloned from Cara Cara navel orange flower, with an open reading frame of 1824 bp and encoding a protein of 607 amino acids (Additional file  19: Table S11), which was similar to that encoded by  Cs3g04360 but with 10 different residues (Additional file  20: Figure S9 A). The protein contained the expected divalent-metal-binding region (DDXXD) necessary for TPS activity and the RRX 8W motif common to cyclic-monoterpene-producing enzymes (Additional file  21: Table S12). The expression of  STPS significantly decreased in fully open flowers (Additional file  20: Figure S9 B). Recombinant proteins were expressed in  E. coli and purified using a combination of Ni 2+ affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Western blot analysis showed that a prokaryotic expression vector that produced a large amount of protein was successfully constructed (Additional file  17: Figure S8 CD). With the addition of GPP or FPP in vitro, GC-MS detection after solvent extraction showed that STPS catalyzed the conversion of GPP to monoterpenes, including 61.26% sabinene, 18.68%  D-limonene, 7.89% linalool, 5.65%  trans-β-ocimene, 4.32%  β-myrcene, and 2.20% α-pinene (Fig.  5). No terpene compounds were detected when FPP was used as a substrate. ","BACKGROUND:Previous reports have mainly focused on the volatiles in citrus fruits, and there have been few reports about the volatiles in citrus leaves and flowers. However, citrus leaves and flowers are also rich in volatile compounds with unique aromas. Here, to investigate the volatiles in citrus leaves and flowers, volatile profiling was performed on leaves from 62 germplasms and flowers from 25 germplasms. RESULTS:In total, 196 and 82 volatile compounds were identified from leaves of 62 citrus germplasms and flowers of 25 citrus germplasms, respectively. The dominant volatile terpenoids were more diverse in citrus leaves than in peels. A total of 34 volatile terpenoids were commonly detected in the leaves of at least 20 germplasms, among which 31 were overaccumulated in the leaves of wild or semiwild germplasms. This result was consistent with the high expression levels of five genes and one key gene of the mevalonate and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) biosynthetic pathways, respectively, as well as the low expression levels of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase of the MEP pathway, relative to the levels in cultivars. Fully open flowers showed increased levels of four terpene alcohols and a decrease in sabinene content compared with balloon-stage flowers, especially in sweet orange. A monoterpene synthase gene was identified and functionally characterized as a sabinene synthase in vitro. CONCLUSIONS:Collectively, our results suggest that 31 important terpenoids are abundant in wild or semiwild citrus germplasms, possibly because of a negative effect of domestication on the volatiles in citrus leaves. The sweet smell of fully open flowers may be attributed to increased levels of four terpene alcohols. In addition, a sabinene synthase gene was identified by combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses.","['Citrus', 'Volatile Profile', 'Terpenoid Biosynthesis', 'Stps', 'Wild Or Semiwild Germplasms']","['Additional file', 'Additional', 'Table', 'file', 'Volatile compounds', 'compounds', 'germplasms', 'Figure', 'loose-skin mandarin', 'citrus germplasms']","[sour-orange, (+)-bicyclogermacrene, α-pinene, E)-, α-citral, Niedu, (+)-bicyclogermacrene, red-tangerine (Additional , TVC (Table, Monoterpenes, TVC (Additional file, CPCoA, CPCoA, GuanXian xiangcheng, xiangcheng, xiangcheng, JYYJ, DXYJ, QTJ, mevalonate kinase, pyrophosphate synthase, FPPS, geranyl pyrophosphate synthase, GPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, GGPPS, abscisic acid, ABA, GPPS-2, S5, 1414.33 ± 51.39 μg/g, 6235.60 ± 142.94 μg/g, SRG, F2), S5, red-tangerine, γ-terpinene, red-tangerine, S5, Additional , α-sinensal, S5, S5, S5, 96.16–98.19, 89.67–92.41, F2, F2, F2, Cs5g23540, Cs5g22980, Cs2g03570, Cs3g21560, Cs2g22180, Cs2g07250, Cs2g07240, Cs2g06470, Cs7g17670, CYP76C, cyclic-monoterpene-producing enzymes (Additional , S12, Ni 2]","['STPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'STPS', 'TPS', 'STPS', 'STPS']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']","['Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus']",
103,103,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC6986037\eupmc_result.json,PMC6986037,"Results Transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly of  Z. armatum The total RNA of five major sample types, including roots (Ro), stems (St), leaf buds (LB), mature leaves (ML) and fruits (Fr), was isolated to construct the comprehensive transcriptome of  Z. armatum. The quality of the RNA was determined using the OD260/OD280 ratio (1.88–2.21) and RIN (7.60–10.00) (Additional file  1: Table S1). A total of 126.89 G of paired-end raw reads were produced by transcriptome sequencing. After trimming adapters and low-quality bases, 7.92–9.91 G of clean bases were produced from 15 cDNA libraries in this study (Additional file  2: Table S2). The error rate of RNA-seq was only approximately 0.02%, all of the Q30 values were greater than 93.90%, and the GC content was above 43% in each sample. In addition, an assembly of 350,625 transcripts was achieved, with a mean length of 1219 bp for the  Z. armatum transcriptome (Additional file  3: Figure S1a). The longest transcript of each gene was chosen from the assembly results as the candidate unigene. Finally, a set of 111,318 unigenes was obtained in the present study (Additional file  3: Figure S1b). The length of the unigenes ranged from 301 to 17,299 bp, with an average of 1014 bp, and the lengths of more than half of the unigenes in the total assembly were greater than 1454 bp ( N50 = 1454). Identification of simple sequence repeats In recent years, various molecular markers have been widely developed in different plants to construct plant genetic maps, perform gene localization, determine hybrid purity, and examine other aspects. To obtain abundant molecular markers for the genetic analysis and marker-assisted selection breeding of  Z. armatum, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified in our transcriptome (Fig.  1). Mono- to hexanucleotide SSRs were identified using MISA software (Fig.  1, Additional file  4: Table S3). A total of 46,098 SSR loci were characterized, among which mononucleotide repeats were the most abundant (30,266, 65.66%), followed by dinucleotides (8528, 18.50%). Moreover, at least 9–12 repeats were detected among the monomer nucleotide SSRs. However, di- to hexanucleotide SSRs were explored mostly in the context of 5 to 8 repeats. These results indicated that high variation might exist in  Z. armatum. Gene functional annotation After assembly, all the unigenes were subjected to BLASTx analysis against five public databases, including NR, NT, KO, Pfam, and KOG, to characterize their gene functions (Additional file  5: Figure S2, Table  1). A total of 73,426 (65.96%) unigenes were annotated in at least one database. The highest annotation rate was obtained in the NR database, which assigned 61,598 (55.34%) unigenes. A total of 34,930 (31.38%) and 16,316 (14.66%) unigenes were annotated with the Pfam and KOG databases, respectively. The top-scoring BLASTx hits against the NR protein database showed that the E-value distribution presented a comparable pattern with 50.70% of the mapped sequences with high homologies (< 1e-45), whereas the E-values for 49.30% of the homologous sequences ranged between 1e-5 and 1e-45 (Additional file  5: Figure S2a). The distribution of sequence similarity showed that 53.90% of the mapped sequences presented similarities higher than 80%, while 10.50% of the hits exhibited similarities lower than 60% (Additional file  5: Figure S2b). Additionally, the species distribution of the NR BLASTx matches showed that the top three species were  Citrus clementina (21.80%),  Citrus unshiu (19.00%) and  Citrus sinensis (16.10%), and all of these species and  Z. armatum belonged to Rutaceae (Additional file  5: Figure S2d). All the above results indicated that a high-quality annotation was obtained in the present study.  Moreover, 34,930 (31.37%) unigenes were annotated with 55 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, including 26 terms related to biological processes, 19 terms related to cellular components, and 10 terms associated with molecular functions (Additional file  6: Figure S3). Under the biological process, cellular component and molecular function categories, the predominant groups were assigned to the cellular process (GO: 0009987) and metabolic process (GO: 0008152); cell (GO: 0005623) and cell part (GO: 0044464); and binding (GO: 0005488) and catalytic activity (GO: 0003824) terms, respectively. To further understand the biological functions and interactions of the unigenes, they were also classified into metabolic pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). A total of 24,137 unigenes (21.68%) were assigned to 19 categories divided into five clusters, including cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, metabolism and organismal systems (Additional file  7: Figure S4). Among the KEGG pathways (Additional file  8: Table S4), the top five categories were translation (2916 unigenes), carbohydrate metabolism (2226 unigenes), overview (1771 unigenes), folding and degradation (1659 unigenes), and amino acid metabolism (1394 unigenes). All of these results showed that the investigated samples were characterized by active cell development and differentiation. Four hundred and twenty two unigenes were annotated with metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, and 376 of which were related to monoterpenoid, diterpenoid, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid, limonene and pinene, carotenoid, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathways. Additionally, 314 unigenes were involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism. These unigenes were the main substances associated with fatty acid and aromatic compound accumulation. It is worth noting that all of these putative genes were differentially expressed among the five different samples in this study (Additional file  9: Figure S5, Additional file  10: Figure S6), and more unigenes were up-regulation in the fruit samples. This suggested that some organ-specific unigenes might be existed in various tissues, and the fruit could be the mainly organs to accumulate the numbing-taste related compounds. Investigation of organ-specific unigenes The Pearson correlation analysis revealed that all three independent biological replicates of each sample presented good reproducibility in the present study, and the stem samples showed the highest correlation coefficient among all of the investigated organs (Additional file  11: Figure S7). To further analyse the characteristics of the genes related to the different organs, the organ-specific unigenes of the five major samples were screened on the basis of a  p value < 0.05 and |log2(fold change)| >5. The expression values (FPKM) for each comparison were for one organ and the sum of other organs. The investigation of the organ-specific unigenes expressed in each organ showed that 4970, 90, 2314, 1955, and 650 unigenes were specifically found in the roots, stems, leaf buds, mature leaves, and fruits, respectively (Additional file  12: Figure S8a-e). The root samples (Ro) expressed the most unigenes (49.80%), including 2653 upregulated and 2317 downregulated genes (Additional file  12: Figure S8f). The stems and fruits expressed the fewest unigenes (0.90 and 6.51%, respectively). To evaluate the functional properties of these organ-specific unigenes, KEGG enrichment was performed, and the significant pathways of each organ are listed in (Additional file  13: Table S5). Seventeen KEGG pathways were significantly enriched in root samples, including flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, terpenoid biosynthesis, alkaloid biosynthesis, and zeatin biosynthesis, which indicated that the most active biological synthesis was occurring in the roots of  Z. armatum. Only two significant KEGG pathways (five unigenes) were observed in the stem samples. Additionally, 14 and 16 KEGG pathways were distinctively obtained in the LB and ML samples, respectively. In both cases, the greatest enrichment was observed for phenyl propanoid biosynthesis, glycerolipid metabolism, galactose metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways, which supply the necessary substances for the growth and development of these tissues. However, unigenes involved in plant hormone signal transduction, flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthesis and metabolism were detected at significant levels in ML samples, which might contribute to the numbing taste and peppery flavour of the leaves of  Z. armatum. Additionally, 18 significant KEGG pathways were identified in the Fr samples, most of which were enriched in terpenoid, alkaloid and flavonoid biosynthesis. These unigenes might be the main source of the special numbing taste of the fruits of  Z. armatum. Identification and characterization of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis The analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was carried out in the five major organs of  Z. armatum. To comprehensively reveal the key genes associated with the special numbing taste in the fruits of  Z. armatum, genes with a  p value < 0.05 and a |log2(fold change)| >1 identified by EdgeR were regarded as DEGs in the comparisons of fruit samples and other organs (Fr vs. Ro, Fr vs. St, Fr vs. LB, and Fr vs. ML). As a result, a total of 3091 DEGs were co-detected in all four comparisons (Fig.  2a), 1625 of which were co-screened and found to be upregulated in all four comparisons (Fig.  2b), whereas 251 of which were co-identified and found to be downregulated in all four comparisons (Fig.  2c). The KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the downregulated DEGs were mainly related to plant hormone signal transduction and amino and sugar metabolism pathways (Additional file  14: Table S6). However, most of the upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in terpenoid, alkaloid, flavonoid and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism (Fig.  2d, Additional file  14: Table S6). Thus, the following analysis was mainly focused on the upregulated unigenes to explore the genetic information associated with the special numbing taste in  Z. armatum.  In total, 53 DEGs were identified as candidate unigenes for 12 enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, and their expression values in the five major organs and TAIR10 annotations are shown in (Additional file  15: Table S7) and  (Additional file  16: Table S8). These enzymes constituted two independent subpathways upstream of the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway (Fig.  3a), both of which utilize glycolysis to obtain the initial substrate for producing dimethylallyl diphosphate (dimethylallyl- PP). Then, dimethylallyl- PP is used to generate monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, triterpenoids, and other terpenoid compounds [ 14], which are the main aromatic substances involved in the special numbing taste in the fruits of  Z. armatum [ 10]. In the present study, the results showed that almost all genes involved in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis were differentially expressed genes and detected at significant levels in the fruit samples (Fig.  3a).  To further characterize the functional properties of these DEGs, some of the DEGs were selected to perform qRT-PCR detection during fruit development and maturation. A total of eight fruit samples were collected to investigate these genes (Additional file  17: Figure S10): in Fr1, 5 days after fertilization, the fruit was green-yellowish with a smooth surface; in Fr2, 15 days after fertilization, the fruit was oval with some slightly concave and transparent speckling on the surface; in Fr3, 28 days after fertilization, the fruit was green and grew rapidly; in Fr4, 40 days after fertilization, the fruit was further expanded with obvious speckles; in Fr5, 50 days after fertilization, the fruit gradually stopped expanding, and inclusions began to accumulate within the speckles; in Fr6, 62 days after fertilization, the fruit was dark green, and significant speckles accumulated additional inclusions; in Fr7, 75 days after fertilization, the fruit gradually matured and exhibited many inclusions within speckles; and in Fr8, 85 days after fertilization, the fruit was completely mature, and the special numbing taste was fully developed. Two unigenes, Cluster-12,235.37800 and Cluster-12,235.28045, were annotated to mevalonate kinase 1 ( MVK1) and phosphomevalonate kinase ( PMVK), respectively, which belong to the MVA pathway and play rate-determining roles in the production of mevalonate- 5PP. The results showed that both of these unigenes were significantly upregulated in the Fr4 stage but showed lower expression in the preceding and the subsequent stages of fruit development and maturation, especially in the Fr7 and Fr8 stages. Cluster-12,235.38535 and Cluster-12,235.46034 were annotated to deoxy- D-xylulose phosphate synthase ( DXS), which catalyses the initial step in the transformation of  D-glyceraldehyde-phosphate into deoxy- D-xylulose-phosphate in the MEP pathway. The results showed that both of these unigenes were significantly upregulated in the Fr4 stage but downregulated in the preceding and subsequent stages of fruit development and maturation (Fig.  3b). Additionally, unigenes involved in two enzymes in the MEP pathway, Cluster-12,235.31323 ( ZaISPE) and Cluster-12,235.41588 ( ZaGCPE), presented similar expression patterns in the fruit development and maturation stages. Moreover, Cluster-12,235.40340, a key unigene annotated to geranyl-geranyl diphosphate synthase 12 ( GGPPS12), which generates important substrates associated with the biosynthesis of various terpenoid compounds, presented gradual up-regulation from the Fr1 to Fr4 stages, whereas it was significantly downregulated in the Fr4 to Fr8 stages. A consistent result was that  ZaTPS03 (Cluster-12,235.42010) was exclusively upregulated in Fr4 samples of  Z. armatum; this unigene is related to the catalysis of the production of (R)-limonene as well as other related compounds using geranyl- PP via the monoterpenoid biosynthesis process. These results indicated that the Fr4 stage could be the core period for the initiation of terpenoid compound biosynthesis and the accumulation of these compounds in the fruit development and maturation process of  Z. armatum. Identification and characterization of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis Based on KEGG enrichment, a total of 20 DEGs were screened and annotated to fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation processes (Additional file  14: Table S6, Fig.  2d). The expression values of these candidate unigenes in the five major organs and their TAIR10 annotations are shown in (Additional file  15: Table S7) and (Additional file  16: Table S8). Moreover, all 20 DEGs were only associated with six subfamilies, including the ACP desaturase 5 ( AAD5), acyl-activating enzyme 16 ( AAE16), ketoacyl-ACP synthetase II ( KASII), long-chain acyl-CoA synthase ( LACS), ketoacyl-CoA synthase ( KCS), and oxoacyl-acyl-carrier protein reductase ( FabG) subfamilies, for which homologous  Arabidopsis sequences were not identified in the TAIR10 protein database. Additionally,  KASII,  FabG, and  AAD5 were significantly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways (Fig.  4a), whereas  LACS and  KCS were mainly associated with long-chain fatty acid biosynthetic and metabolic processes (Additional file  16: Table S8).  Furthermore,  ZaKASII (Cluster-12,235.36948), a key synthetase related to the elongation of 16-carbon palmitoyl-ACP to produce 18-carbon stearoyl-ACP, was significantly upregulated in the Fr4 stage (Fig.  4b) but presented relatively low expression in the preceding and subsequent stages, especially in the fruit maturation process (Fr7-Fr8). However, Cluster-12,235.36948, annotatedto  FabG, which reduces3-Oxo- N-ACP to form 3-hydroxy- N-ACP, was not only upregulated in the Fr4 stage but also showed higher expression in the Fr6-Fr8 stages. It is worth noting that two unigenes annotated to  ZaAAD5, Cluster-12,235.43479 and Cluster-12,235.42753, showed similar patterns and were exclusively upregulated in the Fr6 stage. Both of these unigenes are involved in important reactions in the formation of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids. Identification and characterization of genes involved in fatty acid degradation A total of 168 unigenes were annotated to fatty acid degradation pathways in the transcriptome database analysed in the present study, and 14 DEGs were screened and found to be significantly upregulated in fruit samples according to KEGG enrichment analysis (Additional file  14:Table S6, Fig.  2d). The expression values of these candidate DEGs in the five major organs and their TAIR10 annotations are also listed in (Additional file  15: Table S7) and  (Additional file  16: Table S8). Interestingly, the major pathway of fatty acid degradation was beta-oxidation catabolism, and the main enzymes involved in each step were identified in our DEG profiles, which included long-chain acyl-CoA synthase ( LACS), acyl-CoA oxidase ( ACX), multifunctional protein 2 ( MFP2), hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( HADH), ketoacyl-CoA thiolase ( KAT) and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase 2 ( ACAT2) (Fig.  5a).  The two  LACS genes were investigated in the present study, whose encoded proteins catalyse the initial reactions of the fatty acid degradation process. Cluster-12,235.42753, annotated to  ZaLACS1, was only very significantly upregulated in the Fr4 stage (Fig.  5b), whereas Cluster-12,235.42753 ( ZaLACS6) was not only upregulated in the Fr4 stage but was also highly expressed in the Fr6 stage. Similar results were obtained for  ZaACX3 (Cluster-12,235.39988) and  ZaMFP2 (Cluster-12,235.50349), which catalyse the first and second reactions of fatty acid  β-oxidation, respectively, and presented two peaks of upregulation (Fr4 and Fr6). Additionally, their downstream oxidase,  ZaKATII (Cluster-12,235.55699), which generates and releases CoA, was distinctively upregulated in the Fr4 and Fr6 stages. Additionally,  ZaACAT2 (Cluster-12,235.42348), which is involved in a key step in the transformation of acetoacetyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA, was still highly expressed in the Fr4 and Fr6 stages of  Z. armatum. qRT-PCR validation To experimentally confirm the RNA-seq data, eight DEGs (with 21 terms) detected in Frvs. Ro, Frvs. St, Frvs.LB, Frvs.ML, LB vs. Ro, ML vs.LB, ML vs. Ro, and ML vs. St were tested by qRT-PCR (Additional file  18: Table S9). These genes were randomly selected based on their high fold changes indicating their crucial functions identified in this study. The results for all of these genes were consistent and showed the same trend of up- or downregulation between the qRT-PCR and the RNA-seq platform (Additional file  19: Figure S11). The correlation coefficient for the two expression measurements was 0.8059 between these 24 terms ( R2 = 0.8059). In summary, the results suggested that our transcriptome data accurately reflected the expression patterns of most genes in  Z. armatum.","BACKGROUND:Zanthoxylum armatum (Z. armatum) is a highly economically important tree that presents a special numbing taste. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of the numbing taste remains poorly understood. Thus, the elucidation of the key genes associated with numbing taste biosynthesis pathways is critical for providing genetic information on Z. armatumand the breeding of high-quality germplasms of this species. RESULTS:Here, de novo transcriptome assembly was performed for the five major organs of Z. armatum, including the roots, stems, leaf buds, mature leaves and fruits. A total of 111,318 unigenes were generated with an average length of 1014 bp. Additionally, a large number of SSRs were obtained to improve our understanding of the phylogeny and genetics of Z. armatum. The organ-specific unigenes of the five major samples were screened and annotated via GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. A total of 53 and 34 unigenes that were exclusively upregulated in fruit samples were identified as candidate unigenes for terpenoid biosynthesis or fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation and degradation pathways, respectively. Moreover, 40 days after fertilization (Fr4 stage) could be an important period for the accumulation of terpenoid compounds during the fruit development and maturation of Z. armatum. The Fr4 stage could be a key point at which the first few steps of the fatty acid biosynthesis process are promoted, and the catalysis of subsequent reactions could be significantly induced at 62 days after fertilization (Fr6 stage). CONCLUSIONS:The present study realized de novo transcriptome assembly for the five major organs of Z. armatum. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive analysis revealing the genes underlying the special numbing taste of Z. armatum. The assembled transcriptome profiles expand the available genetic information on this species and will contribute to gene functional studies, which will aid in the engineering of high-quality cultivars of Z. armatum.","['Aromatic compounds', 'Fatty acid', 'Zanthoxylum Armatum', 'De Novo Transcriptome']","['Additional file', 'Additional', 'unigenes', 'file', 'Table', 'Figure', 'Fig.', 'fruit', 'biosynthesis', 'Genes']","[LB, 7.92–9.91 G, RNA-seq, 350,625, 111,318, S1b, SSRs, SSRs, 30,266, 9–12, SSRs, SSRs, KOG, 73,426, 61,598, 34,930 (, KOG, 34,930 (, S5, numbing-taste, |log2(fold change)|, S5, Fr, Fr, St, Fr, LB, Fr vs. ML, TAIR10, Fr3, Fr4, Fr7, Fr8, Cluster-12,235.37800, Cluster-12,235.28045, mevalonate kinase 1, MVK1, phosphomevalonate kinase, PMVK, mevalonate-, Fr4, Fr7, Fr8, Cluster-12,235.38535, Cluster-12,235.46034, Fr4, Cluster-12,235.31323 ( ZaISPE, Cluster-12,235.41588 ( ZaGCPE, Cluster-12,235.40340, geranyl-geranyl diphosphate synthase 12, GGPPS12, Fr4, Fr4, Fr4, Fr4, S6, TAIR10, ACP desaturase 5, AAD5, acyl-activating enzyme 16, AAE16, ketoacyl-ACP synthetase II, KASII, LACS, ketoacyl-CoA synthase, oxoacyl-acyl-carrier protein reductase, FabG, TAIR10, Cluster-12,235.36948, Fr4, Cluster-12,235.36948, annotatedto  , reduces3-Oxo- N-ACP, N-ACP, Fr4, Fr6-Fr8, Cluster-12,235.43479, Cluster-12,235.42753, TAIR10, LACS, acyl-CoA oxidase, MFP2, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, HADH, ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, KAT, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase 2, ACAT2, Cluster-12,235.42753, Fr4, Cluster-12,235.42753, ZaLACS6, Fr4, Cluster-12,235.39988, Cluster-12,235.50349, Fr4, oxidase, Cluster-12,235.55699, Fr4, Cluster-12,235.42348, acetoacetyl-CoA, Fr4, Frvs, Frvs, Frvs, Frvs, LB, Ro]",['ZaTPS03'],[],"['Citrus', 'Citrus', 'Citrus']",

Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Attack Significantly Increased Geraniol Emission from Tea Leaves Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii is the corrected scientific name of tea green leafhopper in China, one of the main pests in tea production regions [ 24]. In tea fields,  E. (M.) onukii-infested tea leaves show changes in appearance. Here, we investigated the effect of  E. (M.) onukii infestation on the formation and emission of geraniol, a volatile monoterpene derived from GPP. We conducted these experiments in the laboratory to exclude the effects of other factors (e.g., other insects/climatic conditions). Compared with control tea leaves, those infested by  E. (M.) onukii showed a significant increase in geraniol emission ( Figure 1a). However, infestation by  E. (M.) onukii did not affect the activity of GES in tea leaves ( Figure 1b). 3.2. Crude Enzyme Extract of Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Produced Geraniol from Greanyl Diphosphate Since the activity of tea leaves GES was not increased after  E. (M.) onukii attack, it was presumed that the geraniol accumulation may induced by GES which was from  E. (M.) onukii. To investigate whether elicitors such as enzymes involved in geraniol formation were present in  E. (M.) onukii, we extracted  E. (M.) onukii using buffer, and added GPP as the substrate. In contrast to controls (GPP or crude extract only), the reaction solution containing GPP and the insect extract specifically produced geraniol, but not other volatile monoterpenes such as linalool. The GES activity was higher in the body part than in the head part of  E. (M.) onukii ( Figure 2,  Table S3). These results confirmed that  E. (M.) onukii contains GES, which generates geraniol from GPP. 3.3. Terpene synthase from Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Was Able to Convert Greanyl Diphosphate to Geraniol Although typical terpene synthase was not found in insect genomic and transcriptomic sequences [ 22], the isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDSs) such as terpene synthases have been reported in  Phyllotreta striolata and  Ips pini [ 22, 25]. A full-length transcriptome of whole  E. (M.) onukii insect was sequenced with three generation PacBio sequencing technology (unpublished data). Three isoprenyl diphosphate synthases including two farnesyl diphosphate (FPPS,  EoFPPS1 and  EoFPPS2) homologue genes and one geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS,  EoTPS) homologue genes were found in this full-length transcriptome. These three genes were cloned from  E. (M.) onukii successfully. The full length of EoFPPS1 (GenBank Accession Number MH383157) was 1179 bps, encoding 392 amino acids. The full length of EoFPPS2 (GenBank Accession Number MH383158) was 1287 bps, encoding 428 amino acids. The full length of EoTPS (GenBank Accession Number MH383159) was 912 bps, encoding 303 amino acids. The calculated molecular masses of EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, and EoTPS were 45, 49, and 35 kDa, respectively. Neighbor-joining tree was generated with other isoprenyl diphosphate synthases in insect. The two farnesyl diphosphate synthase, EoFPPS1 and EoFPPS2, belong to the FPP synthase family. They clustered together with the other characterized FPPS from beetles in phylogenetic trees and were closest to the  Phaedon cochleariae FPPS ( Figure 3). The geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, EoTPS, belongs to the GGPP synthase type III family ( Figure 3) and it was closest with the  Choristoneura fumiferana GGPPS in the phylogenetic analysis. These genes were heterologously expressed in  Escherichia coli ( Figure 4a). Among these three genes, EoFPPS1 was predicted to be mitochondrion localized. To better determine the enzymatic activity of EoFPPS1, the ORF lacking pupative mitochondrial targeting peptide (the first 25 amino acids, EoFPPS1S) was also expressed in  E. coli ( Figure 4a). The activity assay results showed that only EoTPS converted GPP to geraniol ( Figure 4b,  Figure S1). It was presumed that prokaryotic expression systems may not be suitable for functional protein expression. Therefore, EoFPPS1 and EoFPPS2 were also expressed in insect Sf9 cells. The results showed that there is no difference of geraniol formation between EoFPPS1 and empty vector, or between EoFPPS2 and empty vector. Therefore, the enzyme activity assay with insect Sf9 cell expression system also proved that EoFPPS1 and EoFPPS2 could not convert GPP to geraniol ( Figure 5). 3.4. Geraniol Synthase Also Existed in Other Insects To identify whether GES was conserved in insects, the GES activity was also determined in other insects including larvae of  Ectropis oblique and  Euproctis pseudoconspersa, and adult of  Cylas formicarius. The activity was measured with crude enzyme extracted from different insects. The monoterpene synthase assay results showed that only geraniol was produced using GPP as a substrate ( Figure 6). No significant difference was observed in linalool formation between enzyme reaction and GPP self-degradation control ( Figure 6). These results suggested that GES was the monoterpene synthase that existed in these insects. 3.5. Geraniol Had in Vitro Ability to Inhibit the Growth of Endobacterial Isolated from Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii To isolate the endobacteria in  E. (M.) onukii, the dissected insect pieces were incubated in LB plate until the bacteria colonies appeared. Then, the grown bacterial was further purified to obtain single colony. The bacteria DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced. For preliminary identification, the 16S rRNA sequences were analyzed with BLASTn in GenBank database. Isolation A showed similarity of 99.86% with uncultured  Acinetobacter sp. (AB908752). Isolation B showed similarity of 99.79% with  Pseucomonas fulva (FJ972539). Isolation C showed similarity of 99.79% with  Acinetobacter johnsonii (CP037424). In the next steps, these three 16S rRNA sequences were aligned with other sequences of different species in GenBank database. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. The similar results were found in phylogenetic analysis ( Figure 7). These endobacteria were also found in other insects [ 26, 27, 28, 29].  Acinetobacter group was reported to be the major endobacteria in other insects [ 26].  Acinetobacter johnsonii is a common endosymbiont in insect [ 27, 28]. Therefore, in our present study, isolation C  Acinetobacter johnsonii was chosen to initially analyze the potential antibacterial activity of geraniol. The results showed that geraniol could inhibit the isolation C growth in vitro. The geraniol concentration of 500 μg/mL inhibited the isolation C growth in LB medium effectively according to the OD 600 analysis ( Table 1). The isolated C colony  Acinetobacter johnsonii was used for antibacterial activity assay. The experiments were performed in three replicates.","When insects attack plants, insect-derived elicitors and mechanical damage induce the formation and emission of plant volatiles that have important ecological functions and flavor properties. These events have mainly been studied in model plants, rather than crop plants. Our study showed that tea green leafhopper (Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Matsuda), a major pest infesting tea attack significantly induced the emission of geraniol from tea leaves, but did not affect the crude enzyme activity of geraniol synthase in tea leaves. An enzyme extract of E. (M.) onukii specifically produced geraniol from geraniol diphosphate. Furthermore, a terpene synthase (EoTPS) was isolated from E. (M.) onukii. This terpene synthase was able to convert geraniol diphosphate to geraniol in vitro. In addition, geraniol had in vitro ability to inhibit the growth of Acinetobacter johnsonii that is endobacterial isolated from E. (M.) onukii. This information illustrates that elicitors from piercing-sucking insects can induce the formation of volatiles from crop plants and advances our understanding of the roles of plant volatiles in the interaction among crops-insects-microorganisms.","['Tea', 'Geraniol', 'Camellia sinensis', 'Volatile', 'Aroma', 'Green Leafhopper']","['Figure', 'Geraniol', 'onukii', 'GPP', 'Tea Leaves', 'GES', 'synthase', 'Tea', 'Diphosphate', 'activity']","[Tea Leaves Empoasca (Matsumurasca), GES, Greanyl Diphosphate, GES, GES, GES, Greanyl Diphosphate, isoprenyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, FPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, GGPPS, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, MH383158, MH383159, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, FPP synthase, FPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, GGPP synthase type III, GGPPS, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS1S, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, GES, GES, GES, GenBank, FJ972539, C, CP037424, C, C]","['EoTPS)', 'EoTPS', 'EoTPS', 'EoTPS,', 'EoTPS']",[],[],terpene synthase
108,108,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7125107\eupmc_result.json,PMC7125107,"Results Genome sequencing and annotation L. cubeba has a diploid genome (2 n = 24) (Supplementary Fig.  2a) with an estimated haploid genome size of 1370.14 Mb (Supplementary Fig.  2b). The genome was initially assembled with 155.64× sequencing reads from the PacBio platform. The assembled contigs were subsequently linked into 1514 scaffolds with 10× genomics barcoded reads (Supplementary Note  1 and Supplementary Table  1). We obtained an initial genome assembly with 1514 scaffolds covering 1325.69 Mb, with a contig N50 value of 607.34 kb (Supplementary Table  2). Further scaffolding was done based on 292.17 Gb reads from a sequencing library of Genome-wide Chromosome Conformation Capture (Hi-C). We were able to anchor a total of 1018 scaffolds covering 1253.47 Mb (94.56%) of the assembled genome into 12 pseudochromosomes (Supplementary Figs.  2c,  3, and Supplementary Table  3). To confirm the completeness of the assembly, we performed CEGMA 22, BUSCO 23 assessments, and used mRNA sequences of  L. cubeba and found the completeness of the genome to be 95.97% (Supplementary Table  4), 88.4% (Supplementary Table  5), and 97% (Supplementary Table  6), respectively. A combination of homolog-based comparisons and structure-based analyses resulted in an annotation of 735 Mb transposable elements (TEs), representing 55.47% of the  L. cubeba genome (Supplementary Table  7), which is between that of  C. kanehirae (~48% in a 730.7 Mb genome) 12 and  L. chinense (~62% in a 1742.4 Mb genome) 11 (Supplementary Table  8). Long terminal repeats (LTRs) are the predominant TEs in the genome of  L. cubeba, which represent 47.64% (631 Mb) of the whole genome. Both  L. cubeba and  L. chinense have a larger genome size than that of  C. kanehireae12, and they both contain higher content of LTR/gypsy and copia elements (45.31%) than that of the  C. kanehireae genome (16.50%) 12. Hence, it suggests that LTR/gypsy and copia elements contribute most to the expansions of the  L. cubeba and  L. chinense genomes (Supplementary Table  8). A high-confidence set of 31,329 protein-coding genes were predicted in the  L. cubeba genome, of which 29,262 (93.4%) and 27,753 (88.59%) were supported by transcriptome data and protein homologs, respectively (Supplementary Fig.  4a and Supplementary Table  9). A total of 29,651 (94.6%) predicted protein-coding genes were functionally annotated (Supplementary Fig.  4a and Supplementary Table  10) and 30,314 (91.3%) of the genes could be located on the 12 pseudochromosomes. In addition, 1284 (89.2%) of the 1440 protein-coding genes in the BUSCO plant set were predicted in the  L. cubeba genome (Supplementary Table  5). We then compared the genomes of 26 plant species to obtain gene families that are significantly expanded in Lauraceae or that are unique to Lauraceae (Supplementary Fig.  4b, c and Supplementary Table  11). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses found that the significantly expanded gene families are especially enriched in the KEGG pathways of monoterpenoid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and metabolic (Supplementary Table  12) and in the GO terms of TPS activity, transferase activity, and catalytic activity (Supplementary Table  13). Many monoterpene synthase (TPS-b) genes are included in the above enriched KEGG pathways and GO terms, in line with the roles of TPS-b in the biosynthesis of specific scents (mainly monoterpene) in Lauraceae 12,  24. The enrichment analyses showed that the 711 unique Lauraceae gene families are specifically enriched in the KEGG pathways of plant hormone signal transduction and circadian rhythm—plant (Supplementary Table  14) and in the GO terms of regulation of cellular metabolic and organic cyclic compound metabolic processes (Supplementary Table  15). Hormone-related transcriptional factors are over-presented in the unique gene families to Lauraceae, for example, ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5) 25 and ethylene-responsive transcription factor ERF098. Furthermore, the species-specific gene families of  L. cubeba are significantly enriched in the KEGG pathways of biosynthesis of terpenoids and steroids and nitrogen metabolism, and the gene families under significant expansion in  L. cubeba include many members from the ABC transporter C family, which is generally involved in the membrane transport of the secondary metabolism 26 (Supplementary Tables  16– 21). It is interesting to notice that the TPS and ABC transporter members form gene clusters on chromosomes 8 and 12 (Supplementary Fig.  5). The phylogenetic position of Magnoliids among angiosperm Laurales are an order of Magnoliids, whose evolutionary position, mainly with respect to eudicots and monocots, is still the object of contention 10–  13. On the basis of the 160 single-copy gene families derived from 19 eudicots, 8 monocots, 4 Magnoliids, and 3 outgroup species ( Amborella trichopoda,  Ginkgo biloba, and  Anthoceros punctatus), we constructed phylogenetic trees from the concatenated sequence alignments of both nucleotide and amino acids sequences (Fig.  1a, c, left side). In these analyses, Magnoliids were found as a sister group to eudicots after their common ancestor diverged from monocots, which agrees with a previous study using the  C. kanehirae genome 12. To reduce the possibility of long branch attraction in our phylogenetic analysis, we conducted another phylogenomic analysis without Gramineae species and obtained the same topology (Supplementary Figs.  6 and  7). Because incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) may play a role in confounding resolution of early-diverging branches within angiosperms, such as the divergence of Magnoliids, eudicots, and monocots, we further conducted the multi-species coalescent (MSC)-based phylogenomic analyses using ASTRAL 27 by considering each gene tree from the 160 single-copy gene families separately (Fig.  1a, c, right side). The MSC-based phylogeny using nucleotides (Fig.  1a, right side) again supports a sister group relationship between Magnoliids and eudicots, to the exclusion of monocots. However, the MSC-based tree using amino acids (Fig.  1c, right side) suggests Magnoliids to form a sister group with monocots, after their divergence from eudicots. To evaluate the discordance of gene trees in our single-copy gene data set, we used the  Q value in ASTRAL to display the percentages of gene trees in support of the main topology (q1), and the first (q2) and second (q3) alternative topologies 27 (Fig.  1b, d). For example, the majority of gene trees inferred by both nucleotide and amino acid sequences support Amborellales being a sister group to the other angiosperms as the main topology (q1), while there are few gene trees that support either monocots (q2) or eudicots (q3) being the sister group to other angiosperms, respectively (I in Fig.  1b, d). In contrast, the branching order for Magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots displays a high level of discordance among the single-copy gene trees, with two nearly equally supported (and one slightly less supported) topologies in both nucleotide and amino acid sequences-based analyses (II in Fig.  1b-II, d-II). Other discordances among the single-copy gene trees analyzed with ASTRAL concerned the phylogenetic position of  Vitis vinifera28 and the phylogenetic position of  P. americana (left side in Fig.  1b, d). All phylogenomic analyses focusing on Lauraceae species support a sister relationship of  Litsea and  Cinnamomum (right side in Fig.  1b, d). Whole-genome duplications in Laurales Genome collinearity and paralog age distributions all show indications of two ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) events for  L. cubeba. Intragenomic analysis of gene order reveals collinear regions with up to five (but mostly two to four) paralogous segments (Supplementary Table  22 and Supplementary Fig.  8), while age distributions of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site ( KS) for all paralogous genes (paranome), as well as duplicates retained in collinear regions (anchor pairs) both show two signature peaks for WGD events with a recent peak at  KS ≈ 0.5 and a more ancient peak at  KS ≈ 0.8 (Fig.  2a, b). Similarly, previously sequenced genomes (of  C. kanehirae12 and  P. americana14) and transcriptomes (from this study and 1KP 29) of Lauraceae also show two signature peaks in their paranome  KS distributions, except for  Cassytha filiformis (Supplementary Fig.  9), for which only one signature peak could be identified. WGD analyses using the  C. kanehirae genome suggested that the recent WGD in  C. kanehirae is shared by all the Lauraceae species except  C. filiformis, while the ancient WGD seems shared by Laurales and Magnoliales, i.e., the two clades that form a sister group in the Magnoliid clade 12. Also, the analysis of the genome of  L. chinense, another species in the order of Magnoliales, supported a WGD prior to the divergence between Laurales and Magnoliales 8. Our analyses of the transcriptomes of non-Lauraceae Lauralean species, however, found that although some of these species have only one WGD peak in their paranome  KS distributions, others, such as  Peumus boldus,  Laurelia sempervirens,  Gomortega keule, and  Chimonanthus praecox, have two such peaks (Supplementary Fig.  9). Specifically, compared with those in  L. cubeba, the  KS values of the two WGD peaks are larger in  C. praecox and smaller in the other three species, suggesting that the signature peaks in these species may result from either different WGD events or from various substitution rates for duplicates retained following the same WGD events. Indeed, the  KS distributions of one-to-one orthologs identified between  V. vinifera and species from Laurales and Magnoliales show different  KS peaks for the divergence event between  V. vinifera and Magnoliids, indicating different substitution rates within Laurales (Supplementary Fig.  10). In short, our results provide evidence of two WGD events not only in the Lauraceae species but also in some non-Lauraceae species in the Laurales order. To better position the two WGD events identified in the  L. cubeba genome in the lineage of Laurales, we compared the anchor-pair  KS distribution of  L. cubeba with the orthologous  KS distributions (Fig.  2b): (1) between  L. cubeba and  Dehaasia hainanensis,  G. keule, and  C. praecox to represent the divergence of different lineages in Laurales (Fig.  2c); (2) between  L. cubeba and  L. chinense to represent the divergence between Laurales and Magnoliales; and (3) between  L. cubeba and  V. vinifera to represent the divergence between Magnoliids and eudicots. Both the analysis of  KS distributions and relative rate tests to correct for different substitution rates in different species of Laurales (Supplementary Note  2) suggest that the ancient  L. cubeba WGD has occurred shortly before the divergence of Laurales and Magnoliales, while the recent WGD has occurred before the divergence of Lauraceae but closely following the divergence of the lineage including  C. praecox and the lineage including  G. keule (Fig.  2b, c). Some species, such as  L. sempervirens,  G. keule, and  C. praecox, have not experienced the recent WGD identified in  L. cubeba, but also show two signature peaks for WGDs in their paranome  KS distributions (Supplementary Fig.  9). Considering  KS peak values (Supplementary Note  2), we infer independent WGDs in three different lineages of Laurales: one in the lineage leading to  C. praecox and  Idiospermum australiense; one in the lineage leading to  L. sempervirens and  G. keule; and another in the lineage, including Lauraceae,  P. boldus, and possibly  G. americanus (Fig.  2c). Interestingly,  C. filiformis, an obligate parasitic plant in the Lauraceae, and the one with the highest substitution rate in our analysis (Supplementary Fig.  10), show a  KS peak that represents a lineage-specific WGD event after its divergence from other Lauraceae species (Supplementary Fig.  9 and Fig.  2c). However, we propose that  C. filiformis shares the same WGD history as  L. cubeba and the other Lauraceae, but draws a different picture because of its accelerated substitution rate responsible for diminishing the signature peaks for the two WGDs in its paranome  KS distribution. Lauralean species must have experienced rapid radiation over ~3 million years 30. Interestingly, the younger WGD peaks in Laurales seem to coincide with such a period (the right-hand tree in Fig.  2c), which could imply that these WGD events might even have facilitated the rapid radiation of the early Lauralean species. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled that there has been only one WGD event that has occurred shortly before the rapid radiation of Laurales. Under such scenario, our observation of three independent WGDs could be explained by one single WGD that has occurred just before the divergence of Laurales followed by independent diploidizations in the three Lauralean lineages during species radiation, with similarity to the process described in the “lineage-specific ohnologue resolution” model 31. The evolution of floral structures in Lauraceae To investigate the evolution of floral structures in Lauraceae, we first inferred the phylogenetic relationships within Lauraceae using both the concatenated and MSC approaches based on single-copy genes identified from the transcriptomes of 22 species representing 16 genera (Fig.  3a, Supplementary Notes  3 and  4, Supplementary Fig.  11, and Supplementary Table  23). We also obtained a plastid phylogeny based on the reconstructed plastid genomes from 27 species representing 19 genera in Lauraceae (Supplementary Note  5 Supplementary Tables  24 and  25). Phylogenetic trees reconstructed from concatenated sequence alignments had similar topologies than the MSC trees, except for the position of  Lindera and  Laurus (Supplementary Fig.  12). Comparing the nuclear and plastid trees, however, we identified notable differences for some genera in Lauraceae, such as  Lindera,  Laurus,  Nothaphoebe,  Phoebe,  Dehaasia,  Persea, and  Alseodaphne (Supplementary Note  6). ASTRAL analysis also shows phylogenetic discordance among gene trees for the discordant nodes between the nuclear tree and plastid tree (Supplementary Fig.  12), indicating a complicated evolutionary history of Lauraceae. Specifically,  Cryptocarya is the sister group to other Lauraceae species in the plastid tree, while in both the concatenated and MSC trees based on nuclear genes,  Cassytha is a sister to other Lauraceae species. Similar differences have been reported in previous studies 32–  34, at least in our ASTRAL analysis; strong support is given to the sister relationship between  Cassytha and other Lauraceae species with few discordant gene trees with respect to  Cassytha (Supplementary Note  6, Supplementary Fig.  13). Generally, the inflorescences in Lauraceae are panicles, spikes, racemes, pseudo-umbels, and umbels 2. These characteristics of inflorescences are of importance to the classification of the Lauraceae family (Fig.  3b). To investigate the genes that are potentially involved in the evolution of inflorescences, we considered the transcriptomes of flower buds for 21 different species (Supplementary Note  7 and Supplementary Table  26) and phylogeny of Lauraceae inferred by MrBayes 35 were conducted (Fig.  3a). In particular, we focused on the  FUWA genes in 13 genera, because  FUWA has been reported to play an essential role in determining panicle architecture in rice, sorghum, and maize 36. A phylogenetic tree based on the orthologs of FUWA in different Lauraceae species (Supplementary Note  8) seems consistent with the evolution of inflorescences (Fig.  3a, b, and e). The  Cassytha and  Cryptocarya group, which diverged earlier than other Lauraceae lineages, have spike and spikelike panicles, respectively, which are usually referred to as irregular panicles. Subsequently, regular panicles and umbels are present in other Lauraceae species. For example, cymose panicles appear in the  Alseodaphne- Phoebe clade, pseudo-umbels appear in  Sassafras, and umbels appear in the  Litsea- Laurus clade. Consistently, the analyses of domain architectures of the  FUWA gene indicate that the gene contains two conserved NHL domains in the early-diverging lineages of the  Cryptocarya Group and  Cassytha and three NHL domains in other Lauraceae species (Fig.  3e). A similar pattern has also been observed in Lauraceae for involucres. In Lauraceae, genera with panicles and racemes have no involucre, while Sassafras with pseudo-umbels has bracts linear to filamentous, and the  Litsea- Laurus clade with umbels has an obvious involucre. The inflorescences morphological differentiation could be related to the geographic distribution of Lauraceae. The  Cryptocarya Group and  Cassytha are found in the Southern Hemisphere, while the other clades are mainly distributed in the amphi-Pacific or Asian areas. The evolution of perianth tubes in Lauraceae also seems to mirror the phylogeny of Lauraceae (Fig.  3a, c). It has been known that the loss of the trihelix transcription factor PETAL LOSS (PTL) could induce the disruption of perianth development in  Arabidopsis37. Therefore, the differences in  PTL expression in Lauraceae could be consistent with the variations of perianth tubes. Indeed, comparing with the  Litsea- Cinnamomum clade, where the perianth tubes are indistinct, short, and campanulate,  PTL genes from other Lauracea clades exhibit higher level of expression in the flower buds and these species have perianth tubes turbinate or suburceolate (Supplementary Note  9 and Fig.  3c, f). The most recent common ancestor of Laurales was a tree with actinomorphic and bisexual flowers 38. Extant Lauraceae species include both bisexual (dioecious) and unisexual (monoecious) species (Fig.  3d and Supplementary Fig.  1). To identify the genes involved in the sexual determination in Lauraceae, we produced and integrated Illumina transcriptome data for flower buds from 17 species in 10 genera of Lauraceae, including 8 unisexual species in 4 genera and 9 bisexual species in 6 genera (Supplementary Note  7 and Supplementary Table  26). The comparative analyses of the transcriptome data illustrate that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between unisexual and bisexual species are enriched in the KEGG pathway of plant hormone signal transduction. Among these genes,  TGA10 shows obviously higher expression in male flowers from monoecious species than both female flowers from monoecious species and bisexual flowers from dioecious species in Lauraceae (see “Methods,” Supplementary Note  10 and Fig.  3d, g). Our results hence suggest that  TGA10 is involved in male flower development, which is consistent with studies that have found that  TGA10 is required for anther development 39. Moreover, a hypothesized protein (Lcu01G_02292) may also have contributed to sexual determination in Lauraceae, considering their differential expression patterns in bisexual and unisexual flowers in Lauraceae (Supplementary Fig.  14). We also compared the MADS-box genes in the sequenced Lauraceae species and a few other angiosperms (Supplementary Note  11, Supplementary Fig.  15, and Supplementary Table  27). Notably, we found that  SOC1-like genes are expanded in both  L. cubeba (seven members of  SOC1) (Supplementary Table  28) and  C. kanehirae (eight members of  SOC1) 12. Consistent with the expanded  SOC1 clade, the  SVP clade is also expanded and it counts five members in  L. cubeba (Supplementary Fig.  15). It has been reported that the interaction of  SOC1 and  AGL24 from the SVP clade integrates flowering signals in  Arabidopsis40. Both the expanded  SOC1 and  SVP clades could be involved in complex flowering regulation networks and could relate to differential regulation of dioecious plant flowering. Mono-TPS involved in volatiles production in Lauraceae The essential oils produced by Lauraceae are widely used commercially, and contain a variety of components (Supplementary Table  29), such as geranial, neral, limonene, and linalool 7,  12,  19,  20. TPSs are the rate-limiting enzymes in the production of such terpenoids 9,  41 (Fig.  4). The present gene family analysis suggests that the TPS-b gene clade is significantly expanded in Lauraceae (Supplementary Tables  12 and  13). We hence identified all the TPS genes in Lauraceae by combining the data for the  L. cubeba genome and the transcriptome data for 23 species, from 16 genera, in the Lauraceae family (Supplementary Tables  30 and  31). Lauraceae species with a high percentage content of essential oil had larger numbers of TPS-b members (Supplementary Tables  30 and  31), for example,  L. cubeba possessed 24 TPS-b genes in (3–7%, the percentage of essential oil in fresh fruit),  Cinnamomum verum possessed 12 TPS-b genes (1.32–2.13%, the percentage of essential oil in fresh leaves),  Machilus salicina possessed 13 TPS-b genes (1.05%, the percentage of essential oil in fresh leaves), and  P. americana possessed 17 TPS-b genes (1%, the percentage of essential oil in fresh ripe fruit) 14 (Supplementary Tables  30 and  31). We analyzed the first key enzyme in the scent biosynthetic pathway, namely 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), which has three clades (Supplementary Fig.  16). The members in the clade B are expanded across  Litsea,  Beilschmiedia, and  Sassafras (Supplementary Note  12 and Supplementary Fig.  16); as a result, Lauraceae produce high levels of terpenoids.  LcuDXS3-5 belongs to clade B and exhibits very high expression in fruits according to the transcriptome data 42 (Fig.  4). Furthermore, transient overexpression of  LcuDXS3 in  L. cubeba could induce the increase of several components of monoterpene and sesquiterpene (Supplementary Note  12 and Supplementary Fig.  17). To further investigate the members of TPS-b and TPS-g involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, additional expression and functional verification studies were conducted in  L. cubeba. Among the 52 full-length TPS genes in  L. cubeba, 27 were predicted as monoterpene synthase genes, 17 as sesquiterpene synthase genes, and the remaining 8 as diterpene synthase genes (Fig.  4 and Supplementary Tables  32– 34). Tandem duplication (Fig.  5a and Supplementary Fig.  5) events have contributed to the expansion of the TPS-b subfamilies. Both Illumina transcriptome sequencing data (Fig.  4) and qRT-PCR verification showed (Supplementary Fig.  17) that  LcuTPS22 specifically accumulated in leaves. Transient overexpression and enzyme activity assay both demonstrated that LcuTPS22 catalyzed the accumulation of α-pinene, β-pinene, eucalyptol, camphene, eucalyptol, and camphor, which are the main volatile components of the leaves of Lauraceae species (Fig.  5). In addition,  LcuTPS18,  19,  20,  25,  26, and  42 were all highly expressed in the  L. cubeba fruits (Fig.  4 and Supplementary Fig.  17). Transient overexpression and enzyme activity assay also indicated that LcuTPS42 catalyzed the biosynthesis of linalool, phellandrene, and geraniol, which are the main components of the specific scents in Lauraceae (Fig.  5 and Supplementary Fig.  18). Besides the TPS-b gene families, other genes may also function as mediators in scent biosynthesis in  L. cubeba. For example, plant hormone signal transduction enrichment of gene families is unique to Lauraceae; therefore, we investigated the endogenous hormone content and found that abscisic acid (ABA) had a unique peak close to that of the biosynthesized monoterpene in  L. cubeba (Supplementary Fig.  19a). Correspondingly, the treatment of  L. cubeba leaves with ABA induced an increase in both the level of monoterpene (Supplementary Fig.  19b) and the expression of  LcuTPS22 (Supplementary Fig.  19c). In summary, our results provide insights into the candidate genes involved in scent production in the Lauraceae family. Further studies are, however, required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of these genes in the scent biosynthetic pathways in Lauraceae.","The laurel family within the Magnoliids has attracted attentions owing to its scents, variable inflorescences, and controversial phylogenetic position. Here, we present a chromosome-level assembly of the Litsea cubeba genome, together with low-coverage genomic and transcriptomic data for many other Lauraceae. Phylogenomic analyses show phylogenetic discordance at the position of Magnoliids, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting during the divergence of monocots, eudicots, and Magnoliids. An ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) event occurred just before the divergence of Laurales and Magnoliales; subsequently, independent WGDs occurred almost simultaneously in the three Lauralean lineages. The phylogenetic relationships within Lauraceae correspond to the divergence of inflorescences, as evidenced by the phylogeny of FUWA, a conserved gene involved in determining panicle architecture in Lauraceae. Monoterpene synthases responsible for production of specific volatile compounds in Lauraceae are functionally verified. Our work sheds light on the evolution of the Lauraceae, the genetic basis for floral evolution and specific scents.",,"['Supplementary Fig.', 'Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary', 'Supplementary Note', 'Fig.', 'Lauraceae', 'Lauraceae species', 'Table', 'species', 'WGD']","[1370.14 Mb, ×, 1325.69 , 607.34 , 292.17 , 1253.47 Mb, BUSCO, homolog-based, TEs, 1742.4 , TEs, LTR/gypsy, LTR/gypsy, 31,329, 29,262, 30,314, BUSCO, c, ERF098, ABC transporter C, ABC transporter, Magnoliids, single-copy, c, Magnoliids, Magnoliids, ASTRAL, single-copy, c, right side, single-copy, Magnoliids, single-copy, single-copy, WGD, WGD, americana14, 1KP 29, WGD, WGD, WGD, WGD, non-Lauraceae Lauralean, WGD, WGD, WGD, WGD, Magnoliids, Laurales (Supplementary Fig.  , WGD, WGD, Laurales (Supplementary Note, WGD, WGD, WGDs, WGDs, WGD, WGDs, WGD, WGD, WGD, WGDs, WGD, Lauralean, “lineage-specific, ”, single-copy, plastid tree, pseudo-umbels, FUWA, b, pseudo-umbels, pseudo-umbels, Lauracea, “, ”, MADS-box, LcuDXS3-5, LcuDXS3, LcuTPS22, α-pinene, LcuTPS42, abscisic acid, ABA, ABA]","['TPS', '(TPS-b)', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'Mono-TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-g', 'TPS', 'TPS-b', 'LcuTPS22', 'LcuTPS22', 'LcuTPS18,', 'LcuTPS42', 'TPS-b', 'LcuTPS22']","['C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.', 'C.']",[],terpene synthase
119,119,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7192455\eupmc_result.json,PMC7192455,"Results and discussion Identification of TS homologues TSs from different origins show substantial differences in overall primary amino acid sequence, but possess a strongly conserved metal binding domain consisting of an acidic amino acid (AA)-rich motif (D/N) DXX (D/E) or DDXXXE located within 80–120 or 230–270 AA of the N-terminus and an Asn/Ser/Glu triad closer to the C-terminus, which are the signature domains of the class I TS. 2,167 protein sequences out of 73,714 proteins were identified to be TSs and their homologues based on the HMM search as described in the Material and Methods. In a previous study, 262 presumptive bacterial TSs were identified and 27 proteins were functionally characterised in  in vivo conditions [ 37]. Several other bacterial TSs have been characterised and their activities identified with single or multiple substrates [ 24, 28, 36, 38– 41]. In this study, presumptive TS homologue protein sequences were clustered by pairwise similarity, and from the resulting neighbour-joining tree ( Fig 1) we identified TSs from Gram-positive bacteria, mainly from the order  Actinomycetales, as well as Gram-negative bacteria belonging to numerous orders. We annotated 2,167 TSs in the neighbour-joining tree including geosmin synthases, 2-methylisoborneol synthases and several presumptive TSs whose functionality could not be assigned based on their protein sequences ( Fig 1). TSs already identified in the MIBiG database (125 TSs;  https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org) [ 42] were marked when they had e-values of 0 by BLASTp search against the 2,167 HMM hit proteins. Many bacterial strains in the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phylum have TS-like genes, while more than 70% contain the phytoene synthase motif. Enzymes containing this motif are mostly involved in phytoene biosynthesis, a tetra-terpene (C 40) precursor for lycopene biosynthesis. Geosmin synthases and 2-methylisoborneol synthases from bacteria that have been well studied were excluded and presumptive TSs from Actinobacteria and proteobacteria were selected for functional characterization in this study. In total 22 TSs were selected from different clades ( Fig 1) based on one of the following criteria: (i) the sequences contain a single terpene synthase domain (330–350 AA) which belongs to the Isoprenoid Biosynthesis C1 superfamily; (ii) they are from Gram-positive, Gram-negative, thermophilic or thermo-tolerant bacteria; (iii) they are from bacteria that contain other known TSs and have at least 30–40% identity to known TSs but its functionality are not characterized. Functional characterisation of these TSs and identification of their products based on their acyclic allylic diphosphate substrate specificity requires experimental validation which is shown in this work. The 22 potential TSs are selected from the orders of Actinomycetales (Actinobacteria), Burkholderiales (Proteobacteria), Myxococcales (Myxobacteria), Flavobacteriales (Flavobacteria) and Chloroflexales (Terrabacteria). They are: two TSs (AHY47823.1 and AHY45426.1) from the radiation resistant and thermotolerant  Rubrobacter radiotolerans [ 43]; Four TSs (KYF56472.1, CAN96536, KYF59190.1, KYF75876.1) from a prolific secondary metabolite producer  Sorangium sps [ 44]; TS KFG92939.1 from  Burkholderia paludis which was isolated from Southeast Pahang tropical peat swamp forest soil in Malaysia [ 45]; AHH94051.1 from  Kutzneria albida DSM 43870; KPH97530 from  Actinobacteria bacterium OV450; ADU09376.1 from  Micromonospora sp. L5;  geoS (CAB41566.1) from  Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2); ACY98649.1 from an aerobic, cellulolytic, thermophilic Gram-positive bacterium  Thermomonospora curvata [ 46]; EXG82599.1 from  Cryptosporangium arvum DSM 44712; ELQ82238.1 from  Streptomyces rimosus; ABU58787.1 from  Roseiflexus castenholzii DSM 13941; three hypothetical proteins (KFE96946.1, KFF23441.1 and EJL71407.1) from  Chryseobacterium sps [ 47]; two (EST32145.1 and KIZ18902.1) from soil bacteria belonging to  Streptomyces sps; CFM47198.1 from  C.  vrystaatense; KJK55818.1 from  Saccharothrix sp. ST-888 ( Table 1,  S1 Fig). In vitro functional characterization of TSs TS (ADU09376.1, MiGerS) from  Micromonospora sp. L5 incubated with FPP yielded β-elemene, and 8-isopropenyl-1,5-dimethyl-1,5-cyclodecadiene (or also called 1(10),4,11-germacratriene) ( Fig 2G and  S10H Fig and  S10I Fig;  Table 1). The sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, β-elemene, found is most likely an artefact of GC-MS analysis arising from thermal cope rearrangement of germacrene A at elevated temperature [ 57– 59]. Therefore we assumed this synthase produced germacrene A in addition to germacratriene, and was annotated as germacatriene synthase, as germacatriene was the major compound produced. Incubation of the sesquiterpene synthase (10-epi-cubebol synthase; CAN96536.1, ScEpiS) from  Sorangium cellulosum Soce56 with GPP yielded the monoterpene products cis- and trans-β-ocimene, which differ in the position of the isolated double bond, and linalool which was not shown in previous work ( Fig 3C) [ 49]. All three monoterpene products were confirmed using commercial standards ( S11 Fig). When ScEpiS was incubated with FPP the products obtained were 10-epi-α-cubinene, 10-epi-β-cubinene, β-copaene, cadina-3,5-diene, cubebol, γ-cadinene, δ-cadinene, sesquiterpene alcohol 10-epi-cubebol, α-cadinene, 1,10-di-epi-cubenol and cubenol ( Fig 2H). These results confirmed previous observations [ 49] The other minor compounds previously observed: germacrene D, (+)-eremophilene, bicyclogermacrene, T-cadinol, and α-cadinol were not observed due to the solvent extraction method used in this work, instead of sensitive closed loop stripping analysis (CLSA) method used in the previous study. As we have shown in this study, others have observed that heterologous expression of the epi-cubebol synthase from  Streptosporangium roseum in  E.  coli also resulted in the production of β-pinene, β-ocimene (cis- and trans-) and linalool isomers, demonstrating that many sesquiterpene synthases can also accept GPP as substrate [ 60]. Until now, only two bacterial monoterpene synthases linalool synthase (bLinS) and 1,8-cineole synthases (bCinS) from  Streptomyces clavuligerus are well studied [ 61] and structurally characterized [ 6]. Broad substrate spectra have been observed previously for bacterial TSs: spata-13, 17-diene synthase is an enzyme with sesqui-, di-, and sester-terpene synthase activity [ 41], a bLinS from  S.  clavuligerus accepts GPP and FPP [ 23], and incubation of corvol ether B synthase (BAJ27126) from  Kitasatospora setae with GPP yielded linalool as a major product and small amounts of several acyclic and cyclic monoterpenes [ 62]. CFM47198.1, ELQ82238.1, ACY98649.1, EXG82599.1, ABU58787.1, EJL71407.1, KFE96946.1 were tested for compound production with FPP and GPP but no terpenoids were detected. ( S12 Fig) Codon optimized selected TSs were DNA synthesised and cloned into pETM11 with a TEV protease cleavable N-terminal His-tag by GeneArt ( S3 Table). For the heterologous expression of these TSs, the plasmids were transformed into either  E.  coli Bl21 (DE3) or ArcticExpress (DE3) ( S1 Table) and grown in 2xYT media with optimal inducer concentrations to obtain soluble protein. Recombinant proteins were purified using nickel affinity chromatography and subsequently salt and imidazole were removed by a desalting column prior to  in vitro activity assays. Terpenoids resulting from the incubation of the purified recombinant TSs from different bacteria with FPP were extracted using hexane ( Fig 2;  Table 1), while products formed with GPP were extracted using nonane ( Fig 3;  Table 1). Products were identified using authentic standards where possible. Purified recombinant geosmin synthase from  Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) [ 48] and crude extracts with overexpressed limonene synthase from  Mentha spicata (LimS) [ 29] were used as a positive control to validate the  in vitro assays for sesquiterpenoids and monoterpenoids, respectively. As expected, purified geosmin synthase yielded the sesquiterpenoids geosmin, germacradienol and germacrene D in the assay mixture upon incubation with FPP ( S2 Fig and  S3 Fig), whereas the monoterpene limonene was formed when GPP was added to limonene synthase containing crude extracts ( S4 Fig and  S5 Fig). Incubation of a recombinant TS (NCBI accession number AHY47823.1, RrNerS) from the radiation resistant, thermotolerant actinobacterium  Rubrobacter radiotolerans [ 43] with FPP yielded a single product that was identified as trans-nerolidol by GC–QToF analysis ( Fig 2A,  Table 1) and this was further confirmed using standards ( S6 Fig). Incubation with GPP yielded both R- and S- linalool isomers, which were confirmed using standards ( Fig 3A and  S7 Fig,  Table 1). Therefore, this TS was annotated as linalool/nerolidol synthase. Another terpene cyclase homologue, AHY45426 (RrBerS), from  R.  radiotolerans also showed activity with both FPP and GPP, yielding α-bergamotene ( Fig 2B,  S10A Fig,  Table 1) and linalool ( Fig 3B,  S8 Fig,  Table 1) respectively. Therefore, these two TSs are the first to be identified in thermotolerant bacteria,  R.  radiotolerans, which have both mono- and sesqui-terpene synthases activities and are active up to 60°C ( S9 Fig). These thermostable TSs can aid in engineering industrially important TSs to tolerate cultivation at higher temperatures [ 50]. The terpene cyclase (KYF56472.1, ScAroS) from the soil-dwelling Gram-negative bacterium  Sorangium cellulosum converted FPP into only aromadendrene in  in vitro analysis ( Fig 2C and  S10B Fig;  Table 1). Aromadendrene is mostly observed in eucalyptus oil and is also produced by a citrus TS,  CsSesquiTPS5 [ 51] and it has been shown to have antibacterial activity to multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria [ 52]. KYF56472.1 was therefore named aromandendrene synthase. The sesquiterpene cyclase (KFG92939, BpLonS) from  Burkholderia paludis was incubated with FPP to yield two sesquiterpenoids, (±)-cadinene and longiborneol ( Fig 2D and  S10C Fig and  S10D Fig;  Table 1) and was therefore assigned as longiborneol synthase. Incubation with GPP did not yield any observable products. Longiborneol synthases are mostly found in fungi [ 53] and Norway spruce [ 54]. Fusarium uses longiborneol as a precursor for producing the tricyclic mycotoxin culmorin [ 55]. This enzyme from  B.  paludis is the first bacterial longiborneol synthase identified. AHH94051.1 (KaGerS ) from  Kutzneria albida DSM 43870 has 50% identity to germacradienol/ geosmin synthase (fragment) and we tested its functionality with FPP in  in vitro conditions. This yielded germacradienol and germacrene D ( Fig 2E and  S10E Fig;  Table 1) and did not yield any monoterpenes when incubated with GPP. Production of germacradienol was confirmed by comparison to spectra published by Agger et al (2008) [ 56]. The hypothetical protein 450_5823 (KPH97530.1, AbAcoS) from  Actinobacteria bacterium OV450 converted FPP into copaene and acora-3,7(14)-diene ( Fig 2F and  S10F Fig and  S10G Fig;  Table 1), while incubation with GPP did not yield any products. KPH97530.1 was annotated as acoradiene synthase based on its product formation. In vivo production of mono- and sesqui-terpenoids by enhancing MVA pathway precursor supply To quantify the  in vivo product formation, all identified TSs were cloned into the pBbB2a-GPPS (as described in material and methods) backbone plasmid and co-expressed with pMVA plasmid in  E.  coli [ 7] and FPP is supplied via endogenous IspA activity [ 63]. Cultures were overlaid with nonane to extract the metabolites and analysed by GC-QToF. RrNerS produced monoterpenes β-myrcene, linalool, cis-geraniol; and sesquiterpenes: (±)-trans-nerolidol, α/β-farnesene and farnesol in  in vivo conditions ( Fig 4A) whereas its homologue RrBerS yielded monoterpenes β-myrcene, linalool, trans-geraniol and trans-α-bergamotene, α/β-farnesene, (±)-trans-nerolidol, farnesol ( Fig 4B).  MiGerS from  Micromonospora sp. L5 expressed in  E.  coli produced germacrene A and 1,(10),4,11-germacratriene as seen in the  in vitro assays ( Fig 4C). ScAroS and ScEpiS both from  Sorangium, produced similar mono-terpenoids, which are β-pinene, cis- and trans-ocimene, and linalool ( Fig 4D and  Fig 4E). However they produce different sesquiterpenes in both  in vitro and  in vivo conditions: aromandendrene is produced by ScAroS whereas 10-epi-α/β-cubinene, β-copaene, cadina-3,5-diene, cubebol, δ/γ-cadinene and 10-epi-cubebol are produced by CAN96536 ( Fig 4D and  Fig 4F). KaGerS from  Kutzneria albida DSM 43870 produced germacrene D and germacrenedienol ( Fig 4G). Overexpression of hypothetical protein ELQ82238.1 (SrGuaS) from  Streptomyces rimosus produced multiple sesquiterpenes: guaia-1(10)11-diene and (+)-γ-gurjunene when expressed in  E.  coli ( Fig 4H,  S14A Fig and  S14B Fig). Whereas ACY98649.1 (TcCubS) from  Thermomonospora curvata DSM 43183 ( Fig 4I,  S14C Fig) and EXG82599.1 (CaCubS) from  Cryptosporangium arvum DSM 44712 ( Fig 4J,  S14D Fig) produced minor amounts of cubebol in  E.  coli. Terpene synthases may produce different terpene skeletons when expressed natively or in heterologous host compared to their product biosynthesis in  in vitro conditions due to variations in protein folding and assay conditions [ 64]. Geosmin synthase from  Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) when expressed in  E.  coli produced various monoterpenes: β-myrcene, β-ocimene, linalool and geraniol ( S13 Fig) which was unexpected and unexplored for this enzyme as well as the sesquiterpenes: germacradienol, germacrene D but geosmin was not detected, presumably due to inactivity of the C- terminal a-domain in  in vivo ( S13 Fig). In vivo production of possible diterpenes For diterpene synthase activity, the substrate GGPP was synthesized in house but due to its hydrophobic nature the substrate was insoluble in aqueous solution and could not be used in  in vitro enzyme assays. For rapid identification of diterpene synthase activity it is essential to generate abundant amounts of GGPP for  in vivo production in  E.  coli. For this purpose, the native farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase ( ispA) from  E.  coli with two mutations D2G, C155G ( ispAM22), which can function as geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase [ 65], was employed to generate GGPP  in vivo. GGPP synthase activity using the variant prenyltransferase was confirmed by overexpression of spata-13, 17-diene synthase from  Streptomyces xinghaiensis [ 41] together with GGPP synthase ( ispAM22). This yielded the diterpene spata-13,17-diene, where the produced compound was extracted using a nonane layer ( S15 Fig). ABU58787.1 (RcDTPS ) from  Roseiflexus castenholzii DSM 13941 ( Fig 5A,  S16 Fig), EJL71407.1 (CsDTPS) from  Chryseobacterium sp. CF314 ( Fig 5B,  S17 Fig, and KFE96946 (ClDTPS) from  Chryseobacterium luteum ( Fig 5C and  S18 Fig) produced various possible diterpene products when expressed together with  ispAM22 in  E.  coli DH5α. Due to low product yields, the detected compounds could not be annotated by a NIST library search alone. By co-expressing the heterologous MVA pathway, the precursor supply for diterpene, production was enhanced which led to a 10-fold increased production. However, this was still not enough to determine the compounds produced. Large scale production and purification of the diterpenes would be required for structural determination by NMR analysis. In this study, we identified 15 putative bacterial TSs out of 22 that were tested, which produced structurally diverse mono-, sesqui- and di-terpenoids by  in vitro and/or  in vivo assays. We have shown TSs with new activity: 7 sesqui-terpenoid synthases, 3 di-terpenoid synthases and 5 mono-/sesqui-terpenoid synthases which were identified from Gram-positive, Gram-negative and thermophilic tolerant bacterial species. Many sesquiterpene synthases were shown to also have activity as a monoterpene synthase, which suggests that dual substrate specificity is very common for bacterial TSs. In vivo production of all types of terpenoids by  E.  coli makes an attractive platform for rapid identification of enzymes as well as for better and cheaper production yields through metabolic engineering. Especially the newly discovered TSs from the thermophilic/tolerant bacterial species is very promising for further protein evolution studies to design the end terpene product, which we have started [ 50] and to exploit the enzyme stability at higher temperatures. In addition, production of diterpenoids in  E.  coli as an alternative screening method to  in vitro assays is useful due to the difficulties with solubility of GGPP. The results presented in this study suggest that further exploration of putative TSs from different bacteria along with Actinomycetes could expand the structural plethora of terpenes. The majority of the terpene products identified in this study are known to be produced by plant or fungi and reveals that TSs are widely distributed in bacteria. Given the number of uncharacterized bacterial enzymes that exist in nature, it is likely that there remains a wealth of chemistry to be discovered and exploited. Expanding the search for novel terpenoid biosynthesis will provide numerous structures with unexplored properties that could potentially help to develop novel compounds for pharmacological or industrial applications.","Terpenes are the largest class of natural products with extensive structural diversity and are widely used as pharmaceuticals, herbicides, flavourings, fragrances, and biofuels. While they have mostly been isolated from plants and fungi, the availability and analysis of bacterial genome sequence data indicates that bacteria also possess many putative terpene synthase genes. In this study, we further explore this potential for terpene synthase activity in bacteria. Twenty two potential class I terpene synthase genes (TSs) were selected to represent the full sequence diversity of bacterial synthase candidates and recombinantly expressed in E. coli. Terpene synthase activity was detected for 15 of these enzymes, and included mono-, sesqui- and diterpene synthase activities. A number of confirmed sesquiterpene synthases also exhibited promiscuous monoterpene synthase activity, suggesting that bacteria are potentially a richer source of monoterpene synthase activity then previously assumed. Several terpenoid products not previously detected in bacteria were identified, including aromandendrene, acora-3,7(14)-diene and longiborneol. Overall, we have identified promiscuous terpene synthases in bacteria and demonstrated that terpene synthases with substrate promiscuity are widely distributed in nature, forming a rich resource for engineering terpene biosynthetic pathways for biotechnology.",,"['Fig', 'TSs', 'synthase', 'Table', 'FPP', 'GPP', 'synthases', 'produced', 'amino acid', 'Glu triad']","[80–120, 230–270 AA, Asn/Ser/Glu, class I TS, 73,714, TSs, TSs, TSs, 38– 41], TSs, TSs, TSs, MIBiG, TSs, TSs, TSs, C1, TSs, 30–40, TSs, TSs, TSs, TSs (, AHY47823.1, AHY45426.1, TSs, CAN96536, KYF59190.1, KYF75876.1, KFG92939.1, AHH94051.1, KPH97530, OV450, ADU09376.1, CAB41566.1, ACY98649.1, EXG82599.1, ELQ82238.1, ABU58787.1, KFE96946.1, KFF23441.1, EJL71407.1, EST32145.1, KIZ18902.1, CFM47198.1, KJK55818.1, TSs TS, ADU09376.1, MiGerS, β-elemene, germacatriene synthase, CAN96536.1, ScEpiS, Soce56, ScEpiS, α-cadinol, epi-cubebol synthase, β-pinene, bLinS, TSs, spata-13, sester-terpene synthase, bLinS, FPP [ 23], corvol ether B synthase, CFM47198.1, ELQ82238.1, ACY98649.1, EXG82599.1, ABU58787.1, EJL71407.1, KFE96946.1, S12, TSs, GeneArt ( S3 Table, TSs, ArcticExpress, LimS, S2, AHY47823.1, RrNerS, GC–, R-, TS, linalool/nerolidol synthase, AHY45426, RrBerS, TSs, °C, TSs, TSs, ScAroS, KYF56472.1, KFG92939, BpLonS, AHH94051.1, KaGerS, germacradienol/ geosmin synthase, germacradienol, KPH97530.1, AbAcoS, OV450, KPH97530.1, sesqui-terpenoids, TSs, pBbB2a-GPPS, pMVA, cis-geraniol, (±)-trans-nerolidol, α/β-farnesene, RrBerS, α/β-farnesene, (±)-trans-nerolidol, ScAroS, ScEpiS, mono-terpenoids, ScAroS, CAN96536, 4F, KaGerS, germacrenedienol, SrGuaS, ACY98649.1, TcCubS, EXG82599.1, CaCubS, S13, germacradienol, C- terminal a-domain, S13, GGPP, GGPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, D2G, C155G, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase [ 65], GGPP  , GGPP, prenyltransferase, spata-13, GGPP synthase, spata-13,17-diene, S15, EJL71407.1, CsDTPS, CF314, KFE96946 (ClDTPS, TSs, di-terpenoids, TSs, TSs, GGPP]","['CsSesquiTPS5', '(RcDTPS', '(CsDTPS)', '(ClDTPS)']",['C.'],[],terpene synthase
125,125,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7293187\eupmc_result.json,PMC7293187,"Results D-borneol quantitative determination in three chemotypes of  C. burmanni In previous work, we collected three different chemotypes (HBT, LBT, BFT) of  C. burmannii exhibiting similar morphology ( Figs. 2A– 2C). These chemotypes possessed high, low and absent levels of D-borneol, respectively. Here, we used a GC/MS method to analyze the composition of volatile oil in these  C. burmannii samples ( Figs. 2D– 2J). A total of 28 compounds were detected in the three chemotype samples, of which nine were common to all three. D-borneol was the most abundant component of the volatile terpenoids in both HBT and LBT groups, accounting for 42.23% and 57.26%, respectively. In the BFT group, the main component was cymene, accounting for 27.44% of the volatile terpenoids ( Figs. 2K– 2N,  Data S3– S4). Transcriptome analysis To identify genes related to the biosynthesis of D-borneol, we performed deep transcriptome sequencing of the three  C. burmanni chemotypes using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. In total, 21.21 Gb of clean sequence data with GC content of 47.55% was obtained from all samples after filtering and removing adapter sequences from the raw data: 8.40 Gb from the HBT group, 6.39 Gb from the LBT group and 6.42 Gb from the BFT group. Raw data and quality control data statistics are summarized in  Table 1. All RNA-Seq raw data has been submitted to CNGBdb with accession number  CNP0000810. For further analysis, high-quality clean reads were assembled using the TRINITY program, resulting in 142,673 transcripts and 100,218 unigenes with N50 of 1,625 bp and 1,128 bp and average length of 935 bp and 713 bp, respectively. The majority of the reads for both transcripts and unigenes were shorter than 1,000 bp in length, accounting for 92% and 88%, respectively. Only 2% of the transcripts and 3% of the unigenes were longer than 2,000 bp in length. All assembled data are summarized in  Table 2 and  Fig. 3A. Moreover, 80.80% of the clean reads were perfectly mapped to the assembled unigenes by RSEM, indicating that these mapped genes were of high quality and could be used to conduct the subsequent analysis ( Table 1). Sequence of the 100,218 unigenes were shown in  Data S5. All resulting 100,218 unigenes were used for BLAST searches against the GO, KEGG, NR, Pfam and Swiss-Prot databases for annotation, resulting in 28,798, 15,376, 44,495, 28,107 and 24,238 annotated unigenes for the above database, respectively ( Fig. 3B,  Data S6). In total, 45,485 unigenes were annotated to at least one database, and 9,730 unigenes shared annotation in all five databases ( Fig. 3C). The species distribution of the annotated unigenes is shown in  Fig. 3D. Identification of DEGs A total of 8,860 DEGs were identified among the comparison groups. The expression patterns of these DEGs could be classified into four clusters ( Figs. 3E– 3F,  Data S7). Cluster 1 consisted of 2,600 genes significantly down-regulated in the LBT group in comparison with both the HBT and BFT groups. Cluster 2 exhibited the opposite expression pattern to that of cluster 1, containing 3,721 unigenes that were particularly up-regulated in the LBT group in comparison to both the HBT and BFT groups. Cluster 3 contained 2,539 unigenes significantly up-regulated in the BFT group in comparison to both the HBT and LBT groups. Ten genes significantly down-regulated in the BFT group in comparison to both the HBT and LBT groups formed cluster 4. We used a Wayne diagram ( Fig. 3G) to show the number of DEGs between each group. There were 3,140 up-regulated unigenes and 3,643 down-regulated unigenes in the HBT vs LBT comparison. In the HBT vs BFT comparison, we identified 1,303 up-regulated unigenes and 924 down-regulated unigenes. In the LBT vs BFT comparison, 3,902 unigenes were up-regulated while 2,357 unigenes were down-regulated ( Fig. 3H). To gain a deep understanding of the biological functions of these 8,860 DEGs, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. We used dot plots to show the top 20 most enriched KEGG pathway categories with  p value <0.05, which indicated that the top three most enriched KEGG pathways were “cutin, suberin and wax biosynthesis,” “vancomycin resistance” and “fatty acid degradation” ( Fig. 4A,  Data S8). The top 10 most enriched GO terms under the three general sections Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC) and Molecular Function (MF) are summarized in  Fig. 4B and  Data S9. The most enriched GO term in the MF category was protein serine/threonine kinase activity. Within the CC category, the most abundant GO term was chloroplast. In the BP category, the most associated term was protein phosphorylation. In addition, terpene synthase activity was also significantly enriched. Mining of candidate genes related to D-borneol biosynthesis Monoterpenes derived from plants are biosynthesized in the plastid through the MEP pathway. We detected 30 unigenes involved in the MEP pathway, but only three of them exhibited significantly different expression levels among the three comparison groups. Most of the unigenes (11/30), including one DEG, were annotated as  DXS genes, which encode the first rate-limiting enzyme in the MEP pathway. Relatively higher expression of the  DXS gene in the HBT group compared to that in the other two groups might contribute to the differences in D-borneol accumulation in  C. burmannii. Six unigenes were annotated as encoding GPPS, responsible for GPP formation. It is well known that GPPSs exist as homomeric and heteromeric structures in plants ( Burke, Klettke & Wise, 2004;  Rai et al., 2013;  Wang & Dixon, 2009;  Yin et al., 2017) and that plants contain multiple GGPPS or GGPPS-related enzymes, some functioning as large or small subunits (LSU/SSU) of heteromeric GPPS ( Tholl et al., 2004;  Wang & Dixon, 2009). For example, there are 12 GGPPS paralogs in the Arabidopsis genome ( Beck et al., 2013;  Lange & Ghassemian, 2003); however, AtGPPS11 and AtGGPPS12 were characterized as LSU and SSU, with their interaction involved in monoterpene biosynthesis in Arabidopsis flowers ( Chen, Fan & Wang, 2015). To confirm whether the  C. burmannii GPPSs formed homomeric or heteromeric structures, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of seven KEGG-annotated CbGPPS/GGPPS proteins from  C. burmannii and the amino acid sequences of other characterized GPPS/GGPPS proteins. We identified six GPPSs, including two putative homomeric GPPSs, three putative GPPS.SSUs and a putative GPPS.LSU. Only one unigene might encode a GGPPS ( Fig. S1). It has been reported that monoterpene biosynthesis in gymnosperms is mainly regulated by homomeric GPPS and SSUs of heteromeric GPPS ( Schmidt et al., 2010;  Tholl et al., 2004). The 2 putative homomeric GPPSs, 3 putative GPPS.SSUs identified in this study may provide a possible explanation for the monoterpene richness of  C. burmanni. There were 40 unigenes annotated as  TPS by KEGG, among which 11 were associated with the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathway (ko00904), eight were monoterpenoid synthase unigenes (ko00902) and 21 encoded diterpenoid synthase (ko00909). Since D-borneol is a monoterpene, the eight putative monoterpenoid synthase genes were selected for further analysis. The expression patterns of these eight unigenes encoding monoterpenoid synthase, along with those of genes related to the MEP metabolic pathway (Ko00900), were normalized and shown in  Figs. 5A– 5B and  Data S10. Considering the relatively high accumulation of D-borneol in the HBT group compared to the other two groups, we rationalized that metabolism-related genes might exhibit more activity in the HBT group than in the other two groups. Inspiringly, two unigenes encoding monoterpenoid synthase (designated  CbTPS2 and  CbTPS3) were significantly up-regulated in the HBT group compared with the LBT and BFT groups ( Data S11). Furthermore, both unigenes had complete open reading frames. Sequence comparison using BLAST indicated that  CbTPS2 (c122670.graph_c0) exhibited highest similarity [53.27% amino acid (aa) sequence identity] to an (E)-beta-ocimene/myrcene synthase (ADR74206.1) from  Vitis vinifera, while  CbTPS3 (c129067.graph_c0) presented similarity in aa sequence with a S-(+)-linalool synthase (RVW86370.1) from  Vitis vinifera ( Martin et al., 2010). These two candidate  TPS genes were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis, along with other  TPS genes that have been functionally characterized. Similar to other well-characterized  BPPS genes,  CbTPS2 fell within the TPS-b subfamily ( Fig. S2). Furthermore, sequence alignment showed that  CbTPS2 had conserved mono-TPS domains, including RRX8W, RXR, DDXXD and (N,D) D (L,I,V) X (S,T) XXE (NSE/DTE) ( Fig. S3). To find out whether the candidate unigenes differed between each chemotype, the transcriptomes of the three groups were assembled separately, and the sequences were compared. The assembled sequences of each chemotypes were shown in  Data S6– S14. The amino acid sequences of CbTPS2 in the three different  C. burmannii chemotypes differed only by two amino acids, and these sites were not located within the conserved domain, suggesting that these differences may not affect the function of these proteins ( Fig. S4). However, it is interesting that the complete sequence of CbTPS3 could only be found in the HBT and LBT groups, whereas only a small fragment was found in the BFT group ( Fig. S5). This may be due to poor assembly of the BFT transcriptome, or perhaps  CbTPS3 is a pseudogene in BFT. We speculated that  CbTPS2 and  CbTPS3 are probably candidate genes responsible for the biosynthesis of D-borneol in  C. burmannii. Mining of candidate transcription factors related to D-borneol accumulation Transcription factors play an important role in regulating the biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites ( Hong et al., 2012). In our transcriptome analysis, we identified 1,108 transcription factors, which could be assigned to 47 families ( Data S15). Several TF families, including MYB, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), WRKY, basic region/leucine zipper motif (bZIP) and APETALA2/ethylene-response factor (AP2/ERF) families, function in regulating the structural genes involved in monoterpenoid biosynthesis ( Su et al., 2019). These five TF families cover most of the TFs identified in this study ( Fig. 5C). We identified 116 MYB, 65 AP2/ERF, 63 BHLH, 60 bZIP and 47 WRKY candidate genes, among which 35 MYB, 27 AP2/ERF, 24 BHLH, 10 bZIP and 9 WRKY genes were classified as DEGs ( Figs. 5D– 5H,  Data S16). Notably, one WRKY (c122191.graph.c0), two BHLH (c117041.graph.c0, c127743.graph.c0), one AP2/ERF (c130684.graph.c1) and three MYB candidate genes (c68268.graph.c0, c120253. graph.c0, c123637.graph.c0) were significantly up-regulated in both the HBT and LBT groups compared to the BFT group. The different transcription factor expression patterns might be responsible for regulating monoterpenoid biosynthesis. Moreover, the up-regulated transcription factors in the HBT and LBT groups compared to the BFT group provide us with a candidate TF pool related to the biosynthesis and accumulation of D-borneol. Validation of DEGs using Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) To verify the accuracy of RNA-Seq data, we performed expression level analysis on nine unigenes related to the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway and six candidate transcription factors related to D-borneol accumulation using the qRT-PCR method. As shown in  Fig. 6, their expression patterns were similar to those revealed from RNA-Seq data. Thus, these results help confirm the reliability of the transcriptomic analysis."," Background Dextrorotatory borneol (D-borneol), a cyclic monoterpene, is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine as an efficient topical analgesic drug. Fresh leaves of  Cinnamomum  trees, e.g.,  C. burmannii  and  C. camphor , are the main sources from which D-borneol is extracted by steam distillation, yet with low yields. Insufficient supply of D-borneol has hampered its clinical use and production of patent remedies for a long time. Biological synthesis of D-borneol offers an additional approach; however, mechanisms of D-borneol biosynthesis remain mostly unresolved. Hence, it is important and necessary to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of D-borneol. Results Comparative analysis on the gene expression patterns of different D-borneol production  C. burmannii  samples facilitates elucidation on the underlying biosynthetic pathway of D-borneol. Herein, we collected three different chemotypes of  C. burmannii , which harbor different contents of D-borneol.A total of 100,218 unigenes with an N50 of 1,128 bp were assembled de novo using Trinity from a total of 21.21 Gb clean bases. We used BLASTx analysis against several public databases to annotate 45,485 unigenes (45.38%) to at least one database, among which 82 unigenes were assigned to terpenoid biosynthesis pathways by KEGG annotation. In addition, we defined 8,860 unigenes as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), among which 13 DEGs were associated with terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. One 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and two monoterpene synthase, designated as  CbDXS9 ,  CbTPS2  and  CbTPS3 , were up-regulated in the high-borneol group compared to the low-borneol and borneol-free groups, and might be vital to biosynthesis of D-borneol in  C. burmannii.  In addition, we identified one WRKY, two BHLH, one AP2/ERF and three MYB candidate genes, which exhibited the same expression patterns as  CbTPS2  and  CbTPS3 , suggesting that these transcription factors might potentially regulate D-borneol biosynthesis. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR was conducted to detect the actual expression level of those candidate genes related to the D-borneol biosynthesis pathway, and the result showed that the expression patterns of the candidate genes related to D-borneol biosynthesis were basically consistent with those revealed by transcriptome analysis. Conclusions We used transcriptome sequencing to analyze three different chemotypes of  C. burmannii , identifying three candidate structural genes (one DXS, two monoterpene synthases) and seven potential transcription factor candidates (one WRKY, two BHLH, one AP2/ERF and three MYB) involved in D-borneol biosynthesis. These results provide new insight into our understanding of the production and accumulation of D-borneol in  C. burmannii .","['Biosynthesis', 'Monoterpene', 'Transcriptome', 'transcriptional factors', 'Terpene synthase', 'Terpene', 'Bpps', 'Tianran Bingpian', 'C.

130,130,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7417412\eupmc_result.json,PMC7417412,"Results Most of the  TPS-a genes in the Poaceae belong to five well-defined clades In order to identify  TPS-a genes from the Poaceae, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of terpene synthase genes that were extracted using BLASTP analysis from six grass species, including  Zea mays,  Sorghum bicolor,  Setaria italica,  Panicum virgatum,  Oryza sativa, and  Brachypodium distachyon, and a number of other monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species available in the NCBI database and the Phytozome 9.1 database (Supplemental Figure S1). In accordance with the literature (Chen et al.  2011), all obtained  TPS genes clustered into one of the established TPS subfamilies  TPS-a,  TPS-b,  TPS-c,  TPS-e,  TPS-f, and  TPS-g. The  TPS-a genes formed two groups, one containing genes from dicotyledonous species and the other containing genes of monocotyledonous species (Supplemental Figure S1, Chen et al.  2011). A deeper dendrogram analysis of the identified monocotyledonous  TPS-a genes revealed five well-defined monophyletic clades, I–V, each of which possessed exclusively  TPS-a genes from the Poaceae (Fig.  1). Two genes from  P.  virgatum were similar to clade IV and clade V sequences, but clustered separately. Four other Poaceae  TPS-a genes, from rice, sorghum, and bamboo, were found to form a very basal clade among the monocotyledonous  TPS-a subfamily, while  TPS genes from families outside the Poaceae clustered separately from the five Poaceae clades (Fig.  1). The Poaceae  TPS-a genes in clades I–V encode enzymes with distinct catalytic features A literature survey of the properties of the Poaceae  TPS-a encoded enzymes characterized to date revealed that clades I–V have distinctive catalytic features (Table  1). All previously characterized clade I enzymes are sesquiterpene synthases that accept ( E, E)-FPP as substrate and, with two exceptions, catalyze an initial C10-C1 or C11-C1 closure (Fig.  2). All characterized clade II enzymes are also sesquiterpene synthases, but produce either acyclic terpenes or cyclic terpenes derived from an initial C6-C1 closure. In contrast to the sesquiterpene synthases of clades I and II, characterized clade III enzymes mainly accept GPP as substrate and produce monoterpenes derived from an initial C6-C1 closure (Fig.  2). Moreover, most of the clade III sequences are predicted to contain a transit peptide for plastid localization, indicating that these enzymes likely function as monoterpene synthases in planta. The terpene synthases in clades IV and V, however, are diverse in terms of substrate specificity and initial cyclization reaction. The characterized enzymes in these clades form monoterpenes or sesquiterpenes, and catalyze initial C6-C1, C10-C1, or C11-C1 closures (Table  1). Characterization of TPS-a enzymes from maize and  Brachypodium distachyon To provide more information about the differences among these Poaceae  TPS-a clades, we characterized three previously unstudied  TPS-a genes from maize and two  TPS-a genes from  B.  distachyon, a species from which no TPS has been characterized so far. The selected terpene synthases belong to clade I (maize ZmTPS20-Del and ZmTPS22-Del,  B.  distachyon Bradi3g14710), clade II ( B.  distachyon Bradi3g15956), and clade III (maize ZmTPS15-B73). Genes were cloned and heterologously expressed in  E.  coli, and partially purified proteins were incubated with the potential substrates GPP and ( E, E)-FPP in the presence of 10 mM Mg 2+ as cofactor. Enzyme products were analyzed using GC–MS. The three clade I enzymes ZmTPS20-Del, ZmTPS22-Del, and Bradi3g14710 showed exclusively sesquiterpene synthase activity and produced sesquiterpenes derived by either an initial C10-C1 closure or an initial C11-C1 closure, corresponding to the properties of clade I enzymes in the literature. ZmTPS20-Del produced mainly germacrene A (C10-C1 closure), which appeared as the thermal rearrangement product β-elemene in the traces of the GC chromatograms (Fig.  3; Supplemental Figure S2). ZmTPS22-Del produced a complex mixture of sesquiterpenes with the bicyclic β-copaene (C10-C1 closure) as the major component (Fig.  3). In contrast to ZmTPS20-Del and ZmTPS22-Del, Bradi3g14710 had higher product specificity and formed ( E)-β-caryophyllene (C11-C1 closure) with trace amounts of α-humulene and germacrene A (Fig.  3). Monoterpene synthase activity with GPP was not observed for any of the three enzymes. The clade II enzyme Bradi3g15956 converted ( E, E)-FPP into β-macrocarpene and γ-macrocarpene, two bicyclic sesquiterpenes both derived by an initial C6-C1-closure (Fig.  3). GPP, however, was not accepted by Bradi3g15956 as substrate. Maize ZmTPS15-B73 showed no activity when provided with ( E, E)-FPP. However, it converted GPP into a mixture of monoterpenes dominated by the bicyclic alcohol 1,8-cineole (C6-C1 closure) (Fig.  3). Subcellular localization prediction using three different algorithms revealed the presence of an N-terminal transit peptide for plastid localization (Supplemental Figure S3), indicating that ZmTPS15-B73 likely acts as a monoterpene synthase in maize plastids. The reconstruction and characterization of TPS-a ancestor enzymes Most of the enzymes in clades I–III share clade-specific catalytic features, catalyzing either a common initial cyclization or having the same substrate specificity (Table  1; Fig.  2). To test whether these features were already pronounced in the ancestors of the different clades, we reconstructed the respective ancestor sequences, expressed the synthesized genes in  E.  coli, and tested the recombinant enzymes obtained with GPP and ( E, E)-FPP. The putative clade I ancestor showed only sesquiterpene synthase activity and produced mainly germacrene A (C10-C1) and ( E)-β-caryophyllene (C11-C1) (Figs.  2 and  4, Supplemental Figure S2). The putative clade II ancestor accepted both GPP and ( E, E)-FPP as substrate and produced mixtures of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. While the monoterpene blend was dominated by the acyclic myrcene, the major sesquiterpenes were identified as β-bisabolene and ( E)-γ-bisabolene, which are both formed via an initial C6-C1 closure (Figs.  2 and  4). In contrast to the putative ancestors of clade I and clade II, the clade III ancestor, which was expressed without the N-terminal signal peptide, possessed exclusively monoterpene synthase activity and produced the cyclic limonene (C6-C1) as its major product (Figs.  2 and  4)."," Key message Distinct catalytic features of the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily arose early in grass evolution and the reactions catalyzed have become more complex with time. The structural diversity of terpenes found in nature is mainly determined by terpene synthases (TPS). TPS enzymes accept ubiquitous prenyl diphosphates as substrates and convert them into the various terpene skeletons by catalyzing a carbocation-driven reaction. Based on their sequence similarity, terpene synthases from land plants can be divided into different subfamilies, TPS-a to TPS-h. In this study, we aimed to understand the evolution and functional diversification of the TPS-a subfamily in the Poaceae (the grass family), a plant family that contains important crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum. Sequence comparisons showed that aside from one clade shared with other monocot plants, the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily consists of five well-defined clades I-V, the common ancestor of which probably originated very early in the evolution of the grasses. A survey of the TPS literature and the characterization of representative TPS enzymes from clades I-III revealed clade-specific substrate and product specificities. The enzymes in both clade I and II function as sesquiterpene synthases with clade I enzymes catalyzing initial C10-C1 or C11-C1 ring closures and clade II enzymes catalyzing C6-C1 closures. The enzymes of clade III mainly act as monoterpene synthases, forming cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes. The reconstruction and characterization of clade ancestors demonstrated that the differences among clades I-III were already present in their ancestors. However, the ancestors generally catalyzed simpler reactions with less double-bond isomerization and fewer cyclization steps. Overall, our data indicate an early origin of key enzymatic features of TPS-a enzymes in the Poaceae, and the development of more complex reactions over the course of evolution.","['Evolution', 'Maize', 'Grasses', 'Terpene synthase', 'Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction']","['TPS-a genes', 'Poaceae TPS-a', 'genes', 'clade', 'Supplemental Figure', 'NCBI database', 'Fig.', 'Poaceae', 'TPS-a', 'clade III']","[Phytozome 9.1 database (, I–V, I–V, I–V, E, E)-FPP, C10-C1, C11-C1, V, C10-C1, C11-C1, TPS-a enzymes, ZmTPS22-Del, Bradi3g14710, clade III, E, E)-FPP, Mg 2, ZmTPS22-Del, Bradi3g14710, C10-C1, ZmTPS22-Del, C10-C1, ZmTPS20-Del, ZmTPS22-Del, Bradi3g14710, C11-C1, E, E)-FPP, E, E)-FPP, ZmTPS15-B73, TPS-a ancestor, E, E)-FPP, C10-C1, C11-C1, E, E)-FPP, N-terminal signal peptide]","['TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS-e,', 'TPS-f,', 'TPS-g.', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS', 'ZmTPS20-Del', 'ZmTPS22-Del,', 'ZmTPS15-B73).', 'ZmTPS20-Del,', 'ZmTPS22-Del,', 'ZmTPS20-Del', 'ZmTPS22-Del', 'ZmTPS20-Del', 'ZmTPS22-Del,', 'ZmTPS15-B73', 'ZmTPS15-B73', 'TPS-a']",[],[],terpene synthase

TF Genes in the Cucumber Genome Based on the annotated set of genes predicted from the cucumber genome ( http://www.icugi.org/cgi-bin/ICuGI/index.cgi), 1212 genes with a putative TF function of different classes were retrieved ( Figure 1). Half of all TF genes belong to only four different TF gene families, i.e., MYB (189), bHLH (149), AP2/ERF (143) and C2H2 zinc fingers (131). Furthermore, among the 1212 TF genes there are 84 genes encoding NAC domain proteins, 73 genes encoding bZIP (basic-leucine zipper domain) proteins and 67 genes encoding WRKYs. In addition, there are 10 TF gene families with less than 50 members each, including MADS (41 genes), GRAS (37 genes), WTHT (33 genes), TCP (27 genes), GATA (26 genes), NF-Y (26 genes), ZF-TF (22 genes), ARF (20 genes), HOX (17 genes) and 99 putative TFs that do not belong to any of the above TF families. 2.2. Cucumber Genes Responsive to Spider-Mite Feeding Previously, using an RNA-seq approach, we identified 2348 genes that were differentially expressed between spider mite-infested and non-infested plants of two genotypes of cucumber, accession Chinese long with bitter and accession Corona with non-bitter foliage [ 44]. All DEGs were organized into four groups based on their expression at different time points after feeding ( Figure 2). In group I, gene expression increased during the period of feeding in both accessions whereas group IV contained genes for which expression decreased in both accessions. Groups II and III include those genes for which transcripts remained more or less unaltered in Chinese long but increased (group II) or decreased (group III) in Corona after spider-mite feeding. Statistical analysis showed that both duration of feeding and the genotype had significant effects on the transcript abundance of genes and there was a significant interaction between both factors in three of the four groups of genes ( Figure 2). We used this collection of DEGs as a data set to identify TFs that play a role in both positive and negative early responses towards two-spotted spider mites in cucumber. We compared our results with the transcriptional response of cucumber towards the pathogen  Pseudoperonospora cubensis downy mildew as described by Adhikari, et al. [ 45] to study similarities and differences in the involvement of TFs in the response of cucumber to these two different biotic stresses ([ 44],  Table 1). 2.3. Regulation of TF Expression in Response to Spider-Mite Herbivory Out of the 1212 TF-encoding genes ( Figure 1), transcription of 119 was differentially regulated by spider-mite feeding, of which 60 were generally upregulated (in group I and group II DEGs) and 59 were downregulated (in groups III and IV). The distribution of the number of genes in the different groups of DEGs over the TF gene families was analyzed ( Table 1) to discover general trends in the expression of these genes. Groups I and II, both representing increased gene transcript levels after spider-mite feeding, included five MYBs. In contrast, seven MYBs were present in group III and two in group IV, which both represent genes for which transcription is repressed by spider-mite feeding. TF genes of the bHLH family were almost equally distributed over the four groups, with 4 to 6 genes in each of the groups. Most of the ERF TF genes were included in group I (4) and group II (13) and displayed increased transcription upon spider-mite feeding, while seven ERF genes displayed decreasing transcription, six in group III and one in group IV. Most of the WRKY genes were assigned to group III or group IV, and thus displayed decreasing transcription in response to spider-mite feeding. Taken together it seems that ERFs and WRKYs were preferentially up- and downregulated by spider-mite herbivory, respectively, while MYBs and bHLHs were about equally up- and downregulated. The other TF families were basically randomly distributed over the four groups of DEGs ( Table 1). As the WRKY, AP2/ERF, bHLH and MYB TF genes were most responsive to spider mites and were also reported to encode important TFs in plant defense [ 20], we made a more detailed analysis of their expression pattern during early spider-mite feeding ( Figure 3). Expression of MYBs and bHLHs during the first three days after the onset of spider-mite feeding was equally up- and downregulated ( Figure 3), obviously corresponding to their classification in the DEG self-organizing maps ( Figure 1). Most of the AP2/ERFs were found to be upregulated after spider-mite feeding, particularly in Corona. The majority of WRKYs were found in group III and thus were suppressed by spider-mite feeding. However,  Figure 3 shows that expression of most of the WRKYs actually increased on the first or second day of spider-mite feeding before transcripts were downregulated on the third day. 2.4. TF Genes Most Strongly Influenced by Spider-Mite Feeding Spider-mite feeding resulted in differential expression of TF genes in both directions. The relative transcript abundance of a putative bHLH gene (Csa3M002860) increased about 20-fold (log 2Ration ≈ 4.4) one day after the onset of spider-mite feeding compared to transcription in non-infested leaves making it the most strongly affected TF gene in spider mite-infested cucumber leaves. Although the absolute abundance of the transcripts of this TF gene decreased on days 2 and 3, expression was still about 14- and 10-fold higher than in non-infested plants, respectively ( Figure 4). A similar pattern was found for a MYB TF gene, Csa6M121970, with the strongest induction (18-fold) on day 1, and about 7- and 6-fold higher compared with non-infested plants on succeeding days. The other putative TF genes that are depicted in the right panel of  Figure 4 have the strongest induction of expression on different days, but all belong to the ten most upregulated TFs. This group includes three ERFs. In contrast, the two strongest downregulated TF genes belong to the bHLH family ( Figure 4, left panel). Transcription of the bHLH TF gene, Csa3M850530, first increased slightly after one day of feeding and subsequently decreased to approximately half the amount of transcripts of non-infested leaves on day 2 and to 8% (log 2Ration ≈ 3.6) on day 3. Expression of the bHLH TF gene, Csa7M452040, showed a similar pattern, resulting in a decrease in transcripts to 10% (log 2Ratio ≈ 3.3) compared to non-infested plants after three days. The expression of the ten strongest suppressed TF genes decreased mainly on day 3 and this category includes three MYBs. 2.5. Co-Expression of TF Genes with Defense-Related Genes Co-expression analysis between TF genes and genes involved in the biosynthesis of defense-related metabolites may give insight in their regulatory relationships. As we have particular interest in genes and pathways that are involved in biosynthesis of compounds within the herbivory-induced volatile blend that is of importance for attraction of natural enemies of spider mites, we focused on the expression profiles of a gene encoding a lipoxygenase (LOX) which may be involved in green leaf volatile [ 46, 47] and/or JA biosynthesis [ 48] and two genes encoding terpene synthases (TPS) that synthesize multiple mono- and sesquiterpenes and were found to be induced upon spider-mite feeding [ 44]. Furthermore, we included a gene encoding an UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT),  CsUGT, putatively involved in the glycosylation of secondary metabolites [ 49] and a gene encoding a sucrose transporter (SUT),  CsSUT, both of which were selected as representatives of the genes downregulated by spider-mite feeding. In addition to the gene expression patterns detected in response to spider-mite herbivory, expression profiles of these genes after infection with downy mildew [ 45] and in different organs of unchallenged plants [ 12] were included to analyze co-expression relationships with the 119 selected TF genes that show differential expression upon spider-mite herbivory. Hierarchical clustering of these genes was analyzed using Genemaths ( www.applied-maths.com) based on log 2-transformed and mean-centered expression data [ 44]. Distances between genes and clusters and significance of co-expression were calculated based on Pearson correlation and UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean). We found that the TF genes most closely co-expressed with  LOX ( p = 0.05) are a  HOX, two  bZIPs and two  MYBs ( Figure 5). Both spider mite-induced  TPSs closely co-expressed with each other and with a  bHLH, a  MYB and an  ERF ( p = 0.04). Furthermore, although not significantly, three other  MYBs, a  NAC, a  TFIIIC and a  TCP, co-expressed with both  TPS genes more than other TF genes ( p = 0.08).  CsUGT and  CsSUT co-expressed with an  ERF, a  bHLH, a  MYB and a  WRKY ( p = 0.05) ( Figure 5). In addition, the strongest induced TF, i.e.,  MYC ( Csa3M002860) co-expressed with a gene encoding DXS (1-DEOXY-D-XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE), and eight other genes that encode proteins with unknown functions ( Figure S1). All these genes were upregulated during spider-mite feeding, especially in accession Corona. Seven genes co-expressed with the most strongly suppressed TF  bHLH ( Csa3M002860), however protein functions of these genes are mostly unknown except for one gene that encodes a putative lyase. 2.6. Motifs in Promoters of Defense-Related Genes The binding motifs in the promoter regions of spider mite-inducible  CsLOX,  CsTPS9 and spider mite-suppressed  CsUGT and  CsSUT were analyzed to obtain more hints for possible regulators. Multiple motifs were found in each of the promoters by aligning the sequences to PlantCARE, the database of plant  cis-acting regulatory elements [ 50]. There were 32 non-redundant elements in the promoter of  CsLOX, 35 in the promoter of  CsTPS9, and 24 and 30 in the promoters of  CsUGT and  CsSUT, respectively ( Figure 6). Thirteen elements were present in all four promoters, including motifs HSE, circadian, Box I, G-box, TTC-rich repeats, CGTCA-motif, AAGAA-motif, TATA-box, CAAT-box, and three unnamed motifs ( Figure 6). The promoters of the upregulated genes,  CsLOX and  CsTPS9, shared an AE-box, an MBS (MYB Binding Sites) and a motif with unknown function, while there was no common motif shared by the promoters of the downregulated  CsSUT and  CsUGT. Every one of these promoters also had multiple specific motifs which were not present in the other three.","To gain insight into the regulatory networks that underlie the induced defense in cucumber against spider mites, genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) were identified in the cucumber (Cucumissativus) genome and their regulation by two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychusurticae) herbivory was analyzed using RNA-seq. Of the total 1212 annotated TF genes in the cucumber genome, 119 were differentially regulated upon spider-mite herbivory during a period of 3 days. These TF genes belong to different categories but the MYB, bHLH, AP2/ERF and WRKY families had the highest relative numbers of differentially expressed genes. Correlation analysis of the expression of TF genes with defense-associated genes during herbivory and pathogen infestation, and in different organs resulted in the putative identification of regulators of herbivore-induced terpenoid and green-leaf-volatile biosynthesis. Analysis of the cis-acting regulatory elements (CAREs) present in the promoter regions of the genes responsive to spider-mite feeding revealed potential TF regulators. This study describes the TF genes in cucumber that are potentially involved in the regulation of induced defense against herbivory by spider mites.","['Promoter', 'Transcription factor', 'Cucumber', 'Cis-acting Regulatory Elements', 'Spider Mite']","['Genes', 'Spider-Mite Feeding', 'Figure', 'Spider-Mite', 'gene', 'Feeding', 'group', 'group III', 'expression', 'groups']","[TF, MYB, bHLH (149), AP2/ERF (143), TF, bZIP, WRKYs, TF, MADS (41 genes, TCP (27, NF-Y, ZF-TF (, ARF, HOX (17 genes, Spider-Mite, TF, Spider-Mite, WRKY, WRKYs, bHLHs, WRKY, AP2/ERF, bHLH, MYB TF, bHLHs, DEG, WRKYs, WRKYs, TF, Spider-Mite, TF, Csa3M002860, 3, MYB TF, Csa6M121970, TF, Csa3M850530, Csa7M452040, TF, herbivory-induced, LOX, UDP-glycosyltransferase, UGT, sucrose transporter, SUT, downy mildew, Arithmetic, TF, TF, TF, Csa3M002860, 1-DEOXY-D-XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE, TF  , PlantCARE, Box I, G-box, TTC-rich, AAGAA-motif, TATA-box, CAAT-box, AE-box, MBS, MYB]","['(TPS)', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'CsTPS9', 'CsTPS9,', 'CsTPS9,']",[],[],terpene synthase

Generation of RNAi Mediated Knock Down Line of Limonene Synthase Gene in Spearmint We identified and cloned the limonene synthase gene  MsLS from the previously published RNA seq data of spearmint PGT from our lab [ 35]. Full length ORF of  MsLS was cloned from mint PGT cDNA and found 98 percent similar to the previously reported LS gene (L13459) ( Figure S1) [ 27]. The gene was functionally characterized in vitro to test its ability to produce limonene from GDP.  MsLS was cloned into pDEST-6His using gateway cloning system and expressed in  E. coli BL21(DE3). Recombinant MsLS was purified using HisPurTM Ni-NTA spin purification kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Singapore) The purified protein was then used to assay for production of limonene from GDP in vitro. The products were analyzed by GC-MS based on a comparison of retention times and mass spectra of limonene standard. Results showed that incubation of MsLS with GDP produced limonene ( Figure 1A).  No terpenes were detected when MsLS was incubated with farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). With the aim to reduce flux into the native limonene biosynthesis pathway,  MsLS RNAi lines were generated. Of the seven independent transgenic lines confirmed by southern blot, three had single insertion of T-DNA ( Figure 2A). Six out of the seven lines showed a significant reduction in  MsLS expression when compared to WT ranging from 65 to 98% as determined by qRT-PCR ( Figure 2B). No phenotypic difference was observed in the  MsLS RNAi lines and they appeared similar to wild type plants. The comparison of MsLS RNAi lines and WT was based on observable characteristic of both the plants, such as plant height, leaf size and shape, growth rate etc. 2.2. Silencing of MsLS Reduces Monoterpene Production and Affects Flux into Other Metabolic Pathways Three lines (2,4 and 5) with significant reduction in the expression of  MsLS were chosen for further study. Single quadrupole GC-MS analysis was performed on young leaves (2–3 cm) to analyze the effect on production of monoterpenes upon  MsLS suppression.  Peaks were identified based on comparison of the mass spectra with authentic standards. All the three lines exhibited substantial decrease in both limonene and carvone production, ranging from 96% to 99% for limonene and 67% to 91% for carvone, when compared to WT respectively ( Figure 3A). Although the MEP and MVA pathway are well separated there are studies that indicate a crosstalk between the two pathways. The MVA pathway is mainly responsible for the formation of sesquiterpenes and phytosterols. To identify changes in metabolites on a larger scale an untargeted GC- and LC-QTOF-MS analysis was performed on the three  MsLS RNAi lines.  The major sesquiterpene observed in the spearmint variety are caryophyllene,  cis-β-farnesene,  cis-muurola-4(15), 5-diene and germacrene D. Single quadrupole GC-MS analysis revealed that all the three  MsLS RNAi lines showed increase in total amount of sesquiterpenes ranging from 38% to 96% when compared to WT ( Figure 3B). Additionally, GC-QTOF-MS showed an increase in phytosterols namely stigmasterol and sitosterol ranging from 55% to 65% when compared to WT ( Figure 4). An increase in sesquiterpenes and phytosterols indicate an increase in flux towards the MVA pathway upon suppression of the native monoterpene pathway. Further GC and LC–QTOF-MS analysis, showed an increase in the total amounts of fatty acids ranging from 40 % to 55 %, and in flavonoids and phenolic metabolites ranging from 65% to 85 % in all the three  MsLS RNAi lines when compared to WT respectively ( Figure 4 and  Figure S2).  Table 1 and  Table 2 list the various metabolites, which were found significantly increased upon  MsLS suppression. The MEP pathway is localized in the plastids, which is also the site for shikimate and fatty acid pathways. All the three pathways share phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate as common biosynthetic precursors derived from primary metabolism. Our results indicate that alteration of MEP pathway in spearmint also affects the production of metabolites from the other two pathways present in the plastids. 2.3. Expression of Heterologous TPSs in MsLS RNAi Background Among the seven  MsLS RNAi lines, line 4 was chosen for introduction of the heterologous terpene synthases, namely  MsLS RNAi4.  MsLS RNAi4 was a single T-DNA insertion line and showed significant reduction in  MsLS expression and endogenous monoterpene accumulation. The three heterozygous monoterpene synthases (TPSs), linalool synthase (PaLinS) and myrcene synthase (PaMyrS) from  Picea abies and geraniol synthase (CoGerS) from  Cananga odorata (ylang-ylang) were introduced into the  MsLS RNAi4 individually. At least 6 transgenic lines were generated for each TPS. They were characterized by southern blotting and analyzed for individual TPS expression by qRT-PCR ( Figures S3 and S4). Three independent single insertion lines with high TPS expression were advanced for further characterization for each TPS gene. Compared to MsLS RNAi4 with plant growth rate, plant height, leaf size and leaf shape, no observable differences were observed in analyzed transgenic lines expressing PaMyrS, CoGerS and PaLinS. 2.4. Metabolite Profiling of Transgenic Lines Expressing Heterologous TPSs in MsLS RNAi4 Reveals Complex Metabolism of Introduced Monoterpenes Three independent lines expressing linalool synthase (PaLinS), myrcene synthase (PaMyrS) and geraniol synthase (CoGerS) respectively were propagated and maintained for the purpose of metabolite profiling. As monoterpenes are known to be further metabolized to nonvolatile derivatives, methanol extract of leaves of transgenic plants were also analyzed by LC–QTOF-MS in negative mode and positive mode in an untargeted approach to identify derivatives of introduced monoterpenes.  GC-QTOF-MS analysis of three lines expressing geraniol synthase (CoGerS) revealed the presence of geraniol related compounds such geranyl isovalerate, nerolidyl propionate, geranyl hexanoate, geranyl oleate, geranyl palmitate and geranyl acetate but at low levels (up to 5% in the presence of a high sample matrix background). These compounds were not found in WT or  MsLS RNAi lines. LC-QTOF-MS analysis revealed the presence of geraniol glycosides which were putatively identified as malonyl–hexosyl geraniol dimer, malonyl hexosyl geranic acid dimer and hexosyl hydroxy geranic acid. Loganin, an iridoid was also observed ( Table 3 and  Figure S5). Geraniol is a known precursor metabolite of the monoterpenoid iridoid pathway. The above data indicates towards the bioconversion of geraniol by spearmint endogenous enzymes to many different compounds. Further LC-MS/MS of geraniol standard at series of different concentrations was performed to establish a calibration curve. The total amount of geraniol derivatives was quantified based on the relative response factor. With this method the amount of total geraniol derivatives ( Figure 5A) observed ranged from 0.6 ng/g to 0.85 ng/g.  GC-QTOF-MS analysis of three lines expressing linalool synthase (PaLinS) detected no significant amount of free linalool or volatile linalool derivatives in them. LC-QTOF-MS analysis showed the presence of glycosylated non-volatile derivatives of linalool, which were putatively identified as linalool-3-glucoside, and linalyl β- d-glucopyranoside. A linalool ester was also observed which was putatively identified as linalool butyrate ( Table 3 and  Figure S6). Further LC-MS/MS of linalool standard at different concentrations was performed to establish a calibration curve and linalool derivatives were quantified based on the relative response. With this method the amount of total linalool derivatives ( Figure 5B) observed in the three lines ranged from 0.5 ng/g to 0.8 ng/g. Three lines expressing myrcene synthase were analyzed by GC-QTOF-MS but no significant amount of free myrcene or volatile myrcene derivatives were found. LC-QTOF-MS analysis showed the presence of non-volatile derivatives of myrcene which were putatively identified as myrcenyl acetate and dimethyl-3-oxopentane-1-5-diyl dibenzoate ( Table 3 and  Figure S7). LC-MS/MS of myrcene standard at different concentrations was performed and myrcene derivative levels were quantified based on the relative response factor of the standard and derivatives. With this method the amount of total myrcene derivatives ( Figure 5C) observed in the three lines ranged from 0.4 ng/g to 0.6 ng/g. Of all the introduced monoterpenes geraniol showed the maximum number of derivatives and myrcene the least. The above results showed complex metabolism of introduced heterologous monoterpene by endogenous enzymes of spearmint. Principal component analysis was performed between WT and  MsLS RNAi4 LC-MS data sets and between  MsLS RNAi4 and CoGerS, PalinS and PaMyrS lines individually. The PCA ( Figure 6A–D) score plot showed the distribution of the metabolites between the respective groups. The PCA analysis for WT and  MsLS RNAi4 showed two principal components which accounted for 50.6% and 49.4% of the variation with Eigen values for PC1 (3.00) and PC2 (1.78) in the spectral data respectively. For  MsLS RNAi4 and CoGerS line two principal components accounted for 44.1% and 30.3% of variation with Eigen values as PC1 (2.22) and PC2 (1.52).  MsLS RNAi4 and PalinS line showed two principal components accounting for 32.9% and 23.7% variation with Eigen values as PC1 (2.43) and PC2 (1.65). For  MsLS RNAi4 and PaMyrS line, two principal components accounted for 52.6% and 32.4% of the variation, with Eigen values are PC1 (5.06) and PC2 (3.06) respectively. Based on these results, we can now detect the distribution of metabolites whose levels are abundant between the groups. The positive values strengthen the evidence of differences between samples groups, negative values argue against. Thus, the PCA score plots showed a visible discrimination along the PC1 and PC2 explaining the variation of the data.","Spearmint produces and stores large amounts of monoterpenes, mainly limonene and carvone, in glandular trichomes and is the major natural source of these compounds. Towards producing heterologous monoterpenes in spearmint, we first reduced the flux into the native limonene pathway by knocking down the expression of limonene synthase ( MsLS ) by RNAi method. The  MsLS  RNAi lines exhibited a huge reduction in the synthesis of limonene and carvone. Detailed GC-MS and LC-MS analysis revealed that  MsLS  RNAi plants also showed an increase in sesquiterpene, phytosterols, fatty acids, flavonoids, and phenolic metabolites, suggesting an interaction between the MEP, MVA shikimate and fatty acid pathways in spearmint. Three different heterologous monoterpene synthases namely, linalool synthase and myrcene synthase from  Picea abies  and geraniol synthase from  Cananga odorata  were cloned and introduced independently into the  MsLS  RNAi mutant background. The expression of these heterologous terpene synthases resulted mainly in production of monoterpene derivatives. Of all the introduced monoterpenes geraniol showed the maximum number of derivatives. Our results provide new insights into MEP pathway interactions and regulation and reveals the existence of mechanisms for complex metabolism of monoterpenes in spearmint.","['Secondary metabolites', 'Derivatives', 'metabolic engineering', 'terpenes', 'Limonene Synthase', 'Pathway Flux Analyses']","['MsLS', 'Figure', 'lines', 'MsLS RNAi', 'RNAi lines', 'lines expressing', 'showed', 'derivatives', 'Synthase', 'geraniol']","[Line, LS, L13459, pDEST-6His, MsLS, HisPurTM Ni-NTA, kit, MsLS, MsLS, farnesylpyrophosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPP, MsLS RNAi, MsLS, GC-QTOF-MS, LC–, MsLS, PaLinS, PaMyrS, MsLS RNAi4, PaMyrS, CoGerS, PaLinS., MsLS RNAi4, PaLinS, PaMyrS, LC–, malonyl–hexosyl geraniol, S5, PaLinS, GC-QTOF-MS, myrcenyl acetate, dimethyl-3-oxopentane-1-5-diyl dibenzoate, CoGerS, PalinS, PaMyrS lines, PC2 (1.78), CoGerS line, PC2 (1.52), PalinS line, PC2 (1.65), PaMyrS line, PC2 (3.06), PC2]","['TPSs', '(TPSs),', 'TPS.', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs']",[],[],terpene synthase

Identification of Candidate GES Genes from the D. officinale Genome From  D. officinale genomic annotation data, three candidate GES sequences with best matches to known GES proteins [ 6, 12, 13, 15] were retrieved by BLASTN, and named DoGES1, DoGES2, and DoGES3 ( Table S1). Multiple sequence alignment demonstrated that three DoGES proteins had highly conserved aspartate-rich motifs (DDxxD) and NSE/DTE motifs at the  C-terminal, and an RRX 8W domain at the  N-terminal ( Figure 2), suggesting that DoGES1-3 were all TPSs. Among them, DDxxD and NSE/DTE were essential for the cofactor Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ to catalyze the synthesis of monoterpenes [ 18, 19], and the RRX 8W domain was also involved in the cyclization of monoterpene synthase [ 20]. 2.2. Phylogenetic Analysis of DoGES Proteins in the D. officinale Genome To investigate the evolutionary relationship of DoGES proteins with other reported GES proteins, a phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method ( Figure 3;  Table S2). All three DoGES proteins clustered in the TPS-b subfamily, which is specific to angiosperms and is responsible for encoding monoterpene synthases [ 21]. Based on the transcription levels in different tissues (roots, stems, leaves, and flowers),  DoGES1 exhibited high expression in flowers, while  DoGES2 and  DoGES3 were mainly expressed in roots and leaves, respectively ( Figure S1). Consequently, DoGES1 was selected for our candidate study gene related to floral scent formation. 2.3. Molecular Cloning and Analysis of DoGES1 from D. officinale Flowers RNA isolated from  D. officinale flowers during the blossoming period were used as template and amplified via nested PCR. Full-length cDNA sequences of  DoGES1 have a 1749-bp long open reading frame (ORF) that encodes 582 amino acids with a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.34 and a molecular weight of 67.99 kDa ( Figure S2). The DoGES1 sequence was submitted to GenBank Data Libraries under accession number MT875214. The DoGES1 secondary structure, which was determined using the SOPMA program ( http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/), shows that it harbors 69.24% α-helixes, 23.37% random coils, 3.78% β-turns, and 3.61% extended strands. The Chlorop 1.1 tool predicted that DoGES1 contains a 34 amino acid long  N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide. To determine the subcellular localization of DoGES1, three subcellular localization tools (AtSubP [ 22], Plant-mPLoc [ 23], and pLoc-mPlant [ 24]) were used. All of them demonstrated that DoGES1 was located in chloroplasts, and was thus likely a mono-TPS in the MEP-pathway, but not in the cytosolic MVA pathway. 2.4. Subcellular Localization of DoGES1 To confirm the intracellular localization of DoGES1, pSAT6-EYFP-DoGES1 was transformed to the mesophyll protoplasts of 4-week-old  Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Yellow fluorescent signals were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The images indicate that DoGES1 was located in chloroplasts ( Figure 4), similar to  LiTPS2, which encodes a mono-TPS in lily ( Lilium longiflorum ‘Siberia’) [ 25], indicating that DoGES1 may be responsible for monoterpene synthesis. 2.5. Functional Characterization of Enzyme Encoded by DoGES1 in Escherichia coli To investigate whether DoGES1 encodes an enzyme that can produce monoterpenes, the full-length ORF sequence of DoGES1 was subcloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a, expressed in  E. coli BL21 (DE3), and induced by 1 mM isopropyl-β- d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Recombinant pET-32a-DoGES1 proteins were purified using affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA agarose column, and were identified and isolated with a single band matching the expected size of DoGES1 in an SDS-PAGE gel ( Figure S3). After incubation with GPP as substrate for the synthesis of monoterpenes, recombinant DoGES1 proteins successfully yielded geraniol with two characteristic fragment  m/ z 69 and  m/ z 41 in mass spectra produced by GC–MS ( Figure 5), which showed the same mass spectral features of the authentic standard, geraniol. In addition, geraniol was not detected among the protein extracts from an empty vector cell mixture ( Figure 5). These results suggest that DoGES1 from  D. officinale had the capacity to specifically catalyze the formation of geraniol. Consequently, DoGES1 was classified as a geraniol synthase. 2.6. Ectopic Expression of DoGES1 in N. benthamiana We ectopically expressed  DoGES1 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in  N. benthamiana leaves. Positive transgenic leaves were screened by PCR for the presence of the  DoGES1 gene.  DoGES1 was not detected in 6-week-old  N. benthamiana leaves transformed with the empty vector pCAMBIA3300, while the positively transformed  N. benthamiana leaves were selected for subsequent analysis as a result of the high transcription levels of  DoGES1. As expected, a large amount of geraniol was produced in  N. benthamiana leaves overexpressing  DoGES1 3 days after treatment, whereas geraniol was not observed in the control group ( Figure 6). Therefore,  DoGES1 seemed to be a single-product enzyme that contributed to the biosynthesis of geraniol. 2.7. Temporal-Spatial Expression Patterns Analysis of DoGES1 in D. officinale To clarify the expression patterns of  DoGES1 in  D. officinale, different tissues (roots, stems, leaves, and flowers), developmental stages of flowers (budding, semi-open flowers, fully open flowers), flower organs (petal, gynostemium, and labellum), and flower harvest times (8:00, 11:00, 14:00, and 17:00) were measured using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qRCR). The results indicate that  DoGES1 exhibited the highest transcription levels in flowers, followed by stems, while the roots and the leaves displayed a relatively low level ( Figure 7A). As flowers developed, the expression levels of  DoGES1 mRNA also varied.  DoGES1 was slightly expressed in the bud stage, expression increased enormously in semi-open flowers where it peaked, and dropped notably in the fully open flowers ( Figure 7B). Among different flower organs,  DoGES1 expression was 4.77- and 12.29-fold higher in petals than in the gynostemium or labellum, respectively ( Figure 7C). A comparison of  DoGES1 expression at specific times of the day showed that  DoGES1 showed higher expression at 11:00 than at 8:00, 14:00, and 17:00 ( Figure 7D). Furthermore, geraniol content fluctuated among the harvest time points (from 8:00 to 17:00), with a trend of first increasing and then decreasing; the highest amount was observed at 14:00 ( Figure S4). Thus,  DoGES1 was upregulated at first, then downregulated and possessed the highest value at 11:00, corresponding to the increase and then decrease in geraniol content at the same harvest time points (from 8:00 to 17:00). These results suggest that floral monoterpenes, such as geraniol encoded by  DoGES1, might originate from petals and are emitted at 14:00, with a considerably high release during the budding stage in  D. officinale flowers. 2.8. Activation of DoGES1 Gene Expression in Response to Methyl Jasmonate Methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which is involved in responses to various stresses, regulates terpene metabolism [ 26]. To explore the response of the  DoGES1 gene after the application of MeJA,  DoGES1 transcript levels were quantified by qRT-PCR. Compared to the non-treated control,  DoGES1 was significantly upregulated between 2.41- and 21.49-fold, with the highest expression at 3 h after MeJA treatment ( Figure 8A). Furthermore, a significant increase ( p < 0.05) in geraniol was induced by MeJA, increasing by 243.47% ( Figure 8B). This finding suggests the involvement of  DoGES1 in the MeJA-dependent biosynthesis of geraniol.","Floral scent is a key ornamental trait that determines the quality and commercial value of orchids. Geraniol, an important volatile monoterpene in orchids that attracts pollinators, is also involved in responses to stresses but the geraniol synthase (GES) responsible for its synthesis in the medicinal orchid  Dendrobium officinale  has not yet been identified. In this study, three potential geraniol synthases were mined from the  D. officinale  genome. DoGES1, which was localized in chloroplasts, was characterized as a geraniol synthase.  DoGES1  was highly expressed in flowers, especially in petals.  DoGES1  transcript levels were high in the budding stage of  D. officinale  flowers at 11:00 a.m. DoGES1 catalyzed geraniol in vitro, and transient expression of  DoGES1  in  Nicotiana benthamiana  leaves resulted in the accumulation of geraniol in vivo. These findings on DoGES1 advance our understanding of geraniol biosynthesis in orchids, and lay the basis for genetic modification of floral scent in  D. officinale  or in other ornamental orchids.","['Geraniol', 'Orchids', 'Terpene synthase', 'Mep Pathway', 'Floral Volatiles']","['Figure', 'flowers', 'expression', 'geraniol', 'GES proteins', 'proteins', 'officinale', 'leaves', 'DoGES proteins', 'Candidate GES']","[GES, GES, GES proteins [ 6, DoGES1, DoGES3 ( Table S1, DoGES1-3, TPSs, Mg 2, DoGES Proteins, GES, DoGES proteins, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, MT875214, DoGES1, α-helixes, β-turns, DoGES1, DoGES1, pLoc-mPlant [ 24], DoGES1, MEP-pathway, DoGES1, DoGES1, pSAT6-EYFP-DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, pET-32a, isopropyl-β- d-thiogalactopyranoside, pET-32a-DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, DoGES1, pCAMBIA3300, DoGES1, 4.77-, DoGES1, 21.49-fold]","['TPSs.', 'TPS-b', 'mono-TPS', 'LiTPS2,', 'mono-TPS']",[],[],terpene synthase
138,138,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7815096\eupmc_result.json,PMC7815096,"Results Expansion of IDSs in genome of  H.  melpomene We identified candidates potentially involved in terpene synthesis by searching in the genome of  H.  melpomene for enzymes in the mevalonate pathway and IDSs using well-annotated  Drosophila melanogaster orthologs ( S1 Table) [ 30– 32]. We identified reciprocal best basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) hits for all enzymes, except for acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, which showed the closest similarity to 3  Heliconius genes with no reciprocal best BLAST hit ( Fig 1B). There was a clear one-to-one relationship for all enzymes, except for the IDSs which showed evidence for gene duplication. Of these,  Heliconius contains 2 putative FPPSs, 4 putative copies of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase (DPPS) subunit 2, and 7 putative geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases (GGPPSs) ( Fig 1A and 1B). The biggest expansion found was that of the GGPPSs, which are IDSs that catalyse the addition of IPP to farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). One of these,  HMEL015484g1, shows 83% amino acid sequence similarity to the GGPPS of the moth  Choristoneura fumiferana, which has previously been characterised in vitro to catalyse the production of GGPP from FPP and IPP [ 33].  HMEL015484g1 is also the best reciprocal BLAST hit with the GGPPS of  D.  melanogaster ( Fig 1A and 1B). The other 6 annotated GGPPSs show less than 50% similarity to the moth GGPPS, such that their function is less clear. QTL for ( E)-β-ocimene production on chromosome 6 In order to determine which of the genes identified above could be important for ( E)-β-ocimene production in  H.  melpomene, we generated genetic mapping families composed of crosses between 2 closely related species that differ in presence/absence of ( E)-β-ocimene,  H.  melpomene, and  H.  cydno ( Fig 2A). These 2 species can hybridise and, although the F1 females are sterile, F1 males can be used to generate backcross hybrids. We bred interspecific F1 hybrid males and backcrossed these with virgin females of both species to generate a set of backcross mapping families. The ( E)-β-ocimene phenotype segregated in families backcrossed to  H.  cydno, and so we focused on these families ( S1 Fig). Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with 114 individuals, we detected a single significant peak on chromosome 6 associated with ( E)-β-ocimene quantity ( Fig 2B). The QTL peak was at 36.4 cM, and the associated confidence interval spans 16.7 to 45.5 cM, corresponding to a 6.89-Mb region containing hundreds of genes. The percentage of phenotypic variance explained by the peak marker is 16.4%, suggesting that additional loci and/or environmental factors also contribute to the phenotype ( S2 Fig). Patterns of gene expression identify  HMELOS and  HMEL037108g1 as candidates To identify candidate genes for ( E)-β-ocimene production, we searched within the confidence interval of the QTL peak. We found that subunit 1 of DPPS as well as all 7 GGPPSs were found in this region ( Fig 2C). We then compared the expression levels of the 8 genes found within the QTL using published RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data [ 34]. We first analysed data from  H.  melpomene male and female abdomens and heads, mapped to the  H.  melpomene reference genome (v2.5). Since ( E)-β-ocimene is found in male abdomens in  H.  melpomene, we hypothesised that its synthase would be highly expressed in this sex and tissue. Only 1 gene showed male abdomen-biased expression:  HMELOS (previously  HMEL037106g1 from the  H.  melpomene annotation) (tissue * sex, t = −4.18, adjp = 0.0029;  Fig 2D and  S2 Table). All other genes did not show a significant bias in this direction ( S3 Fig and  S2 Table). We next compared gene expression between  H.  cydno and  H.  melpomene abdomens. If HmelOS is synthesising ( E)-β-ocimene, we might expect  HMELOS expression to be higher in  H.  melpomene male abdomens than in  H.  cydno, given that  H.  cydno does not produce the compound. We generated a reference-guided assembly of  H.  cydno by aligning an existing  H.  cydno Illumina trio assembly [ 35] to the  H.  melpomene reference, followed by automated gene annotation. We then manually identified  H.  cydno orthologs for our 7 candidate genes and checked for differential expression between species and sexes.  HMELOS and  HMEL037108g1 were the only genes showing greater male-biased expression in  H.  melpomene abdomens than in  H.  cydno abdomens ( HMELOS, species * sex, t = 3.15, adjp = 0.0445;  HMEL037108g1, species * sex, t = 3.44, adjp = 0.0259;  Fig 2E and  S3 Table). No other genes showed a significant bias in this direction ( S4 Fig and  S3 Table). In summary,  HMELOS and to a lesser extent  HMEL037108g1 are primary candidate genes from within the QTL region. Functional characterisation demonstrates the TPS activity of HmelOS and HMEL037108g1 We cloned  HMELOS and  HMEL037108g1 from  H.  melpomene, as well as the  H.  cydno ortholog of  HMELOS,  HCYDOS, into plasmids and were able to generate heterologous expression of both proteins in  E.  coli ( S5 Fig). We then conducted enzymatic assays with the expressed proteins using precursors from different points in the pathway to characterise their enzymatic function (Figs  1 and  3). First, we carried out assays with DMAPP and IPP, the 2 building blocks at the beginning of the terpene synthesis pathway to test for both IDS and TPS activity, as was seen in  Ips pini ( Fig 1). HmelOS produced trace amounts of ( E)-β-ocimene, linalool (another monoterpene), and nerolidol (a sesquiterpene), in this assay. This presumably occurs via the production of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and FPP; therefore, HmelOS exhibits residual GPPS and FPPS activity, as well as monoterpene synthase and sesquiterpene synthase activity to convert the GPP and FPP to ( E)-β-ocimene, linalool, and nerolidol ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S4 Table). HMEL037108g1 produced trace amounts of linalool ( Fig 3A and  S6 Fig) and nerolidol from DMAPP and IPP. Again, this demonstrates residual GPS and FPPS activity to form the GPP and FPP and then both monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase activity to convert these to linalool and nerolidol ( Fig 3A and  S5 Table). We found no evidence for activity of HcydOS ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S6 Table). We then carried out assays with GPP and IPP, as well as GPP alone to test for monoterpene synthase activity ( Fig 1). Assaying with GPP and IPP together also allows us to test for potential FPPS and sesquiterpene synthase activity which could occur via production of FPP. HmelOS showed monoterpene synthase activity, producing ( E)-β-ocimene when provided with either GPP and IPP, or GPP alone ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S4 Table). Small amounts of ( Z)-β-ocimene were also produced in treatments where ( E)-β-ocimene was produced in large quantities ( S4 Table). In contrast to HmelOS, HMEL037108g1 only produced ( E)-β-ocimene in very small amounts from GPP ( S5 Table). Instead, linalool was produced in large amounts from GPP, suggesting that this enzyme is also acting as a monoterpene synthase but is responsible for production of linalool rather than ( E)-β-ocimene ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S5 Table). HmelOS also produced linalool, albeit in much smaller quantities ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S4 Table). We found no evidence for monoterpene activity of HcydOS ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S6 Table). Finally, we carried out assays with FPP and IPP to test for sesquiterpene synthase activity ( Fig 1). Although HmelOS exhibited small amounts of sesquiterpene synthase activity through the trace production of nerolidol when provided with DMAPP and IPP ( S4 Table), when provided with FPP and IPP, sesquiterpene synthase activity was not demonstrated, suggesting that it is not the primary enzyme function ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig, and  S4 Table). In contrast, HMEL037108g1 did exhibit sesquiterpene synthase activity, producing large amounts of nerolidol when FPP was provided as a precursor ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S5 Table). We found no evidence for sesquiterpene synthase activity of HcydOS ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and S6 Table). Due to the linalool detected in treatments where ( E)-β-ocimene was produced by HmelOS, we tested whether linalool could be a metabolic intermediate between GPP and ( E)-β-ocimene. However, HmelOS did not produce ( E)-β-ocimene from linalool ( S7 Fig and  S7 Table). The 2 stereoisomers of linalool, ( S)-linalool and ( R)-linalool, have different olfactory properties. We confirmed the stereochemistry of linalool produced by both enzymes and found that while HmelOS produced mainly ( S)-linalool, HMEL037108g1 produced a racemic mixture ( S8 Fig). In summary, HmelOS is a monoterpene synthase, catalysing the conversion of GPP to ( E)-β-ocimene in  H.  melpomene ( Fig 3B and 3C and  S8 Table). HMEL037108g1 is a bifunctional monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase catalysing the conversion of GPP to linalool as well as FPP to nerolidol ( Fig 3C and  S8 Table). We found no evidence for TPS activity of HcydOS ( Fig 3A,  S6 Fig and  S8 Table). Functional characterisation demonstrates the residual IDS activity of HmelOS, HcydOS, and HMEL037108g1 In order to better understand the origin of TPS activity in these enzymes, we further investigated their residual IDS activity. While the production of terpenes can be tested by direct gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the products of each experiment, this method will not detect isoprenyl diphosphates, potentially missing IDS activity if it is present. In order to test for IDS activity, we repeated the above experiments with DMAPP and IPP, GPP and IPP, and FPP and IPP, followed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase to hydrolyse the isoprenyl diphosphate products to their respective alcohols. These alcohols can then be detected by GC/MS analysis. No further IDS activity was detected in any enzyme, apart from the residual IDS activity of the  H.  melpomene enzymes already determined above due to the trace amounts of terpenes produced from DMAPP and IPP. When either enzyme is provided with GPP, geraniol is produced, and when provided with FPP, large amounts of farnesol is produced, as expected from the dephosphorylation of the provided precursors, and this is seen in control conditions, as well all experiments with HcydOS ( S9– S11 Figs and  S9– S11 Tables). As expected from the previous experiments, ( E)-β-ocimene is also produced when HmelOS is provided with GPP, and linalool and nerolidol are produced when HMEL037108g1 is provided with GPP and FPP, respectively. Geranylgeraniol is not produced in any treatments, demonstrating that neither HmelOS, HMEL037108g1 nor HcydOS is a GGPPS, as suggested by their annotation ( S9– S11 Figs and  S9– S11 Tables). In summary, both HmelOS and HMEL037108g1 only exhibit residual IDS activity, while we did not detect any IDS activity for HcydOS. Evolutionary history of gene family containing  Heliconius TPSs Lineage-specific expansions of gene families are often correlated with functional diversification and the origin of novel biological functions [ 36]. We therefore carried out a phylogenetic analysis of GGPPS in Lepidoptera to investigate whether gene duplication could have played a role in the evolution of the TPSs HmelOS and HMEL037108g1. Orthologs of the  H.  melpomene GGPPSs were identified in  H.  cydno,  Heliconius erato,  Bicyclus anynana,  Danaus plexippus,  Papilio polytes,  Pieris napi,  Manduca sexta,  Bombyx mori, and  Plutella xylostella [ 37]. Expansions of the GGPPS group of enzymes can be seen in  Heliconius and in  Bicyclus, both groups in which terpenes form part of the pheromone blend [ 38] ( S13 Fig). Expansion of gene families is often followed by an acceleration of the nonsynonymous mutation rate facilitated by a relaxation or loss of selectional constraints [ 39]. To further investigate whether gene duplication played a role in the evolution of TPSs, we examined patterns of synonymous to non-synonymous evolution in the  Heliconius GGPPS/TPS family.  Heliconius and  Bicyclus clades show higher relative non-synonymous evolution consistent with relaxed selection constraints (ω = 0.22 and 0.19, respectively) compared to the strong purifying selection on the non-expanded lepidopteran GGPPS genes (ω = 0.027, χ2 = 338.2,  p < 0.00001). To focus on the  Heliconius-specific duplications, we made a phylogeny using the DNA sequence of transcripts from  H.  melpomene,  H.  cydno, and  H.  erato.  H.  melpomene and  H.  cydno belong to the same clade within  Heliconius, with an estimated divergence time around 1.5 million years ago [ 40].  H.  erato is more distantly related, belonging to a different  Heliconius clade which diverged from the  H.  melpomene/ H.  cydno group around 10 million years ago [ 41]. While ( E)-β-ocimene is not found in the genitals of  H.  cydno, it is found in the genitals of  H.  erato, at around one-tenth the amount of  H.  melpomene [ 18]. We hypothesised that duplications between the  H.  melpomene and  H.  erato clades may have resulted in subfunctionalisation and a more efficient  H.  melpomene enzyme facilitating increased ( E)-β-ocimene production. We found that both losses and gene duplications have occurred between the  H.  melpomene and  H.  erato clades, while gene copy number is conserved between closely related  H.  melpomene and  H.  cydno ( S14 Fig). The exact orthology between the  H.  erato and  H.  melpomene/ H.  cydno genes is unclear, but  H.  melpomene/ H.  cydno have more genes in this family than  H.  erato ( S14 Fig), and both clades have more genes than the ancestral lepidopteran state of 1 copy. We also found evidence for the formation of pseudogenes following gene duplication. The amino acid sequences from translations of 1 gene in  H.  cydno, the ortholog of  HMEL037104g1, does not contain a complete functional protein domain. This is also seen for  Herato0606. 241 in  H.  erato. Furthermore, more recent pseudogene formation could be seen in the  H.  cydno ortholog of  HMEL22306g3, which contained multiple stop codons, despite being transcribed ( S4 Fig). We have demonstrated that HmelOS of  H.  melpomene acts as an ocimene synthase, with residual IDS activity, while we find no evidence of these functions in its ortholog in  H.  cydno, HcydOS. To identify likely functional changes between  H.  melpomene and  H.  cydno we first analysed the patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations between these species. The branch leading up to  HMELOS and  HCYDOS is under positive selection (ω = 1.33); this ratio is greater than the background ratio of the  Heliconius GGPPS genes (ω = 0.19) (χ2 = 6.9,  p = 0.012). However, we find no difference between ω ratio for the  HMELOS branch and  HCYDOS branch (χ2 = 0.36,  p = 0.54). We then predicted the sequence of the last common ancestor (LCA) of  H.  melpomene HmelOS and  H.  cydno HcydOS using ancestral sequence reconstruction with a posterior probability of 0.998 ( S15 Fig). Six amino acid changes differentiate HmelOS from the LCA, and 3 amino acid changes differentiate HcydO S from the LCA. To identify which of these residues are conserved within species, we aligned amino acid sequences from a set of 20 sequences from 10 individuals of each species ( S12 Table). Of the sites which differentiate  H.  cydno and  H.  melpomene from the predicted sequence of the LCA, the most intraspecifically conserved sites occur between amino acid residues 100 and 125, suggesting that this region is likely to be important for the function of the enzyme ( S13 Table). All 3 mutations in the  H.  cydno lineage (M109T, V119T, and A123T) and 1 of the mutations in the  H.  melpomene lineage (R122K) occur in this region. Of the amino acid changes in this region, the mutations in the  H.  cydno lineage involve a larger change in amino acid chemistry (from either methionine or small hydrophobic residues to a polar residue) than the mutation between 2 positively charged amino acids in the  H.  melpomene lineage. In order to determine the number of evolutionary origins of insect and plant TPSs, we carried out a broader phylogenetic analysis, including other known insect and plant IDS and TPS proteins. Similar to the other insect TPSs described,  Heliconius TPSs are not found within the same clade as plant ocimene synthases, representing an independent origin of ocimene synthesis in  Heliconius and plants. Furthermore, the  Heliconius TPSs do not group with known insect TPS enzymes in Hemiptera and Coleoptera ( Fig 4). Instead, the  Heliconius TPS enzymes group with GPP and GGPP synthases, rather than FPP synthases. The TPS enzymes of  Heliconius are therefore of an independent evolutionary origin as compared to other insect TPSs. Comparison of the amino acid alignment of known insect TPSs with the  H.  melpomene enzymes ( S16 Fig) demonstrated that residues previously identified as conserved in insect TPSs [ 28] were not found in the  H.  melpomene TPSs. No residues were shared between all insect TPSs (including  H.  melpomene TPS) which were not also shared with the  H.  melpomene GGPPS. This further indicates independent convergent evolution of TPS function in  H.  melpomene.","Plants and insects often use the same compounds for chemical communication, but not much is known about the genetics of convergent evolution of chemical signals. The terpene (E)-β-ocimene is a common component of floral scent and is also used by the butterfly Heliconius melpomene as an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone. While the biosynthesis of terpenes has been described in plants and microorganisms, few terpene synthases (TPSs) have been identified in insects. Here, we study the recent divergence of 2 species, H. melpomene and Heliconius cydno, which differ in the presence of (E)-β-ocimene; combining linkage mapping, gene expression, and functional analyses, we identify 2 novel TPSs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one, HmelOS, is able to synthesise (E)-β-ocimene in vitro. We find no evidence for TPS activity in HcydOS (HmelOS ortholog of H. cydno), suggesting that the loss of (E)-β-ocimene in this species is the result of coding, not regulatory, differences. The TPS enzymes we discovered are unrelated to previously described plant and insect TPSs, demonstrating that chemical convergence has independent evolutionary origins.",,"['Fig', 'Table', 'melpomene', 'HMELOS', 'GPP', 'IDS activity', 'activity', 'FPP', 'cydno', 'synthase activity']","[acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, FPPSs, decaprenyl diphosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPPSs, GGPPSs, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GGPP, GGPPS, GGPP, GGPPS, GGPPSs, 6.89-Mb, DPPS, GGPPSs, abdomen-biased, HmelOS, HMELOS, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, S5, HmelOS, geranyl diphosphate, HmelOS, GPPS, FPPS, FPPS, HcydOS, FPPS, HmelOS, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, S5, HmelOS, HcydOS, HmelOS, DMAPP, HMEL037108g1, HcydOS, S6 Table), HmelOS, HmelOS, S)-linalool, HmelOS, S)-linalool, HMEL037108g1, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, HcydOS, HmelOS, HcydOS, HMEL037108g1, DMAPP, alkaline phosphatase, HcydOS, S9–, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, HcydOS, GGPPS, S9–, HmelOS, HMEL037108g1, HcydOS, GGPPS, HMEL037108g1, GGPPSs, GGPPS, S13, TPSs, GGPPS/TPS, GGPPS, ω, melpomene/ H.  , S14, melpomene/ H.  cydno, melpomene/ H.  , S14, HmelOS, HcydOS, ω, GGPPS, ω, ω, HcydOS, HmelOS, HcydO, S12, S13, GGPP, TPS enzymes, S16, GGPPS]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs,', 'GGPPS/TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPSs', 'TPSs.', 'TPSs', 'TPS)', 'TPS']",[],[],terpene synthase
139,139,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7822537\eupmc_result.json,PMC7822537,"Results Environment red-light is indispensable for betasatellite-encoded βC1 protein to promote host whitefly attraction To detect whether light affects the natural begomoviral transmission process, we performed whitefly two-choice experiments using  Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb) plants and Nb plants infected with TYLCCNV and its associated betasatellite (TYLCCNB) (TA+β) in white light and dark conditions ( Fig 1A). Consistent with our previous report [ 22], whiteflies showed a significant preference for TA+β-infected plants to uninfected Nb plants under white light ( Fig 1B). Interestingly, the whiteflies did not show preference for TA+β-infected plants under darkness ( Fig 1B). We previously demonstrated that βC1 protein encoded by TYLCCNB is involved in host preference of whitefly [ 22]. More whiteflies were attracted to TA+β-infected plants compared with the βC1 betasatellite mutant virus (TA+mβ)-infected plants under white light, but there were no significant changes of whitefly preference between TA+β-infected plants and TA+mβ-infected plants under darkness ( Fig 1B), suggesting that the viral βC1-mediated whitefly preference is light-dependent. We next performed whitefly two-choice assays using  βC1 transgenic Nb plants (βC1/Nb) in various light conditions. Due to the complicity of the tripartite interactions, we applied monochromatic red-light to represent high red: far-red (R:FR) light ratio and also far-red light to represent low R: FR, the latter mimics the poor light condition of plant competition for light. Different monochromatic light sources were used to determine which wavelength of light is essential for whitefly attraction. Whiteflies were more attracted to the βC1/Nb plants compared to wild-type Nb plants only under red light and white light, not in darkness, far-red light and blue light (Figs  1C and  S1A). Moreover, red light-induced whitefly attraction from βC1/Nb plants was disrupted by far-red light. These whitefly preference results under monochromatic lights agree with the field experiments [ 31], which encouraged us to design other experiments for explicit mechanisms of light effect on the tripartite interactions. To further confirm these results with another host plant, transgenic  Arabidopsis plants expressing  βC1 (βC1/At) were used to perform whitefly two-choice assays and the same result as in βC1/Nb plants was observed ( Fig 1D). Moreover, wild-type Col-0 plants under red light conferred stronger repellence to whitefly than that under darkness on wild-type Col-0 plants ( S2A Fig). These results demonstrate that red light plays a crucial role in whitefly preference for  βC1-expressing plants. Hemipterans lack red light photoreceptors, so red light likely cannot directly affect whitefly behaviors [ 32, 33]. We thus hypothesized that signals from the host plant mediate the red light-induced changes in whitefly preference for plants expressing  βC1. Our previous work showed that TYLCCNB βC1 contributes to the suppression of JA-regulated terpene biosynthesis and renders virus-infected plant more attractive to its whitefly vector [ 22]. Therefore, we examined the expression levels of  TPS genes under various monochromatic light conditions in  Arabidopsis. Only red light could induce the βC1-mediated suppression of  AtTPS10,  AtTPS14, and  AtTPS21 expression (Figs  1E,  S1B, and  S1C). We also found that red light induced higher expression of  AtTPS10 than darkness ( S2B Fig). These results reveal that βC1 inhibits the transcription of  TPS genes in a red light-dependent manner. To explore the potential mechanism underlying the interaction between βC1 and plant signaling under various light conditions, we first excluded the possible roles of light on the subcellular localization of βC1 protein or its transcript levels ( S3A and S3B Fig). We found that the fluorescences from YFP-fused βC1 in white light were more than that in darkness, suggesting that light promotes the accumulation of βC1 ( S3A Fig). We further observed that the abundance of βC1 not YFP protein was higher under red light than under darkness, far-red light and blue light (Figs  2A and  S3C). Furthermore, we detected the accumulation of βC1 protein in two stable transgenic  Arabidopsis lines expressing  βC1 ( 35S: myc-βC1 #1 and #2). The results show that compared to darkness, white light or red light promotes the stability of βC1 protein in stable transgenic plants ( Fig 2B). The profile of protein accumulation offered an explanation for the βC1-induced host preference in a red-light dependent manner. βC1 interacts with PIFs To explore how light signal influences βC1-induced whitefly attraction, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen for βC1 interactors in an  Arabidopsis cDNA library. This identified AtPIF3, which was first identified to act in the light transduction pathway and later as multiple signaling integrator [ 34], as a new βC1-targeted host factor. We next confirmed that βC1 interacts with all four of the  Arabidopsis PIF-quartet proteins (AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, or AtPIF5) by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays (Figs  2C and  S4A), further co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) assay confirmed the interaction between βC1 and AtPIF3  in vivo under both dark and light conditions (Figs  2D and  S4B). Taken together, these data suggest that βC1 interacts with PIFs independent of light in plants. PIFs contain a conserved bHLH domain that binds to DNA and mediates dimerization with other bHLH transcription factors to regulate downstream signaling, and another Active Phytochrome A/B-binding domain that interacts with phyA and phyB to sense upstream signaling [ 19]. To localize βC1-interacting domains, we constructed different AtPIF3 deletion derivatives fused with nEYFP and performed BiFC assays with βC1-cEYFP ( S4C Fig). The AtPIF3 fragment that contained the bHLH domain was sufficient to interact with βC1  in vivo ( Fig 2E), indicating that the interaction between βC1 and PIFs may influence the downstream signaling integrator roles of PIFs in cells. The PIFs mediate defense against whitefly in  Arabidopsis To investigate whether PIFs are involved in plant defense against insect vectors, we performed whitefly bioassays using Col-0 and  AtPIF3-overexpressing ( AtPIF3-OE) transgenic plants. Whiteflies laid fewer eggs and exhibited slower pupa development on  AtPIF3-OE transgenic plants than that on Col-0 plants ( Fig 3A and 3B). Conversely, they laid more eggs and exhibited faster pupa development on  pifq ( pif1/3/4/5) quadruple mutant than that on Col-0 plants ( Fig 3C and 3D), an observation is similar to that with  βC1-expressing  Arabidopsis plants [ 22]. These data suggest that PIFs are involved in plant defense against whitefly vector. Since TYLCCNB βC1 involved in whitefly preference in light-dependent ( Fig 1) and interacts with plant PIFs ( Fig 2), we performed whitefly two-choice assays to examine whether the PIFs have the same effects on whitefly preference as βC1. Consistent with the results with  βC1-expressing  Arabidopsis plants, the  pifq quadruple mutants were higher attractive to whiteflies than Col-0 plants under white or red light ( Fig 3E). The transcriptional levels of  TPS genes ( AtTPS10,  AtTPS14 and  AtTPS21) were significantly repressed in the  pifq mutant compared to those in Col-0 plants under white or red light (Figs  3F,  S5A and S5B). Moreover, compared with YFP@βC1-1/Nb plants (normalized to 100%), overexpression of  AtPIF3 or  AtPIF4 approximately decreased whitefly attraction rate to 50% under white light ( Fig 3G and 3H), suggesting the overexpression of  PIFs could partially rescue the susceptibility of  βC1 overexpression plants against whitefly. Taken together, these results imply that PIFs control the plant terpene-based host preference to whitefly in a light-dependent manner. βC1 suppresses PIFs activity by interfering with its dimerization PIFs are bHLH transcription factors that directly regulate gene expression by binding to a core G-box motif (CACGTG) and G-box-like motif (CANNTG) [ 34, 35]. We wondered whether PIFs directly regulate the expression of  TPS genes and involve in the terpene-mediated whitefly defense response. There are some G-box-like elements (CANNTG) in the promoter of  TPS genes, which are distributed in several regions ( Fig 4A, 4C and 4E). We performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using  AtPIF3-OE plants. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that region II (one G-box-like motif 0.7 kb upstream of the transcription start site) of  AtTPS10, region I of  AtTPS14 (one G-box-like motif 1.4 kb upstream of the transcription start site) or region II of  AtTPS21 (two G-box-like motif 0.8 kb upstream of the transcription start site) was significantly enriched in  AtPIF3-OE lines relative to Col-0 plants ( Fig 4B, 4D and 4F). These data indicate that AtPIF3 directly binds to the promoter of  TPS genes and regulates its expression in  Arabidopsis. Next, we examined whether βC1 affects the trans-activity of PIFs via a construct containing the  AtTPS10 promoter with  luciferase ( LUC) as a reporter, and YFP-AtPIFs (AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, or AtPIF5) as effectors ( Fig 4G).  AtTPS10 promoter:  LUC was transiently expressed with the indicated effector plus βC1 in Nb leaf cells.  Fig 4H shows that each of AtPIFs (AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, and AtPIF5) significantly increased the LUC activity, whereas βC1 decreased AtPIFs-induced LUC activity at different degrees. Therefore, the interaction between βC1 and PIFs blocked the ability of PIFs to regulate  TPS genes. PIF3 activates downstream gene expression by forming homodimers and heterodimers with other PIF-related bHLH transcription factors [ 19]. The interaction between βC1 and the bHLH domain of AtPIF3 ( Fig 2E) raised the possibility that βC1 competes with the bHLH domain to interfere with AtPIFs dimerization. A modified BiFC assay was used to test this hypothesis. In cells co-expressing βC1, the interaction signal strength of AtPIF3-AtPIF3 or AtPIF3-AtPIF4 decreased to approximately half of its original intensity (Figs  5A–5C and  S5C), suggesting that βC1 may interfere with PIF dimerization. Moreover,  in vitro competitive pull-down assays showed that βC1 interferes with homodimerization of AtPIF4-AtPIF4 and heterodimerization of AtPIF3-AtPIF4 ( Fig 5D and 5E). These results provide evidences that βC1 blocks PIFs dimerization by competing with the binding bHLH domain and thereby suppresses the trans-activity of PIFs. PIFs interact with MYC2 to integrate light and JA signals and coordinately regulate host preference of whitefly PIF-quartet integrates signals from multiple signaling pathways, including light and JA signals, to respond to the diverse stresses and developmental processes [ 19, 34, 36]. Previous study has reported that AtPIF4 interacts with AtMYC2, and JA inhibits the function of PIF4 partially through MYC2 in  Arabidopsis [ 37]. To confirm that JA and light signaling work cooperatively to regulate plant defense against whitefly, we firstly investigated whether MYC2 associates with PIFs in plants. BiFC assays showed that AtMYC2 interacts with AtPIF3 and AtPIF4 ( S6A Fig). And Co-IP assays confirmed that βC1, AtMYC2 and AtPIF4 proteins are in a complex ( Fig 6A). Thus, we generated a  pifq/myc2-1 mutant by crossing the  pifq mutant with the  myc2-1 mutant. The transcriptional levels of  AtTPS10 in the  pifq/myc2-1 mutant were additively reduced compared to the parental lines under red light conditions ( Fig 6B). And the  pifq/myc2-1 mutant was higher attractive to whiteflies than Col-0 and  pifq mutant under white light ( Fig 6C and 6D). The results suggest that AtPIFs and AtMYC2 coordinately regulate the expression of  AtTPS10 and whitefly attraction. Since the individual AtPIF4 or AtMYC2 could directly bind and promote  AtTPS10 expression, we next tested whether the AtPIF4-AtMYC2 interaction has a synergetic effect on downstream genes expression regulation. Unexpected, we found that the heterdimerazation of AtPIF4-AtMYC2 in fact even reduces the transactivation activity when co-expressed with AtPIF4 and AtMYC2 compared to AtMYC2 alone under white light ( Fig 6E), indicating an antagonistic effect of heterodimer formation of AtPIF4-AtMYC2 on expression of  AtTPS10. Next we tested the effect of viral βC1 on the AtPIF4-AtMYC2 interaction and found that the interaction signal of AtPIF4-AtMYC2 was increased by two-fold when co-expressed with βC1, but not with β-glucuronidase (GUS) ( Fig 7A and 7B). To test whether the function of βC1 as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR) increases the interaction of AtPIF4 and AtMYC2, we used the mimic phosphorylation of Ser-33 of the βC1 protein (serine to aspartate, βC1 S33D) as a negative control to perform competitive BiFC experiments. Because it has been reported that βC1 S33D protein impairs its functions as VSR [ 38]. There are no significant differences between βC1 protein and βC1 S33D protein in effects on the interaction signal of AtPIF4-cEYFP and nEYFP-AtMYC2 (Figs  7C,  7D sand  S6B). These data suggest that βC1 functions as a linker between two bHLH transcription factors AtPIF4 and AtMYC2, which is independent on βC1 known function as VSR. Competitive pull-down assay also supported the idea that βC1 indeed bridges the interaction of AtPIF4-AtMYC2 ( Fig 7E). One hypothesis was then raised that the self-interaction of AtPIFs or AtMYCs promotes their transcriptional activity, but the formation of heterodimer of AtPIF4-AtMYC2 inhibits the MYC2 transcriptional activity. Once plants are infected by begomovirus, the linker-βC1 even exacerbates their activities. For that end, we coexpressed βC1 and found that βC1 could dampen the activator activities either by single AtPIF4 or AtMYC2 or coexpression of these two bHLH transcription factors ( Fig 6E). To further explore the function of JA signals in βC1- or PIFs-mediated whitefly host preference, we performed whitefly two-choice assays using  βC1-expressing and  pifq mutant plants with MeJA treatment in darkness. The loss of whitefly preference for βC1/At and  pifq mutant plants under darkness was rescued by MeJA application ( Fig 8A and 8B). Accordingly, the expression levels of  AtTPS10,  AtTPS14 and  AtTPS21 in two βC1/At lines and  pifq plants were also dramatically decreased by MeJA under darkness ( Fig 8C–8H). These results demonstrate that JA and light signals integrally modify begomovirus-whitefly mutualism.","Environments such as light condition influence the spread of infectious diseases by affecting insect vector behavior. However, whether and how light affects the host defense which further affects insect preference and performance, remains unclear, nor has been demonstrated how pathogens co-adapt light condition to facilitate vector transmission. We previously showed that begomoviral βC1 inhibits MYC2-mediated jasmonate signaling to establish plant-dependent mutualism with its insect vector. Here we show red-light as an environmental catalyzer to promote mutualism of whitefly-begomovirus by stabilizing βC1, which interacts with PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) transcription factors. PIFs positively control plant defenses against whitefly by directly binding to the promoter of terpene synthase genes and promoting their transcription. Moreover, PIFs interact with MYC2 to integrate light and jasmonate signaling and regulate the transcription of terpene synthase genes. However, begomovirus encoded βC1 inhibits PIFs' and MYC2' transcriptional activity via disturbing their dimerization, thereby impairing plant defenses against whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses. Our results thus describe how a viral pathogen hijacks host external and internal signaling to enhance the mutualistic relationship with its insect vector.",,"['Fig', 'light', 'plants', 'whitefly', 'Figs', 'red light', 'whitefly preference', 'PIFs', 'white light', 'red']","[betasatellite-encoded βC1, TA+β-infected, TA+β-infected, βC1, TA+β-infected, βC1 betasatellite, TA+β-infected, TA+mβ-infected, βC1/Nb, FR, βC1/Nb, βC1/Nb, βC1/At, βC1/Nb, S2A, JA-regulated terpene, S2B, βC1, βC1, βC1, S3A, S3B, βC1, βC1, S3A, βC1, YFP, βC1, βC1, βC1-induced, βC1, βC1, AtPIF3, βC1, AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, AtPIF5, BiFC, βC1, AtPIF3  , βC1, Phytochrome A/B-binding, phyA, phyB, AtPIF3, nEYFP, BiFC, βC1-cEYFP, S4C, AtPIF3, βC1  , βC1, PIFs, βC1, S5B, YFP@βC1-1/Nb, βC1, G-box, CACGTG, terpene-mediated whitefly, G-box-like elements, 4F, AtPIF3, βC1, PIFs, LUC, YFP-AtPIFs, AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, AtPIF5, βC1, AtPIFs, AtPIF1, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, AtPIF5, LUC, βC1, βC1, PIF3, heterodimers, PIF-related bHLH, βC1, AtPIF3, βC1, AtPIFs, BiFC, βC1, AtPIF3-AtPIF3, AtPIF3-AtPIF4, βC1, βC1, AtPIF4-AtPIF4, AtPIF3-AtPIF4, βC1, MYC2, AtPIF4, AtMYC2, JA, PIF4, MYC2, MYC2, AtMYC2, AtPIF3, AtPIF4, S6A, βC1, AtMYC2, AtPIF4, pifq/myc2-1, pifq/myc2-1, pifq/myc2-1, AtPIFs, AtMYC2, AtPIF4, AtMYC2, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, AtPIF4, AtMYC2, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, βC1, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, βC1, β-glucuronidase, GUS, 7B, βC1, AtPIF4, AtMYC2, Ser-33, βC1 protein, βC1 S33D, BiFC, βC1 S33D, VSR [ 38, βC1, βC1 S33D, AtPIF4-cEYFP, nEYFP-AtMYC2 (Figs  7C, βC1, AtPIF4, AtMYC2, βC1, βC1, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, AtPIFs, AtMYCs, AtPIF4-AtMYC2, MYC2, linker-βC1, βC1, βC1, AtMYC2, βC1-, βC1/At, βC1/At lines, begomovirus-whitefly]","['TPS', 'AtTPS10,', 'AtTPS14,', 'AtTPS21', 'AtTPS10', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'AtTPS10,', 'AtTPS14', 'AtTPS21)', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'AtTPS10,', 'AtTPS14', 'AtTPS21', 'TPS', 'AtTPS10', 'AtTPS10', 'TPS', 'AtTPS10', 'AtTPS10', 'AtTPS10', 'AtTPS10.', 'AtTPS10,', 'AtTPS14', 'AtTPS21']",[],[],
142,142,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7890063\eupmc_result.json,PMC7890063,"Results and discussion Plant metabolites are well recognized and explored. In contrast, the biosynthetic capability of fungi is relatively undervalued. Fungi (>3 million species) have enormous diversity and are rich in biocatalysts and secondary metabolites 15–  17. In particular, fungi produce a large portfolio of volatile terpenoids, including sesquiterpenes (e.g., β-caryophyllene and cubenol 18) and monoterpenes (linalool 14, limonene 14, and 1,8-cineole 19). To our knowledge, to date, there are only a few fungal monoterpene synthases reported in the literature (Hyp3, a 1,8-cineole synthase 19 and the very recently identified PpSTS25, a bifunctional myrcene/linalool synthase 20). Here we address this gap and specifically explored fungal linalool synthases. Identification of linalool synthase in agaric mushroom As  A. aegerita is known to produce linalool and its genome has been recently sequenced 21, we tried to identify the linalool synthase in its genome. In our previous study, we identified 11 putative sesquiterpene synthases and 9 of them are functional and produced various sesquiterpenes but not linalool 3. A re-evaluation of the raw genomic data led to an additional putative TPS sequence (AAE3_109435, accession number MN954676). The gene exists in the Illumina sequencing data, whereas it is absent in the PacBio results. PCR amplification of the AAE3_109435 with subsequent sequencing confirmed the presence of the gene in the genome (Supplementary Fig.  S1). The subsequent expression of AAE3_109435 in a GPP-accumulating  E. coli that co-expressed the native enzymes DXS, IDI, and ispA_S80F mutant (GPPS). The resulting strain (GPPS+9435) produced the acyclic monoterpene linalool as the main product and small amount of nerolidol (Fig.  2 and mass spectra in Supplementary Fig.  S2). Geraniol was detected in GPPS+9435 as well as in its control strain (GPPS_ctrl), indicating that geraniol is not the product of AAE3_109435 but instead that of native  E. coli enzymes (such as PhoA, a phosphatase, and NudB, a Nudix hydrolase 22). Furthermore, AAE3_109435 was expressed in the  E. coli strain that accumulates FPP by overexpressing DXS and IDI (without ispA_S80F), and the strain was named ‘FPPS+9435.’ Its main product (>96% regarding the peak area of all the detected terpenes) was nerolidol and only traces of linalool could be detected (Fig.  2A). The control strain (FPPS_ctrl) with an empty vector produced neither linalool nor nerolidol. The results clearly proved that the TPS coded by AAE3_109435 is a bifunctional LNS, which is able to convert FPP into nerolidol and GPP into linalool. Accordingly, it is named Aa.LNS. Furthermore, the linalool produced by Aa.LNS is mainly ( R)-linalool (95% ee, Fig.  2B). Bioinformatics prediction of other fungal LNSs Aa.LNS was used to probe other potential fungal LNSs. The first focus was on  A. pediades, another sequenced fungal species of the genus  Agrocybe. Linalool was detected in the headspace of  A. pediades cultures grown in malt extract medium in our laboratory. A blast search of Aa.LNS against the  A. pediades genome using the online tool of the Joint Genome Institute ( https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Agrped1/Agrped1.home.html) resulted in 11 TPS homologs (Fig.  2C). To improve the prediction confidence, we combined two strategies: (1) full-sequence alignment (Fig.  2C and protein sequence in Supplementary Data  1) and (2) comparison of predicted active sites (Supplementary Tables  S1 and  S2, the results were analyzed with 4LXW (Epi-isozizaene synthase from  Streptomyces coelicolor) and 5NX5 (PDB ID, the bacterial linalool synthase from  Streptomyces clavuligerus, or Sc.LNS) as templates). Here 4LXW and 5NX5 are chosen based on the two criteria: (1) the higher sequence similarity to Aa.LNS and (2) the availability of large ligands (either substrate or product analogs) in the crystal structures, which can facilitate the identification of the active-site residues. Four TPS homologs (Agrped1_820868, Agrped1_694262, Agrped1_689671, and Agrped1_689675) were found to be closely related to Aa.LNS (Fig.  2C). It was hypothesized that the two enzymes Agrped1_820868 and Agrped1_694262 are more similar to Agr8 (a γ-muurolene/β-cadinene synthase) 3 as all three enzymes share almost identical active sites based on our algorithm (Supplementary Table  S1). Hence, we studied Agrped1_689671 and Agrped1_689675. As predicted, the strain expressing Agrped1_689671 produced linalool and nerolidol (renamed Ap.LNS) similar to Aa.LNS (Fig.  2D). Surprisingly, linalool was the sole terpene product of the  E. coli clone expressing Agrped1_689675, indicating that it is a monofunctional linalool synthase (renamed Ap.LS). This attributes to the high specificity of Ap.LS, which is underpinned by the fact that FPP is more abundant in microbial cells than GPP 13. The high specificity of Ap.LS is very interesting, possibly due to steric hindrance of some amino acid residues surrounding the binding pocket to the larger substrate FPP. And we will look into this in the later section of this article. In addition, Ap.LS produced the enantiopure ( R)-linalool (Fig.  2B). Next, we asked whether we could use Ap.LS to probe other fungal linalool synthases. We carried out a UniProt BLAST search of Ap.LS and collected those hits with the highest alignment score (score >700, Supplementary Fig.  S3): three from  Galerina marginata (Galma_223690, UniProt ID A0A067THX9; Galma_63556, A0A067T8I8; Galma_266794, A0A067T571); two from  Hypholoma sublateritium (Hypsu1_148365, A0A0D2NH86; Hypsu1_148385, A0A0D2NA50), and one from  Hebeloma cylindrosporum (M413_27416, A0A0C2YLE7). Four of them (Galma_223690, Galma_63556, Hypsu1_148365, and Hypsu1_148385) clustered into a branch or subgroup with Ap.LS and Ap.LNS in both analyses using full-sequence and active-site alignment (Fig.  3A, B and protein sequence in Supplementary Data  1). Overall, the six homologs share >90% identity of active-site residues (Supplementary Tables  S1 and  S2). Particularly, the active sites of Hypsu1_148385 and Galma_223690 show 95% (36/38) and 97–100% (37–38/38) identity with that of Ap.LS and Ap.LNS, respectively, indicating that they are potential fungal LNSs. The other two amino acid sequences (Galma_266794 and M413_27416) were more closely related to Agr8, with as high as 95% active-site identity (Supplementary Table  S1). Thus it was hypothesized that they were more likely to produce 1,10 cyclization products of FPP, e.g., muurolene, cadinene. This hypothesis was validated by the expression of Galma_223690, Hypsu1_148385, or Galma_266794 in the FPP-accumulating  E. coli. As predicted, Galma_223690 and Hypsu1_148385 were found to be bifunctional LNSs (Fig.  3C), thus renamed Gm.LNS and Hs.LNS, respectively. Moreover, like Agr8, the strain expressing Galma_266794 produced germacrene D (1,10 cyclization) as the main product and a few minor products (γ-muurolene and (+)-δ-cadinene, Supplementary Fig.  S4), thus validating our hypothesis. Here the synergistic use of BLAST search, full-sequence alignment, and active-site alignment was explored. As such, we achieved a relatively high predictability of hunting for biocatalysts of the same function (e.g., linalool synthases). Such a method can be potentially applied for the identification of all kinds of enzymes. BLAST search helps with identifying overall similar enzymes that form our initial screening candidates. Full-sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree facilitate the classification of enzymes. Different classes often have distinct catalytic functions (e.g., different cyclization positions). Active-site prediction further supplements the prediction with two main roles. One is to filter out those enzyme candidates with incomplete binding pockets (e.g., Agr11 is missing the NSE triad, Supplementary Tables  S1 and  S2). The other is to complement the enzyme classification of full-sequence alignment. This is based on the hypothesis that enzymes of the same function may have overall low similarity but more conserved active sites. For example, the Galma_266794 shares comparable full-sequence similarities with Ap.LS (61%) and Agr8 (62%); however, it has much higher active-site identity with Agr8 (95%) than with Ap.LS (71%, Supplementary Table  S1). Indeed, the products of Galma_266794 are similar to that of Agr8. Purification and characterization of fungal linalool synthases and LNSs To date, a number of plant linalool synthases and LNSs have been identified. However, only one bacterial LNS from  S. clavuligerus was recently identified 11, which only shares 15.2% identity with Ap.LS (Supplementary Fig.  S5). With the fungal enzymes studied in this work, linalool synthases and LNSs in three kingdoms have been identified. Next, we sought to compare their catalytic activities and mechanisms by in vitro, in vivo assays, sequence alignments, and three-dimensional (3D) structural models. Protein purification is the prerequisite to study the in vitro kinetics of the fungal enzymes. Though all the five bacterial strains expressing fungal enzymes produced linalool, their expression levels in  E. coli were largely different. Aa.LNS had the highest expression level, followed by Gm.LNS, Ap.LNS, and Ap.LS. The expression of Hs.LNS (Hypsu_148385) was so low that it was not detectable in a protein gel (Supplementary Fig.  S6A). As Aa.LNS had the highest expression level and Ap.LS is the only specific monoterpene synthase, they were chosen as the representatives of fungal LNS and linalool synthase for further studies. However, none of them was soluble based on solubility analysis with B-PER II reagent (Thermo Scientific™) (Supplementary Fig.  S6A). Many approaches were tested but failed to improve their solubility (such as abiotic condition optimization: lowering incubation temperature, tuning inducer dosages, media additives, and protein fusion). Refolding of insoluble fraction could be another solution which we did not test because it is very time-consuming to optimize the best conditions. The N-terminal fusion of Aa.LNS with a maltose-binding protein or thioredoxin did not help (Supplementary Fig.  S6B). Different chaperone systems (DnaK-dnaJ, GroES-GroEL) and trigger factor (TF) in  E. coli were further tested. It was found that TF chaperone could slightly improve the solubility of the synthases. With the optimal condition (3.3 mM arabinose to induce TF chaperone and 0.1 mM IPTG to induce Aa.LNS, Supplementary Fig.  S7) and further separation by size exclusion chromatography, we managed to purify enough soluble Aa.LNS for in vitro characterization. Yet its purity was quite low with ~16.3% (Fig.  4A and full gel image at Supplementary Fig.  S10). In contrast, relatively high purity of soluble Ap.LS (~71.2%) was obtained with the same experimental conditions (Fig.  4B and full gel image at Supplementary Fig.  S11). Consistent with the  E. coli cultures producing the respective synthase, purified enzymes reconfirmed that Aa.LNS can use FPP and GPP to produce nerolidol and linalool, respectively. However, Ap.LS was only active with GPP but not with FPP (Fig.  4). Based on the data in Fig.  4A, B (Supplementary Data  2 and  3),  Km and  kcat values of Ap.LS and Aa.LNS were calculated. The  Km and  kcat values of Aa.LNS for FPP were 9.0 ± 2.3 μM and 3.3 ± 0.3 min −1, respectively, and slightly lower for GPP with 6.7 ± 4.6 μM and 0.5 ± 0.1 min −1, respectively (Table  1). The  Km value of Ap.LS for GPP with 3.8 ± 0.7 μM was slightly lower than that for Aa.LNS, whereas  kcat was much higher with 6 ± 0.3 min −1. To compare the catalytic efficiencies among the known linalool synthases and LNSs,  kcat/ Km value of Ap.LS was the highest, which is about 21-fold, 29-fold, 3-fold, and 4-fold higher than that of Aa.LNS, La.LS (Q2XSC5) from  Lavandula angustifolia (Lavender) 5, Ma.LS (Q8H2B4) from  Mentha aquatica23, and of the bacterial Sc.LNS 11, respectively. As for Aa.LNS as a nerolidol synthase, although the  kcat value of Aa.LNS for FPP was more than five times lower compared to the bacterial one, the  Km value was similar to that of the bacterial Sc.LNS 11 and about half as that of Zm.LNS from  Zea mays (Maize) (Table  1) 24. In vivo activity comparison of linalool synthases and LNSs from three kingdoms and applications in linalool production Due to potential issues such as poor expression and solubility when expressed in cells and the localization difference (cytosolic/membrane bound in vivo versus a one-pot aqueous reaction), the advantages of in vitro enzyme kinetics (Table  1) may not be readily transferable into cellular applications, such as metabolic engineering, where in vivo activities are more critical than in vitro ones. To test the best candidate for microbial linalool production, our previously engineered  E. coli strain was used to compare linalool synthases from three kingdoms: Ap.LS, Sc.LNS, and Cb.LS from  Clarkia breweri (Q96376) as representatives for fungi, bacteria, and plantae, respectively. They were separately cloned into pET-11a vector (Novagen). Together with a p15A vector carrying the whole mevalonate pathway genes 2, the bacterial strains grown in ZYM media produced linalool at 381.2, 8.7 and 1.3 mg/L for fungal, bacterial, and plant linalool synthases, respectively (Fig.  4C). The linalool yield using Ap.LS (fungal) is about 44- and 287-fold as high as that using Sc.LNS (bacterial) and Cb.LS (plant), respectively. As the bacterial densities for different strains are similar, around 10–12 (Fig.  4D), the high yield of linalool in the Ap.LS strain was because of its relatively high in vivo activity (here we refer to the total activity that is the result of both the specific activity and the amount of active enzyme) but not of biomass. A previous study also supported that the bacterial Sc.LNS is better than plant linalool synthases in linalool production in terrific broth (TB) media 10. In the same TB media, the linalool titers reached 601.2 mg/L for Ap.LS stain, about 65% higher than previously reported using Sc.LNS 10. Our study demonstrated that fungal Ap.LS is even superior to the bacterial one, in both activity and selectivity. Although Sc.LNS has a higher activity than plant Cb.LS, it prefers FPP (lower  Km and higher  kcat) to GPP as the substrate 11. Therefore, Sc.LNS produced a larger amount of nerolidol than linalool in  E. coli whose cytosol contained both FPP and GPP; in contrast, Ap.LS produced 100% linalool. High activity contributes to high titers, rates, and yields (TRYs) of linalool production and low manufacturing cost. High specificity would greatly simplify the downstream purification process and further reduce the overall production cost. The superior activity and selectivity of Ap.LS make it more suitable for microbial production of linalool than its plant and bacterial counterparts. Thus, this study sets up a foundation for future works of linalool bioproduction that is greener, safer, sustainable, and of exceptional enantiopurity (( R)-linalool), as compared to chemical synthesis. However, to translate into commercial applications, more studies are required to further improve the linalool TRYs and to overcome the toxicity issue of linalool, which can be addressed by genetic engineering (e.g., metabolic engineering, efflux transporter engineering 25), directed evolution, and bioprocess developments (e.g., in situ product remove fermentation using suitable liquid solvents and/or solid absorbents) 26. Structural comparison of linalool synthases and LNSs from three kingdoms (plants, fungi, and bacteria) Next, we generated a phylogenetic tree with 35 plant enzymes (including 4 nerolidol synthases, 9 linalool synthases and 22 LNSs), 1 bacterial LNS (D5SL78), and 9 fungal enzymes (Supplementary Table  S3). The enzymes were clearly separated into two major clades (one is plant, clade 1, and the other is microbial, clade 2, Fig.  5). The bacterial LNS was closer to the fungal ones, in clade 2. Specifically, the sequence identity among fungal, bacterial, and plant LNSs or linalool synthases are only 8–15%, which includes those metal-binding sites (Supplementary Fig.  S5). Overall, plant linalool synthases/LNSs are larger with 500–900 amino acids than microbial ones with 300–400 amino acids. One particular enzyme D8RNZ9, which is a LNS isolated from the nonseed plant  Selaginella moellendorffii (Spikemoss) 27, is more closely related to the bacterial LNS than plant LNSs. It was hypothesized that it could stem from horizontal gene transfer from microbes to plants or that seed plants lost these LNS enzymes during evolution from nonseed plants 27. The phylogenetic tree indicates the evolutionary divergence of fungal, bacterial, and plant linalool synthases and LNSs. Subsequently, we compared the protein structures of the linalool synthases from the fungus ( A. pediades), the bacterium ( S. clavuligerus), and the plant ( M. aquatica). The crystal structure of Sc.LNS is 5NX5 (PDB ID) 10. The homolog models of Ap.LS and Ma.LS (Q8H2B4) were built based on the crystal structure of (+)-bornyl diphosphate synthase from  Salvia officinalis (1N1B/1N21) 28 and 1,8-cineole synthase from  S. clavuligerus (5NX7) 10, respectively. As the sequence similarity between Ap.LS and 1,8-cineole is only 20.3% (and active-site identity is 49%), the Ap.LS model may have some deviations from its real structure. Nevertheless, their active-site regions are highly conserved (Fig.  6A). Fungal linalool synthase and bacterial linalool synthase are much more similar to each other than to plant linalool synthase in both active-site regions (Supplementary Table  S4) and overall structures (Fig.  6B–D). As a typical plant monoterpene synthase, Ma.LS has two domains (α and β domains) and thus is noticeably larger than the other two synthases with active site residing only in the α domain (catalytic domain, Supplementary Fig.  S8). In contrast, microbial linalool synthases, Sc.LNS and Ap.LS, are similar to typical class I terpene cyclases with a single domain, despite with acyclic products (Supplementary Fig.  S9). Both GPP (its analog, 2-fluorogeranyl diphosphate) and FPP were docked into the three models. We mainly analyzed the interactions of the three linalool synthases with GPP. With 9 hydrophobic interactions with GPP, Ap.LS had the highest amount, as compared to 7 of Sc.LNS and 6 of Ma.LS (Fig.  6B–D). Except for the negatively charged pyrophosphate (Ppi) head, GPP is largely hydrophobic, thus these hydrophobic interactions may contribute to the high activity of Ap.LS. The number of hydrogen bonds identified for the three enzymes was similar. In addition, Ap.LS had the highest binding affinity (−7.6 kcal/mol) to GPP, followed by Sc.LNS (−7 kcal/mol) and Ma.LS (−6.4 kcal/mol). The binding affinity inversely correlated with the  Km values of the three enzymes (Table  1), where higher binding affinity contributed to a lower  Km value. As compared for Ap.LS and Ap.LNS, Ap.LS has higher binding affinity to GPP than Ap.LNS (−7.3 kcal/mol) but lower binding affinity (−8.5 kcal/mol) to FPP than Ap.LNS (−9.0 kcal/mol). The binding affinity data are nicely correlated with their difference in monoterpene and sesquiterpene activities. Furthermore, we superimposed the 3D structures of the active sites of the three enzymes (Fig.  7A and Supplementary Table  S4). Residues in the binding pocket of plant linalool synthase showed the greatest divergence (green regions, Fig.  7A), although structure folding remains conserved. Overall, as shown in the gray regions (Fig.  7A) and highlighted in Supplementary Table  S4, there were 8 conserved residues among the three enzymes, including the aspartate-rich motif, D(D/E)XXD, responsible for Mg 2+ cofactor and substrate binding 1 and NSE triad, (N/D)Dxx(S/T)xxxE, responsible for the substrate binding and coordination of the diphosphate and trinuclear Mg 2+ [PPi-(Mg 2+) 3] cluster 1. All these structural analyses partially explain the activity difference among the three linalool synthases from different kingdoms. Nevertheless, there are other factors that might also contribute to the high in vivo activity of Ap.LS in  E. coli, such as the non-active-site residues, protein expression, and solubility (Supplementary Fig.  S6). Through the structural comparison of linalool synthases from different species, we have observed that the binding affinities of enzymes to the substrates (GPP or FPP) nicely correlated with their activities, especially the  Km values, where higher binding affinity typically contributes to a lower  Km value. However, it is much more complex to explain the difference in  kcat values, due to the large structural difference among these enzymes. To address these, molecular dynamics simulation is advantageous in evaluating the dynamic interactions between enzyme and substrates, intermediates, and products. To do that, it is more appropriate to use the accurate crystal structures of these enzymes, which is one of our future works. Mechanism study on the Ap.LS selectivity Lastly, we attempted to understand the specificity of Ap.LS as compared to other fungal LNSs. Particularly, Ap.LNS and Ap.LS share the highest identity 77.9%; hence, we compared their difference of residues surrounding the substrate-binding pocket. In total, five residues were found to be different (Fig.  7B and Supplementary Table  S5): (1) in the Ppi head region (A59:S58, E316:Q315, I153:V152, here, the former and latter residues refer to that of Ap.LS and Ap.LNS, respectively, especially that E316 is expected to have charged interactions with the Ppi group of GPP/FPP); (2) in the FPP tail region (L60:M59, which could affect the interaction with FPP); and (3) in GPP tail region (G181:A180, which might affect flexibility of helix where the tail end of GPP resides). A series of single mutants were constructed for Ap.LS, A59S, L60M, G181A, and E316Q. However, none of these single mutants had effect on the selectivity of Ap.LS (Fig.  7E). We speculated that the specificity might be the synergistic result of multiple residues. The region A59–L60 was particularly interesting, as A59 and L60 are in close proximity to both the Ppi head and hydrocarbon tail of FPP (Fig.  7D). Indeed, the combination of A59S and L60M mutations resulted in the production of a trace amount of nerolidol, ~2% of total amount of linalool and nerolidol produced (Fig.  7C, E), which indicated that the two mutations are sufficient to convert Ap.LS from a monofunctional linalool synthase to a bifunctional LNS. Adjacent to A59–L60, another residue is also different between Ap.LS (V61) and Ap.LNS (I60). Although single mutation V61I had no effect on the selectivity of the wild-type Ap.LS, the introduction of V61I enhanced the nerolidol production by 12-fold (~40% of total linalool and nerolidol produced) and decreased linalool production by 45% on the basis of the double mutant A59S–L60M (Fig.  7C, E). It seems that the mutation L60M–A59S favors sesquiterpene activity (nerolidol formation) by stabilizing the ligand in a favorable position (A59S) and by promoting the easier leave of the Ppi group from the binding pocket (L60M, Fig.  7D). The third mutation V61I further enhances the effect by pushing M60 and S59 closer to FPP (Fig.  7D). In addition, we also combined the mutations of two regions and obtained the quadruple mutant A59S–L60M–V61I–E316Q; however, it did not further increase nerolidol production. Furthermore, we observed that the wild-type Gm.LNS, whose corresponding residues are more similar to those 59–61 of Ap.LS (S59:A59, L60:L60, V61:V61, Supplementary Fig.  S9), produced the highest amount of linalool (15%) among all the wild-type fungal LNSs (Fig.  3C). As such, we concluded that the region residues (A59–V61) play an essential role for the high specificity of Ap.LS. Lastly, we further tested whether the mutation of the same region could change the selectivity of Ap.LNS to produce only linalool. By introducing 5 mutations (S58A+M59L+I60V+T62P+V63L, or “58–63” mutant in Fig.  7F) or 6 mutations (S58A+M59L+I60V+T62P+V63L+E64G, or “58–64” mutant), linalool percentage was increased from 11% (wild type) to 86% (“58–64” mutant). However, none of the mutation could completely eliminate the nerolidol production, indicating that additional residues are also playing roles in regulating the selectivity. Here, aided by structural comparison of Ap.LS and Ap.LNS, we managed to identify the key residues that alter the selectivity of Ap.LS. The success here has two broad meanings. First, such a structure-based method is of general application in understanding the catalytic mechanism. Our method works even without protein crystal structures but using homology model. And recent achievement by the Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2 ( https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology) can further support our method. Second, the identification of key residues inspires future studies, such as the rational design and engineering of linalool synthases, nerolidol synthases, or bifunctional linalool and nerolidol synthases. More broadly, it might also encourage studies in understanding the selectivities of various TPSs. It was known that some are highly specific and have only a single product, whereas others have multiple products, particularly, the γ-humulene synthase from  Abies grandis, which generates 52 different sesquiterpenes 29. The underlying catalytic mechanism is fascinating but not fully understood. Our study here provides some insights, and further research is required.","Enzymes empower chemical industries and are the keystone for metabolic engineering. For example, linalool synthases are indispensable for the biosynthesis of linalool, an important fragrance used in 60-80% cosmetic and personal care products. However, plant linalool synthases have low activities while expressed in microbes. Aided by bioinformatics analysis, four linalool/nerolidol synthases (LNSs) from various Agaricomycetes were accurately predicted and validated experimentally. Furthermore, we discovered a linalool synthase (Ap.LS) with exceptionally high levels of selectivity and activity from Agrocybe pediades, ideal for linalool bioproduction. It effectively converted glucose into enantiopure (R)-linalool in Escherichia coli, 44-fold and 287-fold more efficient than its bacterial and plant counterparts, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the divergent evolution paths for plant, bacterial and fungal linalool synthases. More critically, structural comparison provided catalytic insights into Ap.LS superior specificity and activity, and mutational experiments validated the key residues responsible for the specificity.",,"['Supplementary Fig.', 'Fig.', 'linalool synthases', 'linalool', 'Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary', 'Ap.LS', 'synthases', 'FPP', 'GPP']","[β-caryophyllene, PpSTS25, AAE3_109435, MN954676, AAE3_109435, AAE3_109435, ispA_S80F mutant, GPPS, GPPS+9435, GPPS+9435, GPPS_ctrl, AAE3_109435, PhoA, NudB, AAE3_109435, ’ Its, FPPS_ctrl, AAE3_109435, https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Agrped1/Agrped1.home.html, 4LXW (Epi-isozizaene synthase, 5NX5 (PDB ID, 4LXW, 5NX5, Agrped1_820868, Agrped1_694262, Agrped1_689671, Agrped1_689675, Agrped1_694262, Agr8, Agrped1_689671, Agrped1_689675, Agrped1_689671, Ap, Agrped1_689675, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, Galma_223690, A0A067THX9, Galma_63556, A0A067T8I8, Galma_266794, A0A067T571, Hypsu1_148365, A0A0D2NH86, Hypsu1_148385, A0A0D2NA50, M413_27416, A0A0C2YLE7, Galma_223690, Galma_63556, Hypsu1_148365, Ap, Ap, B, Hypsu1_148385, Galma_223690 show 95, 97–100, Ap, Ap, Galma_266794, M413_27416, Agr8, Galma_223690, Hypsu1_148385, Galma_266794, Galma_223690, Hypsu1_148385, Agr8, Galma_266794, Agr11, NSE, Ap, Agr8, Agr8, Ap, Agr8, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, B-PER II reagent, thioredoxin, DnaK-dnaJ, TF chaperone, TF chaperone, Ap, ~71.2, Ap, B (Supplementary Data  2, Ap, 3.3 ± , −1, −1, Ap, −1, Ap, Q8H2B4, cytosolic/membrane, Ap, Novagen, Ap, 10–12, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, TRYs, Ap, 8–15, 500–900 amino, Ap, Q8H2B4, Ap, Ap, α, β, α domain, Ap, class I terpene cyclases, Ap, Ap, Ap, −7.6 , −7, −6.4 , Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, −7.3 , −8.5 , Ap, −9.0 , D(D/E)XXD, Mg 2+, NSE, (N/D)Dxx(S/T)xxxE, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, Ap, A59:S58, E316:Q315, I153:V152, Ap, Ap, Ppi, L60:M59, G181:A180, Ap, A59S, G181A, Ap, A59–L60, FPP (, A59S, Ap, A59–L60, Ap, Ap, V61I, Ap, V61I, L60M–A59S, Ppi, V61I, M60, S59, A59S–L60M–V61I–E316Q, 59–61, Ap, S59:A59, L60:L60, V61:V61, Ap, Ap, S58A+M59L+I60V+T62P+V63L, “58–63”, S58A+M59L+I60V+T62P+V63L+E64G, “58–64”, “58–64”, Ap, Ap, Ap, DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPSs.']",[],[],terpene synthase

To examine that the identified HcMYB regulators directly bind or not to the promoters of key volatile floral scent biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2) in  H. coronarium, a Y1H assay was conducted. It was observed that the bait strains harboring  proHcTPS1 and  proHcTPS3 grow well on gained aureobasidin A antibiotic SD-Leu medium co-expression with HcMYB7, HcMYB8, and HcMYB145. Moreover, bait strains harboring  proHcTPS10 gained aureobasidin A antibiotic resistance upon expression of HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB79, and HcMYB238. Furthermore, bait strains harboring  proHcBSMT2 gained aureobasidin A antibiotic resistance upon expression of HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB79, HcMYB145, and HcMYB248 ( Figure 7A). HcMYBs Interacts With JAZ1 Protein To further unravel the molecular mechanism of the involvement of HcMYBs in the regulation of floral aroma biosynthesis, a yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assay was performed. It was observed that pGADT7-T + pGBKT7-53 (positive control) along with yeast cells, which co-transformed with pGADT7-HcMYB7 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB8 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB75 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB145 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, and pGADT7-HcMYB7248 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, grew well on SD plates lacking Trp, His, Ade, and Leu but in the existence of 5 mM 3-AT. On the other hand, yeast cells harboring pGBKT7-Lam + pGADT7-T (negative control), pGADT7-HcMYB79 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, and pGADT7-HcMYB238 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1 did not grow ( Figure 7B). These results indicated that HcJAZ1 may interact with five HcMYBs (HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB145, and HcMYB248) in yeast. Identification of the  HcMYB Genes in  Hedychium coronarium A total of 253 potential candidate  HcMYB genes were identified in  H. coronarium genome data. All genes were designated as  HcMYB1-HcMYB253 based on the chromosomal location. Among them, 27 HcMYB genes belong to 1R, six 3R, one 4R, and the rest are all R2R3 type. The HcMYB protein size and molecular mass range from 100 aa/11.37 kDa (HcMYB100) to 1,749 aa/192.53 kDa (HcMYB10). Similarly, the  pI also varies greatly from 4.51 (HcMYB170) to 12.2 (HcMYB252), indicating their functional diversity in microenvironments. A similar pattern was observed in  Prunus persica and  Phyllostachys edulis ( Zhang C. et al., 2018;  Yang et al., 2019b). Moreover,  in silico analysis revealed that HcMYB proteins were predicted to localize in the nucleus. The detailed information of  HcMYB genes is provided in  Supplementary Table 1. Phylogenetic Divergence of  HcMYB Genes The domain structure analysis showed that all  HcMYB genes contain highly conserved typical SANT DNA-binding domains in their sequences, which is essential for their different regulatory interaction mechanism. The multiple sequence alignment of mostly  HcMYB genes revealed that they possess 2R and 3R repeat signatures at the N-terminus, and seven candidate  HcMYB genes were selected for multiple sequence alignment ( Supplementary Figure 1). The seven candidate HcMYB proteins were selected for further characterization based on their expression pattern with flower scent emission. To assess the phylogenetic relationship among  MYB genes in  H. coronarium (253  HcMYBs), rice (66  OsMYBs),  Arabidopsis (125  AtMYBs), and tomato (127  SlMYBs), an unrooted NJ phylogenetic tree was generated. All MYB proteins were divided into 15 distinct clades designed as G1–G15. Among them, subgroup G13 constitutes the largest group containing 64 MYB members of four different species followed by G15 (63), G1 (56), G7 (54), G8 (48), G6 (48), G7 (40), G11 (39), G5 (30), G12 (28), G2 (26), G10 (26), G4 (25), G14 (8), and G3 (6), respectively. Similarly, the maximum number of  HcMYB genes were clustered into subgroup G15 (29) followed by G11 (27), G8 (27), G1 (25), G7 (23), G8 (23), G13 (20), G2, (15), G10 (15), G5 (13), G9 (12), G12 (10), G14 (7), G4 (5), and G3 (2), respectively. Interestingly, subgroup G14 contains eight MYBs from which seven belong to  H. coronarium ( Figure 1). Overall, all HcMYBs with AtMYB, OsMYB, and SlMYBs were unevenly clustered into all groups indicating their evolutionary divergence. The group of MYB genes in the same subclade may have a similar function. The phylogenetic tree analysis of only MYB proteins from  H. coronarium revealed that 253 HcMYB proteins were distinctly grouped into 12 different clades ( Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, three groups (G3, G13, and G15) from four genome phylogeny, were missing. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree of 253 HcMYBs was also constructing with the previously identified scent-related MYB TFs ( Supplementary Figure 3). The data showed that all HcMYBs along with previously identified scent-related MYBs were clustered into five distinct clades (G I-G V). The maximum number of scent-related MYB proteins were clustered in G II (11) followed by G V (5), G III (2), and G I (1), respectively. Furthermore, the selected seven-candidate HcMYB proteins were also grouped in different clades. HcMYB79 was clustered in G I, which included AtMYBL2, and HcMYB75/145/238 was found in G II, which contains the majority of scent-related MYBs (AtMYB2/21/24, FaEOBII, PhEOBI, PhEOBII, FvEOBII, PsMYB26, AmMYB305/340, and NiMYB3005). Similarly, HcMYB248 was found in G III, which includes AtMYB42 and PhODOI, while HcMYB7/8 was clustered in G V which includes AtMYB4/7, FaMYB1/10, PhMYB4, and PtMYB14 ( Supplementary Figure 3). Gene Structure and Motif Analysis of  HcMYB Genes To investigate the functional diversification of HcMYB proteins, 10 conserved motifs (motifs 1–10) were identified in the MEME server ( Supplementary Figure 4). The majority of the HcMYB proteins within the subclade had a similar composition of motifs, while variation was observed among different subclades. The motifs 1, 2, and 3 were the most conserved and appear in most of the HcMYB proteins. All the HcMYB proteins contain two or more than two motifs except HcMYB185 which only has motif 2 ( Supplementary Figure 5). HcMYB23, HcMYB40, HcMYB47, HcMYB55, HcMYB110, HcMYB126, HcMYB168, and HcMYB253 proteins contained motif 3 and motif 8; HcMYB31, HcMYB67, HcMYB91, HcMYB121, and HcMYB179 proteins contained motif 1 and motif 2. HcMYB proteins containing motif 9 and motif 10 belong to subgroup G10 and G9, respectively. Interestingly, some HcMYB proteins contain the repetition of motif 3 and motif 8 and fall into subgroup G2 indicating their involvement in a specific function ( Supplementary Figures 2,  5B). Gene structure analysis was performed to better understand the expansion of  HcMYB genes in  H. coronarium. The number of exon/intron ranges from 0 to 21. Gene structure analysis revealed that five  HcMYB ( HcMYB27,  HcMYB87,  HcMYB185,  HcMYB217, and  HcMYB249) genes were intron-less, while  HcMYB10 have a maximum of 21 introns ( Supplementary Figure 5C). Moreover,  HcMYB89 has the longest intron, and the majority of them (82%) were disrupted by two or three introns. In General, the  HcMYB genes with the same number of introns were grouped into a similar subclade. Chromosomal Distribution and Duplication Events Among  HcMYB Genes The chromosomal location of  HcMYBs was performed to investigate the genomic distribution of the MYB gene family in  H. coronarium. The results revealed an uneven distribution of  HcMYB genes in the chromosomes ( Figure 2A). In total, 6  HcMYB genes were found on chromosomes 1 and 13, 7 on chromosomes 8 and 16, 9 on chromosomes 3 and 15, 11 on chromosomes 10 and 12, 12 on chromosome 6, 14 on chromosomes 7 and 11, 15 on chromosomes 5 and 9, 16 on chromosome 17, 18 on chromosome 14, and 19 on chromosome 2. The maximum number of  HcMYB genes (20) were presented on chromosome 4. The majority of  HcMYB genes were observed on the top and bottom of the chromosomes, while rarely found in the middle of the chromosome. Gene duplications play a crucial role in the evolution and expansion of gene families in plants. It was found that  H. coronarium genome contained 62 HcMYB segmental duplications ( Figure 2A). The maximum number of segmental duplication events was observed on chromosomes 14 and 17, while a low number of duplication events were found on chromosome 3. Moreover, three tandem duplication pairs were also identified on chromosome 17 in  H. coronarium genome. The  Ka/Ks (synonymous/non-synonymous) values of all segmentally and tandemly duplicated  HcMYB gene pairs had less than 1, indicating that they evolved under the pressure of purifying selection ( Figure 2A and  Supplementary Table 3). The average  Ka/Ks value of tandem duplication genes (0.57) was higher than that segmented duplication genes (0.27). Moreover, the segmental and tandem duplication gene events occurred about 47 Mya (million years ago), implying that duplication events play a crucial role in functional and evolutional divergence. To determine the evolutionary mechanism of  HcMYB genes, comparative synteny maps of  H. coronarium associated with rice, pineapple, Arabidopsis, and banana were constructed ( Figure 2B). A total of 7 ortholog MYB gene pairs between  H. coronarium and  Arabidopsis, 19 orthologs between  H. coronarium and rice, 44 orthologs between  H. coronarium and pineapple, and 193 orthologs between  H. coronarium and banana were identified ( Figure 2B and  Supplementary Tables 4– 7). The number of HcMYB-MaMYB was greater than HcMYB-AtMYB, HcMYB-OsMYB, and HcMYB-AcMYB, indicating the closer evolutionary relationship between  H. coronarium and  Musa accuminata and their divergence from the common monocot ancestor. Interestingly, HcMYB29 and HcMYB194 collinear gene pairs were present among four species. HcMYB29 was homologous pair of AT5G65230.1 ( A. thaliana), LOC_Os02g51799.1 ( O. sativa), Aco002802.1 ( A. comosus), and GSMUA_Achr10T24560 ( M. acuminata). Similarly, HcMYB194 was collinear gene pair of AT4G37780.1, LOC_Os03g56090.1, Aco004978.1, and GSMUA_Achr5T01930. In short, the aforementioned two collinear gene pairs were found among four species genomes, implying their evolutionary mechanism and specific function in  H. coronarium. Cis-Regulatory Elements and  HcMYB Targeting miRNAs A 2-kb upstream promoter region of  HcMYB genes was scanned for  cis-regulatory elements analysis. The data showed that MeJA responsiveness elements are the most common ones, which were found in 210  HcMYB gene promoters. Other  cis-acting regulatory elements found in the promoter region of HcMYB genes were ABARE (208), ERE (180), GARE (144), MBS (128), Auxin responsive (120), SARE (99), and low-temperature responsiveness elements (96) ( Supplementary Figure 6). The detailed information regarding the  cis-elements present in the promoter region of  HcMYB genes is given in  Supplementary Table 8. Previous studies showed that miRNA play key roles in plant secondary metabolism. In  A. thaliana, miR858 encodes regulatory peptides and controls flavonoid biosynthesis and development ( Sharma et al., 2020). Similarly, miR156 was involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in poplar ( Wang et al., 2020). The miRNA prediction analysis showed that  HcMYB genes were targeted by different families of miRNA. About 37  HcMYB genes were mainly targeted by miR156, miR157, miR158, miR160, miR167, miR168, miR169, miR172, miR319, miR854, and miR858. The  HcMYB genes were commonly targeted by miR156, miR167, and miR319 ( Supplementary Table 9). Interestingly,  HcMYB187,  HcMYB166, and  HcMYB157 were targeted by both miR167 and miR319. The majority of  HcMYB genes (42) were targeted by miR858. Expression of  HcMYB Genes at Different Organs and Flower Developmental Stages The differential expression patterns of  HcMYB genes in different organs and flower developmental stages were analyzed using the RNA sequencing data ( Yue et al., 2015;  Supplementary Figure 7). The expression pattern of  HcMYB genes was grouped into three clusters. The cluster I showed a group of  HcMYB genes, which had preferential expression pattern in flowers. Similarly, cluster II and cluster III represent the member of  HcMYBs, which showed their high expression levels in rhizome and leaves, respectively ( Supplementary Figure 7A). Interestingly,  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB75,  HcMYB145,  HcMYB238, and  HcMYB248 from cluster I had the highest expression level in the flower. Some members of the cluster I also showed their spatial expression both in flower and rhizome including  HcMYB79,  HcMYB128,  HcMYB162,  HcMYB130,  HcMYB108,  HcMYB199, and  HcMYB208. The members of  HcMYB genes in cluster II showed high expression in the rhizome, while a few genes from cluster III showed high expression both in flowers and leaves and some in leaves and rhizomes. However, the majority of genes from cluster III showed their high expression in leaves. The amount of volatile contents released from flowers was maximum, while less quantity was observed in leaves and rhizomes ( Figure 3A). Previous studies showed that tissue-specific expression is important for gene functioning ( Sonawane et al., 2017). The data indicate the group of  HcMYBs present in cluster I might be involved in floral scent formation, while cluster II and cluster III in the functioning of vegetative organs (rhizome and leaves). In  H. coronarium, the process of floral scent formation is associated with flower development. The emission quantity of floral volatiles was low at the bud stage and substantially increase with the flower development peak at the blooming period and declined at the senescence stage ( Figure 3B). To clarify the functioning of  HcMYBs during flower development stages, their expression level at three stages was divided into three clades via a heat map ( Supplementary Figure 7B). Several  HcMYB genes showed high expression levels at the D1 stage followed by D4 and D6, respectively. However, some  HcMYBs ( HcMYB34,  HcMYB51,  HcMYB181, and  HcMYB232), which belong to cluster I, showed a substantial increase in expression level with the developmental stages. The members of  HcMYB genes from cluster II showed diverse expression levels. The majority of genes showed a high expression level at the D4 stage only, although  HcMYB5,  HcMYB62,  HcMYB106,  HcMYB111,  HcMYB240, and  HcMYB245 from cluster II showed high expression both at D1 and D4 stage. Likewise, within-cluster II, some  HcMYBs ( HcMYB16,  HcMYB94,  HcMYB203,  HcMYB208,  HcMYB218, and  HcMYB221) showed specific high expression both at D4 and D6 stage only ( Supplementary Figure 7B). Interestingly,  HcMYB22,  HcMYB55, and  HcMYB112, within-cluster III, showed a high expression at the D1 stage, with no expression at the D4 stage and dramatically peak at the D6 stage. Based on transcriptome data, seven  HcMYB genes were selected and their spatial expression pattern was validated via RT-qPCR at four different flower development stages ( Figure 3C). The expression level of  HcMYB79 increased with the flower development and peak at the senescence stage, while  HcMYB8 and  HcMYB75 showed a high expression level at the D2 stage (half-open). However,  HcMYB7,  HcMYB145,  HcMYB238, and  HcMYB248 showed a dramatic increase in the expression level from D2 to D3 stage. Moreover, the expression of candidate  HcMYB genes correlates with the emission of total volatile contents ( Supplementary Figure 8). The expression level of  HcMYB genes significantly altered with the flower developmental process, suggesting their potential role during the development of flower and floral scent emission. Expression of  HcMYBs in Response to Hormone Stresses Plant hormones play several functions in growth and development and are involved in different signaling pathways. Auxin, abscisic acid, ethylene, and jasmonates are the key hormones playing an essential role in flower development and senescence. The amount of floral volatile contents was increased by 27.6, 23.9, 25.5, and 33.1% under IAA, ABA, ethylene, and MeJA treatment, respectively ( Figure 4A). The expression levels of selected  HcMYBs were analyzed via RT-qPCR under the abovementioned treatments. The data showed that mRNA levels of  HcMYB75,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB238 were upregulated under auxin treatments, while  HcMYB248 was downregulated ( Figure 4C). Under ABA treatment,  HcMYB145 expression level was increased by 19-fold followed by  HcMYB75,  HcMYB79, and  HcMYB238, respectively. However, the expression level of  HcMYB248 was reduced ( Figure 4D). For ethylene treatment,  HcMYB79 and  HcMYB145 were significantly upregulated; however,  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8, and  HcMYB248 were downregulated ( Figure 4E). The expression levels of  HcMYB75,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB238 were upregulated when treated with MeJA, while  HcMYB248 was downregulated ( Figure 4F). Moreover, mRNA levels of key structural biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2) were also upregulated upon phytohormones stresses ( Figure 4B). These results indicate that  HcMYB genes respond to various stresses and play crucial roles through crosstalk with different hormones. Subcellular Localization of HcMYB Proteins In silico subcellular localization of  HcMYB genes revealed that all  H. corornarium MYB genes are predicted to localize in the nucleus except HcMYB126, which is predicted to localize in the chloroplast ( Supplementary Table 1). To experimentally validate the predicted localization, four  HcMYB genes ( HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248) were selected for analysis in  Arabidopsis protoplast. The NLS-mCherry was applied in each transformed design to act as a marker for nuclear localization. The results revealed that HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, and HcMYB248 proteins were localized to the nucleus ( Figure 5). Suppression of  HcMYB Genes Altered the Emission of Main Floral Volatile Compounds To understand the potential involvement of  HcMYB genes in the floral scent formation, a virus-induced gene silencing system was performed for  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248. The data showed that the mRNA expression level of  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248 was decreased 41.4, 47.8, 78.7, 75.8, and 85.3%, respectively ( Figure 6A), relative to the control flowers. The silencing of  HcMYB genes in flowers also downregulated the expression level of key structural volatile biosynthesis genes. In the  HcMYB7-silenced flower, the expression level of  HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2 was downregulated up to 59.7, 23.1, 65.7, and 58.3%, respectively, compared to control. The silencing of  HcMYB8 in  H. coronarium flowers, downregulated the expression level of  HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS10, and  HcBSMT2 by 76.5, 54.5, 82.8, and 87.7%, respectively. Alike, silencing of  HcMYB79 significantly downregulated the expression levels of  HcTPS1 (74.4%),  HcTPS10 (87.6%), and  HcBSMT2 (87.4%). The expression level of  HcTPS1 (68.3%),  HcTPS3 (57.7%),  HcTPS10 (52.6%), and  HcBSMT2 (48.3%) was significantly suppressed in the  HcMYB145-silenced flowers. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of  HcTPS1 (66.5%),  HcTPS3 (38.8%),  HcTPS10 (72.1%), and  HcBSMT2 (81.4%) were significantly changed in the  HcMYB248-silenced flowers ( Figure 6B). The effect of silencing of  HcMYB genes on the floral volatile profile of  H. coronarium was assessed. It was observed that eucalyptol contents were decreased 42.2, 40.8, 22.6, 34.6, and 39.8% in the  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers, respectively ( Figure 6C). Similarly, the silencing of  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8, and  HcMYB79 significantly decreased the accumulation of ocimene by 23.3, 24.4, and 27.1%, respectively. However, no significant change in volatile contents was found in the  HcMYB145 and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers ( Figure 6D). The volatile contents of methyl benzoate were significantly decreased by 27.6 and 31.9% in the  HcMYB8 and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers, respectively, while silencing of  HcMYB145 did not affect the level of methyl benzoate ( Figure 6E). Furthermore, the contents of linalool were decreased by 16.9, 26, 13.9, 26.2, and 15.1% in the  HcMYB7,  HcMYB8,  HcMYB79,  HcMYB145, and  HcMYB248-silenced flowers, respectively ( Figure 6F). The data showed that these  HcMYB genes play a crucial role in the floral scent formation in  H. coronarium.","The MYB gene family is one of the largest groups of transcription factors (TFs) playing diverse roles in several biological processes.  Hedychium coronarium  (white ginger lily) is a renowned ornamental plant both in tropical and subtropical regions due to its flower shape and strong floral scent mainly composed of terpenes and benzenoids. However, there is no information available regarding the role of the MYB gene family in  H. coronarium . In the current study, the MYB gene family was identified and extensively analyzed. The identified 253  HcMYB  genes were unevenly mapped on 17 chromosomes at a different density. Promoter sequence analysis showed numerous phytohormones related to  cis -regulatory elements. The majority of  HcMYB  genes contain two to three introns and motif composition analysis showed their functional conservation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HcMYBs could be classified into 15 distinct clades, and the segmental duplication events played an essential role in the expansion of the  HcMYB  gene family. Tissue-specific expression patterns of  HcMYB  genes displayed spatial and temporal expression. Furthermore, seven  HcMYB  ( HcMYB7/8/75/79/145/238/248 ) were selected for further investigation. Through RT-qPCR, the response of candidates  HcMYB  genes toward jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and auxin was examined. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays revealed that candidate genes directly bind to the promoter of bottom structural volatile synthesis genes ( HcTPS1 ,  HcTPS3 ,  HcTPS10 , and  HcBSMT2 ). Moreover, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay showed that HcMYB7/8/75/145/248 interact with HcJAZ1 protein. In  HcMYB7/8/79/145/248 -silenced flowers, the floral volatile contents were decreased and downregulated the expression of key structural genes, suggesting that these genes might play crucial roles in floral scent formation in  H. coronarium  by regulating the expression of floral scent biosynthesis genes. Collectively, these findings indicate that  HcMYB  genes might be involved in the regulatory mechanism of terpenoids and benzenoid biosynthesis in  H. coronarium .","['Structural genes', 'terpenes', 'Floral Scent', 'Myb', 'Hedychium Coronarium']","['HcMYB Genes', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Figure', 'HcMYB', 'Genes', 'HcMYB proteins', 'expression', 'expression level', 'Supplementary', 'Supplementary Table']","[HcMYBs, MYB-core, HcTPS1, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB238, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, HcMYB248, JAZ1, HcMYBs, yeast-two-hybrid, Y2H, pGADT7-T, pGBKT7-53, pGADT7-HcMYB7 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB8 +, pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB75 +, pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB145 +, pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB7248 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, Trp, pGBKT7-Lam, pGADT7-HcMYB79 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, pGADT7-HcMYB238 + pGBKT7-HcJAZ1, HcJAZ1, HcMYBs, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB75, HcMYB145, HcMYB248, 1R, 3R, 4R, HcMYB100, HcMYB170, HcMYB252, 2019b, HcMYB proteins, NJ, MYB, G1–G15, G13, MYB, G15 (63), G8 (48), G7 (40, G11 (39), G5 (30), G12 (28, G10 (26), G4, G14 (8), G3 (6), G11 (27, G8 (27, G7 (23, G8 (23, G13 (20), G10 (15), G5 (13), G9 (12), G12 (10, G14 (7, G4, G3 (2, G14, HcMYBs, SlMYBs, MYB, MYB, G13, G15, HcMYBs, MYB TFs, HcMYBs, G I-G V, MYB, G II, G V, G III (2, G I (1, seven-candidate HcMYB proteins, G I, AtMYBL2, HcMYB75/145/238, G II, AtMYB2/21/24, FaEOBII, PhEOBI, PhEOBII, AmMYB305/340, NiMYB3005, HcMYB248, AtMYB42, PhODOI, HcMYB7/8, G V, AtMYB4/7, FaMYB1/10, PhMYB4, HcMYB proteins, HcMYB185, HcMYB23, HcMYB40, HcMYB47, HcMYB55, HcMYB110, HcMYB126, HcMYB168, HcMYB253, HcMYB31, HcMYB67, HcMYB91, HcMYB121, HcMYB179, G10, G9, MYB, 12, 12, 9, MYB, HcMYB-MaMYB, HcMYB-AtMYB, HcMYB-OsMYB, HcMYB-AcMYB, HcMYB194, AT5G65230.1, LOC_Os02g51799.1 (, Aco002802.1, GSMUA_Achr10T24560 ( M. acuminata, HcMYB194, AT4G37780.1, LOC_Os03g56090.1, Aco004978.1, GSMUA_Achr5T01930, HcMYB, ABARE, ERE (180), GARE (144), MBS (128), Auxin, SARE (99, miR156, miR156, miR160, miR167, miR168, miR169, miR172, miR319, miR156, miR167, miR319, miR167, miR319, D4, HcMYB34, D1, D4, within-cluster II, HcMYB16, D4, D1, D2, Auxin, abscisic acid, ABA, auxin, ABA, HcTPS1, HcMYB Proteins, MYB, HcMYB126, HcMYB7, NLS-mCherry, HcMYB7, HcMYB8, HcMYB145, HcMYB248]","['HcTPS1', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS10', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,', 'proHcTPS1', 'proHcTPS3', 'proHcTPS10', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS10,', 'HcTPS1', 'HcTPS10', 'HcTPS1', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS10', 'HcTPS1', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS10']",['C.'],[],
145,145,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7952643\eupmc_result.json,PMC7952643,"Results Evaluation of Mite Populations in the Net House and Their Damage to Tomato Leaves The two commercial tomato cultivars (Shiran and Ofir) were selected based on the following information: description on the Rimi website ( www.rimi.co.il), and pre-observation by the Agriculture Extension Service of Israel that reported a lower mite population on Ofir than on the other commonly grown cultivars of cluster cherry tomato. Mite populations were evaluated according to the adult and juvenile pest life cycle stages (eggs were excluded). The average numbers of adult and juvenile mites on two sampling dates, 5 and 8 weeks after TSSM infestation, are presented in  Figure 1. A comparison of the two sampling dates indicated that Shiran had more mites than Ofir in the juvenile stages, while only on the 5 weeks the adult stage had significantly higher on Shiran than on Ofir. In the 8 weeks, the adult mite population on Shiran had reduced, and in Ofir, it was not changed, which might be the outcome of severe plant damage.  Supplementary Figure 3 shows the total number of adult and juvenile mites on the two tomato cultivars along 2 months of scouting for mites. These results also show a higher number of both adults and juveniles on Shiran vs. Ofir. Overall, they suggest that in net house growth conditions, Shiran is more mite susceptible than Ofir. Additionally, plant morphology was scored at a single time point (5 weeks after TSSM infestation;  Figure 2A), 3 months from the beginning of the experiment.  Figure 2B presents the distribution of the plant damage in the two tomato cultivars in the net house. Most Shiran plants were mildly damaged and more damaged than most of the Ofir plants. These results suggest that the plant damage was related to the intensity of mite infestation, and that the Ofir cultivar is more resistant to mites. Evaluating TSSM Performance and Fecundity Under Controlled Growth Conditions To validate whether Ofir was more resistant to TSSMs than Shiran in a controlled environment, two complementary experiments were conducted: (i) mite reproduction, in which the number of mobile mites was evaluated on whole mite-infested plants for 13 days; and (ii) mite oviposition, in which the number of eggs was counted for 5 days during mite infestation using leaf disks. As shown in  Figure 3A, mite reproduction was significantly higher on Shiran (386.5) than on Ofir (306.2) plants, suggesting that Shiran is more susceptible to TSSMs under laboratory conditions. We determined the oviposition rate of TSSMs on the cultivars by applying females and counting new eggs each day, as shown in  Figure 3B. The two-way ANOVA indicated a significant difference in the number of eggs between sampling days ( df = 4;  F = 6.3;  p < 0.0001), while no significant difference was detected between the cultivars ( df = 1;  F = 1.1;  p = 0.29). Therefore, we conducted a one-way-ANOVA comparing the number of eggs on each cultivar separately. On Ofir, the highest number of eggs was counted on the 3rd day (9.4 eggs per female), then it declined to 8.3 eggs per female on the 5th day, while on Shiran, the highest numbers of eggs were counted on days 3–5 (9.1–9.9 eggs per female). These results revealed the different time responses of the two cultivars, possibly driven by variations in the molecular mechanisms. Pathway Analysis and Identification of Relevant Metabolic Pathways Mediating the Tomato Responses Against TSSMs To investigate the global transcriptional changes of the tomato cultivars, leaves from 5-week-old plants were infested with 60 TSSMs for 3 days, and then samples from TSSM-infested and untreated controls were collected. The total transcript levels (22,592 genes with no zero values) were used to construct a principal component analysis (PCA) plot. As presented in  Figure 4A, the PCA plot indicates that each cultivar's samples were clustered with one another. The samples were separated into infestation treatments, which explained 92% of the variance (PC1), and into cultivars, which explained 4% of the variance (PC2). This analysis suggests strong inducible responses of both cultivars following TSSM infestation, as well as distinct constitutively expressed sets of genes between the two cultivars. The DESeq2 tool was used to detect differentially expressed genes in the transcriptomic dataset (Love et al.,  2014), which generated two sets of transcriptional variations: (i) between the two cultivars and (ii) between treatments (TSSM-infested vs. untreated control). A list of the gene sets is presented in  Supplementary Table 3. The analysis of differentially expressed genes resulted in a total number of 7,099 differentially expressed genes, and the distribution of these genes was calculated and is presented in a Venn diagram ( Figure 4B). Many genes were altered in response to mite attack (6,632), while only a small number of genes (252) were differentially expressed between the two cultivars. Additionally, 215 genes varied between both cultivar and treatment. This result indicates that the major transcriptomic effects are induced by TSSM infestation. To reveal the biological processes involved in each group of the Venn diagram, an over-representation pathway enrichment analysis was performed, and the results were compared using the LycoCyc database ( http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/). In this analysis, the differentially expressed genes were included (both up- and downregulated in each group). In  Table 1, the significantly enriched pathways of cultivars, TSSM-induced treatment, and overlap group genes are presented ( Tables 1A–C, respectively). The pathways significantly enriched by the cultivars alone were mainly associated with the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids (flavonol, syringetin, luteolin, and leucopelargonidin and leucocyanidin) and terpenoids (monoterpenes). A large number of over-represented pathways were enriched upon mite infestation, including the following central metabolic pathways: amino acid biosynthesis (Phe, Tyr, Trp, Asp, and Glu), fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis (phospholipids), photosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism ( Table 1B). Additionally, several pathways associated with secondary compound biosynthesis were enriched: cofactor, prosthetic group, electron carrier, and vitamin (folate and chlorophyll cycle), nitrogen-containing compounds (hydroxycinnamic acid tyramine amides), and terpenoid (antheraxanthin and violaxanthin, and phaseic acid). Notably, another over-represented pathway was the biosynthesis of volatile benzenoid esters (i.e., MeSA and methylbenzoate), which result from the degradation of aromatic compounds (Tzin and Galili,  2010). As presented in  Table 1C, only a few pathways within the overlap group were significantly enriched, including the initial reaction of phenylpropanoids toward flavonols and suberin biosynthesis, as well as the biosynthesis of the phytohormone, SA. Together, these observations revealed the contribution of cultivars to the variation, which was mainly associated with secondary metabolism. In contrast, the mite-inducible changes were related to both primary and secondary metabolism. The overlap group, which represents genes that differ by both cultivar type and infestation treatment, is related to secondary metabolism. GO enrichment for each of these groups showed similar results to  Table 1, with a few additional categories. The GO enrichment summary of biological process, molecular function, and cellular component is presented in the  Supplementary Table 4. There was at least one pathway in all the groups involved in the metabolism of volatile compounds, including monoterpenes, salicylate (and MeSA), and volatile benzenoid ester biosynthesis. Therefore, we further explored these two pathways, looking at gene expression and measuring volatile composition changes. Comparing the Expression of Genes Associated With the Terpene Pathway and Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis The terpene biosynthesis gene list was generated according to a recently published study characterizing the tomato  Terpene synthase (TPS) gene family by Zhou and Pichersky ( 2020) and  Apocarotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) by Ilg et al. ( 2014). Out of 51 genes, 23 were detected in our dataset. As shown in  Table 2A, five  Terpene synthase (TPS) genes were highly expressed in untreated Ofir vs. Shiran, including  TPS5 (Solyc01g105890),  TPS7 (Solyc01g105920), and  TPS19/20 (Solyc08g005665) involved in monoterpene biosynthesis,  TPS9 (Solyc06g059885) involved in monoterpene and sesquiterpene biosynthesis, and  TPS18 (Solyc08g005720) involved in diterpene biosynthesis. This revealed the constitutive transcriptomic difference between the two tomato cultivars. Upon mite-infestation in the Ofir cultivar, the expression levels of six genes were reduced, including  TPS4 (Solyc01g105880),  TPS12 (Solyc06g059930),  Geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases (GGPPSs; Solyc04g079960 and Solyc02g085700),  Solanesyl diphosphate synthase (SPPS; Solyc07g061990), and  Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD2; Solyc01g087260), while  TPS46 (Solyc03g006550) was significantly overexpressed. In Shiran cultivar, three genes were underexpressed ( TPS35, Solyc01g101210;  GGPPS2, Solyc04g079960 and  CCD2, Solyc01g087260), and two genes were overexpressed ( TPS5, Solyc01g105890; and  TPS46, Solyc03g006550). Notably, the gene ID of  TPS20 and  TPS19 was Solyc08g005665.1, Solyc08g005670.2, and then Solyc08g005665.1 again in  S. lycopersicum annotation versions 2.4, 3.2, and 4.0, respectively. Both gene IDs have been used in the literature (Xu et al.,  2018; Zhou and Pichersky,  2020). The current annotation suggests that  TPS19 and  TPS20 are two coding sequences on the same transcript and are likely splice variants. However, their high sequence similarity prevented the distinction between the two during the mapping phase. Therefore, to separate them in the current RNAseq data, their amino acid variation from the reference genome (Heinz. cv) was used to infer their presence in the raw sequencing reads. A few reads that showed amino acid profiles congruent with both proteins, were excluded. The quantification of the reads revealed that both isoforms are present in Ofir and Shiran ( Supplementary Figure 4). In all four groups,  TPS20 had more reads than  TPS19. Unlike the TMM analysis, where  TPS19/20 was not detected in control samples of Shiran cultivar ( Supplementary Table 5), a few reads were detected in these samples. Salicylic acid (SA) is synthesized via two pathways: (i) chorismate through  Isochorismate synthase (ICS) and (ii) from Phe via  Phe ammonia-lyase (PAL) (Lefevere et al.,  2020). The gene list was generated from LycoCyc ( http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/) and MetaCyc databases (Caspi et al.,  2018). The results of the genes involved in SA and volatile benzenoid ester biosynthesis are shown in  Table 2A. In Ofir, the expression levels of 11 genes from the Phe pathway were altered upon mite infestation, including  PALs (Solyc03g042560, Solyc05g056170, Solyc09g007900, and Solyc09g007910),  Benzoate-CoA ligase (BCLA; Solyc12g044300),  Benzyl alcohol benzoyl transferase (BEBT; Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, and Solyc07g049670),  Cinnamate:CoA ligase (CNL; Solyc02g081360), and  Salicylate 1-O-methyltransferase (SAMT; Solyc01g081340 and Solyc09g091550), and the expression of  ICS (Solyc06g071030) from the chorismate pathway was significantly decreased. In Shiran, the expression levels of 9 genes from the Phe pathway were altered, including  PALs (Solyc10g011920, Solyc03g036470, and Solyc09g007900),  BEBTs (Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, Solyc07g049670, and Solyc08g005760), and  CNLs (Solyc02g081360 and Solyc03g031870), while the level of  ICS did not change. While several genes were significantly modified in response to mite-infestation, none of these genes were significantly different between the two cultivars' untreated samples (constitutive differences), suggesting that the SA pathway is mostly involved in the inducible defense mechanisms. Altogether, the results indicate a dramatic change in the gene expression levels of SA and volatile benzenoid ester biosynthesis, mostly affected by mite treatment (inducible manner). Additionally, only a slight effect on the terpene biosynthesis pathway was seen, which was enriched more in the Ofir than the Shiran cultivar (constitutive manner). Content of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) The transcriptome analysis suggested that one of the major differences between these cultivars was related to the metabolism of VOCs. The two cultivars' volatile content was determined under both mite-infested and untreated control conditions using the HS-SPME-GC-MS technique to link the transcriptomic to the metabolic changes. A total of 54 metabolites were identified across all different treatments, including 12 monoterpenes, 7 sesquiterpenes, 8 irregular terpenes, 7 phenylpropanoids and benzenoids, and 20 aliphatics ( Supplementary Table 6). In a principal component analysis, the majority of variance in volatiles content was due to the cultivar factor (PC1, 68.7% of total variation). The TSSM infestation factor (PC2) explained another 10% of the total variation in the data, reflecting the induced change in the volatiles content ( Supplementary Figure 5). To compare the relative levels of VOCs, Student's  t-tests were conducted. The values in log2 fold change, separated into five volatile biosynthetic classes, are presented in  Table 3. This analysis revealed that nine compounds from the mono-, and irregular terpenes differed between the two cultivars in both conditions (mite-infested and untreated control), including 4-carene, limonene, p-cymene, p-cymenene, terpinolene, α-terpinene, β-phellandrene, β-pinene, and crypton. However, only two compounds, α-pinene and o-guaiacol, were modified in the untreated Ofir vs. untreated Shian, and three compounds, 1-nonanol, 1-Octanol, and methyl salicylate, were altered in mite-infested Ofir vs. mite-infested Shiran. Methyl benzoate was the only compound that increased upon mite infestation in Shiran cultivar, while none of the metabolites changed upon mite infestation in the Ofir cultivar. Notably, two monoterpenes 3,7,7-trimethyl-1,3,5-cycloheptatriene and β-myrcene were detected only in the Ofir cultivar. These comparisons suggested that monoterpenes are the main VOCs that differ between cultivars (constitutive levels), while only minor changes occur upon TSSM attack. To compare the amount of VOCs in each cultivar and condition, we measured all compounds produced on day 3 dpi, and the change in each VOC was tested by a one-way ANOVA. Overall, 29 out of 54 VOCs varied significantly ( df = 4; Fisher's LSD;  p ≤ 0.05), indicating unique volatile content between the cultivars and treatments ( Supplementary Table 7A). The most pronounced differences between the cultivars were in the levels of monoterpenes, of which 3,7,7-trimethyl-1,3,5-cycloheptatriene and β-myrcene were only detected in Ofir, and seven other monoterpenes were over-represented in Ofir relative to Shiran. Additionally, the most pronounced difference in response to TSSM infestation was in the level of the benzenoid compound methyl benzoate, which increased in response to TSSM infestation in both cultivars. Overall, MeSA was the most abundant molecule, followed by β-phellandrene in Ofir and methyl benzoate in Shiran ( Supplementary Table 7B). To compare the total amount of VOCs in each cultivar and condition, we measured all 54 compounds produced. The total VOC content extracted from the Ofir control plants was approximately twice that of the Shiran plants. Upon infestation, both Ofir and Shiran plants produced ~1.5 times more VOCs ( Supplementary Table 7B). In this dataset, Ofir and Shiran seemed to produce different volatile patterns, both in quality and quantity. The question was whether differences in these patterns were due to changes in specific classes of metabolites. To that end, the use of hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward's linkage) resulted in a heatmap, presented in  Supplementary Figure 6. Overall, the VOC dataset was divided into six clusters, and volatiles mostly grouped by classes (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and irregular terpenes). Six groups of metabolites were further selected, and their average levels were present in infested and untreated plants at different times (1, 3, 5, and 7 dpi) shown in  Figure 5. The sum of 9 monoterpenes was more than 10 times higher in Ofir than in Shiran. Notably, the only monoterpenes in greater quantity in Shiran were α-pinene and β-pinene ( Figures 5A,B, respectively). Both sesquiterpene and the irregular terpenes presented similar patterns between the groups and were higher in Ofir than in Shiran. However, irregular terpenes varied more between the Shiran control and infested treatments ( Figures 5C,D, respectively). The volatile phytohormone MeSA was significantly higher in Ofir than in Shiran and increased in the infested treatments ( Figure 5E). Methyl benzoate was the most prominent compounds that increased in response to TSSM infestation in both cultivars and was the only compound that increased over time ( Figure 5F). VOCs associated with the aliphatic class did not show a clear pattern, and most of them were more abundant in Ofir than Shiran, except 1-nonanol, and 1-octanol, which presented the opposite trend ( Table 3 and  Supplementary Figure 6). Further evidence for volatile differences between the two cultivars was discovered by measuring the VOC profile of tomatoes grown in the net house. Leaf samples were collected over 3 months, and volatiles were detected using GC-MS liquid extraction. The results suggested that Ofir accumulated higher amounts of volatiles during this time than in Shiran ( Supplementary Figure 7). These findings supported our laboratory experiments, wherein the total amount of VOCs was higher in Ofir than Shiran ( Supplementary Table 7B). Furthermore, 1 week after TSSM infestation, the amount of volatiles increased until 2 weeks after infestation. Subsequently, it declined during the establishment of the mite population ( Figure 1 and  Supplementary Figure 5, respectively). The VOC list is presented in  Supplementary Table 8. Olfactometry Bioassay of TSSM and  Phytoseiulus persimilis Upon Exposure to Shiran and Ofir Odors A Y-shape olfactometry bioassay was designed ( Figure 6) to understand the effect of different VOC emissions on mite behavior. The TSSMs showed no preference for the odor source emitted by intact Shiran-control and Ofir-control plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577). Similarly, TSSMs had no preference when given a choice between Ofir-control and Ofir-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577), Shiran-control and Shiran-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.13;  p = 0.715), and Shiran-infested and Ofir-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.78;  p = 0.376;  Figure 6A).  Phytoseiulus persimilis predatory mite is known to respond to unique VOC compositions (Takabayashi et al.,  2000). Therefore, we tested the indirect effect of the VOCs blend of the two cultivars on these mites by exposing them to either TSSM-infested or untreated (control) Ofir and Shiran volatile emissions. The  P. persimilis clearly chose Ofir-infested over Shiran-infested plants (χ 2 = 4.94;  p = 0.0263;  Figure 6B).  Phytoseiulus persimilis did not show a significant preference when given a choice between Shiran-control and Ofir-control plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577), Ofir-control and Ofir-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.31;  p = 0.577), and Shiran-control and Shiran-infested plants (χ 2 = 0.13;  p = 0.715). The results indicated that the predator mite could distinguish between infested Ofir and Shiran, but the TSSM could not.","The two-spotted spider mite (TSSM;  Tetranychus urticae ) is a ubiquitous polyphagous arthropod pest that has a major economic impact on the tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) industry. Tomato plants have evolved broad defense mechanisms regulated by the expression of defense genes, phytohormones, and secondary metabolites present constitutively and/or induced upon infestation. Although tomato defense mechanisms have been studied for more than three decades, only a few studies have compared domesticated cultivars' natural mite resistance at the molecular level. The main goal of our research was to reveal the molecular differences between two tomato cultivars with similar physical (trichome morphology and density) and agronomic traits (fruit size, shape, color, cluster architecture), but with contrasting TSSM susceptibility. A net house experiment indicated a mite-resistance difference between the cultivars, and a climate-controlled performance and oviposition bioassay supported these findings. A transcriptome analysis of the two cultivars after 3 days of TSSM infestation, revealed changes in the genes associated with primary and secondary metabolism, including salicylic acid and volatile biosynthesis (volatile benzenoid ester and monoterpenes). The  Terpene synthase  genes,  TPS5, TPS7 , and  TPS19/20 , encoding enzymes that synthesize the monoterpenes linalool, β-myrcene, limonene, and β-phellandrene were highly expressed in the resistant cultivar. The volatile profile of these cultivars upon mite infestation for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days, revealed substantial differences in monoterpenoid and phenylpropanoid volatiles, results consistent with the transcriptomic data. Comparing the metabolic changes that occurred in each cultivar and upon mite-infestation indicated that monoterpenes are the main metabolites that differ between cultivars (constitutive levels), while only minor changes occurred upon TSSM attack. To test the effect of these volatile variations on mites, we subjected both the TSSM and its corresponding predator,  Phytoseiulus persimilis , to an olfactory choice bioassay. The predator mites were only significantly attracted to the TSSM pre-infested resistant cultivar and not to the susceptible cultivar, while the TSSM itself showed no preference. Overall, our findings revealed the contribution of constitutive and inducible levels of volatiles on mite performance. This study highlights monoterpenoids' function in plant resistance to pests and may inform the development of new resistant tomato cultivars.","['Salicylic acid', 'Tetranychus urticae (Koch)', 'Terpene synthase', 'volatile organic compounds', 'Solanum Lycopersicum', 'Phytoseiulus Persimilis']","['Ofir', 'Shiran', 'Supplementary Table', 'Supplementary Figure', 'Agriculture Extension', 'Extension Service', 'Figure', 'Ofir cultivar', 'Shiran cultivar', 'TSSM infestation']","[Ofir, Rimi, Ofir, TSSM, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, TSSM, Ofir, Ofir, TSSMs, mite-infested, TSSMs, TSSMs, Ofir, TSSMs, TSSMs, TSSM-infested, 22,592, PC2, DESeq2, TSSM, Venn, http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/, TSSM-induced, Trp, Asp, SA, mite-inducible, 2A, Ofir, Solyc01g105890, Solyc01g105920, Solyc08g005665, Solyc06g059885, Solyc08g005720, Solyc01g105880, Solyc06g059930, GGPPSs, Solyc04g079960, Solyc02g085700, Solyc07g061990, Solyc01g087260, Solyc03g006550, TPS35, Solyc01g101210, Solyc04g079960, Solyc01g087260, TPS5, Solyc01g105890, Solyc03g006550, Solyc08g005665.1, Solyc08g005670.2, Solyc08g005665.1, IDs, TPS19, RNAseq, Ofir, http://solcyc.solgenomics.net/, 2A, Ofir, Solyc03g042560, Solyc05g056170, Solyc09g007900, Solyc09g007910, BCLA, Solyc12g044300, BEBT, Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, Solyc07g049670, CoA ligase, Solyc02g081360, SAMT, Solyc01g081340, Solyc09g091550, Solyc06g071030, chorismate, 9, Solyc10g011920, Solyc03g036470, Solyc09g007900, Solyc05g015800, Solyc07g049660, Solyc07g049670, Solyc08g005760, Solyc02g081360, Solyc03g031870, SA, Ofir, mite-infested, TSSM infestation factor, PC2, mite-infested, β-pinene, α-pinene, Ofir, TSSM, ≤, Ofir, Ofir, TSSM, TSSM, MeSA, β-phellandrene, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, α-pinene, β-pinene ( Figures 5A, B, Ofir, D, Ofir, TSSM, Ofir, Ofir, Ofir, TSSM, TSSM, Ofir Odors A Y-shape, TSSMs, Shiran-control, Ofir-control plants, χ 2, TSSMs, Ofir-control, Ofir-infested plants, χ 2, Shiran-control, Shiran-infested plants, χ 2, Shiran-infested, Ofir-infested plants, χ 2, TSSM-infested, Ofir-infested, Shiran-infested, χ 2, Shiran-control, Ofir-control plants, χ 2, Ofir-control, Ofir-infested plants, χ 2, Shiran-control, Shiran-infested plants, χ 2, Ofir]","['(TPS)', '(TPS)', 'TPS5', 'TPS7', 'TPS19/20', 'TPS9', 'TPS18', 'TPS4', 'TPS12', 'TPS46', 'TPS35,', 'TPS5,', 'TPS46,', 'TPS20', 'TPS19', 'TPS19', 'TPS20', 'TPS20', 'TPS19.', 'TPS19/20']",[],[],terpene synthase
146,146,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC7982956\eupmc_result.json,PMC7982956,"Results Obtainment of Transgenic Sweet Orange Plants Overexpressing  AtCS To obtain constitutive synthesis of ( E)-β-caryophyllene, a T-DNA harboring the genomic sequence of  A. thaliana ( E)-β -CARYOPHYLLENE SYNTHASE TPS21 ( AtCS) under the control of the 35S promoter plus the  nptII selectable marker gene cassette was constructed. This T-DNA was transferred into the genome of Valencia sweet orange ( Citrus X sinensis L. Osb.) via  Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the cut ends of internodal stem tissues. A total of 10 putatively transgenic ( E)-β -CARYOPHYLLENE SYNTHASE overexpressing lines (CS lines) were produced by regeneration on kanamycin-containing medium. Seven independent transgenic lines harboring a full-length single copy of the transgene in Southern blots were selected for further analysis ( Supplementary Figure 1).  AtCS expression was evaluated in leaves from young shoots, the most attractive leaf stage to  D. citri and thus the most interesting target tissue to induce ( E)-β-caryophyllene emission. Transcripts of the transgene were detected in all the CS orange lines analyzed, while they were absent in flushes from EV control lines ( Figure 1). Lines CS-5, -14, and -17 showed comparable intermediate expression levels, while CS-2, -6, and -15 presented lower transcript amounts. Line CS-16 exhibited the highest level of  AtCS expression, over eightfold higher than that of CS-6, and approximately doubled that of intermediate lines. Overexpression of  AtCS Did Not Induce Detrimental Effects in CS Transgenic Sweet Orange Plants Selected CS lines were grafted on “Rangpur” lime ( Citrus X limonia Osb.) and propagated under greenhouse conditions without observing any detrimental effect on plant growth. The plants also showed no alteration of color or morphology, being indistinguishable at a first glance from the empty-vector (EV) control plants ( Figure 2A). After 18 months, basic phenotypic characteristics, such as internode length, stem diameter, and leaf area, were evaluated. No significant differences between engineered CS- and EV-transformed lines were found ( Figure 2B). To investigate whether  AtCS heterologous overexpression induces any detrimental effect in citrus, some key fruit quality parameters were evaluated in fruits from three selected greenhouse-grown engineered lines. Visually, CS and EV fruits and juices were indistinguishable ( Figure 3A). Accordingly, obtained results indicated that size, weight, number of segments, and peel color of CS fruits were statistically equal to those of EV ( Figure 3B). Similarly, quality characteristics were comparable in CS and EV juices ( Figure 3C). However, these results are just preliminary. Fruit setting should be evaluated for several productive seasons in the orchard to be able to get reliable results on fruit quality. Nevertheless, our first fruit evaluation was enough to claim that  AtCS overexpression does not induce any aberrant phenotype in the GM fruits. Analysis of Volatile Terpene Compounds Accumulated in the Leaves of Engineered CS Sweet Orange Lines Terpene volatiles accumulated in young flushes of CS and EV control lines were extracted and analyzed by GC-MS. The total amount of volatile terpene compounds accumulated in the flushes of the CS lines analyzed was, in general, similar to that detected in EV controls ( Figure 4). Only in CS-15 and -17, mono- and sesquiterpene content was significantly altered in relation to EVs. In these lines, monoterpene accumulation was between 4.6- and 5.1-fold higher than in EV lines, while the sesquiterpene amount was more than twofold higher than in the controls. The changes in the monoterpene profile were analyzed in more detail ( Figure 5A). Lines CS-15 and -17 had a higher content of all the monoterpenes identified, especially α-terpineol (more than 10 times higher than EVs). The other monoterpenes, except β-citronellal, increased at least 3.5-fold relative to the controls. In CS-16, a slight decrease in the content of all the monoterpenes was detected, but to a significant extent only for α-phellandrene, β-citronellal, β-citronellol, and geranial. Lines CS-2 and -14 displayed a reduced accumulation of many monoterpene alcohols and aldehydes, of at least 50% for citronellal, citronellol, and geranial. Regarding the sesquiterpene profiles, lines CS-2 and -14 showed no significant differences when compared with EV lines ( Figure 5B), while in lines CS-5 and -16,  Z-β-farnesene content was reduced by about 60%. The largest changes were again identified in lines CS-15 and -17, which had between 1.9 (β-elemene) and four times [( E)-β-caryophyllene and β-sinensal] higher sesquiterpene concentrations than the EVs. Diaphorina citri Is Less Attracted to CS Than to Control Lines in Four-Arm Olfactometer Assays The response of  D. citri to volatiles emitted from the transgenic orange lines was assessed in a four-arm olfactometer ( Figure 6). Psyllids spent significantly less time in odor fields corresponding to volatiles from all CS lines than in clean air fields ( Figure 6A). Highest significant effect was observed for odor field from line CS-15, in which the psyllids spent about 36% less time in CS fields in relation to EV, while the lowest effect was recorded for CS-6 odor field, in which psyllids expended a bit more than 18% less time than in that of EV. In the remaining CS lines, the reduction of time spent vs. EV was between 24 and 29%. To find out whether  CLas-infected psyllids were also deterred by CS volatiles, new behavioral assays were performed with three selected engineered lines showing different terpene accumulation profiles. A line with increased amount of ( E)-β-caryophyllene (CS-15), a line with reduced content of orange leaf characteristic aroma monoterpenes (CS-16), and a line without changes in the accumulation of terpenes with respect to the controls (CS-5) were selected. Regardless of their volatile accumulation profile, infected psyllids spent significantly less time in odor fields from CS selected lines than in EV ones ( Figure 6B), with reductions between 15% (CS-5 and -15) and 22% (CS-16). It is interesting to note that time spent by psyllids in CS odor fields was lower than in EV fields ( Figure 6), but percentages varied from one set of experiments (healthy psyllids) vs. the other ( CLas-infected psyllids), which were performed along different months and then using different plant propagations. Then to ensure that CS lines are consistently less attractive to the psyllids and the effect of  CLas infection on  D. citri behavior, new statistical analysis was performed. When comparing the data from both experiments ( Supplementary Figure 2), results indicated that just the genotype of the assayed lines was influencing  D. citri response ( F = 5.97,  p = 0.0005), regardless of whether it was  CLas infected or not ( F = 2.24,  p = 0.1348) and without interaction between these two factors ( F = 1.22,  p = 0.2999). Volatile Terpene Emission Profile of CS Leaves Is Highly Disturbed As  D. citri,  CLas infected or not, showed different responses to CS and EV lines that could not be directly related to variations in their volatile terpene content, the emission of these compounds by flushes of selected lines was analyzed. Again, lines CS-5, -15, and -16, plus one control EV line, were chosen. Total monoterpene emission of the CS lines did not differ much from EV lines with the exception of CS-5, which did not emit terpinolene and linalool ( Figure 7A). However, the emission of terpinolene was more than 200-fold higher in CS-17 than in the other lines. Regarding sesquiterpenes, the only ones detected in our emission analyses were those produced by AtCS activity, namely, α-copaene, ( E)-β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene ( Figure 7B). The first one was not detected in EV volatile profiles, while the other two were emitted at a rate of 2 ng/h or lower. Emission rates of all three compounds were much higher in the CS engineered lines, at least 5, 279, and 15 ng/h for α-copaene, ( E)-β-caryophyllene, and α-humulene, respectively. In CS lines, this boosts the emission of sesquiterpene compounds, which was between 100 and 300 times higher than that of controls, leading to an increase in total terpene emission ( Figure 7C). Monoterpene emission was slightly reduced, although not to a significant extent. As a result, there was a radical shift in the profile of volatiles emitted by the CS lines: monoterpenes constituted 99% of the total emitted volatiles in EV lines, and this decreased to 36% in CS-16 and even to 7% in CS-5 ( Figure 7C). Diaphorina citri Is Less Attracted to CS Engineered Sweet Orange Lines in No-Choice Assays To further evaluate the effect of the volatiles emitted by selected CS-lines on  D. citri behavior, no-choice assays were performed. This kind of experiment may give a more realistic view of the response of psyllids, as they can move more freely than inside the olfactometer arena, and visual cues of the orange tree flushes can be added as an attractive parameter to the insect or avoided (with a kaolin spray). At least 99 responsive psyllids were evaluated (at 10 different days) for each genotype, thus circumventing any bias due to uncontrollable factors (atmospheric pressure, air relative humidity, light, etc.). Based on olfactometric and chemical results ( Figures 6,  7), lines CS-5 and -15 (highly repellent and showing the most altered emission profile) and healthy psyllids (easier to culture and not-requiring qPCR to test  CLas infection) were selected for these experiments. In order to avoid the effect of visual cues on this kind of assays, the plants were sprayed with kaolin. Each line was evaluated releasing 10 psyllids each day and scoring their location 1, 4, 8, and 24 h afterward. Eight hours after their release, the EV line contained at least 21% more insects than CS-lines, although the effect was not statistically significant ( Figure 8A). At 24 h, the two tested CS-lines still harbored less  D. citri individuals than the EV control line, with significant reductions of 14 and 23% (for CS-5 and -15, respectively). Finally, the response of  D. citri to a selected CS engineered line (CS-15, highest repellent effect,  Figure 8A) was evaluated in a no-choice assay, but this time, the plants were not treated with kaolin, to take into account the attractiveness promoted by visual cues too. As before, 10 psyllids per plant were evaluated at 10 different days, and the number of psyllids that settled on the different lines was evaluated over 24 h ( Figure 8B). At short time intervals (<8 h), only a slight non-significant reduction in the number of psyllids on CS lines was observed. After 24 h, however, the proportion of psyllids on the flushes was about 16% lower for CS than for EV line.","Huanglongbing (HLB) is a destructive disease, associated with psyllid-transmitted phloem-restricted pathogenic bacteria, which is seriously endangering citriculture worldwide. It affects all citrus species and cultivars regardless of the rootstock used, and despite intensive research in the last decades, there is no effective cure to control either the bacterial species ( Candidatus  Liberibacter spp.) or their insect vectors ( Diaphorina citri  and  Trioza erytreae ). Currently, the best attempts to manage HLB are based on three approaches: (i) reducing the psyllid population by intensive insecticide treatments; (ii) reducing inoculum sources by removing infected trees, and (iii) using nursery-certified healthy plants for replanting. The economic losses caused by HLB (decreased fruit quality, reduced yield, and tree destruction) and the huge environmental costs of disease management seriously threaten the sustainability of the citrus industry in affected regions. Here, we have generated genetically modified sweet orange lines to constitutively emit ( E )-β-caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene repellent to  D. citri , the main HLB psyllid vector. We demonstrate that this alteration in volatile emission affects behavioral responses of the psyllid in olfactometric and no-choice assays, making them repellent/less attractant to the HLB vector, opening a new alternative for possible HLB control in the field.","['Biotechnology', 'Transgenic', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Volatiles', 'Chemical ecology', 'Hlb', 'Asian Citrus Psyllid']","['lines', 'Figure', 'CARYOPHYLLENE SYNTHASE', 'Sweet Orange', 'orange lines', 'Line', 'Psyllids', 'Supplementary Figure', 'control lines', 'Orange']","[E)-β -CARYOPHYLLENE, TPS21, AtCS, -14, -6, Line CS-16, CS-6, “Rangpur” lime, EV-transformed lines, CS, Orange Lines, CS, CS-15, α-terpineol, β-citronellal, CS-16, β-citronellal, β-citronellol, -14, -14, β-sinensal], CS-6, CS-15, CS-16, CS-16, CLas-infected psyllids, CS, CS-17, AtCS, CS engineered lines, CS-16, CS-5 ( Figure 7C, CS-lines, CS-lines, CS engineered line, CS-15]",['TPS21'],[],"['Citrus', 'Citrus']",
154,154,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC8255067\eupmc_result.json,PMC8255067,"Results Mechanical damage (MD) increased the production of terpenes Higher contents of terpenes in MD-treated plants relative to the CK group were evidenced except for one monoterpene and one sesquiterpene. Specifically, from  BCC leaves we detected a total of 21 terpenes induced by MD treatment, including 14 monoterpenes (accounting for 88%, of which 63% was D-borneol) and 7 sesquiterpenes (accounting for 11%), using GC/MS ( Fig. 1A,  1B,  Table S2). Seventeen terpenes (11 monoterpenes, 6 sesquiterpenes) had the highest content 6 h after the MD treatment, and for 2 monoterpenes their content peaked after 2 h and then declined by 6 h post-MD. Furthermore, the carene, pseudolimonene, camphene, sabinene, eucalyptol, D-borneol, terpineol, elemene, and germacrene B contents were all prominently enhanced in the MD_6h samples compared with the CK group, while their levels in the MD_2h samples also tended to surpass those of CK, albeit not significantly ( Fig. 1C). Transcriptome sequencing and annotation, expression analysis of unigenes Based on the ability of MD to increase D-borneol and other monoterpenes’ production, deep transcriptome sequencing of the induced  BCC collected at different hours was performed, as well as the CK group. In total, 67.66 Gb of high-quality base pair data (at least 7.51G per sample and 22.55 G for each group), with a GC content of 48.62%, were obtained ( Table 1). Our PCA analysis of the resulting transcription data revealed a clear separation of the MD_6 h group from both MD_2 h and CK groups, suggesting a high repeatability of the sequencing data ( Fig. 2A). A total of 86,452 unigenes were assembled  de novo, these having a mean length of 837 bp and an N 50 of 1,300 bp ( Table 2). Most of the unigenes (65,483; 75.74%) were shorter than 1,000 bp, while only a few genes (7,308; 8.4%) were longer than 2,000 bp ( Fig. 2B). We then evaluated the quality of the assembled sequences by examining the mapped ratio of the clean data to the assembled unigenes of each sample using RSEM. The result showed that 81.05% of the clean reads could be perfectly mapped to the reference unigenes, indicating the throughputs and sequencing quality were sufficient to ensure the reliability of further analyses ( Table 1). Moreover, the ‘TransRate’ assembly score, which aims to assess the accuracy and completeness of transcriptome assembly, reached 31.45% for  C. campora, a value higher than that of many of other assemblies ( Smith-Unna et al., 2016). We also assessed the assembly completeness using BUSCO, this lent further support to the high quality of the assemblies, in which 80.70% of single-copy orthologs were successfully captured ( Table 2). All RNA-Seq raw data was submitted to CNGBdb (accession number  CNP0000956) and NCBI (accession number  PRJNA679978). And the the de novo transcript assemblies was submitted to CNGBdb (accession number  CNA0020891,  https://db.cngb.org/search/project/CNP0000956/). Using the BLAST algorithm, sequence annotations were performed against the NR, Swiss-Prot, Pfam, COG, GO, and KEGG databases. From this, 27,727 unigenes (32.07%) were annotated by the KEGG database, 25,714 unigenes (29.74%) were identified in the GO database, 13,356 unigenes (15.45%) were annotated against the COG database, and 34,072 unigenes (39.41%) had significant matches to the NR database. In addition, 41,035 (47.47%) and 41,466 (47.96%) of the unigenes displayed significant similarities to known proteins in the Pfam and Swiss-Prot database, respectively ( Fig. 2C). When summed, we found 15,578, 22,906, and 26,732 of the unigenes expressed in the CK, MD_2h, and MD_6h groups, respectively ( Fig. 2D). Among those, 1,582 unigenes were expressed only in the CK group, 5,441 specifically in the MD_2h group, and 9,472 unigenes uniquely so in the MD_6h group ( Fig. 2E), indicating that the MD treatment was able to significantly induce the expression of genes in  BCC. These results provided a general overview of the assembled transcriptome that we then used in our further analysis of DEGs. Comparing the DEGs induced by MD treatment to the enrichment analysis To fully explore potential DEGs induced by the MD treatment, we compared three groups of  C. camphora plants. The DEGs were designated according to an expression level of —log 2 (fold-change) —>1 and FDR <0.05 in each pairwise comparison. This revealed 12,180 (9,643 upregulated, 2,537 downregulated) and 13,466 (9,222 upregulated, 4,244 downregulated) unigenes that were significantly differentially expressed relative to the control samples in the MD-treated samples at 2 h and 6 h post-treatment, respectively. Between MD_2h and MD_6h, we identified 10,477 unigenes significantly expressed (4,570 upregulated, 5,907 downregulated) ( Figs. S1A– S1C). Among the three pairwise comparisons, 2,539 genes were commonly regulated. Finally, a total of 19,149 DEGs were screened among the three comparison groups ( Fig. S1D). To exhaustively explore the presumed functions of the above DEGs, we then performed KEGG and GO enrichment analyses to uncover overrepresented pathways and biological functions in the BCC leaves as induced by their mechanical damaging. Based on the GO analysis, within the main molecular function (MF), cellular component (CC), and biological process (BP) categories the most enriched GO terms of the upregulated DEGs in the CK vs. MD_2 h comparison were protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity, recognition of pollen, and intrinsic component of membrane ( Table S3); in the CK vs. MD_6 h comparison, the over-presented GO terms contained genes were related to transcription, the DNA-templated extracellular region, and heme binding activity ( Table S4). For the MD_2 h vs. MD_6 h comparison, the largest percentages of unigenes identified within the CC, BP, and MF categories were extracellular region, reactive oxygen species metabolic process, and monooxygenase activity ( Table S5). Additionally, KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that the upregulated DEGs from the CK vs. MD_2h comparison could be assigned to 128 pathways, while the top 3 enriched pathways were “plant-pathogen interaction”, “plant hormone signal transduction”, and “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” ( Fig. S1E,  Table S6). In comparing the CK with the MD_6 h group, the most overrepresented pathways for the upregulated DEGs were “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”, “alpha-linolenic acid metabolism”, “plant-pathogen interaction”, “phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis”, and “selenocompound metabolism” ( Fig. S1F,  Table S7). Regarding the MD_2h vs. MD_6h comparison, the KEGG pathways of “ribosome”, “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”, “plant-pathogen interaction”, “MAPK signaling pathway-plant”, and “flavonoid biosynthesis” were the five most enriched ( Fig. 3S1G,  Table S8). Identifying the DEGs related to terpene biosynthesis induced by MD To further assess the effect of MD induction on volatile terpene biosynthesis, we next focused on the expression pattern of genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes. A total of 20 genes participating in the terpene backbone synthesis pathway had their activities significantly altered by MD. These 20 DEGs consisted of 3 homologues of HMGR, 3 homologues of HMGS, 5 homologues of DXS, 2 homologues of IDI, 1 homologues of GPPS, 2 homologues of FPPSs, and 4 homologues of GGPPSs. The expression of each DEGs was substantially increased in MD_2h or MD_6h when compared with the CK group, except for one putative DXS (CcDXS1) and one GGPPS (CcGGPPS2) ( Fig. 3,  Table S9). We spotted 13 TPS-encoding unigenes ( Table 3). According to our phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequences in combination with well-characterized terpene synthase genes, the 13  BCC TPSs could be divided into five subfamilies ( Fig. 4A). The  CcTPS1 (TRINITY_DN14566_c0_g1),  CcTPS2 (TRINITY_DN50688_c1_g1),  CcTPS3 (TRINITY_DN43620_c0_g4), and  CcTPS5 (TRINITY_DN39759_c0_g1) all belong to the TPS-b subfamily, which are responsible for the synthesis of cyclic monoterpenes and contain the RR (X) 8W motif in their N-terminal region. Both  CcTPS4 (TRINITY_DN45508_c0_g2) and  CcTPS6 (TRINITY_DN49732_c0_g3) could be assigned to the TPS-g subfamily, which produces acyclic monterpenes and lacks the RRX8W motif in their N-terminal region. Another three,  CcTPS7 (TRINITY_DN34440_c0_g1),  CcTPS8 (TRINITY_DN40799_c0_g1), and  CcTPS9 (TRINITY_DN46911_c0_g1), are members of the TPS-a subfamily clade, which may encode a sesquiterpene synthase. Next,  CcTPS10 (TRINITY_DN47476_c0_g1),  CcTPS11 (TRINITY_DN47476_c0_g2), and  CcTPS13 (TRINITY_DN51000_c1_g1) belong to the TPS-e/f subfamily, while only  CcTPS12 (TRINITY_DN49635_c3_g3) belongs to the TPS-c subfamily that is responsible for the synthesis of diterpenes. Using the MEME program, the conserved motif analysis revealed that those TPS members clustering in the same subfamily showed similar motif characteristics ( Figs. 4B– 4C). Of these 14 TPSs, 10 were defined as differentially expressed TPS genes, whose expression pattern were shown  Fig. 3. We used these 10 putative TPSs, comprising 5 putative monoterpenoid synthase, 1 sesquiterpenoid synthase, and 4 diterpenoid synthase genes, in the further analyses. The FPKM values of the 10 candidate TPS genes and the content of terpenes were integrated and a correlation analysis was performed to clarify the relationship between them. According to the ensuing correlation networks ( Fig. 4D,  Table S10),  CcTPS1 was positively associated with six monoterpenes (carene, pseudolimonene, camphene, sabinene, L-limonene, D-limonene) as was  CcTPS3 and  CcTPS4 with four monoterpenes (borneol, bornyl acetate, camphor, terpineol). Presumably, CcTPS1 might directly influence the biosynthesis of carene, pseudolimonene, camphene, sabinene, L-limonene, and D-limonene in  BCC leaf tissue, while CcTPS3 may partake in the biosynthesis of borneol, camphor, and terpineol, with CcTPS4 perhaps participating in the biosynthesis of borneol, terpineol, and bornyl acetate. Identifying candidate transcription factor in response to MD Since transcriptional reprogramming is primarily controlled by TFs, we further identified the differentially expressed TFs among the three treatment comparison groups. In this study, 673 differential expressed putative TFs belonging to 30 families were identified in  BCC among the three group comparisons. There are about 58 TF families in higher plants, for which the major TF families, such as AP2/ERF, bHLH, MYB, WRKY, and bZIP, are linked with responses to biotic and abiotic stresses ( Karanja et al., 2019;  Lin et al., 2013;  Liu & Liu, 2020;  Pandey et al., 2017;  Zhao et al., 2011). In line with other published findings, we found many TFs of the MYB family (127 genes), along with those of the AP2/ERF family (81 genes), BHLH family (55 genes), WRKY family (37 genes), and bZIP family (35 genes) ( Table S13). The expression patterns of these five TF families were depicted in  Figs. 5A– 5E and conveyed in  Table S14, which indicated that most of the unigenes in these five TF families (82/127 for MYB, 70/81 for AP2/ERF, 38/55 for BHLH, 31/37 for WRKY, and 29/37 for bZIP) were upregulated in the MD-treated samples at either 2 h or 6 h vis-à-vis the control samples. These screened TFs offered a pool of candidates that can be harnessed to potentially enhance plant resistance to MD. Mining of candidate transcription factors related to monoterpenoid biosynthesis Recently, the MYB-, bHLH-, ERF-, WRKY-, and bZIP-type TFs were shown capable of regulating the expression of plant monoterpene synthase genes ( Sarker, Adal & Mahmoud, 2019). To select candidate TFs able to regulate the expression of monoterpene synthase in  BCC, the abovementioned 335 DEGs belonging to these five TF families were submitted to a gene co-expression network analysis with the three selected candidate monoterpene synthase genes ( CcTPS1, CcTPS3, CcTPS4). The results showed that three homologues of the BHLH family, six homologues of the bZIP family, five homologues of the WRKY family, 12 homologues of the ERF family, and 16 homologues of the MYB family all had strong, positive correlation coefficient values (R 2-values > 0.8) with  CcTPS1 and  CcTPS4. In stark contrast, no TFs were found positively related to  CcPTS3. Based on these results, interaction networks between the two monoterpene synthase and 42 transcription factors were organized ( Fig. 6A,  Table S15). Building on this, we carried out a more in-depth analysis of the sequences of these candidate TFs. First, by using the ORF finder, 37 of the TFs corresponding to 5 WRKY genes, 15 MYB genes, 10 ERF/AP2 genes, 5 bZIP genes, and 2 BHLH genes were discovered to contain a complete ORF. Next, the deduced amino acid sequences of each of these 37 TFs were submitted to the PfamScan, to determine whether a given sequence contained the conserved domains of the corresponding gene family. As a result, the 5 WRKY all contained complete WRKY domains (PF03106.15) and likewise, the 15 MYB genes all harbored a MYB DNA-binding domain with a Pfam ID of PF00249.31. The 10 ERF/AP2 genes, five bZIP genes, and two BHLH genes were confirmed to belong to their corresponding gene families since their respective AP2 (PF00847.20), bZIP_1 (PF00170.21), and HLH (PF00010.26) domains were identified. Taken together, these 37 TFs may play important roles in regulating monoterpene synthase expression to affect monoterpene biosynthesis in  BCC. Therefore, this promising pool of candidate TFs is the focus of our future research. qRT-PCR validation of DEGs from the RNA-Seq analysis To validate the reliability of the RNA-Seq data, we chose 15 genes (nine monoterpene biosynthesis related genes, six transcription factors) to conduct the qRT-PCR analysis. These results basically agreed with the above transcriptome results; hence, our original analysis of the  C. camphora transcriptome is robust ( Fig. 6B)."," Background The borneol chemotype of  Cinnamomum camphora  ( BCC ), a monoterpene-rich woody plant species, is the sole source prescribed by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia for the production of natural D-borneol, a major monoterpene in  BCC  used for millennia as a topical analgesic in China. Nevertheless, the possible gene-regulatory roles of transcription factors (TFs) in  BCC 's monoterpenoid biosynthesis remained unknown. Here, a joint analysis of the transcriptome and terpenoid metabolome of  BCC  induced by mechanical damage (MD) was used to comprehensively explore the interaction between TFs and terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes that might participate in monoterpene biosynthesis in  BCC . Results Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis detected 14 monoterpenes and seven sesquiterpenes. All but two monoterpenes underwent a significantly increased accumulation after the MD treatment. RNA sequencing data revealed that 10 TPS, 82 MYB, 70 AP2/ERF, 38 BHLH, 31 WRKY, and 29 bZIP unigenes responded to the MD treatment. A correlation analysis revealed that three monoterpene synthase genes (CcTPS1, CcTPS3, CcTPS4) highly correlated with multiple monoterpenes, namely D-borneol, camphor, and bornyl acetate, which could be responsible for monoterpenoid biosynthesis in  BCC . Furthermore, five WRKY, 15 MYB, 10 ERF/AP2, five bZIP, and two BHLH genes had strong, positive correlations with  CcTPS1  or  CcTPS4 , judging by their high coefficient values (R 2  > 0.8). The bioinformatics results were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. Conclusion This study provides insight into the genes involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of monoterpene in  BCC  and thus provides a pool of candidate genes for future mechanistic analyses of how monoterpenes accumulate in  BCC .","['Metabolism', 'Transcription factor', 'Transcriptome', 'Monoterpene Biosynthesis', 'Borneol Chemotype Of Cinnamomum Camphora']","['Fig.', 'genes', 'Table', 'TRINITY', 'unigenes', 'DEGs', 'biosynthesis', 'BCC', 'group', 'analysis']","[CK, D-borneol, D-borneol, MD_6h, CK, MD_2h, CK, D-borneol, CK, MD_6, CK, 86,452, 65,483, BUSCO, single-copy, CNGBdb (accession, CNGBdb (accession, Swiss-Prot, 34,072 unigenes, 41,035 (, Swiss-Prot, 22,906, 26,732, CK, MD_2h, MD_6h, CK, MD_2h, MD_6h, —log 2, MD_2h, MD_6h, 2,539, CK, protein serine/threonine, CK, MD_6, MD_6, MF, S5, CK, MD_2h, “, ”, “plant hormone, ”, ”, CK, MD_6, ”, “alpha-linolenic acid, ”, “, ”, “phenylalanine, ”, ”, S1F, MD_2h, MD_6h, “ribosome”, ”, “, ”, “MAPK, pathway-plant”, “flavonoid, ”, HMGR,, HMGS, GPPS, FPPSs, GGPPSs, MD_2h, MD_6h, CK, GGPPS, CcGGPPS2, TRINITY_DN14566_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN50688_c1_g1, TRINITY_DN43620_c0_g4, TRINITY_DN39759_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN45508_c0_g2, TRINITY_DN34440_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN40799_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN46911_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN47476_c0_g1, TRINITY_DN47476_c0_g2, TRINITY_DN51000_c1_g1, TRINITY_DN49635_c3_g3, TPSs, CcTPS1, CcTPS3, CcTPS4, AP2/ERF, MYB, WRKY, bZIP, Liu, MYB, AP2/ERF, BHLH, WRKY, bZIP, S14, MYB, AP2/ERF, WRKY, bZIP, vis-à-vis, MYB-, bHLH-, ERF-, WRKY-, bZIP-type TFs, Adal, CcTPS1, CcTPS3, CcTPS4, BHLH, bZIP, WRKY, MYB, S15, WRKY, MYB, ERF/AP2, bZIP, PfamScan, WRKY, WRKY, PF03106.15, MYB, MYB, ERF/AP2, bZIP, BHLH, AP2, PF00847.20, bZIP_1, PF00170.21]","['TPS-encoding', 'TPSs', 'CcTPS1', 'CcTPS2', 'CcTPS3', 'CcTPS5', 'TPS-b', 'CcTPS4', 'CcTPS6', 'TPS-g', 'CcTPS7', 'CcTPS8', 'CcTPS9', 'TPS-a', 'CcTPS10', 'CcTPS11', 'CcTPS13', 'TPS-e/f', 'CcTPS12', 'TPS-c', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'TPSs,', 'TPS', 'CcTPS1', 'CcTPS3', 'CcTPS4', 'CcTPS1', 'CcTPS3', 'CcTPS4', 'CcTPS1,', 'CcTPS3,', 'CcTPS4).', 'CcTPS1', 'CcTPS4.']","['C.\xa0campora,', 'BCC.', 'C.\xa0camphora', 'BCC.', 'C.\xa0camphora']",[],terpene synthase
156,156,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC8369990\eupmc_result.json,PMC8369990,"Results Identification and Characterization of Scent-Related R2R3-MYB Family Members In a previous transcriptomic analysis, we identified a clade of genes whose expression rose throughout flower development and with increasing floral scent emissions ( Yue et al., 2015). Among these genes,  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 are specifically expressed in flowers. The full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 contain open reading frames (ORFs) of 618 and 693 bp, encoding polypeptides of 205 and 230 amino acid residues with molecular masses of 23.26 and 24.68 kDa, respectively. Analysis of the predicted protein sequences of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 revealed the presence of 2R and 3R repeat signatures at the N-termini: these features of R2R3 DNA-binding MYB proteins ( Figure 1A) are essential for their interactions with regulatory sequences in the promoters of their target genes ( Kranz et al., 1998;  Dubos et al., 2010;  Medina-Puche et al., 2014). We performed a phylogenetic analysis of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 compared to R2R3-MYBs involved in secondary metabolism in other plant species. HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 clustered into different groups ( Figure 1B). HcMYB1 belongs to Group III and shares high amino acid homology with AtMYB77 and AtMYB44 ( Aharoni et al., 2001;  Shin et al., 2007;  Jaradat et al., 2013). In contrast, HcMYB2 belongs to Group I, whose members include AmMYB305, AmMYB340 ( A. majus), AtMYB24 ( A. thaliana), AtMYB21 ( A. thaliana), PhEOBII ( Petunia ×  hybrida), FaEOBII ( Fragaria ×  ananassa) NlMYB305 ( Nicotiana langsdorffii), and PsMYB26 ( Pisum sativum) ( Uimari and Strommer, 1997;  Shin et al., 2002;  Li et al., 2006b;  Liu et al., 2009;  Spitzer-Rimon et al., 2010;  Medina-Puche et al., 2015). The two proteins clustered into different groups and may have different functions and/or operate through different pathways to take part in floral volatile production. Furthermore, to interrogate the evolutionary relationship of six HcMYB family members with Arabidopsis MYBs, a phylogenetic tree was built. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all MYB proteins can be clustered into five different groups (G A–G F). HcMYB1 was clustered into group G B, HcMYB2/6/5 belongs to group G D, while HcMYB3/4 was grouped into G A ( Supplementary Figure 1). HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 Are Expressed During Flower Development and in Response to Auxin The accumulation of floral volatiles increases as flower development proceeds ( Yue et al., 2015;  Abbas et al., 2019). To study this process, we divided the flower development process into six stages ( Figure 2A). The emission of floral volatiles was low during the bud period (F1 and F2), substantially increased beginning at the initial flowering stage (F3), peaked during the full-bloom stage (F4 and F5), and declined at the senescence stage (F6) ( Figure 2B). To examine the relationship between  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 and key volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2) involved in floral volatile contents, we measured the expression levels of these genes.  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 transcript levels were low during early flower development and substantially increased thereafter.  HcMYB1 expression peaked at the full-bloom stage (F4–F5) and decreased at the senescence stage (F6), whereas  HcMYB2 was most strongly expressed at F6 ( Figure 2C). We detected similar expression patterns for  HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2 during flower development ( Figure 2D). Moreover, the expression levels of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 were positively correlated with the emissions of floral volatiles; this correlation was highly significant for  HcMYB1 ( Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, HcMYB1 showed a highly significant correlation with the emission of linalool contents ( Supplementary Figure 3). These results suggest that these genes play important roles in floral scent formation in  H. coronarium. Auxin plays a crucial role throughout flower development ( Krizek, 2011;  Ke et al., 2018). We, therefore measured total auxin levels in  H. coronarium during flower development (F1–F6). The total auxin contents were low during F1 and F2, peaked at F3–F5, dropped slightly at F4, and declined further at F6 ( Figure 2E). The emission of total floral volatiles was correlated with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) contents, suggesting that auxin might play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of these compounds. Under IAA treatment, the contents of the major floral volatiles ocimene, linalool, and methyl benzoate increased by 16, 17, and 20%, respectively, compared to those in control flowers not treated with IAA (CK) ( Figure 3A). Moreover, the expression of key structural volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS5,  HcTPS8,  HcPAL, and  HcBSMT2) was upregulated by this treatment ( Figure 3B). To characterize the expression levels of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 in response to IAA treatment, we performed qRT-PCR analysis.  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 transcript levels strongly increased after IAA treatment, reaching their highest levels at 12 h after treatment. In contrast, a rapid increase in  HcMYB2 and  HcTPS5 expression was observed at 2 h after treatment ( Figure 3C). Volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2) were also upregulated at 12 h after IAA treatment ( Figure 3D). The results suggest that the biosynthesis of floral volatiles is spatially and temporally regulated by HcMYB1 and HcMYB2, which are strongly associated with auxin-induced volatile emissions in  H. coronarium. We also examined the effect of p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB) (inhibit auxin action) on the floral volatile compounds ( Figure 4). In contrast to auxin, the emission of floral volatile compounds decreases. Under PCIB treatment, the contents of eucalyptol, allo-ocimene, β-ocimene, methyl benzoate, and linalool were decreased by 57, 81, 89, 100, and 42%, respectively, compared to those in control flowers not treated with PCIB ( Figure 4A). As expected, similar to IAA, the volatile contents of caryophyllene do not change significantly. We perform qRT-PCR analysis to characterize the expression level of key genes under PCIB treatment. The expression level of key volatile biosynthesis genes  HcTPS1,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS5,  HcTPS8,  HcPAL,  HcBSMT1,  HcBSMT2,  HcMYB1, and  HcMYB2 were downregulated by 79, 93, 64, 89, 33, 97, 96, 75, and 72%, respectively, relative to control ( Figure 4B). The data endorse the aforementioned findings that auxin plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of floral volatile compounds. Furthermore, we quantify the total hormone contents under IAA and PCIB treatment using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). The data showed that under IAA treatment, the total IAA and jasmonic acid (JA) contents were increased by 42 and 35% compared to control. Likewise, the total IAA and JA contents were decreased by 31 and 51%, respectively, while abscisic acid (ABA) contents were increased by 45% under PCIB treatment ( Figure 4C). However, the ABA contents do not change significantly under IAA treatment, suggesting that auxin might play a key role in the biosynthesis of floral volatile compounds via crosstalk with the abovementioned hormones. HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 Localize to the Nucleus and Exhibit Transactivation Activity Most MYB TFs specifically localize to the nucleus ( Zou et al., 2008;  Zhu et al., 2015;  Zhou et al., 2017). However, some MYB TFs localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm ( Li et al., 2006a). The nuclear localization prediction server WoLF PSORT 1 predicted that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 localize to the nucleus. To assess this prediction, we generated HcMYB1-GFP and HcMYB2-GFP constructs in which these genes were driven by the CaMV  35S promoter and used them to transform  Arabidopsis protoplasts. In HcMYB1-GFP- and HcMYB2-GFP-transformed protoplasts, observed green fluorescent protein (GFP) signals specifically in the nuclei, whereas control (GFP) protoplasts showed a ubiquitous distribution of GFP throughout the protoplasts ( Figure 5A). We included nuclear localization signal (NLS)-mCherry in each transformation as a marker for nuclear localization. These results demonstrate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 are nucleus-localized proteins, which is in keeping with their expected roles as transcription factors. Transcription factors regulate their target genes via transactivation activity. To investigate the transactivation activities of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2, we performed transient expression analysis in  Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We fused five copies of the GAL4 DNA-binding element (GAL4BD) and the minimal TATA region (5′-TATAAA-3′) of the  35S promoter to the firefly luciferase ( LUC) reporter; the Renilla luciferase ( REN) reporter gene driven by the  35S promoter as the reporter vector. The LUC/REN ratio from the reporter vector was used as an internal control. We constructed effector plasmids harboring the ORFs of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 ( Figure 5B). Unlike the GAL4BD negative control (empty vector, pBD), HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 activated the  LUC reporter gene. The LUC/REN ratios of HcMYB1, HcMYB2, and GAL4BD-VP16 were 3. 1-, 3. 7-, and 11.1-fold higher, respectively, compared to the negative control ( Figure 5C). These results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 function as transcriptional activators. Virus-Induced Gene Silencing of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 in Flowers Modifies the Emission Levels of Volatiles To investigate the potential involvement of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 in floral scent formation, we suppressed their expression through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in flowers ( Renner et al., 2009;  Yuan et al., 2011). We confirmed that this led to significant decreases in  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 transcript levels compared to those in unsilenced control flowers ( Figures 6A,B). The contents of the volatiles methyl benzoate and linalool in flowers decreased by approximately 57 and 21%, respectively, in response to  HcMYB1 silencing, whereas the eucalyptol and ocimene contents did not change significantly ( Figure 6C). In  HcMYB2-silenced flowers, the contents of methyl benzoate, linalool, ocimene, and eucalyptol decreased by 68, 37, 18, and 17%, respectively, compared to the control ( Figure 6C). We also analyzed the expression levels of key volatile biosynthesis genes ( HcTPS3,  HcTPS5, and  HcBSMT2) in  H. coronarium. In  HcMYB1-silenced flowers,  HcTPS5 and  HcBSMT2 were significantly downregulated, whereas  HcTPS3 did not exhibit any significant changes in expression, compared to the control. Furthermore, in  HcMYB2-silenced flowers,  HcTPS3,  HcTPS5, and  HcBSMT2 were all significantly downregulated compared to the control ( Figure 6D). These results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 play important and overlapping roles in the formation of floral volatiles in  H. coronarium. HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 Activate Structural Genes Involved in the Volatile Biosynthetic Pathway MYB TFs transcriptionally regulate several genes by binding to the MEB [(T)(T)TGAC(C/T)] sequences in their promoters ( Rushton et al., 2010).  In silico cis-element analysis revealed the presence of MYB-binding motifs in  HcBSMTs and  HcTPSs sequences. MYB-core binding motifs were present in ten out of twelve  HcBSMTs. The number of MYB-binding motifs varies from one to thirteen. Interestingly, the number of MYB-bindings motifs in  HcBSMT2 was highest compared to other  HcBSMTs ( Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, MYB-core binding motifs were found in sixty out of sixty-two  HcTPSs. The promoter sequence analysis of  HcBSMT2 (1131 bp) and  HcTPS5 (1555 bp) revealed the presence of MYB-core binding motifs in their sequences. There were 13 and 5 copies of MYB-binding motifs in the sequences of  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5, respectively, suggesting that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 might target these genes. To determine whether HcMYB1 and/or HcMYB2 bind to the promoters of  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5, we performed a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay. Bait strains co-expressing HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 and harboring  proHcBSMT2 grew well in SD-Leu medium containing the antibiotic aureobasidin A (AbA), whereas bait strains harboring  proHcTPS5 grew well only when they expressed HcMYB2 ( Figures 7A,B). These results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 bind to the  HcBSMT2 promoter, while HcMYB2 binds to the  HcTPS5 promoter. To confirm the binding ability of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 to the  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 promoters, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using GST-HcMYB1 and GST-HcMYB2 in  Escherichia coli. The probes used for  proHcTPS5 and  proHcBSMT2 were 49 bp, which start from (+)1168 to (+)1216 and (+)291 to (+)339, respectively. The sequences of the probes are listed in  Supplementary Table 2. Purified recombinant GST-HcMYB1 and GST-HcMYB2 fusion proteins bound to biotin-labeled probes derived from the  HcBSMT2 promoter, leading to a mobility shift, whereas no mobility shift occurred in the presence of GST alone ( Figure 7C). Next, we performed a competition assay, which showed that adding a 100-fold amount of unlabeled probe molecules (as compared to the labeled molecules) to the binding reaction reduced the intensity of the protein-DNA complex signal, and adding 500-fold unlabeled probes prevented any protein-DNA complex from being detected ( Figure 7C). We also observed binding between HcMYB2 and a biotin-labeled probe from the  HcTPS5 promoter ( Figure 7D). These results endorse the aforementioned data that HcMYB1 binds to the  HcBSMT2 promoter and HcMYB2 binds to the  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 promoters. To test the ability of HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 to activate the  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 promoters, we performed a dual-luciferase assay. We individually cloned the promoter regions of  HcBSMT2 and  HcTPS5 into reporter plasmids and the ORFs of  HcMYB1 and  HcMYB2 into effector plasmids ( Figure 7E). HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 significantly enhanced  HcBSMT2 promoter activity (by 4.8-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively) compared to the control ( Figure 7D). Meanwhile, HcMYB2 significantly enhanced  HcTPS5 promoter activity (by 2.4-fold) compared to the control ( Figure 7F). Therefore, HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 activate the  HcBSMT2 promoter and HcMYB2 activates the  HcTPS5 promoter, indicating that these TFs have different target genes in  N. benthamiana leaves. These findings indicate that both HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 are transcriptional activators of volatile biosynthesis genes in flowers. HcMYB1 Interacts With the Auxin-Responsive Protein HcIAA4 by Y2H and BiFC Assays MYB proteins interact with many other proteins involved in hormone signal transduction, such as the jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive repressor proteins of the JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) family and the ABA signal receptor protein PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE LIKE (PYL) ( Qi et al., 2014;  Zhao et al., 2014). In a Y2H assay, HcMYB1 interacted with the auxin-responsive protein HcIAA4, whereas HcMYB2 did not ( Figure 8A). To verify the interaction between HcMYB1 and HcIAA4, we performed a BiFC assay. Expressing the N-terminal half of YFP fused to HcMYB1 (HcMYB1-YFP N) and the C-terminal half of YFP fused to HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP C) in  N. benthamiana leaves resulted in fluorescence. Moreover, the reciprocal experiment with the C-terminal half of YFP fused to HcMYB1 (HcMYB1-YFP C) and the N-terminal half of YFP fused to HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP N) also resulted in fluorescence and the control combinations of YFP C + HcMYB1-YFP N and HcIAA4-YFP C + YFP N did not result in fluorescence ( Figure 8B). To elucidate the functional significance of the interaction between HcMYB1 and HcIAA4, we co-transformed  N. benthamiana leaves with the same amounts of effectors carrying HcMYB1 and/or HcIAA4 in combination with the  HcBSMT2pro-LUC reporter constructs. The effect of HcMYB1 on  HcBSMT2pro expression was repressed in the presence of HcIAA4 ( Figure 8C). These results demonstrate that HcMYB1 directly activates  HcBSMT2 expression, which is modulated by its interacting partner HcIAA4.","Auxin, an important plant hormone, induces the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites by modulating the expression of auxin-responsive genes. In the ornamental plant  Hedychium coronarium , linalool and methyl benzoate are biosynthesized by the terpene synthase (TPS) HcTPS5 and the benzoic/salicylic acid methyltransferase (BSMT) HcBSMT2, respectively. However, the transcriptional regulation of this process remains unclear. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the R2R3-MYB transcription factors HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 in regulating the biosynthesis of these floral aroma compounds.  HcMYB1  and  HcMYB2  are specifically expressed in flowers, their expression is correlated with the emission of volatile compounds in flowers, and is induced by auxin. Moreover, HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 interact with the  HcBSMT2  promoter region. HcMYB2 activates the expression of the linalool synthase gene  HcTPS5 . In flowers with  HcMYB1  or  HcMYB2  silenced, the levels of floral scent compounds were significantly reduced, and  HcBSMT2  and  HcTPS5  were downregulated compared with the wild type. Moreover, HcMYB1 form protein-protein interaction with key scent-related HcIAA4 protein to regulate floral aroma production. Taken together, these results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 play crucial roles in regulating the formation of scent compounds in  Hedychium coronarium (H. coronarium)  flowers in response to auxin signaling.","['Biosynthesis', 'MYB transcription factors', 'auxin', 'Floral Scent', 'Hedychium Coronarium']","['Figure', 'Supplementary Figure', 'floral volatiles', 'IAA', 'IAA treatment', 'genes', 'flower development', 'volatile', 'floral', 'expression']","[Scent-Related, R2R3, MYB, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, R2R3-MYBs, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, AtMYB77, AtMYB44, HcMYB2, AmMYB305, AmMYB340, A. majus, AtMYB24, AtMYB21, Petunia ×, FaEOBII, Pisum sativum, MYB, G A–G F, HcMYB1, G B, HcMYB2/6/5, G D, HcMYB3/4, G A, HcMYB1, Auxin, F2, F5, HcTPS5, F4–F5, F6 ( Figure 2C, HcMYB1, Auxin, auxin, F2, F3–F5, F4, F6 ( Figure 2E, auxin, CK, HcTPS1, HcTPS5, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, auxin-induced, auxin, auxin, Figure 4A, auxin, JA, abscisic acid, ABA, ABA, auxin, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, MYB, MYB TFs, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1-GFP, HcMYB2-GFP, HcMYB1-GFP-, HcMYB2-GFP-transformed protoplasts, green fluorescent protein, GFP, GFP, GFP, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, GAL4, GAL4BD, firefly luciferase, LUC, LUC/REN, GAL4BD, pBD, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, LUC, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, GAL4BD-VP16, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, unsilenced, HcTPS3, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, MYB, MYB-bindings, MYB-core, MYB-core, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, Y1H, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, GST-HcMYB1, GST-HcMYB2, (+)1216, (+)291, (+)339, GST-HcMYB1, GST-HcMYB2, GST, protein-DNA complex, protein-DNA, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, dual-luciferase, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, Y2H, BiFC, MYB, JAZ, ABA signal receptor, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB2, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, YFP, HcMYB1, HcMYB1-YFP N, YFP, HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP C, YFP, HcMYB1, HcMYB1-YFP C, YFP, HcIAA4 (HcIAA4-YFP N), YFP C + HcMYB1-YFP, HcIAA4-YFP C, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB1, HcIAA4, HcMYB1, HcIAA4]","['HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS8,', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS1,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS8,', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS3', 'HcTPS3,', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPSs', 'HcTPSs.', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5,', 'HcTPS5,', 'proHcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'proHcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5', 'HcTPS5']",[],[],
158,158,C:\Users\shweata\snowball\corpus\tps_citrus\PMC8404343\eupmc_result.json,PMC8404343,"Results Light deprivation decreased terpenoid, but increased GLV emissions Predation assays performed with a biparential RIL population of  N. attenuata plants grown in a field plot in the summer of 2017 revealed that  M. sexta eggs and larvae were predated by big-eyed bugs ( Geocoris spp.) during the day time (Fig.  S1), consistent with previous findings [ 27]. Because plant volatiles play essential roles in mediating this tri-trophic interaction [ 23,  26] and to get a better understanding of their diurnal/nocturnal regulation, we collected headspace day and night time volatiles from  N. attenuata leaves on glasshouse-grown plants elicited by wounding plus  M. sexta larval regurgitant (W + R) using PDMS tubing pieces (Kallenbach et al. [ 30], Fig.  1A, B). The assayed leaf was enclosed in a plastic cup which could be wrapped using aluminum foil to locally deprive the treated leaf of light (Fig.  1A, B). We found that the emission of most terpenoid volatiles corresponded strongly to light periods, especially linalool and ( E)-α-bergamotene (Fig.  1C). The emission of these terpenoid volatiles was very low during the night period (22:00–6:00), increased in the morning (6:00–10:00), and peaked during the middle of the day (10:00–14:00), then decreased in the afternoon (14:00–18:00) and returned to low levels in the evening (18:00–22:00). When the leaf was enclosed in a wrapped cup during the middle hours of the day (10:00–14:00), the emission of most terpenoids immediately decreased to low levels, comparable to those measured at night. After the foil wrapping was removed in the afternoon and evening, the emission of these terpenoid volatiles returned to control levels (Fig.  1C). In contrast to the day-emitted terpenoids, many GLVs were abundantly emitted at night and steadily decreased during the day, although some, such as ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and ( Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate, continued to be released at high levels in the morning. Local light deprivation during the middle hours of the day did not alter GLV emissions but up-regulated them in the afternoon, which likely continued through the evening hours (Fig.  1C). The decreased total terpenoid volatile emissions and increased total GLV emissions associated with light deprivation were further confirmed in single 24 h collections after W + R treatments (Fig.  1D). Thus terpenoids and GLVs showed opposing responses to local light deprivation.  Because the volatile emission might also be affected by temperature and humidity caused by wrapping the cups, we monitored these two factors outside of cups, in clean cups and in wrapped cups (Fig.  S2A). We found that there was only 0.8–2.4 °C drop in temperature in wrapped cups compared to clean cups during the wrapping period 10:00–14:00 (Fig.  S2B). The average humidity in wrapped cups were about 9% higher than in clean cups, but it was more variable depending on the enclosed leaf (Fig.  S2B). These difference in temperature and humidity were not supposed to significantly affect the volatile emission in our experimental setups because they were in the comfortable zone of the plants. Silencing  NaPhyB1 expression and ABA treatments altered GLV but not terpenoid emissions We assessed the volatile emissions elicited by W + R treatment in a series of plants individually silenced (by stable transformation with inverted repeat—ir—RNAi constructs) in the following photoreceptor genes:  NaPhyB1, NaPhyB2, NaPhyB1 x NaPhyB2, NaCrypt1 and NaCrypt2 (previously characterized by Oh et al. [ 31]). The emission pattern of volatiles in all the plants were largely unchanged (Fig.  2A, Fig.  S3) with the exception of those of ir PhyB1 plants. Particularly, in plants generated by crossing ir PhyB1 with ir PhyB2 to silence both phytochrome genes, ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate emissions increased in the afternoon. Supplementation of far red light did not alter total terpenoid or GLV emissions as assessed in 24 h collections (Fig.  2B) or collections taken every 4 h (Fig.  S4).  ABA regulated HIPVs but not via stomatal conductance We tested if the day/night patterns of volatile emission were controlled by changes in stomatal resistance, which might influence the release of volatiles from plant tissues (Fig.  3A, [ 32,  33]). We used ABA treatments to increase the stomatal resistance of leaves of empty vector control (EV) and ir MPK4 plants, which, as previously described [ 34], have stomata that are largely in the open state and are not responsive to ABA treatments (Fig.  3A, B). ABA treatment of EV plants increased stomatal resistance during the day, but the diurnal emissions of the terpenoids, linalool and ( E)-α-bergamotene, were not altered in either EV or ir MPK4 plants (Fig.  3C). In contrast, emissions of ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate were upregulated at the sampling period that followed the ABA treatment and returned to control levels at the end of the day in both EV and ir MPK4 plants (Fig.  3C). Interestingly, measurements of the internal leaf volatile pools revealed that ABA treatments decreased the amounts of linalool accumulated in leaves during the middle part of the day in both EV and ir MPK4 plants, although it did not decrease amounts released to the headspace (Fig.  3C, D). Internal ( E)-α-bergamotene pools tended to increase but were not significantly changed by ABA treatment, consistent with the headspace emissions. Internal ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate pools tracked headspace emissions, and both were enhanced by ABA treatments in EV plants, with smaller enhancements in ir MPK4 plants (Fig.  3D).  Thus ABA treatment enhanced the emission of a GLV, which is more abundantly emitted in the dark, despite reducing stomatal conductance. Similarly, impaired red/far red light perception also increased GLV emission. However, neither ABA treatment nor impairment of plant light perception had a significant effect on emission of terpenoids. Genes responsible for terpenoid and GLV biosynthesis are diurnally transcribed A previously published microarray data set revealed dynamic transcriptome changes in  N. attenuata after W + R treatment [ 35]. From this data set,  NaLIS transcripts, encoding the linalool synthase  23, were abundant in the daytime and barely detectable at night (Fig.  4A). Transcripts of the ( E)-α-bergamotene synthase gene,  NaTPS38 [ 24] , were strongly increased in both day and night, however, the rate of up-regulation was greater during the day. Intriguingly, transcripts of  NaHPL and  NaLOX2, both involved in GLV biosynthesis, were also more abundant during the day, even though the emission of most GLVs is nocturnal. Using qRT-PCR we further confirmed that light deprivation strongly down-regulated  NaLIS transcript levels, as well as those of  NaGPPS1 and  NaGPPS2, genes responsible for the biosynthesis of monoterpenoid substrates upstream in the pathway (Fig.  4B).  Cis-acting regulatory elements involved in light-, stress-, phytohormone- and circadian-regulation were identified in the biosynthetic genes We scanned the 2 kb promoter regions of  NaLIS, NaTPS38, NaHPL and  NaLOX2 for  cis-acting regulatory elements (Fig.  5, Table  1, Table  S2).  NaLIS has six and  NaTPS38 five elements identified as potentially involved in responsiveness to light in their promoters, and eight and fourteen were found in the promotors of  NaHPL and  NaLOX2, respectively. Box 4 [ 36] was present in all the promoters with different copy numbers. Some of the elements were found in two or three of the promoters such as the AE box [ 37], G-box [ 38,  39], GT1-motif [ 40], and TCT-motif [ 41]. The others were only found in a specific promoter, e.g. the ACE [ 42] element was only in the promoter of  NaLOX, chs-CMA1a [ 43] in the promoter of  NaLIS, GA-motif [ 44] and I-box [ 45] in the promoter of  NaHPL. The promoter regions of these genes also contained numerous elements responsive tostress and/or phytohormones including JA, MeJA, SA and ABA, specifically: seven for  NaLIS, eight for  NaTPS38, 11 for  NaHPL and 13 for  NaLOX. Notably, the ABRE element (ACGTG/CACGTG/AACCCGG) involved in ABA regulation [ 46,  47] was specifically found in the  NaLIS, NaHPL and  NaLOX2 promotor regions, but not for  NaTPS38. This is consistent with ABA treatment enhancing ( Z)-3-hexenyl acetate emissions and internal pools, and decreasing linalool internal pools, but not affecting ( E)-α-bergamotene (Fig.  3D). A single circadian element (CAAAGATATC, [ 48]) was identified for  NaLIS,  NaTPS38, and  NaLOX2, but not for  NaHPL. "," Background Timing is everything when it comes to the fitness outcome of a plant's ecological interactions, and accurate timing is particularly relevant for interactions with herbivores or mutualists that are based on ephemeral emissions of volatile organic compounds. Previous studies of the wild tobacco N. attenuata have found associations between the diurnal timing of volatile emissions, and daytime predation of herbivores by their natural enemies. Results Here, we investigated the role of light in regulating two biosynthetic groups of volatiles, terpenoids and green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which dominate the herbivore-induced bouquet of N. attenuata. Light deprivation strongly suppressed terpenoid emissions while enhancing GLV emissions, albeit with a time lag. Silencing the expression of photoreceptor genes did not alter terpenoid emission rhythms, but silencing expression of the phytochrome gene, NaPhyB1, disordered the emission of the GLV (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. External abscisic acid (ABA) treatments increased stomatal resistance, but did not truncate the emission of terpenoid volatiles (recovered in the headspace). However, ABA treatment enhanced GLV emissions and leaf internal pools (recovered from tissue), and reduced internal linalool pools. In contrast to the pattern of diurnal terpenoid emissions and nocturnal GLV emissions, transcripts of herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) biosynthetic genes peaked during the day. The promotor regions of these genes were populated with various cis-acting regulatory elements involved in light-, stress-, phytohormone- and circadian regulation. Conclusions This research provides insights into the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of HIPV bouquets, a mechanistic complexity which rivals the functional complexity of HIPVs, which includes repelling herbivores, calling for body guards, and attracting pollinators.","['herbivory', 'Light regulation', 'Hipvs', 'Terpenoid Volatiles', 'Glvs', 'Plant Diurnal Rhythms']","['Fig.', 'ABA treatment', 'ABA', 'GLV emissions', 'emissions Predation', 'emissions', 'emission', 'Geocoris spp.', 'GLV', 'Predation assays']","[PDMS, 22:00–6:00, 6:00–10:00, GLVs, 0.8–2.4 °C, ABA, NaPhyB2, NaPhyB1, NaPhyB2, NaCrypt2, phytochrome, ABA, MPK4, ABA, ABA, MPK4, ABA, MPK4, ABA, MPK4, ABA, ABA, MPK4, ABA, ABA, GLVs, phytohormone-, NaTPS38, G-box [, GT1-motif [ 40, TCT-motif [ 41], ACE [ 42], chs-CMA1a [ 43], GA-motif [ 44, I-box [ 45], tostress, JA, SA, ABA, ABRE element (, ABA, ABA, CAAAGATATC]","['NaTPS38', 'NaTPS38,', 'NaTPS38', 'NaTPS38,', 'NaTPS38.', 'NaTPS38,']",[],[],
