Results and Discussions The XRD pattern of the LLZNO powder is shown in  Figure 2b and was identified as cubic phase (PDF 63-0174). The LD result and SEM image of the LLZNO powder after the attrition milling process, which demonstrated a submicron powder, are showed in  Figure 2a and  Table 1. The D (10), D (50), D (90), and primary particle size of the submicron LLZNO powder were 0.43 µm, 0.59 µm, 0.812 µm, and about 0.1 µm, respectively. The value of D (3,2) (0.575 µm) is similar to that of D (4,3) (0.607 µm), which indicates that the prepared powder had a uniform particle-size distribution. In addition, the powder also had a higher specific surface area (2007 m 2/kg), which means that the powder had a high sintering activity, which can promote crystal growth and the rapid densification of ceramics in the sintering process. The XRD patterns of the LLZNO ceramic samples are showed in  Figure 3. The phases of all the prepared ceramic samples were identified as cubic phases (PDF 63-0174). The crystal parameters of the different samples are showed in  Table 2. The XRD patterns of the samples sintered at 1200 °C × 60 min (SL1) and at 1100 °C × 360 min (SL5) showed a few impure phase peaks, mainly belonging to LiNbO 3 (PDF 82-0459) and Li 7NbO 6 (PDF 29-0816), and due to the decomposition from the high sintering activity of the LLZNO after having been sintered for too long at a high temperature. Moreover, these impure phases decreased the total ionic conductivity of LLZNO ceramics by increasing the resistance of the grain boundary. AC impedance plots and the enlargement of the LLZNO ceramic pellets under different sintering conditions are showed in  Figure 4a, b. The fitting curve of the sample sintered at 1200 °C for 30 min (SL2) is showed in  Figure 4c, and it consists of a quasi-semicircle at high frequency and a long diffusion tail at low frequency. The equivalent circuit model R b(R gbQ gb)(R elQ el), in which R b, R gb, and R el are resistances originating from the bulk, grain boundaries, and Ag electrodes, is used to fit the plots and is shown in  Figure 4d. The total ionic conductivity of the ceramics is mainly decided by R b plus R gb. The total ionic conductivity and relative density of the LLZNO ceramic pellets are showed in  Figure 4e and  Table 2. The highest total ionic conductivity (5.09 × 10 −4 S·cm −1) of the LLZNO ceramic pellets was obtained when sintered at a high temperature and for a short time (SL2, 1200 °C × 30 min), and its relative density is 87.3%. This indicates that high-performance LLZNO ceramics are obtained when sintered at high temperatures only for short sintering times. However, the total ionic conductivity and relative density of ceramic pellets decreased and impure phases occurred when the sintering time was prolonged at 1100 and 1200 °C. The lowest total ionic conductivity (0.35 × 10 −4 S·cm −1) and relative density (83.4%) were obtained when the ceramic pellets were sintered at 1100 °C for 360 min (SL5). Meanwhile, a higher total ionic conductivity (3.49 × 10 −4 S·cm −1) and a higher relative density (90.3%) of ceramic pellets (SL3, 1150 °C × 60 min) were obtained when sintered for 60 min from 1100 to 1200 °C, and this result indicates that, in this study, increasing the sintering temperature too much was disadvantageous for obtaining LLZNO ceramics with good performance. Arrhenius plots and the linear fitting curve are showed in  Figure 5a. The activation energy of ceramics samples is showed in  Figure 5b and  Table 2, and their values are within the range of 0.31–0.33 eV. This indicates that there was no obvious effect on the activation energy of the ceramics when the green pellets prepared from the submicron LLZNO powder were sintered. The variation tendency of the activation energy was similar to the total ionic conductivity, and the lowest and the highest activation energy was 0.311 eV (SL2, 1200 °C × 30 min) and 0.328 eV (SL5, 1100 °C × 360 min). SEM images of cross sections of the LLZNO ceramics, which were sintered under different conditions, are showed in  Figure 6a–e. We found that the grain size of the ceramics that were sintered for 60 min within a temperature range of 1100 to 1200 °C gradually increased from 1~5 μm (SL4, 1100 °C for 60 min,  Figure 6d). A few of the grains were 5 μm and most of the grains were 100~200 μm (SL3, 1150 °C for 60 min,  Figure 6c), and finally, all grains were about 200 μm (SL1, 1200 °C for 60 min,  Figure 6a). Here, we found a mass of abnormal growth grains (AGGs) [ 50], as shown in  Figure 6a,c,e, and a mass of pores were distributed in the AGGs. Meanwhile, the total ionic conductivity was lower when the AGGs were bigger. This was due to the submicron LLZNO powder having a high sintering activity, which made the crystal grain of the LLZNO ceramics have a high specific surface energy during the high-temperature sintering process, and promoted rapid grain growth and ceramic densification in the sintering process. For the above reasons, the growth rate of the grains was higher than the migration rate of the pores at the grain boundaries when the sintering temperature was higher and the sintering time was longer and the pores could not be discharged from the grain boundaries and finally stay on the inside of the AGGs. As a result, the bulk impedance of the crystal grains increased, and the total ion conductivity was reduced. However, although the submicron LLZNO powder had high sintering activity, the growth of grains could not be entirely promoted in a shorter sintering time and at a lower temperature. Therefore, a mass of grains which stayed in the initial state are shown in  Figure 6d (SL4, 1100 °C × 60 min), and this was disadvantageous for lithium-ionic conduction due to the incomplete surface of the LLZNO grains after the attrition milling process. Eventually, the ceramic pellets showed a lower total ionic conductivity (0.51 × 10 −4 S·cm −1). A cross-sectional SEM image of the sample sintered at 1200 °C for 30 min (SL2) is showed in  Figure 6b. It was found that the grains grew uniformly (~4 μm), their surfaces were smooth without pores, and they bond tightly with other grains. A highest ionic conductivity of 5.09 × 10 −4 S·cm −1 was obtained, which indicates that the submicron LLZNO powder had a higher sintering activity and high total ionic conductivity LLZNO ceramic pellets could be obtained by sintered at a high temperature for only a short time. At the same time, the LLZNO ceramic pellets which had a higher total ionic conductivity could also be also obtained when the sintering temperature was properly reduced. Figure 6f shows the SEM image and its EDS mapping, including La, Zr, and Nb in the cross section of the LLZNO ceramic of 1200 °C × 30 min (SL2). The cross section of the sample exhibits a transgranular fracture and an intergranular fracture, and the elements of La, Zr, and Nb are relatively uniformly distributed, which indicates that the Nb element was successfully incorporated into the LLZO lattice. This is also verified by the XRD result. However, the non-uniform distribution of Zr, La, and Nb exists in the central part of the EDS mapping. This indicates that during high-temperature sintering element segregation and depletion occurred due to the different migration rates of the elements.  The specific capacity and coulombic efficiency of quasi-solid-state batteries with LiMn 2O 4 as the positive electrode after 50 cycles of a galvanostatic charge‒discharge test at 25 °C are showed in  Figure 7a. The 1st, 2nd, 10th, 20th, and 50th galvanostatic charge‒discharge curves of quasi-solid-state batteries are showed in  Figure 7b. The quasi-solid-state batteries showed good cycling performance at a current density of 0.02 mA/cm 2 and a voltage within 3.0–4.3 V. The first discharge specific capacity was 106.4 mAh/g and the coulomb efficiency was 93.23%. The 2nd, 10th, 20th, and 50th discharge specific capacities were 106.8 mAh/g, 105.3 mAh/g, 106.9 mAh/g, and 105.5 mAh/g, respectively. After 50 cycles of the galvanostatic charge‒discharge test, the coulomb efficiency was maintained at about 95% and the capacity retention rate was 99.15%. The capacity of the batteries increased in the early stage of the galvanostatic charge‒discharge test, which may be caused by the activation of positive material. This indicates that submicron LLZNO powder can be used in quasi-solid-state batteries, and that the specific capacity and the cycling stability of quasi-solid-state batteries are relatively good. Here, the electrochemical performance of quasi-solid-state batteries using submicron LLZNO powder is only discussed, and further research will be carried out in the future.",NaN,NaN,"['LLZNO ceramic', 'LLZNO', 'LLZNO powder', 'Figure', 'submicron LLZNO', 'ionic conductivity', 'total ionic', 'ceramic pellets', 'sintering', 'ceramic']"

2,C:\Users\shweata\openDiagram\physchem\liion\PMC7048421\eupmc_result.json,PMC7048421,"RESULTS The tremendous extension of cycle life of the SEB over the baseline cell may stem from the denser and more stabilized SEI layer formed on graphite particles and CEI layer on NCM622 particles in the presence of the electrolyte additives. For the baseline cell, the nickel-rich NCM particles are prone to microcracks along grain boundaries ( 5,  6) that provide gaps for electrolyte penetration and lead to more severe electrolyte oxidation and rock salt formation ( 7). Particle cracking also sets free new, fresh surface area from which oxygen can be released ( 8). The microcracks on NCM622 particles for the baseline cell are observed after only 50 cycles ( Fig. 5D). The formation of cracks becomes much more notable throughout the micrograph domain after 956 cycles ( Fig. 5F). For the SEB cells, cracks on NCM particles are not observed at 50 cycles, and a small amount of cracks are observed after 4021 cycles ( Fig. 5J). The presence of microcracks not only causes a loss of contact but also accelerates NCM capacity fade. For the SEB cells, the polymer coating from TAP likely forms a robust CEI, reducing formation of microcracks ( Fig. 2B). This is also evidenced by optical images (fig. S4) and no observable cell deformation or swelling after 4021 cycles even at an elevated temperature of 60°C. The use of the TAP additives altered the EEI compositions markedly. We performed x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the graphite and NCM electrodes after 4021 cycles and compared the EEI structure of the samples from the baseline cell after 956 cycles. At the graphite anode, the TAP-containing electrolyte-derived SEI contains high concentrations of C, O, and P elements, compared to the control sample of the baseline cell ( Fig. 6 and fig. S5). In addition, a higher content of C─C species in the entire C-containing species was also found in the TAP-containing electrolyte-derived SEI, suggesting the decomposition of the TAP at the anode (fig. S5). Meanwhile, the composition of the cathode CEI was also changed. With the TAP additive, the SEI layer has more C, P, and F and less Li and O, compared to the baseline SEI ( Fig. 6 and fig. S5). High contents of LiF and P-containing species (O─P═O, Li xP yOF z, and Li xP yF z) ( 9) were found in the cathode CEI layer, owing to the use of the TAP additive ( Fig. 6). A detailed peak interpretation is as follows: peaks at 284.6, 286.1, 288.8, and 290.1 eV in the C 1s spectrum are attributed to C─C, C─O, O─C═O, and poly(O─C═O) ( 10), respectively; peaks at 684.6 eV in the F 1s spectrum are attributed to LiF; peaks at 686.9 eV in the F 1s spectrum and 136.7 eV in the P 2p spectrum are attributed to O─P═O and Li xP yOF z; and peaks at 686.3 eV in the F 1s spectrum and 134.5 eV in the P 2p spectrum are attributed to Li xP yF z. In comparing O 1s spectrum of the aged baseline (956 cycles) and SEB-3 electrodes (4021 cycles), the peak at 529.2 eV for SEB-3 cathode is effectively eliminated in comparison to that for the baseline cathode ( Fig. 6). This indicates that less lattice oxygen of NCM622 is detected for SEB-3 cathode attendant to a relatively thicker CEI layer. This is consistent with the thicker CEI layer detected by Xia  et al. ( 2) on the coated NMC442 surface in the presence of TAP additive. Thus, the XPS result confirms that the TAP additive leads to a thick CEI layer and, in consequence, slower crack evolution, less gas generation, and longer cycle life. The three SEB cells show very close rates of capacity fade within 1000 cycles ( Fig. 4A). Beyond 1000 cycles, SEB-3 shows a much lower rate of capacity fade than the other two SEB cells, as expected from its lowest reactivity. In comparison with the baseline cell, the stability and long cycle life of SEB cells are clearly evident, the reasons of which can be delineated from the differences in the capacity retention trend at various stages of aging. For the baseline cell, we see a sharp decrease in C/3 capacity retention during the initial stage and a slow decrease in the secondary stage. This is primarily attributed to the loss of lithium inventory during the quick and slow growth of the SEI layer. For the SEB cells, the capacity fade is linear with cycle number, indicating that there is no quick growth in the initial stage of aging as SEI layer growth is suppressed by in situ formation of the flame-retardant protective layer. Moreover, a sharp, nonlinear capacity loss due to lithium plating can usually be observed in the baseline cell at room temperature and at low temperatures in final stages of cell aging ( 11). In all SEB cells operated at 60°C, this lithium plating-induced capacity loss is, however, absent, indicative of no lithium plating in SEB cells. The SEB cell free of Li plating offers a significant improvement in safety over conventional LIB cells. There is another advantage of SEB cells promising for ultralong cycle life when deployed in the field. While conventional LIB cells undergo a large environmental temperature swing, the SEB cells almost always operate at a single, constant temperature (say 60°C) regardless of ambient temperatures and after an extremely short period of initial transition by self-heating (on the order of tens of seconds). The latter feature guarantees minimal damage of battery materials in SEB cells caused by wide temperature variations. For the baseline cell, the capacity loss at elevated temperatures is mainly due to SEI growth on the anode side and solvent oxidation on the cathode side. As a consequence, the DCR increases markedly with cycle number ( Fig. 4B). In the case of SEB cells, the DCR of the fresh cell is initially much larger than the baseline cell; however, its rate of increase is much slower due to the protective coating on both the anode and cathode ( Fig. 2B).  Figure 4 (C and D) shows discharge curves of the fresh SEB cell versus the aged cell, respectively. Because of its DCR increase with cycle number, SEB-3 shows slight power fade after 2821 cycles at 60°C. In contrast, the baseline cell shows a drastic DCR increase and, hence, substantial power loss within only 556 cycles (fig. S6). For all the SEB cells with TAP additive, their DCRs increase linearly and increased additive content leads to higher DCR in fresh cells but slower DCR evolution with cycle number ( Fig. 4B). The SEB cells do not produce gas during cycling tests, yielding more safety than the baseline cell. In addition, cells containing TAP produce less gas during formation than the baseline cell ( 2,  12). Because of the high-voltage tolerance of SEB cells, when charged to a high voltage of 4.4 V as compared to 4.2 V, the SEB cell discharge capacity increases 12.7%, and its discharge energy increases 14.5% (fig. S1B). Thus, the high-voltage tolerance can be used to increase cell energy density. The electrolytes for SEB cells were formulated by reducing EC content and adding TAP as an additive. Although EC is an essential solvent for SEI layer formation, it also leads to gas generation, especially at high voltage ( 13). Calendar aging testing shows that high-temperature and high-SOC conditions accelerate capacity fade and increase in internal resistance while also promoting gas generation. SEB cells initially contains 10 wt % EC in the electrolyte. Some EC is consumed during the formation cycle, resulting in an EC content much less than 10% in formed SEB cells. This is advantageous since the rate of gas generation in an EC-less electrolyte would be lower than that in an electrolyte with high EC content. With the introduction of new materials into the electrolyte, the effect on cell cost, weight, and fabrication should be evaluated. The electrolyte additive, TAP, has a comparable price and density when compared to current standard solvents; thus, no notable material cost difference is expected with the introduction of SEB electrolytes. Unlike superconcentrated electrolytes ( 14), the electrolytes with TAP do not increase the viscosity compared to the standard electrolyte. From a fabrication perspective, the SEB electrolytes will also add no additional cost due to the similarity in processing during and after introduction into a cell. Last, the SEB cells offer an important benefit associated with thermal management of a battery pack. When high power is required, the SEB cells are to be heated internally ( 1) and operated at elevated temperatures. Assuming the environmental temperature is 25°C, and the SEB and baseline cells operate at 60° and 30°C, respectively, the SEB provides a temperature difference driving heat dissipation that is 7× larger than the baseline case. Further, the SEB cell has lower DCR at its operational temperature of 60°C (17.1 ohm·cm 2 for SEB with 1 wt % TAP) than the baseline cell at 30°C (25.3 ohm·cm 2), indicating ~1.5× lower heat generation at the same current. The combination of these two factors eases the burden of thermal management by a factor of approximately 10 for SEB cells. As a proof of concept, we prepare a baseline cell composed of a standard electrolyte, 1 M LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (3/7 wt) + 2 weight % (wt %) vinylene carbonate (VC), and a graphite anode and an NCM622 cathode. Protective layers of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) are formed during initial charge/discharge cycles. To yield low DCR and hence high power, these interfacial layers are usually thin, lacking sufficient density and resilience to resist decomposition under abuse conditions, to suppress continuous reaction of the solvent EC in the SEI, or to hinder continuous oxidation of EC with oxygen released from cathode materials in the CEI, thereby leading to Li consumption and loss of cell capacity. In contrast, in SEB cells, we create highly stable, flame-retardant EEIs through the addition of a small amount of TAP in the standard electrolyte. This electrolyte modification is accompanied by the simultaneous reduction of EC content, i.e., EC/EMC (1/9 wt) + 2 wt % VC, intended for further reduction in gas production via side reactions. In this work, we present results for three prototype SEB cells, identified as SEB-1, SEB-2, and SEB-3 and corresponding to 0.5, 1, and 1.5 wt % TAP, respectively. The charge-transfer resistance of the SEB cells, measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), increases by 3× to 5× as compared to the baseline cell without the electrolyte additives, as shown in  Fig. 2A. The high impedance comes from the polymerization of TAP molecules that form thick and dense interfacial films at the surfaces of both the anode and cathode ( 2). On the anode side, the film serves as an enhanced SEI layer to stabilize further growth. On the cathode side, the film hinders EC in the electrolyte from reacting with lattice oxygen on the NCM surface at high temperature or high voltage ( 3), as shown schematically in  Fig. 2B. PolyTAP and its composites are flame-retardant materials. In addition, the PolyTAP has electrically insulative properties and stability at elevated temperatures ( 4). All these properties make PolyTAP well suited to enhance the safety of SEB cells under abuse conditions. This is confirmed by nail penetration tests shown in  Fig. 2C, where the temperature rise is only 100°C (without cell deformation, smoking, or fire) versus almost 1000°C (catching fire) in the baseline case ( Fig. 2D). The superior safety performance of the SEB cell is further illustrated by the electrical performance of the cell during nail penetration. For the baseline cell, the cell voltage decreases to 0.1 V within 5 s after the nail penetration. The sharp voltage drop indicates that the shorting current is extremely high due to low internal resistance of the baseline cell. In contrast, the voltage of the SEB cell drops from 4.171 to 3.085 V within 5 s after penetration, showing a slow and controlled discharge due to the high internal resistance of the SEB cell. The substantially higher resistance in the SEB cell than the baseline is caused by the electrically nonconductive layers formed on the surface of the graphite and NCM particles, as schematically shown in  Fig. 2B. The stability and safety of SEB cells are further evident in high-voltage charge and high-temperature calendar life tests (figs. S1 and S2). The SEB cells can undergo 1254 exposures to high-voltage abuse [constant current (CC) charge to 4.4 V, constant voltage (CV) to C/20] at 40°C with a capacity retention of 80%, whereas the baseline cell sustains only 40 cycles at the same capacity loss and operating temperature, indicating that the SEB cell is >30× more stable and hence safer than the baseline cells under high-voltage charging conditions. Calendar life testing further shows that the passivated SEB cells can effectively suppress self-discharge. The self-discharge current is measured by holding the cell voltage constant at a required value, such as 4.187 V for 100% state of charge (SOC). Both baseline and SEB cells display a fast decrease of self-discharge current density in the beginning of calendar aging due to anode SEI layer growth. Fresh SEB cells show self-discharging currents ~5× lower than the baseline cell at room temperature and 50% SOC, 6× lower at room temperature and 100% SOC, and ~7× lower at 60°C at both 50 and 100% SOC. After 60 days of storage, the self-discharge current begins to plateau; however, the self-discharge current in the SEB cell is still 2× lower than that in the baseline cell at room temperature and 50% SOC and 3× lower at room temperature and 100% SOC. The self-discharge becomes 4× lower at high temperature (60°C) at both 50 and 100% SOC, indicating that at elevated temperatures, the SEB cells maintain superiority in calendar life over the baseline cell. A distinctive feature of SEB cells is high power on demand. When batteries are not in operation, SEB cells are left idle at room temperature, exhibiting high stability and safety. However, upon operation, a SEB cell switches to high-reactivity conditions through rapid thermal stimulation. This can be illustrated through DCR, which is inversely proportional to power performance. Here, DCRs upon discharge and charge for SEB and baseline LIB cells are measured at 50% SOC by a 10-s hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) method. As expected, the DCR values increase substantially by adding a small amount of TAP in the electrolyte, as shown in  Fig. 3 (A and B), which also demonstrates that adding more TAP in SEB-3 (e.g., 1.5 wt %) results in a further increase in DCR, owing to the formation of thicker protective layers. Figure 3C shows the relative power of SEB cells versus the baseline LIB, where the power of the baseline cell at room temperature is normalized to be unity, thus demonstrating that SEB cells can provide sufficient, higher power by operating at higher temperatures. At 50% SOC, SEB-1 operated at 29.2°C provides the same power as the baseline cell at room temperature. The safest cell, SEB-3, with 1.5 wt % TAP additive requires an operation temperature of 44.6°C to deliver the same power as the baseline cell at room temperature. The baseline cell has a narrow temperature window of 15° to 35°C, whereas the SEB cells have much higher maximum operating temperature without becoming excessively reactive. Thus, the necessity of higher temperature operation for power recovery does not pose an issue for SEB cells. At 50% SOC, the discharge power boost over the baseline Li-ion cell is 2.05, 1.81, and 1.39 for the SEB-1, SEB-2, and SEB-3, respectively ( Fig. 3C). Moreover, at the ambient temperature of 0°C, the baseline LIB cell has a relative power of 0.38, while SEB-2 has a relative power of 1.81 when operated at 60°C [it takes 30 s to heat up a cell from 0° to 60°C at a speed of 2°C/s, typical of the self-heating structure of Wang  et al. ( 1)]. This is ~5× boost in power over the LIB cell for SEB cells working in the freezing environments. Generally, SEB cells perform independent of ambient temperatures or weather, as they are always heated up in a matter of seconds and operate at a constant elevated temperature. Although heating a cell to an elevated temperature consumes cell energy, the total deliverable energy of a cell, counterintuitively, is not reduced. As shown in fig. S3, the C/3 discharge energy was 9.62 watt-hours (Wh) for the baseline cell at room temperature and 10.15 Wh for the SEB-3 cell at 60°C. According to our previous work ( 1), it takes ~1% cell energy for a 10°C temperature rise, meaning that the SEB-3 cell needs 3.5% of its energy for heating from 25° to 60°C; the remaining discharge energy is thus 9.79 Wh, which is 2% higher than that of the baseline cell at room temperature. As mentioned, such rapid heating is achieved through the insertion of a micrometer-thick nickel sheet. The impact of this additional component on cell power density can be evaluated through  Eq. 1, where  m is the mass of the given cell and the ratio of discharge power evaluated through HPPC is inversely proportional to the ratio of DCRs (Power Density)SEB(Power Density)baseline@RT=(DCRbaseline@RTDCRSEB@60°C)(mbaselinemSEB)(1) The addition of the nickel foil increases cell mass by 1.3%, while the ratio of DCRs in  Eq. 1 is the relative power presented in  Fig. 3C at 60°C. On the basis of these values, the power density is not reduced but rather increased by a factor of 2.02, 1.79, and 1.37 in the case of SEB-1, SEB-2, and SEB-3, respectively. Thus, in the case of SEB-3 with the highest internal resistance, the power density is still 37% higher than the baseline cell operated at room temperature. Figure 3D presents the relative interfacial reactivity as derived from the charge-transfer resistance of EIS results. This further confirms that increased operational temperature effectively decreases the charge-transfer resistance of SEB cells and consequently increases the cell reactivity and power. The reactivity boost over the baseline LIB cell is 2.06 for SEB-2. Overall, both relative power and relative reactivity illustrate the ability of SEB cells to achieve high power on demand. On the other hand, the values of relative reactivity of these two cells shown in  Fig. 3D indicate that the SEB cell will be 5× safer and undergo 5× less aging at room temperature, which is supported by self-discharge and capacity retention tests displayed in fig. S2. Furthermore, the comparison of relative reactivity for the two cell types at 60°C indicates that the SEB cell is more than 2× less prone to thermal runaway. Beyond safety and high power, there is an ever-increasing need for long cycle life of LIBs. Low-reactivity SEB cells built with highly stable materials offer longer calendar life (fig. S2), evident from the slow capacity fade when the battery is in idle conditions at room temperature. At elevated temperatures, cycling of SEB cells is also stable.  Figure 4A compares capacity retention of the baseline cell with SEB cells during cycling at 60°C of 1C CC charge to 4.2 V CV charge till C/20 and then 1C discharge to 2.8 V. Clearly, the SEB cells outperform the baseline cell as evidenced by a 20% capacity loss at 481 cycles with visible signs of cell deformation due to gas evolution and graphite anode swelling for the baseline cell, while SEB-3 can achieve 2821 cycles before reaching 20% capacity loss. This corresponds to ca. 6× improvement in cycle life. In addition, SEB-3 achieves 4014 cycles at 75% capacity retention while still showing signs of a healthy cell capable of cycling stably (no perceptible gassing or lithium plating). The average discharge capacity of these 4014 cycles is 84.2% of an equivalent full cycle (EFC). Assuming a 153-mile driving range per EFC for an electric vehicle (e.g., 2019 BMW i3), the 4014 cycles mean >517,000 miles of lifetime. That is more than 5× the warranty for commercial electric cars (e.g., BMW i3, 70% capacity for 8 years or 100,000 miles). Improvement of cell lifetime can be further demonstrated by considering the rate of capacity fade during calendar aging at room temperature (i.e., the stable state), which is 7× lower than that at 60°C (the reactive state). The SEB cell will only be heated to the reactive state for situations requiring high power or fast charging. The greater part of its lifetime (>90%) would be spent in idle conditions (the stable state). Therefore, in the field, the SEB cycle life is expected to extend much beyond 4014 cycles before reaching 25% capacity loss.",NaN,NaN,"['SEB cells', 'SEB cell', 'SEB', 'baseline cell', 'cell', 'cells', 'Fig.', 'baseline', 'temperature', 'TAP']"
3,C:\Users\shweata\openDiagram\physchem\liion\PMC7052225\eupmc_result.json,PMC7052225,"Results and Discussion Fabrication of self-standing films As shown in Figs.  1 and  2, thin films that are approximately 100-µm thick are obtained through the aforementioned fabrication technique. The calendering of self-standing films results in reduced thickness, as discussed below. Generally, average thickness reductions of 20 and 30% are observed when the electrodes are calendered at 50 and 80 °C, respectively. The films are fully bendable, rollable, and resistant, as shown in Fig.  1. Punching an electrode from the film does not affect the integrity of the electrode, as shown in Fig.  2c. The carbon-rich side produced during the first fabrication step (Fig.  2a) remains totally similar after the filtration of the solution that contains the active material. The FB-rich side shown in Fig.  1b is then filled with active material and carbon during the second filtration step. A two-layer electrode film composed of a carbon current collector, a layer of active material, and carbon is subsequently fabricated. This method is interesting because it avoids the inclusion of the mass of an aluminum current collector. This mass can be replaced with more cellulose fibers or carbon in order to fabricate a strong film with a higher carbon content than a film casted on a metal current collector. In fact, for an electrode (~6 mg/cm 2 of active material) casted on an aluminum foil, the active material (e.g., LFP) accounts for 53% of the total mass, whereas the inactive aluminum is 41 wt.%. Approximately 6% of the electrode mass corresponds to the binder and carbon. Another interesting aspect is that the quantity of active material may be accurately determined because it is weighed before it is introduced to the beaker and before the filtration step (Scheme  2). Depending on the battery configuration or cathode/anode material utilized, the quantity of active materials (in mg·cm −2) in the self-standing film can be easily adapted. In order to confirm that raw cellulose fibers can be used as a support for the active material in a Li-ion battery, a simple paper electrode entirely composed of cellulose fibers is fabricated. This electrode is tested as a working electrode in a coin cell versus lithium metal. The cycling voltammetry experiment shown in Fig.  3 reveals that the cellulose fibers ( ) are totally electro-inactive up to 4.2 V, thus confirming their possible integration in Li-ion battery manufacturing. In fact, the electrochemical response in the potential window from 2 to 4.2 V vs. Li/Li + is similar to that obtained in a bare electrode ( —) that is only composed of a stainless steel spacer. The currents recorded are approximately 10 4 lower than those obtained when an LFP cathode is cycled, as shown in Fig.  4. In the new fabrication process, a third step can be included. As an option, a paper separator can be directly deposited onto the electrode film, as shown in Fig.  2d. Cyclic voltammetry is employed to characterize the produced film and verify the influence of the paper separator on the electrochemical properties. A Celgard separator is employed to compare the electrochemical behavior of an electrode without an integrated paper separator. Figure  4 shows the cyclic voltammetry experiments performed at a scan rate of 0.03 mV·s −1 on a self-standing LFP electrode with (—) and without ( ) a paper separator added on top of the electrode. The obtained results indicate that the additional layer does not adversely affect the electrochemical properties of the LFP electrode because the polarizations (∆E) of the two electrodes are similar. Furthermore, the intensity of redox peaks of the electrode integrated with the paper separator is slightly higher than that of the LFP electrode alone. This can be explained by the enhancement of mechanical properties and the increased integrity of the film. A similar behavior resulting from the use of water-soluble carbons is observed. These water-soluble carbons yield a stronger film and lead to a better penetration of carbon and active material into the voids created by the cellulose matrix. Morphological analyses of self-standing films The surface topology of cellulose electrode films made of unmodified and modified VGCF carbons and with/without LFP is obtained through 3D confocal microscopy experiments. Figure  5 shows the optical and 3D confocal microscopy images of the FB-rich side of these different cellulose films. In the first fabrication step, the carbon current collector is created, thus producing carbon-rich and FB-rich sides, as shown in Fig.  1. The FB-rich side is particularly inhomogeneous and highly porous, as shown in Fig.  5a,b. After the second step, which involves the filtration of the mixture of LFP and unmodified VGCF carbon, the surface appears smoother (Fig.  5c,d) and is mainly composed of carbon that has not migrated inside the electrode. The poor dispersion of carbon in the electrode results in an inferior electrochemical performance, which is worse than the performance of an electrode made of modified VGCF-COOH carbon. In fact, after aryl-COOH groups are grafted, the carbon fibers become more soluble in water and are well-distributed in the bulk of the electrode. The FB-rich side of the LFP electrode made of VGCF–COOH (Fig.  5e,f) is basically similar with that obtained for the cellulose film without an active material (Fig.  5a,b) except that some voids are filled with LFP and carbon. This is attributed to the better penetration of modified carbon into the pores of the electrode. The SEM images of an LTO self-standing film are presented in Fig.  6. The top (Fig.  6a) and bottom views (Fig.  6b) represent the FB-rich and carbon-rich sides, respectively. As shown in the top-view image, the pores created among the large cellulose fibers is filled with the mixture of modified VGCF and LTO materials. The corresponding C and Ti elemental mappings are shown in Fig.  SI1, indicating that carbon and LTO exhibit good dispersion. The bottom view (Fig.  6b) only shows the VGCF–COOH fibers that form a strong carbon mat (which is expected) that is ideal for electron conduction and current collection. The inset shows the intertwined carbon fibers that reinforce the electrode film. Finally, the cross-section of the electrode film presented in Fig.  6c shows a carbon-rich area that is approximately 20 µm thick with no (or extremely few) LTO particles. Inside the electrode (Fig.  6d), a composite of well-dispersed LTO particles with interconnected VGCF carbon fibers is observed; this composite permits strong electrode adhesion and good electrical conduction. The chemical mapping of the cross-section of this self-standing film that illustrates Ti and C dispersions inside the electrode is shown in Fig.  7. A high carbon concentration is effectively located on one side of the self-supported film with the presence of an extremely small amount of titanium. The LTO material is well-dispersed in the bulk of the film, demonstrating that thick film electrodes with high active mass loading can be easily obtained with this technique. Carbon is also well-dispersed, ensuring good electrical conduction throughout the film thickness, as demonstrated by the electrochemical performance of self-standing electrodes presented below. Electrochemical performance of LFP electrodes Figure  8 shows the (a) cycling voltammetry and (b) rate capability experiments performed for the three LFP electrodes with the same loading and conducted according to the same procedure. Three different carbons, however, are used: unmodified VGCF (—), COOH-aryl ( ), and SO 3H-aryl-modified VGCF (· · · ·). Although the cyclic voltammograms are relatively similar, Fig.  8b shows a clear improvement of the electrochemical performance when modified VGCFs are used, especially at 2 C and 5 C cycling rates. At a low current density (C/10), the discharge capacities of all electrodes are similar, i.e., approximately 155 mAh·g −1. When the cycling rate is increased to 1 C, the discharge capacity remains at approximately 140 mAh·g −1 for electrodes that contain the modified VGCF. On the other hand, for the film made of VGCF, 120 mAh·g −1 is obtained. At a 5 C rate, a similar discharge capacity of 120 mAh·g −1 is obtained for the electrode containing the COOH-aryl-modified VGCF. As discussed above, water-soluble carbons are well-dispersed in the pores created by cellulose fibers, thus resulting in better electrical conductivity in the film. At 5 C, approximately 50 and 77% of the initial discharge capacity is recovered when the VGCF and COOH–aryl-modified VGCF are employed, respectively. The inset in Fig.  8a shows that cellulose fibers are visible on the surface of the electrode made of VGCF–COOH carbon. This observation confirms that the modified carbon migrates inside the film during the process, thus leading to a better contact between the LTO and carbon fibers (Fig.  6d). Similar electrochemical improvements were reported by Wu  et al. with their cathode composite made of carbon-coated LFP nanoparticles that are electronically connected with CNTs, thus forming an optimal three-dimensional conducting network 51. Modified Denka and CNT carbons were also tested in the composition of the electrodes and the electrochemical results of such cathodes are shown in Fig.  SI3. Despite water-soluble CNTs gave a small improvement of electrochemical performance at high C-rates, the modified VGCF remains the best choice for making the electrode for economic reasons. The use of water-soluble carbons demonstrates that better electrochemical performance and shorter preparation time can be achieved; accordingly, the modified LFP with aryl-COOH groups is prepared. The same method for carbon modification is employed but with certain differences. The reaction procedure is represented in Scheme  1 (reaction b). The modification is conducted in acetonitrile rather than acidic media because the LFP powder rapidly reacts with water and acids 48–  50. Figure  9 shows the electrochemical performances of two LFP electrodes made of modified LFP–COOH materials with different thicknesses. First, it should be noted that the grafting of organic species on the LFP does not adversely affect the electrochemical performance because the rate capability is practically identical regardless of whether pristine or modified LFP is used. Although this result has not been verified, it indicates that the amount of grafted groups should be extremely low (<1 wt.%) as indicated by the performances remaining unchanged. An extremely high loading of grafted groups leads to an unsatisfactory rate capability, as demonstrated by recent works 47,  52. In conclusion, the use surface-modified carbon and LFP–COOH allows the fabrication of a strong self-standing film in less than 10 min by simply mixing the components in water. As shown in Fig.  9, a slightly higher capacity is obtained after calendering at 80 °C because the contact between the carbon and active material inside the electrode is better. The same result is obtained with the unmodified LFP electrodes calendered at 50 °C (Fig.  SI2; Supporting Information). At 25 °C, an approximately 100-µm thick film is obtained, whereas ~80 and ~70 µm are measured after calendering at 50 and 80 °C, respectively. Electrochemical performance of LTO electrodes The LTO (Li 4Ti 5O 12) is an active material that is being considered for application in Li-ion batteries 53. This material does not form a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer because its working voltage occurs at a sufficiently high potential (1.55 V vs. Li/Li +). Moreover, the LTO qualifies as a zero-strain material because it remains stable during the insertion/deinsertion of lithium 54. Similar to the LFP, the LTO is a relatively inexpensive material and therefore a perfect candidate for the production of low-cost batteries. Self-standing LTO films with different loadings are prepared following the same method of fabrication described in Scheme  2. The cyclic voltammetry and rate capability experiments are presented in Fig.  10. When the load is increased (because of the LTO mass), the intensity of redox peaks in the voltammogram (Fig.  10a) increases, and the polarization slightly decreases. This behavior demonstrates that this technique of fabrication can be adapted for high loads of active material. Furthermore, the corresponding rate capabilities shown in Fig.  10b are considerably similar up to a rate of 2 C. At 2 C, approximately 135 mAh·g −1 is obtained, representing ~85% of the initial discharge capacity (160 mAh·g −1). A few slight variations among the anode capacities are observed at 5 C; nevertheless, approximately 90–100 mAh·g −1 is delivered. Similar to the LFP cathodes, a better electrochemical performance is obtained when a small amount of CNT–COOH is added to the composition of the LTO electrode. For instance, at a 5 C rate, a specific capacity of 120 mAh·g −1 is obtained (Fig.  SI4; Supporting Information). The cyclability of LTO self-standing electrodes is evaluated with long cycling experiments at a rate of C/2. Figure  11 presents the capacity retention of two different compositions of electrodes with more than 300 charge/discharge cycles. Practically 100% of the initial discharge capacity at C/2 is recovered at the end of experiment. Stable discharge capacities of 157 and 150 mAh·g −1 are thus obtained through several hundreds of cycles when the electrode is fabricated with ( ) and without CNT–COOH (▪). Moreover, a stable Coulombic efficiency of appoximately 99.9% is obtained by both electrodes at 300 cycles. After cycling, the cell is disassembled, and the self-standing electrode remains totally intact without the dissolution of active material or carbon in the electrolyte (Fig.  SI5; Supporting Information). Electrochemical performance of complete LFP/LTO batteries Complete Li-ion batteries are assembled with the self-standing LFP and LTO electrodes. The LTO anode material is in the delithiated state and three Li + ions can be inserted according to Eq. ( 1) 55. 1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$3{\rm{L}}{\rm{i}}{\rm{F}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{P}}{{\rm{O}}}_{4}+{\rm{L}}{{\rm{i}}}_{4}{\rm{T}}{{\rm{i}}}_{5}{{\rm{O}}}_{12}\to 3{\rm{F}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{P}}{{\rm{O}}}_{4}+{\rm{L}}{{\rm{i}}}_{7}{\rm{T}}{{\rm{i}}}_{5}{{\rm{O}}}_{12}$$\end{document}3LiFePO4+Li4Ti5O12→3FePO4+Li7Ti5O12 The practical capacity of 165 mAh·g −1 for the LTO electrode is slightly higher than that obtained for the LFP self-standing film (160 mAh·g −1); hence, electrochemical cells with an LFP/LTO mass ratio of approximately 1 can be used. Apart from this ratio, however, the use of a minimal amount of excess LTO material achieves an LFP/LTO mass ratio of ~0.85. This excess is preconized for safety concerns and is generally employed in commercial batteries. A full Li-ion battery is assembled with a standard Celgard separator and another with a Kodoshi paper separator to produce an all-paper battery. Compared to the cell assembled with a Celgard separator, the battery that employs a paper separator is observed to achieve a better electrochemical performance: for every C rate ranging from C/24 to 2 C, 10 mAh∙g −1 is added to the obtained discharge capacity (Fig.  SI6; Supporting Information). The electrochemical performance is significantly better when a paper separator is employed; hence, several LFP/LTO batteries with different amounts of active materials and Kodoshi paper as separator are assembled. According to the fabrication method described in Scheme  2, LFP and LTO masses in the range 40–70 mg are utilized. Li-ion batteries with LFP/LTO mass ratios of 1 and ~0.85 are electrochemically tested; the rate capabilities of such electrodes are shown in Fig.  12. The results do not exhibit particular differences when an excess amount of anode material is utilized, which is a valid observation. A remarkable improvement, however, is evident when the battery is cycled at a high C rate. In fact, at a 5 C rate, for the two electrodes made of 50 mg of LFP, the specific capacities obtained are approximately 105 and 115 mAh·g −1 when LFP/LTO mass ratios of 1 and 0.85 are utilized, respectively. Under these conditions, a better retention capacity at high C rates should therefore be obtained; however, additional results should be obtained to confirm this observation. Overall, the specific capacities obtained are slightly lower when the anode and cathode loadings are increased especially at high C rates. For instance, a battery that is assembled with electrode films made of 40 mg of LFP and LTO (▪) delivers a capacity of 135 mAh·g −1 at 2 C. On the other hand, 125 mAh·g −1 ( ) and less than 120 mAh·g −1 ( ) are obtained when films composed of 50 and 60 mg of LFP and LTO are employed, respectively. The same behavior is observed at 5 C because 115, 105, and 95 mAh·g −1 are delivered by the electrode films fabricated with 40, 50, and 60 mg of active materials, respectively. The cyclability of a complete LFP/LTO battery made of 70 mg of active material is evaluated over 1000 cycles at a 2 C rate after several cycles of formation (Fig.  13). An initial discharge capacity of approximately 130 mAh·g −1 is obtained with a high capacity retention of ~91.6% after 1000 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the foregoing is one of the best results reported in literature for an all-paper full cell. In contrast, the LFP/LTO battery reported by Cornell  et al. 36 delivered an initial discharge capacity of 140 mAh·g −1 at C/10. Apart from a low coulombic efficiency, a poor capacity retention of 87% is observed after only 20 cycles. The decrease in the active mass loading is found to deteriorate the cyclability of the battery. In fact, the same experiment with electrodes made of 40 mg of LFP and LTO has resulted in a capacity retention of only 82.9% (Fig.  SI7; Supporting Information). In both cases, however, a high Coulombic efficiency of ~99.9% is obtained. This observation may possibly be explained by the better contact between the active material (LFP or LTO) and carbon in the heavier film, leading to slightly higher capacities and avoiding the progressive electrical isolation of the active material (i.e., better capacity retention). This capacity loss is already observed among electrodes made of LFP sub-micrometer plates 56 and micro-sized LFP 57 cycled at 1 C. Further cycling experiments at C/2 among different electrode compositions are performed, and the same conclusion is obtained. These results are shown in Fig.  SI8b, which also shows that capacity retentions of 89.6, 90.8, and 91.4% are obtained when 40, 60, and 70 mg of LFP are used, respectively. Electrochemical performance of PTCDA electrodes Organic electrodes are known to be potential candidates for next-generation Li-ion batteries 9,  58. Organic electrodes could lower the cost of battery manufacturing because organic materials can be prepared from natural products and biomass 59. Moreover, because of the absence of inorganic structures and metals, such as cobalt or nickel, batteries made of organic materials are eco-friendly and totally recyclable. The possible fabrication of a self-standing organic cathode film that is solely composed of recyclable materials (cellulose, carbon, and redox-active organic molecule) is therefore demonstrated. A number of organic molecules have been reported as possible active materials in Li-ion batteries 60–  63. For our experiments, an inexpensive commercial 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) molecule, which has a theoretical capacity of 273 mAh·g −1, is selected. Self-standing PTCDA cathodes with different active mass loadings are prepared according to the method described in Scheme  2. This organic molecule is partially soluble in water; hence, the preparation of cathode is considerably simple, and the PTCDA is securedly contained in the cellulose/VGCF substrate. The cyclic voltammetry and rate capability experiments for the PTCDA electrodes are presented in Fig.  14. This organic molecule is known to be a semiconductor 64, and its rate performance and stability are considerably poor because of its low electrical conductivity and high solubility in an electrolyte. In fact, the increase in the PTCDA mass in the self-standing film has also increased polarization (Fig.  14a) although the intensity of the redox peak has slightly increased. This behavior is confirmed by the rate capability experiments shown in Fig.  14b. During the discharge of PTCDA electrodes, the voltage suddenly drops, as reported by recent articles on organic cathode materials 65,  66. The initial drop from the OCP to a plateau at approximately 2.4 V vs. Li/Li + is caused by the transformation from the PTCDA to lithium enolate with the assimilation of Li + ions. The specific capacity obtained, however, is approximately 137 mAh·g −1, which corresponds to only half of the theoretical capacity because only two lithium ions react with ketones 67. The insertion of the other two Li + ions occurs in the potential window range of 0.9–1.3 V vs. Li/Li +. An intense discharge process, however, will damage the structure and therefore result in a strong irreversibility 65. When self-standing PTCDA electrodes are cycled at C rates that exceed 1 C (Fig.  14b), the discharge capacities considerably decrease with the increase in active mass loading. The discharge capacities are therefore approximately 110, 60, and only 35 mAh.g −1 at 5 C for PTCDA electrode films composed of 40, 50, and 60 mg of active materials, respectively. These electrochemical performances, however, are better than those generally reported for electrodes spread on aluminum current collectors with inferior active mass loadings 67. As an example, following the new fabrication method, an approximately 6-mg·cm −2 PTCDA electrode is capable of delivering 120 mAh·g −1 at 1 C. Figure  15 presents the capacity retention over 100 charge/discharge cycles for two electrodes with different compositions after performing a rapid formation at 5 C. This formation has prevented the migration of PTCDA in the electrolyte, and the Coulombic efficiency has remained at approximately 100% in all the cycling experiments. Electrochemical performance for battery doublons cycled without the formation at high C-rate are presented in Fig.  SI9. In this case, a rapid decrease of Coulombic efficiency was observed with cycling. Post-mortem microscopy analyses of the cathode surface after cycling at a 5 C rate should be performed to understand the reasons that cause the better electrochemical performance. It is probable that during cycling at a high C rate, the PTCDA molecules do not have sufficient time to migrate to the electrolyte and are confined in the cathode. During the same time, a passivation film is formed at the surface of the cathode because of electrolyte degradation. This layer could impede the PTCDA dissolution in the electrolyte without affecting the electrochemical performance. Although the resulting Coulombic efficiency becomes better by rapidly performing five cycles at 5 C, this improvement has no significant impact on the cyclability because 80 and 91% of the initial discharge capacity at C/10 are obtained after 70 charge/discharge cycles at C/10 for the electrodes composed of VGCF–COOH (Fig.  15, □) and a mixture of VGCF–SO 3H and CNT–SO 3H (Fig.  15,  ), respectively. These values are relatively similar to those calculated in the galvanostatic cycling experiments shown in Fig.  SI9. It is evident that the use of a small quantity of CNT–SO 3H in the composition of the electrode enhances not only the discharge capacity delivered but also the cyclability over hundreds of cycles. The rapid capacity loss observed after 80 charge/discharge cycles in the self-standing film composed of VGCF–COOH is probably caused by the degradation of the Li metal anode 68. This is confirmed by the additional electrochemical results obtained using PTCDA electrodes with higher active mass loadings (Fig.  SI10, Supporting Information), which sustain a rapid capacity decay after only 70 cycles. In fact, the increase in active mass induces the increase in the cycling current, which promotes the formation of lithium with a high surface area and leads to an insufficient cycle life 69. The method of fabrication described in this work is clearly adapted to the use organic cathode materials. The electrochemical performance (capacity and Coulombic efficiency) obtained is considerably better than those usually reported for PTCDA cathodes with lower active mass loadings 70. Moreover, to avoid the shuttle effect on the PTCDA electrode, the rapid formation at 5 C is considered and should be applied to other high-capacity organic molecules, such as anthraquinone 71 or 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride 72. Electrochemical performance of complete LFP/graphite batteries In order to produce a low-cost Li-ion battery with recyclable organic cathode and anode, self-standing graphite electrodes are also prepared. Graphite is the most common anode material used in Li-ion batteries 73. With a theoretical capacity of 372 mAh·g −1, which corresponds to that of stage-I compound LiC 6, graphite has remained a common choice for anodes in Li-ion batteries 74. Section SI10 (Supporting Information) presents the electrochemical performances of different graphite electrodes made of pristine SO 3H-modified graphite powders (Figs.  SI11 and  SI12). The self-standing anode is firstly combined with the LFP, and the full LFP/graphite battery is assembled with an excess capacity for the anode. The charge/discharge profile of the first cycle at C/24 of the corresponding battery is presented in Fig.  16a. A flat plateau at approximately 3.25 V is obtained with a small polarization, and the first discharge delivered is approximately 125 mAh·g −1. The overall potential is more interesting than that of the LFP/LTO system presented earlier; however, the specific capacity is lower because of the irreversible consumption of lithium by the graphite anode. As shown in Fig.  16a, this strong irreversibility results in a Coulombic efficiency of only 76% for the first cycle, but it practically reaches 100% in the succeeding cycles at 1 C. A long-term cycling experiment is also performed for 300 cycles at a cycling rate of 1 C. Figure  16b presents the stability of the LFP/graphite battery. After 300 charge/discharge cycles, the specific capacity is approximately 88 mAh·g −1, which corresponds to 85% of the initial discharge capacity obtained at 1 C. Although the Coulombic efficiency remains constant at approximately 100% during the entire experiment, a gradual capacity fading is evident probably because of the cathode and anode, as shown in Figs.  13 and  SI12. In contrast, the all-paper LFP/graphite battery fabricated by Leijonmarck  et al. exhibits poor cyclability 31. In fact, after 300 charge/discharge cycles at 1 C, approximately 50 mAh·g −1 is obtained, which corresponds to a retention capacity of ~45%. Electrochemical performance of complete PTCDA/graphite batteries An all-organic prototype PTCDA/graphite battery without transition metal is prepared and electrochemically tested. It is among the first self-standing batteries that is composed of organic redox molecules and biodegradable components reported in literature. The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate the concept of a battery that is both inexpensive and biodegradable. First, a prelithiation step is necessary, however, because the PTCDA molecule is in its oxidized form. To this end, the PTCDA self-standing film is assembled with a lithium counter electrode in a coin cell. Figure  17a shows the initial discharges of up to 1.5 V vs. Li/Li + of three PTCDA/Li batteries made of 50 and 60 mg of organic cathode material. To achieve the complete lithiation of PTCDA, the potential is maintained at 1.5 V for 3 h (chronoamperometry experiment in Fig.  17b). The coin cell is disassembled, thereafter, and the prelithiated PTCDA cathode is recovered to be assembled with a graphite anode. The initial charges (— and ‒ ‒ ‒) and discharges (  and  ) obtained at a constant current of C/24 between 1.5 and 3.5 V versus graphite of two prelithiated PTCDA/graphite batteries are presented in Fig.  18a. For the PTCDA, the first charge is higher than the theoretical capacity of 137 mAh·g −1. It reaches 160 mAh·g −1 because of the formation of SEI at the graphite anode surface. In fact, anodes in general 75, especially graphite anodes 76, sustain high first-cycle active lithium losses (ALL), which results from lithium-consuming parasitic reactions, such as the formation of an SEI 77. In particular, carbons and graphites with high surface areas result in more SEI formations and thus higher ALL 78. In general, the loss of active lithium resulting from its consumption in the positive electrode material permanently reduces the available energy. When the PTCDA/graphite battery is discharged, a small quantity of lithium is irreversibly consumed by the anode, and only 104 and 108 mAh·g −1 are obtained when the cathode is made of 50 and 60 mg of PTCDA, respectively. The long-term cycling experiments at C/10 for these batteries are shown in Fig.  18b. As observed in graphite electrodes (Fig.  SI12), a continuous capacity loss upon cycling occurs in complete PTCDA/graphite batteries mainly because of the graphite anode’s consumption of lithium. A slight improvement is observed when the mass of prelithiated PTCDA increases because of the higher amount of available lithium. For this reason, future works will focus on the optimization of cathode/anode active mass ratios. Additional tests (e.g., prelithiation of anode) that could lead to the realization of a full organic battery with a stable capacity of approximately 120 mAh·g −1 should be planned.",NaN,NaN,"['Fig.', 'LFP', 'LTO', 'electrode', 'PTCDA', 'LFP electrode', 'electrodes', 'PTCDA electrodes', 'active material', 'capacity']"

5,C:\Users\shweata\openDiagram\physchem\liion\PMC7052380\eupmc_result.json,PMC7052380,"Results and Discussion Phase Structural Analysis The phase constitution and crystal structure of the synthetic LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/C composites are here investigated. XRD patterns of the composites are shown in  Figure 1. It can be seen that there is no noticeable difference between LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/C composites. All the sharp diffraction peaks corresponding to the (200), (101), (210), (011), (111), (211), (301), (311), (121), (410), (221), (401), (112), (222), and (123) planes can be indexed to the orthorhombic olivine-type structure LiFePO 4 with the Pnma space group (JCPDS card No. 83-2092) (Wang et al.,  2009,  2010), and no excess impurity peaks are observed. The results manifest that the synthetic composites have high crystallinity and purity; this is mainly because microwave synthesis has the advantage of increasing the crystallinity and purity of products. The diffraction pattern of LiFePO 4/graphene shows that no diffraction peak of graphene oxide (at around 12°) is observed, proving that the graphene oxide has already been reduced into graphene directly without any reducing agent or atmosphere. This is mainly because the graphene oxide with a large amount of oxygen functional groups on the surface that can absorb microwaves easily, and electromagnetic energy is converted into heat and molecular kinetic energy; the reactive oxygen groups are then exfoliated, and, finally, the graphene oxide is restored into graphene. Also, the introduction of graphene has no effect on the structure of LiFePO 4. Moreover, the diffraction pattern of LiFePO 4/C shows no diffraction peaks corresponding to residual carbon, indicating that the carbon decomposed from sucrose in the sample exists in an amorphous state. TG-DSC Analysis TG-DSC measurement data is used to estimate the graphene and carbon content in the LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/carbon composites, as shown in  Figure 2. The pure LiFePO 4 can be completely oxidized to Li 3Fe 2(PO 4) 3 and Fe 2O 3 under air flow, and the total weight gain is about 5.07% in theory (Belharouak et al.,  2005; Bai et al.,  2015). For LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/carbon composites, in the temperature range of 400–600°C, the graphene and carbon are oxidized to CO 2 gas, so the amounts of graphene and carbon in the LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/carbon composites are about 1.40 and 10.70%, respectively. Raman Analysis Raman scattering spectroscopy was employed to recognize the chemical structure of the LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/C composites; the results are shown in  Figure 3. The main vibration modes include internal modes attributable to  PO43- anions and external modes attributable to the coupled motion of Fe 2+ and  PO43- (Markevich et al.,  2011). The modes at 990, 1,058, and 945 cm −1 correspond to the anti-symmetric (ν3) and symmetric (ν1) stretching of the P–O bonds. The modes at 626 and 587 cm −1 correspond to the symmetric (ν2) and anti-symmetric (ν4) bending of the O-P-O angles. The mode at 395 cm −1 corresponds to the lithium cage and oxygen ion breathing cage. The modes in the 100–300 cm −1 range are induced by translation of Fe and coupled translation and vibration of Fe and  PO43- (Burba and Frech,  2004; Wu et al.,  2013). Moreover, there are two obvious D band peaks at around 1,310 cm −1 and a G band at around 1,590 cm −1 (Tuinstra and Koenig,  1970). The D band is induced by a disordered and defective carbon structure in the crystal plane of the short-order  sp2 and  sp3 carbon. The G band is assigned to the in-plane bond-stretching motion of  sp2 carbon atoms. The intensity ratio of the D and G bands ( ID/ IG) is inversely proportional to the degree of graphitization of carbon materials. The  ID/ IG in LiFePO 4/graphene composites is 1.18, while the  ID/ IG in LiFePO 4/C composites is 1.43. This implies that the graphene has a higher degree of graphitization than the carbon decomposed from sucrose. The higher the degree of graphitization, the better the conductivity of the carbon. A high degree of graphitization is favorable for electron transfer and improves the electrochemical performance of the cathode. Additionally, the strong signals of the graphene (D band and G band) weaken and override the bands of LiFePO 4 in the high-frequency region. Morphological Analysis SEM images of the graphene oxide and LiFePO 4/graphene are shown in  Figures 4A–F.  Figure 4A shows that the micron-scale graphene oxide sheets aggregate into petal shapes; these sheets can provide implantation sites for the adhesion of reaction particles.  Figures 4B,C clearly shows that the LiFePO 4/graphene composites are composed of micron-scale spheres and blocks with average dimensions of ~2 μm. In  Figures 4D–F, it can be clearly observed that these LiFePO 4/graphene microspheres and micron blocks are composed of densely aggregated nanoparticles. This structure forms because the self-heating effect induced by the microwave heating can greatly shorten the reaction time, and the graphene wrapping the surface of LiFePO 4 particles can inhibit the growth of grains. Under the action of graphene, the nanoparticles assembled into microspheres and micron blocks. When the highly conductive electrolyte penetrates into the cathode material, the nanoparticles have a high specific surface area, which increases the contact area with the electrolyte. The nanoparticle size can shorten the diffusion paths of electrons and lithium ions and improve the conductivity of the cathode material significantly. Moreover, the micron structure formed by the aggregation of nanoparticles does not collapse during the process of lithium-ion intercalation and deintercalation, which ensures the stability of cathode material in the electrolyte. TEM and HRTEM images of the micron/nanoscale LiFePO 4/graphene composite are shown in  Figures 4G,H. The ultrathin graphene sheets successfully form an effective conducting network and intrinsically bridge and intimately connect the active LiFePO 4 particles.  Figure 4H indicates that the graphene sheets around LiFePO 4 are highly graphitic. The highly efficient and stable conducting network can give the material desirable electrochemical properties. In the energy spectrum, elements of P, O, Fe, and C are found, as shown in  Figure 4I; Li cannot be detected because of its very low atomic weight. The formation process of the LiFePO 4/graphene composites is illustrated in  Figure 5. At the initial stage of the reaction, the chemical reaction follows a dissolution–precipitation mechanism. The iron ions, phosphate ions, and lithium ions in the solution react with each other and form agglomerated precipitate on the surface of the graphene oxide sheets, and a large number of active functional groups are adsorbed on the surface of graphene oxide. At the stage of microwave irradiation, the active functional groups, being polar molecules, can absorb microwave easily, and electromagnetic energy is converted into heat and molecular kinetic energy. The temperature increase quickly, the reactive oxygen groups are exfoliated, and, finally, the graphene oxide is restored into graphene. Meanwhile, the precipitated particles adsorbed on the surface of reduced graphene sheets become hot and absorb microwaves quickly, the particles interact with each other, and then crystal nuclei are formed quickly under the action of the microwave electromagnetic field. Finally, under the influence of micron graphene sheets, the crystal nuclei grow, agglomerate, and form microspheres and micron blocks. Electrochemical Properties Analysis A schematic diagram of LiFePO 4/graphene electrode dynamics is shown in  Figure 6. Transportation of electrons and ions (e − and Li +) from their “reservoirs” toward the LiFePO 4 particles (Gaberscek et al.,  2007; Gaberscek,  2009) is shown as step A. A charge incorporation reaction that involves the transfer of e − and Li + from the outside into the interior of active particles is shown as step B, and the transport of the lithium component inside the solid active particles (solid-state diffusion) is shown as step C. It can be seen that graphene can provide a high-speed channel for the rapid diffusion of electrons and cause the electrons to reach the reactive site quickly, thus increasing the electronic conductivity of the materials. Meanwhile, the nanoparticles can shorten the transport path of Li + from the surface to the interior of solid active particles and improve the diffusion coefficient of lithium ions. Moreover, the nanoparticles are surrounded by the micron graphene sheets, and the micron structure guards the stability of the material. Therefore, LiFePO 4/graphene composites are expected to have excellent electrochemical performance. Cyclic voltammetry was performed to investigate the electrochemical kinetics of LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/C cathode materials.  Figure 7 shows the CV spectra of the LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/C composites. In the first scan, there is a pair of redox peaks corresponding to the Fe 2+/Fe 3+ couple (Ding et al.,  2010; Zhou et al.,  2011). The shapes of redox peaks are low and asymmetrical; this is because, in the first charging and discharging cycle, active materials are not completely saturated by electrolyte, and the pathways of lithium ion insertion and extraction were not completely formed. In the second scan, the current intensity increases, and the shape of the redox peaks becomes more symmetrical and sharper. For LiFePO 4/graphene, the potential difference between the oxidation and reduction peaks decreases from 0.27 to 0.26 V, which means that the phase is stabilized in subsequent cycles.  Figure 7B shows the CV spectra of LiFePO 4/C composites. During the second scan, the potential difference increases from 0.31 to 0.33 V, which proves that detrimental polarization becomes more and more serious. The results show that LiFePO 4/graphene composites have very high reversibility and better electrochemical activity. The polarization of the LiFePO 4/C electrode is explained by the electron transfer pathway, as shown in  Figure 8A. The carbon is dispersed unevenly, so the electrons cannot reach the entire reactive site where the Li + ions intercalate. In contrast, for LiFePO 4/graphene, due to the one-dimensional Li + ion mobility in the framework, the graphene can ensure that electrons reach particles from all directions and alleviate the polarization, as shown in  Figure 8B. Therefore, the LiFePO 4/graphene composites, with well-defined peaks and smaller potential difference, have higher electrochemical reactivity. The charging and discharging capacity profiles of the LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/C at progressively increasing C rates from 0.1 to 10 C are shown in  Figure 9. The cells are cycled in the voltage window of 2.7–4.2 V at room temperature. For LiFePO 4/graphene composites, the initial discharge capacity is 166.3 mAhg −1 at 0.1 C, and the discharge capacity decreases to 156.1 mAhg −1 with an increase in the discharge rate to 1 C. At a higher discharge rate of 5 C, the cell delivers a capacity of 132.4 mAhg −1. Even at a 10 C rate, the capacities can reach 120.9 mAhg −1, and a good voltage plateau remains above 3 V. For LiFePO 4/C, the discharge capacity is 154.8, 133.8, 121.6, 105.9, and 86.4 mAh g −1 at 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and 10 C rates, respectively. The cycling performances of the LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/C from 0.1 to 10 C are shown in  Figure 10. Although for LiFePO 4/graphene, the specific capacity decreases with increasing current rate, the capacity retention remains very good for all of the different rates; the discharge capacity retentions are, respectively, 99.5, 99.2, 99.4, 99.1, and 97.1% at 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and 10 C current rates after being cycled 10 times. While for LiFePO 4/C, the discharge capacity retentions are, respectively, 97.7, 96.9, 93.0, 87.1, and 79.5% at 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and 10 C current rates. All of the results demonstrate that LiFePO 4/graphene composites have better rate performance and cycling stability. This can be attributed to the excellent electrical conductivity of graphene, which can improve the conductivity and stability of materials. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to investigate the electrochemical behaviors of LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/C cathodes.  Figure 11A shows the Nyquist plots of the LiFePO 4/graphene and LiFePO 4/C cathodes. The experimental EIS data is simulated by Zview2.1 software according to the equivalent circuit as shown in  Figure 11B. It can be found that all the Nyquist plots present a high-frequency quasi-semicircle, which is related to the migration of the Li + ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface and the charge transfer process. Meanwhile, a low-frequency sloping line is related to the Warburg impedance of the lithium-ion diffusion in the electrode (Zhang et al.,  2011).  RS is the internal resistance of the cell and corresponds to the electrodes, electrolyte, and the separator resistance,  Rct is associated with the charge-transfer resistance,  CPE is associated with the capacitance contributed by the surface of the active material (Guo et al.,  2010). The simulation results show that the  Rct value of the LiFePO 4/graphene cathode is 79 Ω, which is smaller than the 129 Ω value of the LiFePO 4/C cathode. The result shows that graphene can reduce the charge transfer resistance of Li-ion insertion and extraction between the electrode/electrolyte and increase the conductivity of the LiFePO 4/graphene cathode.",NaN,NaN,"['LiFePO', 'graphene', 'graphene composites', 'graphene oxide', 'Figure', 'composites', 'graphene sheets', 'Structural Analysis', 'carbon', 'shown']"

It can be seen that after 10 cycles of precycling, the interface of the electrode is gradually stable. In particular, the discharge curve of the 4.7 V plateau is highly coincident, which indicates that the battery is stable, and the next step of thermodynamic parameter measurements can be carried out. It can be seen from the figure that the discharge capacity of the 4.7 V high-voltage plateau is about 115 mA h g –1, accounting for 80% of the total discharge capacity, which is also the focus of this paper (compared with a 4 V slope stage). The SOD may change slightly after the OCV test. Thus, if the cell is discharged to the next specific capacity point directly, the actual SOD may be different with the targeted point. In addition, the SOD cannot be adjusted by potential because of the very flat plateau before 80% SOD, which leads to a big capacity change with a small potential change, and an unacceptable SOD error. To obtain accurate SODs, the cell is fully charged and discharged to target SOD after every OCV tests.  Figure   1b shows the charge–discharge curve of LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4/Li half-cell before and after the OCV test. The curve basically coincides with each other, indicating that the battery and the electrode material structure are both stable in the whole test process. This suggests that the above test procedure is meaningful. The open-circuit voltage and temperature curves measured at steady state reflect the intrinsic thermodynamic characteristics of LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4. Figure   2a–c shows the open-circuit voltage versus time curves measured at 60, 50, and 20% SOD, respectively. Although the open-circuit voltage fluctuates slightly at the same temperature, the change in trend can be seen. As the temperature increases along 0, 10, 20, and 30 °C, the open-circuit voltage decreases in turn. The open-circuit voltage at the same temperature is taken as the middle value of the stable stage, and the obtained temperature versus open-circuit voltage curve ( Figure   2d) meets the linear fitting condition, so (∂ E/∂ T) P can be obtained, and then, Δ S can be obtained according to  eq   2. Table   1 summarizes the open-circuit voltage, d E/d T, Δ S, Δ G, and Δ H values of the LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4/Li half-cell for different SODs at 20 °C.  Figures   3 and  4 show the open-circuit voltage curve and Δ S curve of the LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4/Li half-cell for different SODs at 20 °C. It can be seen from  Table   1 and  Figure   4 that the Δ S value for 0–10% SOD (high-voltage lithium-deficient phase) is almost the same. It can be inferred that it conforms to the characteristics of first-order two-phase transformation, which is often accompanied by large volume change, resulting in large internal stress, particle fracture, and deterioration of cycle performance. In the range of 10–40% SOD, Δ S shows a slope change, which indicates that the reaction in this region is closer to the single-phase reaction of a solid solution rather than the two-phase reaction. The 40–60% SOD region is a transition region, indicating that there are new phases in the region, which is a multiphase coexistence region. In the 60–80% SOD range, Δ S also shows a slope change, indicating that the region is closer to the reaction mechanism of a single-phase solid solution. The OCV in the 80–100% SOD range is always unstable during measurement, and the calculation error of the mean value is large. However, it can also be seen qualitatively that the absolute value of Δ S in this area is large, and the volume changes greatly along with a huge amount of change in heat; therefore, this area corresponds to the Mn 4+ → Mn 3+ redox couple, rather than Ni 2+ → Ni 3+ → Ni 4+ redox. It has been reported that the lithium intercalation reaction is a two-phase reaction in LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4, corresponding to the two-half plateau high-voltage regions. 37 In this paper, the intercalation is more like a single-phase solid solution reaction based on the evolution trend of Δ S. 40 The reason of the discrete conclusion with the previous report needs to be studied more in the future. One possible reason may be the content of Mn 3+ in the samples, as it is reported that the increase in the degree of disorder by doping can make the Δ S get inclined to the slope. 41 Using open-circuit voltage data and  eq   1, the value of Δ G under different SODs can be calculated, and then through  eq   3, the value of Δ H can be obtained.  Figure   5 shows Δ G ( Figure   5a) and Δ H ( Figure   5b) versus SOD curves of the LiNi 0.5Mn 1.5O 4/Li half-cell. The value of Δ H corresponds to the heat released by the electrochemical reaction of the battery. It is of great significance to study the heat generation and temperature change in the process of battery charging and discharging and then to carry out thermoelectric-coupled simulation and predictive management of the battery system. 22 The reversible heat generation is calculated using  eq   4, as shown in  Figure   6. Because Δ S is always negative at all SODs, and  I is negative in the discharge process, − TΔ SI/ nF is negative, exhibiting the heating effect. In the charging process,  I is positive, so − TΔ SI/ nF is positive, exhibiting the cooling effect. The heating or cooling effect is rather strong from 80 to 90% SOD, for the absolute value of Δ S is large, and the structure changes severely in this range.",NaN,NaN,"['SOD', 'open-circuit voltage', 'Discussion Figure', 'Figure', 'SODs', 'voltage', 'open-circuit', 'change', 'SOD range', 'reaction']"
9,C:\Users\shweata\openDiagram\physchem\liion\PMC7058583\eupmc_result.json,PMC7058583,"Results and Discussion Synthesis and Characterization Figure 1 illustrates the preparation mechanism of the 3D flower-like MoS 2-PrGO nanocomposites. Firstly, under the ultrasonic induction, PEO chains were tightly bound to the GO surface to form a large area of 3D PGO layered spatial structure due to the strong affinity between PEO's non-shared ether-oxygen electrons and GO hydrogen bonds. Secondly, under the electrostatic force,  MoO42- anions approached the GO surface and were mainly captured by the carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxy groups (Chang and Chen,  2011). Finally, H 2S released by sulfourea converted  MoO42- and GO  in situ to MoS 2 nano-flowers and rGO in the solvothermal process. Therefore, 3D flower-like MoS 2-PrGO sandwich nanocomposites were successfully obtained. SEM and TEM were used to describe the morphology of the obtained sandwich nanocomposites. As shown in  Figure 2A, the separated 2D ultrathin rGO nano-sheets were assembled into a remarkable 3D layered spatial structure under the linking of PEO. Supported by the PEO chains, the enlarged interlayer space can accommodate a significant number of micron-sized MoS 2 nano-flowers.  Figure 2B shows the morphology of the 3D MoS 2-PrGO sandwich nanocomposites. The ultrathin MoS 2 nanosheets were assembled into distinct nano-flowers anchored on the surfaces of rGO hosts. The average size of MoS 2 nano-flowers was about 200 nm. The results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates that the contents of MoS 2 in the obtained nanocomposites reached 83.3% ( Figure S1 and  Table S1). This 3D layered sandwich structure is conducive to improve the electronic and ionic conductivity. In addition, the PEO chains buffered the volume expansion of the MoS 2 nano-flowers during charge/discharge processes. The TEM image of the 3D layered MoS 2-PrGO sandwich nanocomposites ( Figure 2C) reveals that the MoS 2 nano-flowers were well-encased in the rGO interlayers without aggregation, which is consistent with SEM image. The further HR-TEM image ( Figure 2D) displays that the MoS 2 petals consisted of 5–10 monolayers. The interlayer distance between each monolayer was about 0.62 nm, corresponding to the (002) lattice planes of MoS 2 (Lin et al.,  2017). The corresponding EDX mapping of C, O, S, and Mo reveals that the C and O elements were homogeneously distributed in the specimens ( Figure 2E), while the S and Mo elements were agglomerated with remarkable flower-liked hot spots. This further confirmed that the ultrathin MoS 2 nanosheets were assembled into nano-flowers anchored on the surfaces of rGO hosts, successfully forming a 3D flower-like MoS 2-PrGO sandwich architecture. Figure 3A presents the XRD pattern of the 3D flower-like MoS 2-PrGO sandwich composites and the commercial MoS 2 specimens. All diffraction peaks of the MoS 2 matched well the diffraction peaks of the typical hexagonal MoS 2 (JCPDS 37-1492). The obtained hexagonal MoS 2 had lattice parameters of  a =  b = 3.16 Å and  c = 12.31 Å, which were consisted with the experimental values (Guo et al.,  2017). Other than diffraction peaks of the hexagonal MoS 2, a weak and broad peak appeared in the XRD pattern of the 3D flower-like composites. This additional peak located at 24.5° was attributed to the (002) planes of rGO hosts (He et al.,  2014; Chong et al.,  2017). The chemical bonding conditions of the 3D flower-like composites were further analyzed by XPS. As shown in  Figure 3B, XPS spectrum of the C 1 s core-level was divided into two deconvolution peaks. The intense peak located at around 284.6 eV matched the C–C bonds of rGO nanosheets, and the weak peak near 286.0 eV was contributed by C–O bond (Yang et al.,  2009).  Figures 3C,D show the XPS spectrums of Mo 3d and S 2p, respectively. The bonding peaks centered at 228.8 and 232.1 eV reflected the bonding states of Mo 3d 5/2 and Mo 3d 3/2, implying a standard Mo 4+ state. The main and satellite peaks of S 2p spectrum were, respectively, located at 161.7 and 162.8 eV with a 1.1 eV energy separation, corresponding to the S 2− state (Khawula et al.,  2016). The XPS analysis indicated that S and Mo elements in the final products existed in the form of MoS 2. Electrochemical Properties Figures 4A,B illustrate the first three cyclic CV curves of the commercial MoS 2 specimens and the 3D flower-like MoS 2-PrGO sandwich composites. In the first cathodic scan, the CV curves of the commercial MoS 2 specimens and the 3D flower-like composites exhibited two significant reduction peaks at ~0.88 and 0.26 V. The reduction peak at 0.88 V was derived from the formation of Li xMoS 2 after lithium ions were inserted into (002) plane of MoS 2 (Liu et al.,  2015), while the other peak at 0.26 V was induced by the conversion of MoS 2 into Mo and Li 2S. The anodic scan peak around 2.39 V reflected the reaction of Li 2S into Li + and S. Over the next two cycles, both CV curves displayed an additional reduction peak near 1.86 V. This additional reduction peak was mainly attributed to the formation of gelatinous polymeric layers (Du et al.,  2010). The electrochemical reaction mechanism of each peak was written as (Wang Z. et al.,  2013). (1)2Li++S+2e-→Li2S (2)MoS2+xLi++xe-→LixMoS2 (3)LixMoS2+(4-x)Li++(4-x)e-→Mo+2Li2S Compared with the commercial MoS 2 specimens, the CV curves of the 3D flower-like composites presented stronger reduction peaks because the electrochemical reaction of lithium with MoS 2 was synchronous with that of lithium with rGO (Wang and Li,  2007). Figures 4C,D show the charge-discharge voltage profiles of the commercial MoS 2 specimens and the 3D flower-like MoS 2-PrGO sandwich composites at a constant current density of 100 mA g −1. During the first discharge, the commercial MoS 2 anode produced two potential plateaus at 1.4 and 0.5 V. The plateau at 1.4 V corresponded to the formation of Li xMoS 2 lattice and the insertion of lithium ions. The discharge plateau at 0.5 V was attributed to the conversion of MoS 2 into Mo and Li 2S, as well as the formation of gelatinous polymeric layers driven by electrochemical degradation of electrolyte (Ding et al.,  2011). Consistent with CV test results, the broad plateau at about 2.3 V was a trace of the Li 2S decomposition. As shown in  Figure 4D, although those plateaus recurred in the charge-discharge voltage profiles of the 3D flower-like composites, their width decreased. This indicated that the electron migration rate of the 3D flower-like composites is faster than that of the commercial MoS 2 specimens. Furthermore, the gentle potential curve slope and large charge capacity indicate that the 3D flower-like composites delivered more reactive sites and nice cycle stability. The first discharge-charge capacities of the 3D flower-like composites were 1,800 and 1,122 mA h g −1, respectively, far higher than those of the commercial MoS 2 specimens. The initial irreversible capacity loss was about 37.7 %, mainly caused by the lithium ion residues in the MoS 2 lattice and the formation of SEI films (Tang et al.,  2009). Figure 5A plots the cycling performances of the commercial MoS 2 specimens and the 3D flower-like MoS 2-PrGO sandwich composites at a constant current density of 100 mA g −1. It was obvious that the commercial MoS 2 electrodes could not afford prolonged cycling and rapidly decayed to zero after 170 cycles, while the 3D flower-like composites exhibited extraordinary cycling behavior and still maintained a reversible capacity of 1,036 mA h g −1 after 500 cycles. SEM test results reveals that after 500 cycles, the structure of the 3D flower-like composites was still intact without obvious pulverization ( Figure S2). The high reversible capacity and remarkable cycling behavior of the 3D flower-like composites were also reflected in the rate performance.  Figure 5B shows the rate cycling behavior of the commercial MoS 2 specimens and the 3D flower-like MoS 2-PrGO sandwich composites at various current densities of 100–2,000 mA g −1. Compared with the commercial MoS 2 specimens, the 3D flower-like composites presented an excellent rate performance. Their specific capacity remained at 579 mA h g −1 when current density continuously increased to 2,000 mA g −1. In contrast, commercial MoS 2 specimens failed completely before the cycling current increased to 500 mA g −1. In addition, when the current density changed to 100 mA g −1, the specific capacity of the 3D flower-like composites almost returned to their initial value, and remained stable throughout the subsequent cycling. The excellent electrochemical performance of the 3D flower-like composites was further verified by the EIS measurements.  Figure 6 shows the Nyquist plots of the 3D flower-like composite electrodes after different cycles. All Nyquist plots were semi-circular at the high frequencies and oblique in the low frequencies. The semicircle reflected the charge-transfer impedance on electrode (R ct), and the slope line in the low-frequency range represented the Warburg impedance (W) associated with the diffusion process of lithium ions (Xu et al.,  2013). The Randles equivalent circuit inserted in  Figure 6 simulated the corresponding electrochemical system, where CPE represents the double-layer capacitance and Rs is the ohmic resistance. The fresh 3D flower-like composite electrodes exhibited a small semi-circular with a slight increase after 500 cycles. This indicated that the 3D flower-like composite electrodes possessed lower charge-transfer resistance and long-term cycling stability. Their lower charge-transfer resistance is due to the good conductivity of rGO. Furthermore, their unique 3D layered sandwich structure also facilitates rapid transfer of lithium ions upon cycling. Assisted by PEO chains buffering, the robust rGO interlayers effectively suppressed the volume expansion of MoS 2 and ensured a good cycling performance. In addition, the ultrathin MoS 2 nanosheets also accommodated a high tolerance to structure changes. Their unique 3D flower-like sandwich structure provided more active sites for the interface reaction between active materials and the lithium-ions, which endowed the final electrodes with a high reversible capacity.",NaN,NaN,"['MoS', 'flower-like MoS', 'commercial MoS', 'flower-like composites', 'Discussion Synthesis', 'flower-like', 'Figure', 'Characterization Figure', 'composites', 'sandwich composites']"
10,C:\Users\shweata\openDiagram\physchem\liion\PMC7065120\eupmc_result.json,PMC7065120,"Results and Discussion In the theoretical data, an abnormally high voltage plateau (about 4.2 V vs. Li +/Li 0) is observed at a low Li content ( x<0.2). This effect is a computational artifact since an extremely large supercell would be required to perfectly distribute Li sites and Fe vacancies at very low Li content, which cannot be modeled with our limited computational resources. Fortunately, the requirement is much weaker for a medium Li content, which makes the voltage profile more reliable in that range. Another divergence is the maximally available Li content  x, which should be 2 (theoretically) when the fully lithiated compound Li 2NCN forms. In the experiment,  x can become larger than 2, and actually goes up to about 2.8 because of side reactions. We note that the electrode is made not only of FeNCN but also includes 40 w % of carbon and binder (CMC, carboxymethyl cellulose). Therefore, the reasons for the larger Li content may include the formation of a passivation layer (SEI, solid–electrolyte interface) on the active material and electrolyte degradation. This is also the reason why the capacity of the first lithiation is always higher than that of subsequent cycles. For FeNCN, the SEI (or electrolyte degradation) seems to be largely reversible, and seemingly keeps cycling at more than 2 Li. This phenomenon is also observed in transition‐metal oxides. 14 Despite the two unavoidable divergences, the calculated voltage profile agrees well with experiment and nicely reproduces a similar voltage plateau for a wide Li range (0.2< x<2.0). Figure  3 a,b depicts the minimum‐energy curve and voltage profile for the FeNCN archetype in a NIB, obtained with the same computational approach as used for the LIB before. An analogous high voltage plateau (about 3.4 V vs. Na +/Na 0) appears at a low Na content ( x<0.2), similar to the LIB. The maximum experimentally achievable Na content, however, is only  x=1.5. This is because Na fails to react with all FeNCN in experiments, probably due to kinetic hindrance, so there is only a partial reaction (or partial discharge). The SEI (or electrolyte degradation) effect is the same as in a LIB, but with less reversible capacity to form the active material. If we set  x=1.5 as the theoretical maximum Na content, that is, the discharge process ends at Na 6Fe(NCN) 4 and not Na 2NCN, we end up with a new voltage profile for a partial discharge. It is reassuring that this new profile, depicted as a solid orange line in Figure  3 b, agrees nicely with the experimental result.  For further interpretation and understanding of the aforementioned findings, chemical‐bonding analysis was employed. In the cathode of a LIB or NIB, the ideal reaction pathway (or minimum‐energy curve) starts at FeNCN, proceeds through a variety of intermediate (amorphous) compounds, and ends at Li 2NCN or Na 2NCN. For an intermediate compound with a certain stoichiometric configuration, for example, Li 2Fe 7(NCN) 8, different crystal‐structure models were computationally established. Taking a thermodynamic point of view, the one crystallizing with the lowest formation energy was preferred but we note that other metastable variants with higher formation energies but lower activation barriers are also possible according to Ostwald's step rule. 25 In the following, we rationalize the occurrence of structural polymorphs from the aspect of chemical bonding. Figure  4 a depicts the composition Li 2Fe 7(NCN) 8 (corresponding to a Li content of  x=0.25) for which three structural models ( P6 3/ mmc,  Immm, and  I4/ mmm) were established. Among these,  I4/ mmm has the lowest formation energy. Previous research indicates that the structural preference in carbodiimides can be determined from chemical‐bonding analysis. 21,  26 Figure  4 a presents a crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis of both Fe−N and Li−N bonds in the three Li 2Fe 7(NCN) 8 models adopting  P6 3/ mmc,  Immm, and  I4/ mmm symmetry. Negative (or positive) COHP values indicate energy‐lowering bonding (or energy‐increasing anti‐bonding) interactions. It is apparent that bonding interactions dominate in the low‐energy valence‐band region whereas anti‐bonding states appear in the unoccupied conduction band, but also just below the Fermi level. For a quantitative assessment, all COHP values were integrated up to the Fermi level to yield ICOHP data for the Fe−N and Li−N bonds and averaged over all corresponding bonds in the unit cell. It turns out that the  I4/ mmm model of Li 2Fe 7(NCN) 8 not only holds the strongest bonding interactions for both Fe−N and Li−N bonds but also has the lowest formation energy. Hence, the chemical‐bonding analysis is useful to deduce where the structural preference of the intermediate compounds originates from.  As discussed above, the cell voltage for FeNCN originates from the potential difference between the Fe 2+/Fe 0 and Li +/Li 0 (Na +/Na 0) redox couples in a LIB (NIB). An ideal voltage profile displays a flat plateau with a theoretical voltage of 1.6 V (1.1 V) in a LIB (NIB), as tabulated in Table S2. The actual profile, however, exhibits a monotonous decrease in voltage upon lithiation (sodiation) both experimentally and theoretically. We rationalize this decreasing character from a monotonous decrease in the atomic charge of Fe, expressed as  y in Fe y+  in the energetically low‐lying intermediate ternaries, and evaluated from Mulliken charge analysis in Figure  4 b. To zeroth order, the higher the cationic charge, the stronger the reduction power. Indeed, the Mulliken charge of Fe decreases from 1.1 in FeNCN to 0.9 in Na 22Fe 7(NCN) 18, seemingly leading to a decrease in the Fe y+ /Fe 0 redox potential; note that these (basis‐set‐independent) Mulliken charges were numerically projected from the entire wavefunction expanded from plane waves. 27 Figure  4 b also demonstrates a more negative ICOHP progression for the Fe−N bonds, but now upon sodiation in a NIB. This indicates an almost continuous increase in covalency for the Fe−N bonds in the energetically low‐lying intermediate ternaries, another confirmation of a smaller amount of electron density transferred from Fe to N and, thus, a decrease in the charge of Fe. At last, the lithiation of FeNCN was followed experimentally by operando Fe K‐edge XAS in order to corroborate or falsify the theoretical findings. 28 In particular, the extended fine structure of the XAS spectrum (EXAFS) 29 is very sensitive to the modification of the nearest‐neighbor shell of the Fe atoms and is hence used to validate the DFT‐predicted ternary intermediates. The complete operando data set depicting the evolution of Fe K‐edge XAS spectra acquired during the first electrochemical discharge of FeNCN vs. Li is presented as a contour plot in Figure  5 a. The plot shows a decrease of the edge‐energy intensity accompanied by a shift to lower edge energy, reflecting the effective chemical reduction of the Fe atoms.  Principal component analysis (PCA) 30 indicates that three independent principal components are needed to reproduce the entire data set, yielding 99.9 % total variance, as shown in Figure S4. Subsequently pure spectral components were reconstructed via multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR‐ALS). 31 The EXAFS spectra indicate that component 1 and component 3 can be easily fitted with the structure of pristine FeNCN and the iron nanoparticles, as shown in Figure S6 and S7, respectively. Component 2 represents the ternary intermediate, which reaches its maximum concentration at about one third of the first discharge (Figure S5 b), and can therefore be successfully fitted by the theoretical structure of Li 2Fe 2(NCN) 3, in line with the amount of reacted lithium. The compound Li 2Fe 2(NCN) 3, structurally derived from Li 2NCN, yields satisfactory results, as shown in Figure  5 b and Table  2. The quantum‐chemical bonding analysis in Figure S8 also indicates that the Fe−N bonds in the Li 2Fe 2(NCN) 3 structure derived from the Li 2NCN supercell possess a more negative ICOHP value (meaning stronger bonding, −1.84 eV) than the ones in the FeNCN supercell (−1.46 eV). In other words, the good agreement of the DFT‐predicted structure with the experimental spectra confirms the formation of an intermediate yet amorphous phase compatible with the local structure of Li 2Fe 2(NCN) 3 during the conversion reaction of FeNCN vs. Li. Unravelling such transient phases in complex reaction mechanisms is a valuable asset of the MCR‐ALS approach, was recently shown for sodiation of SnSb. 32 We calculated the average cell voltages 17 of the TMC (TM=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) vs. pure Li and Na metals using the PBE and PBE+ U functionals (see the Supporting Information). 18 Pure PBE produces less reliable voltage data (the largest error being 1.2 V for CoNCN in a LIB) because the  U correction is necessary to model the highly correlated TM electrons. 19 As shown in Table S2 (Supporting Information), introducing the  U correction 20 effectively decreases the voltage errors (to about 0.8 V for CoNCN in a LIB), so we chose PBE+ U for a large‐scale study. Since we focus on the reaction pathways and voltage profiles during the charge/discharge process for the FeNCN archetype in Li/Na‐ion batteries, the crystal structures of the fully delithiated (desodiated) compound FeNCN and the lithiated (sodiated) compound Li 2NCN (Na 2NCN) should be analyzed first (Figure  1). FeNCN crystallizes in the hexagonal system with  P6 3/ mmc symmetry, that is, octahedral coordination for Fe and trigonal‐prismatic coordination for NCN, resembling the nickel arsenide motif. Li 2NCN (Na 2NCN), however, adopts a tetragonal  I4/ mmm structure with tetrahedral coordination for Li (Na) and a quadratic‐prismatic coordination for NCN. Like the related oxide compounds, transition‐metal carbodiimides follow a conversion‐reaction mechanism when used as electrode materials. That means that drastic structural transformations occur during the charge/discharge process. It is unclear up to which degree the crystal structures of the intermediate compounds may resemble FeNCN or Li 2NCN in a LIB. It is therefore far from trivial to correctly deduce the atomistic structural details of these ternaries denoted as Li–Fe–NCN, in particular because reliable experimental models (for example, from X‐ray diffraction) are missing. Because of this, we tentatively used four kinds of structural bases for a thorough survey of possible Li–Fe–NCN ternaries: two from divalent carbodiimides, 21 namely the NiAs‐type FeNCN and the NaCl‐type MnNCN, one from Li 2NCN, and one from Li‐containing metal oxides such as CuLi 2O 2 (where one needs to replace O 2− anions with NCN 2− groups).  During the discharge process in a Li‐ion half‐battery with Li metal as the anode, the cathode (FeNCN) accommodates both Li + cations (through the electrolyte) and electrons (through an external loop) to form Li–Fe–NCN ternaries. Note that an oxidation reaction in the positive FeNCN electrode forming Fe 3+ cations is prevented during lithiation (cathodic conditions), which rather leads to the reduction of the material producing the deposition of elemental Fe 0. To maintain electrical neutrality in a Li–Fe–NCN ternary, Fe 2+/Fe 0 reduction and Li 0/Li + oxidation must proceed in a 1:2 proportion since one Fe 2+ acts as two Li + in the charge compensation. In other words, a cathode host accommodates two Li and precipitates one Fe simultaneously. That is, the intermediate compounds, whatever they may be, share the generic chemical formula Li xFe (1−  x/2) NCN with 0< x<2. We enforced this confinement due to charge balance when establishing the model‐type intermediate compounds 22 as derived from the aforementioned four structural bases and as tabulated in Table  1.  After full optimizations, the structures were used to perform electronic self‐consistency calculations. To examine the stability of each intermediate compound, its formation energy  Eformation was calculated, which is defined as the energetic difference between an intermediate compound Li xFe (1−  x/2) NCN and its corresponding linear combination of Li 2NCN (fully lithiated) and FeNCN (fully delithiated): (1)Eformation=ELixFe(1-x/2)NCN-x2ELi2NCN-1-x2EFeNCN Figure  2 a shows the formation energies of all calculated Li xFe (1−  x/2) NCN compounds at various configurations. By convention, the more negative the formation energies, the more stable the compounds. All unstable (or metastable) compounds with positive formation energies were not included in Figure  2 a. For convenience, a line connecting the compounds that are most stable at each configuration is also depicted in blue (minimum‐energy curve or energy convex hull). 23 Given full thermodynamic control, the reaction pathway during the charge/discharge process would have to follow this line (related phase diagram shown in Figure S3).  Each voltage pair (given by two intermediate compounds with adjacent Li content in the phase diagram) gives a voltage plateau, and a voltage profile can be obtained by combining all voltage plateaus. For example, given a voltage pair of two intermediate compounds written as  Lix1Fe(1-x1/2)NCN and  Lix2Fe(1-x2/2)NCN (taking  x1< x2 with FeNCN as a cathode host in a LIB), their reaction reads: (2)x2-x1Li+Lix1Fe(1-x1/2)NCN→Lix2Fe(1-x2/2)NCN+12x2-x1Fe, so that the voltage plateau  Φ( x1,  x2) results, similar to that from M x(NCN) y to Li 2NCN, in: (3)Φx1,x2=-ΔGx2-x1zF≈-[ELix2Fe1-x2/2NCN+12x2-x1EFe-ELix1Fe(1-x1/2)NCN-x2-x1ELi]x2-x1zF-1 Figure  2 b depicts the theoretical voltage profile for the archetype FeNCN using a blue solid line, corresponding to the minimum‐energy curve in Figure  2 a. The staircase shape originates from the limited number of stable compounds obtained from the also limited number of DFT calculations. For conversion‐reaction mechanism materials, there is clearly a large experimental difference between the first and second lithiation, but the subsequent cycles are identical. 24 Indeed, during the first lithiation process, large and well‐crystallized particles are transformed into nanosized and amorphous particles. Only after this irreversible morphological change, the lithiated material becomes the true cycling material. Thus, the experimental profile of FeNCN at the second cycle at a rate of C/50 (corresponding to the reaction of one mole of Li per mole of FeNCN in 50 h) is depicted (as a dashed line) for comparison.",NaN,NaN,"['NCN', 'Figure', 'FeNCN', 'voltage', 'voltage profile', 'intermediate compounds', 'LIB', 'compounds', 'intermediate', 'voltage plateau']"

Here, the capacity was calculated based on the mass of the initial weight of solid MnO 2 on the cathode. For fair comparison, parameters including (1) the mass loading of cathode (area: 0.5 cm 2, areal loading of MnO 2: ∼2.0 mg cm −2), (2) the concentration of MnSO 4 additive (0.2 M), and (3) the volume of electrolyte (200 μL for each battery) were well-controlled for all batteries. The δ-MnO 2 cathode synthesized via a molten-salt-assisted method (see  Transparent Methods) showed an initial discharge capacity of 252 mAh g −1, and reached 317 mAh g −1 after a five-cycle activation process ( Figure 1A). Unlike most of the previously reported works, it is interesting that the discharge capacity of the δ-MnO 2 cathode kept increasing during subsequent cycling at a current density of 300 mA g −1, and reached a discharge capacity of 403 mAh g −1 after 100 cycles. α-MnO 2, another cathode material widely utilized in Zn-ion batteries, was also evaluated for its cycling stability. Although showing better discharge capacities in the first five cycles (first discharge: 325 mAh g −1 and fifth discharge: 339 mAh g −1), the α-MnO 2 cathode exhibited inferior capacity retention to that of the δ-MnO 2 cathode. It suggests that different cathodes delivered different electrochemical behaviors in Zn-ion batteries. The different capacity variation tendencies of these two cathodes point to a fact that is seldom noticed: The capacity of Zn-ion battery cathodes may not be simply determined, as previously reported, by the capability of suppressing Mn-based cathode dissolution. The intrinsic property of the cathode (e.g., the specific surface area, the valent state of Mn cations, and Mn-site defects) may result in the change of parameters that were not given sufficient attention, i.e., the oxidation of the Mn 2+ ion in the electrolyte that can lead to the deposition of active Mn compound on the cathode. Considering the abundant defects in the δ-MnO 2 cathode material as synthesized under an unstable, highly oxidizing atmosphere generated by the molten sodium nitrate salt ( Hu et al., 2017), modification of δ-MnO 2 was conducted using a facile method where the oxide was stirred in 1 M CoCl 2 at room temperature (see  Transparent Methods). Compared with the original δ-MnO 2, the resulting cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 showed an even more pronounced capacity enhancement ( Figure 1A), increasing from the initial discharge capacity of 196 mAh g −1 to 258 mAh g −1 after five cycles and further to 435 mAh g −1 at the 100 th discharge. This capacity is surprisingly high when compared with the previously reported values (∼300 mAh g −1 in the 100 th discharge) ( Pan et al., 2016,  Huang et al., 2018,  Zhang et al., 2017). The increment of the capacity could be highly associated with the oxidation of Mn 2+ in the electrolyte, which was evidenced by the analysis of Coulumbic efficiency and the differential capacity (dQ/dV). All the cathodes showed high Coulumbic efficiency close to 100%, whereas the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 showed slightly lower Coulumbic efficiencies during the recharging cycles ( Figure 1B). Without the MnSO 4 additive, the Coulumbic efficiency of all samples is similar and near 100% ( Figures 1B, capacity data shown in  S1). This indicates that the additional Mn 2+ in the electrolyte was actually involved in the redox process on the cathode. To further investigate this issue, the first five discharge-charge profiles of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode are presented in  Figure 1C. Two conventional plateaus at potentials of 1.4 and 1.3 V versus Zn/Zn 2+ reflect the H + intercalation process and the Zn 2+ intercalation process, respectively ( Huang et al., 2018). In each subsequent charging process, an additional plateau/slope was observed at potential around 1.6–1.8 V, besides the two conventional plateaus that represent the reverse process of Zn 2+ and H + intercalation. In  Figure 1D, differential capacity (dQ/dV) analysis more clearly shows this additional oxidation process happening at a voltage range of 1.62–1.80 V. This could be ascribed to the oxidation of Mn 2+ to Mn 3+, as will be discussed in the following sections. In a mild aqueous electrolyte environment, subsequent hydrolysis of Mn 3+ could result in the deposition of Mn compound on the cathode ( Gibson et al., 2016). These compounds were involved in the subsequent discharge, thus providing additional capacity. Figure 1E gives a schematic and an equation that describe the dynamic capacity of a Mn-based cathode. Based on the fact that no matter what be the phase structures of the Mn-based cathode (e.g., α-MnO 2, δ-MnO 2), the discharge capacity of the cathode mainly originates from the redox of Mn species between different valent states (from +4 to +3 or even to +2). Therefore, the discharge capacity of a Mn-based cathode on a specific cycle is determined by three essential parameters and their interaction ( Figure 1E): (1) the initial amount and valence of Mn in the solid Mn-based cathode before cycling, (2) the dissolution amount of the active Mn compound during each discharge/charge cycle, and (3) the deposition amount of active Mn compound during each charge. In these parameters, the initial valent state of the Mn element is determined by the cathode material itself, which has a significant influence on the first discharge capacity. On the subsequent cycling, the dissolution rate and deposition rate will negatively and positively, respectively, influence the amount of Mn on the cathode, thereby playing a more important role in the capacity retention. Based on this equation, developing a cathode with a low dissolution rate and a high deposition rate is crucial to the stable operation of Zn-ion batteries. The synthesis of δ-MnO 2 and its further modification by cobalt were illustrated in  Figure 2A (details are provided in the  Supplemental Information) ( Hu et al., 2017). As indicated by the qualitative analysis of the Mn L-edge near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectra ( Cowie et al., 2010,  Gann et al., 2016) ( Figure 2D), cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 showed the lowest Mn valency among the three different MnO 2-based cathodes. Therefore an expected lower initial capacity was observed for cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2. For the batteries without any additional MnSO 4 in the electrolyte, the dissolution rate is reflective of the capacity retention. As shown in  Figure 1B, the dissolution rate of cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 is only slightly lower than those of the other two cathodes. Based on these results, the significant capacity increment of cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 during cycling could be attributed to its superior deposition rate of Mn compound. A comparison of the dQ/dV profile of the fifth charging ( Figure 1F) also indicates that the additional oxidation process on a δ-MnO 2 cathode with cobalt modification is more significant than that without cobalt modification. Furthermore, the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode shows excellent rate performance and rate retention (over 500 mAh g −1 at 0.1 mA g −1 and ∼125 mAh g −1 at 5 mA g −1) after 100 cycles of cathode recovery ( Figure 1G). In the following sections, we analyze the property of the material and design a first-reported home-made electrolyzer system to offer more insights into the role of the cobalt-containing species on the mechanism behind the unique performance. The existence of the cobalt element and its chemical state is crucial to the deposition rate of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode material. The presence of the Co was revealed by Co 2p peaks (2p 3/2 at 795.5 eV and 2p 1/2 at 780.7 eV) in the spectra of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) ( Figures 2B and  S2). The quantity of cobalt element was further evaluated with inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), which gave a Co/Mn atomic ratio of 0.063:1 after cobalt modification ( Table S1). A similar result of Co/Mn ratio (0.052:1) was also obtained by the compositional analysis of the XPS survey spectra ( Table S2). These results from both bulk-sensitive ICP and surface-sensitive XPS indicate that Co element is evenly decorated on the δ-MnO 2. Evidence from the Co L-edge NEXAFS spectra ( Figure 2C) suggests that Co species on the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 has a valent state between +2 and +3. This indicates that during the modification process, Co 2+ in the CoCl 2 solution was partially oxidized by the high-valent-state (+4) Mn cations in the δ-MnO 2. Meanwhile, the valent state of Mn cation was decreased, as evidenced by the Mn L-edge NEXAFS spectra ( Figure 2D). Owing to the presence of Mn-site defects, cobalt-containing species (e.g., Co(II) and Co(III)) can be incorporated in δ-MnO 2 nanosheets (as illustrated in  Figure 2A). ( Wang et al., 2018) In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD,  Figure S3) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED,  Figure 3C) patterns of the material show no other well-defined crystalline phase. Detailed observation of the transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images did not reveal the existence of any amorphous phase other than the layer-structured manganese oxide. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping in  Figure 3F indicates that cobalt element is well dispersed on the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 with no significant agglomeration. In short, after cobalt modification, cobalt cations with valent states +2 and +3 in the form of cobalt-containing species is incorporated in the highly defective δ-MnO 2 nanosheets. A similar conclusion was also drawn by Wang et al. based on analysis of the quick extended X-ray absorption fine structure data ( Wang et al., 2018). Resulting from the removal of the salts after the molten-salt synthesis, the δ-MnO 2 nanosheets formed loose-packed particles with a size of several micrometers ( Figure S4). The loose packing morphology results in abundant secondary pores, which demonstrates a high specific surface area (139 m 2 g −1) and a large total pore volume (0.50 cm 3 g −1), as presented in  Figure S5. Owing to the mild condition utilized for the cobalt modification, the resulting material shows a flower-like morphology ( Figure 3A), exhibiting similar surface area (161 m 2 g −1) and porosity (0.48 cm 3 g −1) ( Figure S5). Based on the observation of TEM images, the thickness of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 nanosheets is approximately 5 nm ( Figures 3B and  S6). This value was in accordance with the linear analysis of the 2D height sensor signals using atomic force microscopy ( Figure S7), which indicates that the thickness is in the range 3–5 nm. HR-TEM in  Figures 3D and 3E demonstrates the [001] view direction of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 nanosheet, which clearly shows the (010), (100), and (110) planes with a lattice distance of 2.4, 2.4, and 1.4 Å, respectively. This result is also confirmed by the SAED ( Figure 3C) and XRD ( Figure S3) patterns. The Catalytic Effect of Cobalt Components in the Deposition Process of Active Mn Compound After the oxidation process, the generated Mn 3+ is then hydrolyzed and deposited as solid Mn(III) compounds on the cathode ( Gibson et al., 2016). For cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode, both catalysis routes contribute to the deposition process. Of importance, the well-dispersed cobalt-containing species could serve as preferred active sites by providing enhanced charge-transfer capability, thereby demonstrating a much superior deposition rate. On the contrary, the deposition of active Mn compound was still observed but less significant ( Figure 4A) for the cathode without cobalt modification, as the catalysis could only rely on the Mn self-catalysis route. It is worth noting that the cobalt content can influence the deposition of Mn compound. Manganese oxide cathodes with different cobalt contents were compared in  Figure S13. The increase in cobalt content provides a better capability for the deposition of Mn compounds on the cathode, thereby leading to faster increases of capacities ( Figure S13B). The improvement of the deposition of Mn compounds is not very significant when the Co/Mn ratio is higher than 0.10:1 (atom %), indicating that the cobalt-induced facilitation of the deposition of Mn compounds may have a limitation. Also, the deposition of Mn compounds may be influenced by the concentration of the Zn 2+ ion. As presented in  Figure S14, batteries with lower Zn 2+ concentrations demonstrated higher retention rates. This could be associated with the higher ionic conductivities and higher pH values of the electrolytes, which are both beneficial to the deposition of Mn compounds ( Zhang et al., 2016,  Poyraz et al., 2019). In this section, the role of cobalt components in the deposition of active Mn compound is further discussed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) for a practical battery configuration and a home-made electrolyzer cell. Compared with the galvanostatic charging process where the time duration in the range of 1.6–1.8 V for each charging is very short (causing a fast voltage buildup due to the full charge of the cathode), the CV and LSV methods allow equal time at every voltage step. Therefore, well-defined peaks could be identified from a CV or an LSV curve, when compared with the dQ/dV profile extracted from a galvanostatic charging profile. Using a conventional Zn|electrolyte|MnO 2 coin-type battery configuration, an oxidation peak at around 1.65 V was observed, indicative of the oxidation of Mn 2+. It is no surprise that without introducing MnSO 4 into the electrolyte, the oxidation of Mn 2+ is much less significant ( Figure S8). Also, in the same electrolyte composition, the oxidation peaks at 1.65 V of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode were more noticeable than those of the δ-MnO 2 cathode, as presented in  Figure 4A. To further reveal the role of cobalt components, a home-made electrolyzer cell with a two-electrode configuration was designed ( Figure S9A). A stainless-steel (SS) electrode or a Co(OH) 2-coated SS electrode (denoted as SS-Co(OH) 2, preparation setup shown in  Figure S10) was used as the working electrode. A Zn plate was used as both the reference and the counter electrode. A larger quantity (10 mL) of the electrolyte with the same composition (2 M ZnSO 4 + 0.2 M MnSO 4) was used. An LSV scan from 1.0 to 2.3 V (oxidizing process) was applied to the SS electrode and SS-Co(OH) 2 electrode. For SS electrode, with the onset voltage at ∼1.85 V, an oxidation peak centered at ∼2.05 V was observed ( Figure 4B). Without any Mn compound on the original electrode, this process can be attributed to the oxidation of the Mn 2+ in the electrolyte. After scanning to 2.3 V, the electrode (denoted as ▪ in  Figures 4B–4D) was collected and characterized with XPS. The Mn 2p 3/2 profile of the sample indicates that the deposited Mn compound was mainly in high valent states of +3 and +4 ( Figure 4C). For the SS-Co(OH) 2 electrode, two additional peaks centered at ∼1.65 V and ∼1.80 V were identified, which could be ascribed to the oxidation of Mn 2+ in the electrolyte and the further oxidation of Mn compound (e.g., from +3 to +4) on the solid electrode ( Figure 4B). The Mn 2p 3/2 profile ( Figure 4C) of the SS-Co(OH) 2 electrode after scanning to 1.85 V (denoted as ★) shows that the chemical state of the deposited Mn compound was very similar to those of SS and SS-Co(OH) 2 after scanning to 2.3 V (denoted as ▪ and ▲). XRD profiles of the SS-Co(OH) 2 after scanning to 1.85 and 2.3 V (denoted as ★ and ▲) indicate that their phase strutures are similar to those of the layered δ-MnO 2 and cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 ( Figure S11). As presented in the digital photographs ( Figure 4D), the major color and texture changes of the SS electrode and SS-Co(OH) 2 electrode before and after the LSV scan to a certain voltage also provide visual support for the deposition of the Mn compound. The high valent state of the Mn compound of the SS-Co(OH) 2 sample after scanning to 1.85 V (★) indicates the readiness to be reduced and to provide capacity in a subsequent discharge process. In  Figure 4E, the SS-Co(OH) 2 electrode was CV scanned (1 mV s −1). No reduction peak was found at the first negative scan from open circuit voltage (∼1.28 V) to 1.0 V, indicating that no significant discharging capacity was provided from SS-Co(OH) 2. The following positive (oxidation) scan from 1.0 to 1.85 V shows the oxidation of Mn 2+ and further oxidation as mentioned earlier, after which the subsequent negative scan shows two well-defined peaks at ∼1.4 and ∼1.2 V ( Figure 4E), matching well with the reduction peaks observed from the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode in a typical Zn-ion battery ( Figure 4A). It is important to note that cobalt element in the state of unbound Co 2+ in the electrolyte did not facilitate the deposition of active Mn compound. As presented in  Figure S12, LSV of SS in the electrolyte with and without additional 0.01 M CoSO 4 demonstrated similar onset potentials of ∼1.9 V, indicating no beneficial effect on facilitating the Mn compound deposition. Therefore, the promoted deposition of active Mn compound would be ascribed to the cobalt hydroxides and cobalt-containing species that bound on the solid cathode. This result is vital for the analysis in the following section. The mechanism behind the facilitated deposition of active Mn compound could be ascribed to dual-catalysis effects from Mn(IV) species and Co(III) species on the cathode. Usually, Mn 2+ in the electrolyte is more stable than most of the Mn cations due to the high tendency of Mn 3+ disproportionation ( Gibson et al., 2016). A recent research reported by Qiao's group indicated that the deposition of MnO 2 on a carbon fiber using a Mn 2+-containing electrolyte took place at a high potential of 2.2 V versus Zn 2+/Zn in a chronoamperometry charge process ( Chao et al., 2019). The sluggish kinetics of the direct oxidation of Mn 2+ could result in a large overpotential. Our LSV scan for the SS electrode in the Mn 2+-containing electrolyte ( Figure 4B) also indicates a similar result where an onset potential of deposition of the active Mn compound was higher than 1.85 V versus Zn 2+/Zn, which is beyond the voltage window for a typical Zn-ion battery. The unique facilitated deposition observed in this work within the voltage range below 1.85 V could be ascribed to the following two different catalysis routes ( Figure 4F): Mn self-catalysis (Route 1): where oxidation of Mn 2+ was achieved by the comproportionation of Mn(IV) and Mn 2+Mn(III) → Mn(IV) + e  -Mn(IV) + Mn  2+ → Mn(III) + Mn  3+ Co-induced catalysis (Route 2): where oxidation of Mn 2+ was enhanced by cobalt-facilitated charge transfer Co(II) → Co(III) + e  -Co(III) + Mn  2+ → Co(II) + Mn  3+ The Dynamic Movement of Cobalt Components for Self-Recovery of the Mn-Based Cathode As shown previously in  Figure 1A, the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode exhibits a superior rate toward the deposition of active Mn compound during the entire cycling test. This result indicates the continuous influence of cobalt components on facilitating the recovery of the Mn-based cathode. The authors once considered that the cobalt components could be only confined on the initial δ-MnO 2 cathode. In other words, the newly deposited Mn compound ( Figures 5A and 5B) on the surface might not contain cobalt components. Interestingly, however, after 10 and 100 cycles, identical cobalt signals were still observed both in bulk-sensitive EDX spectra ( Figures 5C and  S15) and in surface-sensitive Co 2p XPS profiles ( Figure 5D), although both signals were decreased as expected. This could be attributed to a dynamic movement of cobalt components, similar to the dissolution-deposition process of the MnO 2 cathode. It is important to note that the pH value of the electrolyte could be one of the important parameters that may cause the dissolution and redeposition of cobalt components. The pH value of the electrolyte (2 M ZnSO 4 + 0.2 M MnSO 4) is ∼5 ( Sun et al., 2017), a mild acidic environment under which the cobalt components (e.g., Co(OH) 2) could be unstable ( Gayer and Garrett, 1950). As indicated in previous reports, the electrolyte pH of Zn-ion batteries may vary due to the intercalation/de-intercalation of H +. In a system with a large volume of electrolyte (e.g., 10 mL, experiment shown in  Figure 4E), the intercalation/de-intercalation of H + is not significant enough to largely influence the pH value. Decomposition of Co(OH) 2 was observed only after five CV cycles (1.0–1.85 V,  Figure S16). However, in a coin-type battery with a small amount of electrolyte (200 μL in each of our battery), the pH value of the electrolyte could be significantly increased after being fully discharged ( Lee et al., 2016). The pH increase after the first discharge to 1.0 V was evidenced by the formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate (which only forms in high pH environment) on the cathode surface, as confirmed by XRD analysis ( Figure S17). ( Huang et al., 2018,  Pan et al., 2016) In  Figure 6, a bigger picture of the role of cobalt components in facilitating the recovery of the cathode and their dynamic movement is demonstrated. During the cycling, cathode reconstruction occurs in the battery, involving the dissolution and deposition of both Mn and Co components. Deposition of the Mn-based cathode is driven by an electrochemical charge process, which is further facilitated by cobalt components bound on the Mn compound. At the same time, the deposition/dissolution of the Co component is a pH-sensitive process. Owing to the weak acidic environment, a small fraction of cobalt component was dissolved in the electrolyte. During battery discharging, H + was inserted in the Mn-based cathode ( Sun et al., 2017), resulting in the increase of pH value and consequently the re-deposition of cobalt component on the reconstructed cathode surface. During each charge process, H + was reversibly released, causing the re-dissolution of cobalt components to some extent. This dynamic movement of the cobalt component in the solid electrode and liquid electrolyte is important for the persistent facilitation of cathode recovery. It is worth mentioning that apart from the facilitating effect from cobalt components, the overall capacity recovery rate of the Mn-based cathode is also limited by many other factors, e.g., (1) limited conductive cathode surface, (2) decreased Mn 2+ concentration in the electrolyte after many discharging-charging cycles, (3) the ionic conductivity and pH of the electrolyte, and (4) deterioration of the Zn anode ( Ha and Lee, 2016,  Selvakumaran et al., 2019). From the consideration of the first factor, the increment of the capacity for a battery with the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode (as shown in  Figure 1G) gradually slowed down during the 50–100 cycles. In addition, a comparison of the morphologies of cathode surface before cycling and after 100 th charge provides clear evidence that most of the conductive surface (e.g., current collector and conductive carbon) was heavily covered with dense, newly deposited active Mn compound ( Figures S18C and S18E). The deterioration of the charge-transfer situation of cathode surface could further limit the deposition of active Mn compound. Cycling Performance and More Practical Battery Configurations The practical viability of the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode was further demonstrated with a prolonged cycling test based on a higher current density of 2 A g −1 in a 200 μL electrolyte of 2 M ZnSO 4 and 0.2 M MnSO 4 ( Figure 7A). A commercially applicable battery cycle life (80% of capacity retention) of 2,000 discharge-charge cycles is presented. Even after 5,000 cycles, the battery still shows decent capacity retention of approximately 63% (compared with the 10 th discharge capacity). As mentioned in the  Introduction section, as the Mn 2+ additive is also active during cycling, it should also be considered for the evaluation of the overall capacity of the cathode. From the practical utility aspect, the final objective is to stabilize the battery performance with minimum additional Mn 2+. Using a smaller electrolyte volume of 70 μL, we then investigate the capacity retention of batteries in 2 M ZnSO 4 with five different concentrations of MnSO 4 additives (from 0 to 0.2 M as demonstrated in  Figure 7B) based on the total Mn compound mass (i.e., MnO 2 in the solid cathode and MnSO 4·H 2O added in the electrolyte). As indicated in  Figure 7C, due to its good cathode recovery capability, the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode enabled a more stable operation of rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion batteries. With a low MnSO 4 additive concentration of only 0.02 M (corresponding to an atomic percentage of 12% of the Mn additive in the electrolyte), an average capacity fading rate of 0.23% per cycle was achieved between the 7 th and 100 th cycles, much lower than that without MnSO 4 additive (0.35% per cycle, 1.5 times faster fading). We further demonstrate that batteries with a gel-polymer electrolyte and a cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode also presented decent performance and a similar trend of capacity increase during a 100-cycle stability test ( Figure S19). This indicates that the cobalt-catalyzed deposition strategy can also be applied to a hydrogel electrolyte battery system. Conclusion Stable performance of Zn-ion batteries was realized through a first reported cobalt-catalyzed recovery strategy, which was achieved by facilitating the deposition of active Mn compound in the cathode. The discharge capacity of a Mn-based cathode was determined by (1) the initial amount and valence of Mn in the solid Mn-based cathode before cycling, (2) the dissolution amount of the Mn cathode, and (3) most importantly, the deposition amount of active Mn compound. The facilitation of deposition is achieved by utilizing a facile cobalt modification strategy that integrated the well-dispersed, cobalt-containing species into the defective δ-MnO 2 nanosheets. Verified by both practical coin-type batteries and a newly designed home-made electrolyzer system, the deposition of active Mn compound was confirmed to be significantly facilitated with cobalt-based compounds (e.g., Co(OH) 2) and the bound cobalt-containing species (e.g., Co(II) and Co(III)) in the cobalt-modified δ-MnO 2 cathode, whereas the unbound Co 2+ in the electrolyte showed no significant impact on the deposition process. In addition, the concentration of Mn 2+ additives and the volume of the electrolyte are also vital parameters for capacity recovery of the cathode. For a fair performance comparison, these two parameters should be well controlled and clearly indicated in future publications of Mn-based cathode for Zn-ion batteries. Overall, this work provides a deeper insight into the deposition behaviors of the active cathode material and its significant influence on the stable performance of aqueous Zn-ion batteries. This work could also provide inspiration for the materials engineering for future functionalized cathodes, especially for other conversion-type battery cathodes that suffer from the similar dissolution issue, for example, manganese-based cathodes for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries and sulfur cathodes for Li-S and Na-S batteries. Limitations of the Study Our work has demonstrated how cobalt modification can facilitate the deposition of Mn compounds on the δ-MnO 2 cathode and lead to stable performance of Zn-ion batteries. Although the catalytic effect of cobalt species was evidenced by electrochemical analysis and supported by multiple  ex situ characterizations, in-depth understanding of the catalytic mechanism is still needed. Further investigation with advanced  in situ techniques and theoretical calculations may provide a deeper insight.",NaN,NaN,"['Figure', 'cathode', 'Mn-based cathode', 'cobalt-modified δ-MnO', 'δ-MnO', 'deposition', 'capacity', 'cobalt', 'Cobalt Components', 'Figures']"
12,C:\Users\shweata\openDiagram\physchem\liion\PMC7066648\eupmc_result.json,PMC7066648,"Results and Discussion The fabrication process of the yarn-shaped LIB is briefly described in this section. As shown in  Figure   1, a yarn-shaped LIB with SSYs@LiFePO 4 (SSY@LFP) as the cathode, the SSYs@graphite (SSY@G) as the anode, and PVDF-HFP/LiBF 4 with EC/PC as the gel electrolyte was successfully assembled. It is advantageous that SSYs provide high electrical conductivity and excellent flexibility, whereas gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) play the role of electrolytes and separators which ensure equivalent high ionic conductivity to the liquid electrolyte and enhance the safety performance of the battery. 36−  38 The structure and performance of the fabricated yarn-shaped LIB will be scrutinized in the next sections. The surface morphology of the yarn-shaped LIB is discussed in this section. The optical image of SSY ( Figure   2a 1) with a diameter of about 0.6 mm demonstrates the smooth surface with metallic luster. After cleaning, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of filaments from SSY demonstrate very smooth surfaces without any impurities ( Figure   2a 2,a 3). What is more, single SSY possesses concave and convex surface structures, which favors the contact adhesion between the active materials and the SSY. With the active material being LFP-coated, the yarn-shaped cathode electrode ( Figures   2b 1–b 3 and  S2a,b) (diameter ∼0.78 mm) shows that the coated materials are densely and continuously distributed with black-gray color. Also, uniformly dispersed CNTs in the cathode electrode ( Figure   2b 3) may enhance the conductivity to reduce the polarization of the battery and provide electron tunneling for LiFePO 4 to compensate the charge balance during Li + insertion and removal. 39,  40 The yarn-shaped anode electrode with natural graphite ( Figures   2c 1 and  S2c,d) (diameter ∼0.83 mm) has a gloss surface, which is possibly attributed to the presence of free electrons in the graphite layer. It is observed that anode sheet layers (size about 5–10 μm) are uniformly dispersed with little agglomeration and have a porous structure ( Figure   2c 2,c 3), which possibly contributes to the overall large specific surface area and facilitates the diffusion of Li +. In addition, the presence of elongated and electrically conductive CNTs may result in a good conductive pathway between the graphite sheets, which enhances the catalytic activity of the charge transfer reaction. 41Figure   2d 1 indicates that the gel electrolyte has little rough surface and uniform pore distribution, which may lead to small surface pores of SSY@LFP@GE (cross-sectional diameter ∼0.95 mm) ( Figure S3a) and high specific surface area.  Figure   2d 2,d 3 demonstrate the porous structure of the prepared gel electrolyte (pore size ∼1 μm). This porous structure ( Figure S3b) of the GPE may ensure lithium-ion conduction while preventing the passage of electrode particles. An increased number of macropores enhances the specific surface area of electrodes and provides more channels for the transport of ions. In addition, the interpenetrating macroporous structure can reduce the resistance of ion transport and polymer chain scission migration while increasing the ionic conductivity. 42 Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the cathode electrode SSY@LFP from the corresponding SEM image ( Figure   3) revealed the existence and distribution of various elements. In detail, Fe, P, and O elements from LiFePO 4 and the C element from CNTs are well observed. In addition, the even distribution of Fe, P, and O elements strongly indicates that the cathode material is uniformly coated onto the surface of the flexible SSY without severe agglomeration. The uniform distribution of C elements further evidences that the uniform three-dimensional network of CNTs is formed ( Figure   2b 3) and may retard the expansion process of the electrodes in battery cycling. 43 To verify the electrochemical stability of the SSYs as current collectors, electrochemical performance of these yarns will be discussed in the section. As shown in  Figure   4a, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of SSYs in the voltage range of 2.0–3.7 V imply no obvious redox peak at different scan rates of 5, 10, 20, and 50 mV·s –1. Because the SSYs are not involved in the electrochemical reaction of the electrodes in the voltage range, their suitability as a flexible substrate for a yarn-shaped LIB is confirmed. The electrochemical performance of the gel electrolyte is scrutinized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The typical Nyquist plots are composed of one semicircle in a high-frequency range and a straight line in a low-frequency range. The radius of the semicircle in the high-frequency region represents the impedance of the electrode, namely, the impedance of lithium ions between the electrode and the electrolyte interface in this work. The slope of the linear line in the low-frequency region represents the ease of lithium-ion diffusion: the steeper the slope of the line is, the easier the lithium-ion diffusion is. 44−  46 As shown in  Figures   4b,c, and  S4a,b, Nyquist plots of the gel electrolyte after 1 and 24 h of storage time show typical characteristics, but the low-frequency slope of the gel electrolyte after 1 h of storage is larger, indicating lower ion diffusion resistance. 47 When comparing the high-frequency semicircle of the gel electrolytes, it is clear that the radius of the gel electrolyte stored for 1 h (296 Ω) is much smaller than that of the one after 24 h of storage (5782 Ω), implying rapid electron transport and low charge transport resistance of the newly prepared gel electrolyte. 48 Moreover, the performance of the prepared gel electrolyte is time-sensitive, possibly because of the volatilization of the plasticizer (EC/PC) over time. Typically plasticizers play a multitude of roles in the gel electrolyte such as reducing the crystallinity of the polymer and the activation energy of ion transport, increasing the mobility of the polymer segment and the concentration of free ions, promoting the dissociation of lithium salts, and so forth. 49 Thus, retaining the maximum plasticizer content is the key to obtain the best electrochemical performance of the yarn-shaped LIB. The cycle performance is further examined in this section. As shown in  Figure   5a, this 7 cm-long yarn-shaped LIB has a capacity of 0.45 mA h at 0.1 C. In addition, in the discharge platform range of 3.1–3.2 V, the battery has a voltage curve similar to that of the coin-type full battery, which rationalizes the design principle of the yarn-shaped LIB. With a cyclic charge/discharge analysis at 0.1 C ( Figure   5b), the charging platform (3.4–3.55 V) and the discharging platform (3.0–3.2 V) indicate the typical charge/discharge curve of the battery. The cyclic stability test of the assembled yarn-shaped LIB at 0.2 C ( Figure   5c) shows that the capacity retention is 42.78% and the Coulombic efficiency remains 54.2% from the 1st cycle to the 50th cycle. During the charging process, the anode experiences volume expansion, resulting in the generation of structural debris and new surface area. The additionally formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film will increase the amount of lithium-ion consumption. During the discharging process of the battery, the structural debris that have poor contact or have been detached from the conducting network of the anode will not participate in the electrochemical reaction, and these lithium ions are irreversibly lost. Therefore, Coulombic efficiency is not very satisfactory. To better understand the cycling capability of the yarn-shaped LIB, EIS measurements were performed before the 1st and after the 50th charge/discharge cycle ( Figure   5d). After 50 cycles, the ionic and electronic conductivities of the yarn-shaped LIB are reduced because the calculated impedance increases from 263.4 to 324.6 Ω and the linear slope of the low-frequency region is decreased. It is possibly due to the occurrence of interfacial side reactions inside the battery and SEI film formed on the surface of the electrode. 50 To better verify the flexibility of the prepared yarn-shaped LIB which has an effective length of 7 cm and a diameter of 1.76 mm ( Figure   6a), its electrochemical performance at different states (normal, bent, and knotted) is demonstrated ( Figures   6b and  S5). In the normal state, the assembled yarn-shaped LIB has a discharge specific capacity of 55.8 mA h·g –1 at 0.1 C. Even being bent or knotted, the output specific capacity of the assembled yarn-shaped LIB is still maintained above 85%. How to maintain the stable capacity retention rate of the prepared yarn-shaped LIB in the process of multiple bending or folding is still an important issue to be solved in the future. The battery with good flexibility ( Figures   6c–f and  S6) offers the possibility of being woven into fabrics ( Figure   7a). In addition, the practical application of the assembled yarn-shaped LIB is revealed. The charged yarn-shaped LIB under the bending state successfully powers up an electronic watch ( Figure   7b and  Video S1) and an electronic thermo-hygrometer ( Figure   7c and  Video S2) to enable them to work for 36.2 and 4.7 h, respectively. Comparison of the volumetric energy density and specific capacity of this work with other reported yarn-shaped LIBs is presented in  Figure S7, and data about the yarn-shaped battery are summarized in  Table S1. The performance of the yarn-shaped LIB assembled from inexpensive materials through a simple preparation process still needs to be further improved.",NaN,NaN,"['yarn-shaped LIB', 'Figure', 'LIB', 'gel electrolyte', 'yarn-shaped', 'Figures', 'SSY', 'electrolyte', 'surface', 'gel']"
13,C:\Users\shweata\openDiagram\physchem\liion\PMC7067258\eupmc_result.json,PMC7067258,"Results and discussion To prepare powder crystalline  PCT-1·DMF, HHTP and HAT-CN were dissolved in DMF and stirred at 100 °C for 3 h to yield the deep green powder of  PCT-1·DMF. We also attempted the preparation of a single crystal of  PCT-1·DMF using various solvent combinations to allow single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements to be carried out. However, only unsuitable ultrafine needle-like crystals were obtained by the vapor diffusion method at room temperature due to the fast nucleation of  PCT-1·DMF (Fig. S1 in the ESI †). Thus, to slow the crystallization rate, a boronate ester COF (COF-5) was used as an HHTP source. As the framework of COF-5 is composed of HHTP and boronic acid, and the boronate ester bond easily undergoes hydrolysis, HHTP molecules are expected to be released gradually under ambient conditions, which could in turn control the nucleation rate of  PCT-1·DMF. Thus, COF-5 and HAT-CN were suspended in DMF and allowed to stand exposed to hexane vapor as a poor solvent. After 1 week, plate-like single crystals of  PCT-1·DMF with a measurable size of 350 μm were obtained, suggesting that COF-5 was decomposed by moisture in the air and HHTP molecules were released in the DMF solvent. The crystal structure ( Fig. 2) revealed that  PCT-1·DMF exhibits a pseudo-hexagonal columnar structure in which HHTP and HAT-CN molecules stack alternately along the  c axis. The distance between the π planes of HHTP and HAT-CN in the column was 3.27 Å, suggesting the presence of strong π–π interactions between these two compounds. In addition, the intercolumnar spaces were filled with DMF, which forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxy groups of HHTP (Fig. S2 †). As shown in  Fig. 3a, the XRPD pattern of  PCT-1·DMF agreed with the simulated pattern predicted from the single-crystal structural analysis, demonstrating that the bulk-synthesized dark green powder forms the same structure. Although the donor HHTP and acceptor HAT-CN compounds are white and yellow powders, respectively,  PCT-1·DMF was obtained as a deep green powder, suggesting CT-band formation. Indeed, UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements of  PCT-1·DMF showed a wide absorption band at 700–800 nm (Fig. S3 †), which represents the CT band between HHTP and HAT-CN. The electronic state of HAT-CN in  PCT-1·DMF was then evaluated by FT-IR spectroscopy. It has been reported that the stretching vibration peaks of the nitrile group ( νCN) of HAT-CN with neutral and anionic radicals appear at 2241 and 2210 cm –1, respectively. 51 In the FT-IR spectrum of  PCT-1,  νCN was observed only at 2241 cm –1 (Fig. S4 †), indicating that the HAT-CN molecules in  PCT-1·DMF are neutral. The molecular orbital of an HHTP and HAT-CN dimer cut from the crystal structure of  PCT-1·DMF was obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the B3LYP/6-31++G** level of theory under gas-phase conditions including dispersion forces with Grimme's D2 parameter. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) shown in Fig. S5 † confirm that the majority of the HOMO is localized on the HHTP molecule and the majority of the LUMO is localized on the HAT-CN molecule. This result indicates that  PCT-1·DMF is a neutral CT complex, which is consistent with the FT-IR spectroscopy results. In addition, the electrostatic potentials (ESPs) of the HHTP and HAT-CN molecules were calculated along with the energy of the aromatic interactions (including dispersion forces) to evaluate the strong π–π interactions between HHTP and HAT-CN. The ESPs shown in  Fig. 3b demonstrate that the aromatic rings of HHTP and HAT-CN possess negatively and positively charged cores, respectively, suggesting that the mixed columnar structures are stabilized by electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged aromatic cores. In addition, the energy of the π–π interactions between HHTP and HAT-CN was calculated using the cut dimeric structure, giving an estimated stack energy of –39.0 kcal mol –1, which indicates a greater stability than that provided by π–π interactions between HAT-CN ( i.e., –13.8 kcal mol –1), as estimated from the reported crystal structure of HAT-CN (Table S1 †). 52 Furthermore, in the crystal structure of  PCT-1·DMF, six DMF molecules form hydrogen bonds to the hydroxy groups of HHTP. The calculated π stack energy using the HHTP and HAT-CN dimer with six molecules of DMF was –66.9 kcal mol –1 (Table S2 †). The strong π–π interactions can therefore be explained by the fact that hydrogen bonds increase the negative charge of the HHTP aromatic ring and therefore the electrostatic interactions between HAT-CN and HHTP become stronger. The guest-free phase of  PCT-1 was then prepared by heating  PCT-1·DMF at 120 °C overnight under reduced pressure. The  1H NMR spectrum of  PCT-1 in methanol- d4 revealed that only one DMF molecule per HHTP molecule remained in the structure, indicating that the other five DMF molecules were removed upon heating (Fig. S6 †). CHN elemental analysis also confirmed the existence of one DMF molecule in  PCT-1. The XRPD pattern of  PCT-1 acquired in a dry Ar atmosphere ( Fig. 3a) shows broader peaks than that of  PCT-1·DMF, in which fewer peaks are observed. The majority of peaks corresponding to  PCT-1 were indexed as ( hk0), and all peaks were observed to be shifted to larger 2 θ values. The d-spacing of the peak at 2 θ = 27.4°, assigned to the (001) diffraction, is 3.26 Å, which corresponds to the distance between the π planes of HHTP and HAT-CN, and indicates that the intermolecular distances in the columns remain constant following DMF removal. Assuming an orthorhombic crystal system, the assigned cell parameters are  a = 11.2 Å,  b = 20.6 Å, and  c = 3.26 Å. When pseudo-hexagonal packing of the columns on the  ab plane is assumed, a column diameter of approximately 10–11 Å is obtained, which is consistent with the sizes of HAT-CN and HHTP. These results strongly suggest that a structural transformation occurred after DMF removal and that the intercolumnar distance was reduced to maintain the pseudo-hexagonal columnar packing due to the strong π–π interactions between HHTP and HAT-CN. The SEM images shown in  Fig. 3c and d indicate that the crystal morphology of  PCT-1 was maintained after DMF removal. Interestingly, the XRPD pattern became sharper and shifted after exposing  PCT-1 to ambient air or water vapor ( Fig. 3a). Assuming that the crystal system is orthorhombic, the unit cell parameters are  a = 13.5 Å,  b = 22.1 Å, and  c = 3.29 Å, indicating that the lattice expanded along the direction of the  ab plane. This result strongly suggests that  PCT-1 rapidly adsorbs water molecules in the hydrophilic intercolumnar spaces to form  PCT-1·H  2O . In addition, following exposure of  PCT-1·H  2O  powder to DMF vapor, the original XRPD pattern of  PCT-1·DMF was recovered, indicating that the adsorption–desorption process of the guest is reversible and that  PCT-1 can be regarded as a porous material (Fig. S7 and S8 †). To explore the porous properties of  PCT-1 in detail, the water adsorption isotherm was acquired at 298 K. As shown in  Fig. 3e, water was adsorbed with a large hysteresis and a step was present at  P/ P0 = 0.7, which is typically observed in the sorption isotherms of flexible MOFs in which structural transformations occur. 53– 55 At  P/ P0 = 0.92, the adsorption was 238 cm 3 g –1 (at STP), which corresponds to the adsorption of 15 water molecules per HHTP/HAT-CN dimer. This stepwise sorption behavior suggests that the structural transformation or lattice expansion occurred at  P/ P0 = 0.7. N 2 adsorption measurements of  PCT-1 at 77 K were also performed, and the obtained N 2 isotherm showed that  PCT-1 does not adsorb nitrogen at this temperature. This result suggests that  PCT-1 adsorbs only polar molecules ( e.g., H 2O and DMF) in the intercolumnar space or that the structural transformation requires a higher temperature due to the high activation energy necessary for the diffusion process. The XRPD pattern after the water-sorption experiments (Fig. S9 †) is similar to that prior to water adsorption. In addition, SEM imaging confirmed that the morphology was maintained after water adsorption ( Fig. 3f), suggesting that recrystallization did not occur during the adsorption measurements and water adsorption did not destroy the  PCT-1 columnar structure. These results demonstrate that the pseudo-hexagonal columnar packing is retained during water adsorption. To evaluate the electrochemical performance of  PCT-1, coin-type lithium metal battery cells were assembled using cathodes with  PCT-1 and lithium foil as anodes. The pellet cathode samples were composed of 30 wt%  PCT-1, 60 wt% carbon black (to improve electrical conductivity), and 10 wt% PVDF. 22 Before conducting electrochemical experiments, the solubilities of  PCT-1, HAT-CN, and HHTP in the electrolyte were checked. While slight elution of  PCT-1 into the electrolyte was observed, HHTP and the HAT-CT monomer were well dissolved under the same conditions, demonstrating that elution was suppressed by CT complex formation. The voltage range used to evaluate the battery performance of the coin-type cells was determined from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) peak position and the reversibility. CV measurements in three voltage ranges (1.0–4.0 V, 1.5–3.5 V, and 1.75–3.0 V) demonstrated that peak reversibility at 2.67 V was observed only when the voltage range was 1.75–3.0 V (Fig. S10 †). Therefore, galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out at voltages of 1.75–3.0 V with a current density of 500 mA g –1. Despite using high current density conditions, the discharge capacities in the first and second cycles were 416 and 288 mA h g –1, respectively ( Fig. 4a), and the numbers of electrons were 11.0 and 7.6 per HHTP/HAT-CN dimer, respectively. The energy densities in the first and second cycles were 151.0 and 73.7 W h kg –1, respectively, and the power densities in the first and second cycles were 331.7 and 232.9 W kg –1, respectively. As two kinds of multi-redox-active molecules are present in  PCT-1,  i.e., HHTP and HAT-CN, multiple electron reactions can occur. We assume that each HAT-CN and HHTP molecule undergoes an ideal 6e – redox reaction and that the total maximum theoretical capacity of  PCT-1 is 454 mA h g –1, which is of the same order as the first discharge capacity. In addition, the high capacity of the lithium metal battery cell under these high current density conditions suggests that lithium ions can pass through the intercolumnar space in  PCT-1, and therefore, HHTP and HAT-CN molecules inside the crystal lattices react efficiently. Although the capacity of the battery after 100 cycles was 48.1% of that after 2 cycles, the coulombic efficiency was maintained at ∼100% over 100 cycles, and all electric energy obtained in the charge process could be utilized in the discharge process ( Fig. 4b). The low cycling performance is therefore attributed to the gradual elution of  PCT-1 into the electrolyte, despite  PCT-1 being stabilized by CT complex formation, as mentioned above. In contrast, the abrupt decrease in capacity in the first cycle, which is sometimes observed in batteries that use molecular cathode active materials, can be ascribed to several factors. 22, 56 Possible reasons for this phenomenon include the dissolution of  PCT-1 in the electrolyte, the formation of a solid electrolyte interface, and supercapacitance effects on the electrode surface. In addition, HHTP possesses six hydroxy groups, which can be deprotonated and lithiated under the conditions in the cell. The deprotonation process is irreversible; hence, it may also be responsible for the dramatic capacity decrease observed in the second charge/discharge curve. The properties of a battery using  PCT-1·DMF, where DMF molecules are present in the intercolumnar spaces, were also examined. The galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles revealed that the discharge capacity in the second cycle was 103 mA h g –1 and the number of electrons was 4.4 per HHTP/HAT-CN dimer, which is lower than the performances of degassed  PCT-1 (Fig. S11 †). These results suggest that the stable hydrogen bonds between the DMF molecules and hydroxy groups prevent Li + ion diffusion. In contrast, when the amount of  PCT-1 in the cathode was increased or the thickness of the cathode was increased, the cell capacities decreased, likely due to the low electrical conductivity of the alternately stacked CT complex,  PCT-1 (Fig. S12 and S13 †). The capacity of a battery without the active material (only the carbon additive) was quite low (<14 mA h g –1), indicating that the contribution the carbon additive is limited or negligible (Fig. S14 †). To investigate the electrochemical behavior of  PCT-1 in the cell, CV measurements were conducted on the fabricated cell. As shown in  Fig. 4c, the cathodic peaks at 1.78, 2.02, and 2.67 V ( vs. Li +/Li) represent the reduction of  PCT-1 and the insertion of lithium ions, while the anodic peaks at 2.11, 2.23, and 2.89 V ( vs. Li +/Li) are attributable to the oxidation and extraction of lithium ions, demonstrating that  PCT-1 exhibits a reversible multistep redox ability. The three redox potentials,  E1/2, at 1.95, 2.13, and 2.76 V ( vs. Li +/Li) are close to the redox potentials of HHTP and HAT-CN in the coin-type cell, as shown in Fig. S15, † which suggests that the redox reaction of HHTP and HAT-CN influences battery performance. The redox reaction of 5,6,11,12,17,18-hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA), a HAT derivative, was reported to be a 6e – reaction that can be divided in two three-electron processes,  i.e., 2.6–2.15 V and 1.68–1.38 V. 49 Since HAT-CN has a lower LUMO level than HATNA, the redox reaction of HAT-CN occurs in the higher voltage region, which is consistent with the CV profile of  PCT-1. The redox peaks remained constant after 10 CV cycles, although the peak intensity decreased, which is consistent with the low cycle performance of the battery capacity (Fig. S10 †). The capacitive contributions in the CV profiles were separated from the total current according to the reported method (Fig. S16 †). 57 The voltage profile for the capacitive current demonstrates that the anodic peaks at 2.11, 2.23, and 2.89 V ( vs. Li +/Li) and the cathodic peaks at 1.78, 2.02, and 2.67 V ( vs. Li +/Li) do not originate from the capacitive effect. In contrast, the large capacity and the sloping potential of the battery are partly due to the relatively large capacitive contribution, which was attributed to the porous structure of  PCT-1. Furthermore, the XRPD patterns of the cathode before and after the charge and discharge processes demonstrate that the hexagonal packing structure was retained, although the peaks became broader after charge–discharge (Fig. S17 †). To compare the CT complex with the HHTP and HAT-CN monomers, we conducted a comparative battery performance experiment using cathodes containing only HHTP or HAT-CN molecules. At 500 mA g –1, the discharge capacities in the second cycle for  PCT-1, HHTP, and HAT-CN were 288, 45, and 98 mA h g –1, respectively, as shown in  Fig. 4d and S18. † The capacity of  PCT-1 was significantly higher than those of the monomers, suggesting that the stable one-dimensional mixed columnar structure enhances the stability and the efficient diffusion of lithium ions. The CV profile of the HHTP monomer showed broad redox peaks and the battery performance was rather low, although the high capacity and CV peak at 2.67 V ( vs. Li +/Li) of  PCT-1 suggested the existence of an HHTP redox reaction in the CT complex, which could account for the large capacity of  PCT-1. The high redox activity of HHTP in  PCT-1 is most likely due to the porous structure and the efficient diffusion of Li + ions in the crystal lattice. The rate performance of  PCT-1, HHTP, and HAT-CN shown in  Fig. 4e reveals that the high capacity of  PCT-1 is retained even under rapid charge and discharge conditions. This result suggests that the intercolumnar channels in  PCT-1 enhance the efficient diffusion of lithium ions, thereby improving the rate performance. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was used to evaluate the diffusion rate of lithium ions in  PCT-1 (Fig. S19 †). The diffusion coefficient ( DLi  +) of lithium ions calculated by the GITT was 6.73 × 10 –11 cm 2 s –1, which is comparable to those of conventional metal oxides and/or highly porous materials such as exfoliated COFs. 32, 58 The high  DLi  + of  PCT-1 was therefore attributed to the channels between the columnar structures, which act as diffusion paths for lithium ions. To investigate the CT resistance in the active material, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out. As shown in  Fig. 4f and S20, † the semicircles in the Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuit fitting results demonstrate that the CT resistance of  PCT-1 (96 Ω) is lower than those of HAT-CN (146 Ω) and HHTP (131 Ω), suggesting that the CT resistance was also improved by the formation of columnar structures.",NaN,NaN,"['HHTP', 'DMF', 'Fig.', 'HAT-CN', 'DMF molecules', 'HHTP molecule', 'HAT-CN molecules', 'molecules', 'DMF removal', 'structure']"

Results and Discussions According to Ikonen et al., porous silicon was prepared by electrochemical etching of silicon wafers and ball milling. The average pore size of pSi was 5–16 nm and the obtained electrode shows a capacity of 1200 mAh/g [ 28]. According to Gauthier et al., an Si-based anode with improved performance was achieved using high-energy ball milling as a cheap and easy process to produce Si powder. Milled powders were nanostructured with micrometric agglomerates (approximately 10 µm in size), made of submicrometric particles with crystallite size of 10 nm. They showed that, compared to non-milled 1–5 µm powders, the improved performance is linked to a strong lowering of particle disconnection at each charge, while the irreversibility due to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation remains unchanged. Electrode achieves 600 cycles at more than 1170 mAh/g with coulombic efficiency above 99% [ 61]. In the study by Zhang et al., one-dimensional porous silicon nanowires were prepared through the MACE process by using metallurgical silicon as raw material. Nanowires were coated with crossed carbon skeleton via in situ polymerization and carbonization process. The resultant composite delivered a high capacity of 1253 mAh/g with good cycling stability [ 43]. In this work, metal-assisted chemical etching of starting Si material resulted in the average pore size of 3.44 nm, which is large enough for the solvated lithium ions to pass through pores easily. Figure 3 shows TEM images of powder samples S1 (a), S2 (b), and S3 (c). The TEM image of sample S1 shows agglomerates composed of a dozen smaller particles. The measured particle size distribution of sample S1 gave the mean particle size of ~75.2 nm (+/− 13 nm), while the size of the agglomerate proved to be much larger (approximately 250 nm). The ball-milled sample (S2) possesses of small discrete particles around 29 nm (+/− 6 nm) in size and bigger particle agglomerates approximately 200 nm in size. Sample S3 consisted of irregular particles (c) with a lot of empty spaces between particles, which indicated the porous nature of sample S3. The particle size of ~106.2 nm (+/− 18 nm) and particle agglomerate size of approximately 500 nm were measured (c). The total volume and specific surface areas of samples were measured using nitrogen adsorption. For these analyses, the samples were degassed at T = 250 °C and the sample chamber was filled with controlled increments of nitrogen starting at relative pressure of p/p 0 = 0.025 at T = 77K, where p 0 is the saturation vapor pressure of liquid N 2 at 77K. Figure 6 shows the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the samples S1, S2, and S3. Samples S1 and S3 can be characterized by the H4 type hysteresis loops of physisorption isotherms. These types of loops are generally found within materials possessing narrow slit pores, often in the micropore region. For sample S1, the hysteresis loop closes at around 0.47 p/p 0 which is indicative of the so-called tensile strength effect. In contrast to the hysteresis loop of sample S1, the hysteresis loop of sample S3 is observable in the low-pressure region, which can be a consequence of irreversible adsorption of nitrogen in pores of a similar width as the adsorptive molecule or the chemisorption of the adsorptive molecules. Due to the presence of the low-pressure hysteresis in sample S3, an accurate analysis of pore size and pore volume is not possible. In contrast to these two samples, S2 exhibits a type II physisorption isotherm, which is characteristic of nonporous or macroporous adsorbents. The shape of such an isotherm is a consequence of unrestricted monolayer-multilayer adsorption up to high values of p/p 0 [ 44, 45], which is in line with particle agglomeration visible on the TEM images. The difference in the physisorption isotherms ( Figure 4) is a result of mechanochemical treatment of sample S2 which can influence the structure of the samples regarding both micropores and mesopores [ 46]. From these data, the total surface area of the sample can be derived by the method of Brunauer, Emmet and Teller (BET) [ 47]. For sample S1 the surface area is 10.6 m 2/g, while for S2 it is 16.7 m 2/g. The surface increase is expected because the particle size is reduced. Sample S3 has a surface area of 7.2 m 2/g which is also expected because the average pore size of S3 (3.44 nm) is much bigger than for the S2 (1.26 nm) or S1 (0.56 nm). The total pore volume increased in sample S3. The average particle size and surface area of samples S1, S2, and S3 are given in  Table 1. Figure 5 shows the X-ray powder diffraction patterns of samples S1, S2, and S3. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of these samples contain only diffraction lines typical of silicon (Si, space group  Fm3¯m, a = 5.43088 Å; ICDD PDF No. 27-1402). In the case of sample S1, diffraction lines are very strong and narrow, which indicate a well crystalline sample. Milling of sample S2 caused a broadening of the diffraction lines and the increase of background due to the decrease of crystallite size and the increase of lattice defects. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of S3 contains, beside strong and narrow diffraction lines typical of silicon, diffraction lines of lower intensity typical of silver (Ag, space group  Fm3¯m, a = 4.0862 Å; ICDD PDF No. 4-783). During the processing of various materials in the mill, in addition to grinding particles and forming defects, the metastable phases might be formed [ 48]. In particular, the small quantities of high-pressure phases were formed upon silicon milling [ 49]. In order to determine portion of crystal phases (silicon and silver) in sample S3, we performed Rietveld refinement of a powder diffraction pattern ( Figure 6). The obtained results indicate that this sample is predominantly silicon (~99.5%). The amount of the second crystalline phase, silver, was estimated at ~0.5%. The weighted residual error index (R wp) of the refined pattern was less than 9%. The physical broadening (β) of the diffraction lines was used to estimate the volume-averaged domain size ( Dv) and the root-mean-square strain ( εRMS) according to the so-called ”double-Voigt” method [ 50] equivalent to the Warren-Averbach approach [ 51]. This method, in which Voigt functions were used to describe the contribution of both the crystallite size and the lattice micro-strain to the broadening of the diffraction lines, was performed using the computer program BREADTH [ 52]. Physically broadened diffraction line profiles (β) were obtained by convolution-fitting approach (program SHADOW [ 53]) in which the instrumental profile (a split Person VII function fitted to the very narrow diffraction lines of zincite [ 54]) is convoluted with a refineable Voigt function to fit the observed diffraction lines profile. The results of convolution-fitting of the diffraction lines in products S1, S2, and S3 are shown in  Figure 5. The results of diffraction line broadening analysis are summarized in  Table 2. Figure 7 shows Raman spectra of samples S1, S2, and S3. The Raman peak at 510 cm −1 (~40 cm −1 width) found in sample S1 is characteristic for the crystalline silicon (c-Si) powder. The mechanochemical treatment of the sample produced defects and strain and as a consequence the c-Si peak at 510 cm −1 was further shifted toward lower wavenumbers by 30 cm −1, and it was further broadened by an additional ~10 cm −1. These changes indicate that the lattice has been further defected and strained, resulting in a change of the Si–Si bond length [ 55, 56]. Sample S2 also shows photoluminescence (PL) as a result of new formatted Si-O bonds in the sample as shown on the FT-IR spectrum. The PL of porous silicon is attributed to the recombination centers related to Si-O bonds. The phonon confinement can be explained by the formation of the nanocrystalline silicon domains created by mechanochemical treatment. The Raman spectrum of sample S3 contains a peak at 510 and shoulder at 495 cm −1. The origin of the first one is due to phonon confinement in silicon nanoparticles and the second one is due to amorphous silicon layers or surface phonons of silicon nanoparticles [ 57, 58]. The increased number of silicon nano-domains could be caused by MACE treatment. There is no observable PL effect in the sample S3 because the MACE process could remove the oxide layers by chemical etching. Figure 8 shows FT-IR spectra of samples. All three samples show a broad band ranging from 3700 to 3200 cm −1 associated with the stretching mode of hydrogen in Si-OH groups. A strong band at 2280–2080 cm −1 is in the range of silicon hydrogen species (SiH x, x = 1–3) [ 59], but due to the characteristic shape of the band, we assigned this band to the adsorbed CO 2. The characteristic asymmetric stretching mode for Si-O corresponds to the band in the range of 1100 to 1400 cm −1 for samples S1 and S2, which is in line with the PL effect present in the Raman spectrum of S2 [ 59]. Figure 9 shows UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (a) of samples S1, S2, and S3 and the corresponding Kubelka-Munk plots (b). The band gap energy of samples S1, S2, and S3 was calculated based on the Kubelka-Munk function. The following relation is used: (  hνα)  1/n =   A (  hν −   Eg)  (1) where  h is Planck’s constant,  ν is frequency,  α is absorption coefficient,  Eg is band gap and A is proportionality constant. The value of the exponent n represents the type of sample transition (n = 2 for indirect allowed transition, n = 0.5 for direct allowed transition). The calculations were performed for indirect band gap energy determination; therefore, the value of n was set to 2. The collected diffuse reflectance spectra were converted to the Kubelka–Munk function. The vertical axis was converted to a quantity ( R∞) hν where  F( R∞) is proportional to the absorption coefficient and is calculated by the following equation: F(  R∞) = (1 −   R)  2/2  R(2) where  R is reflectance at a given wavelength. Using the calculated values,  F( R∞)  hν2 was plotted against  hν. A line tangent to the linear part of the curve was extrapolated to zero reflectance. The extrapolated value was taken as the band gap energy of the material. The calculated band gaps ( E  g) of samples S1, S2, and S3 were estimated to 1.35, 1.53, and 1.68 eV, respectively which is in agreement with Raman scattering measurements that show silicon nanosized domains for all samples analyzed. Band gap increases with the decrease in size due to electron confinement at the nano scale. Electrochemical measurements were performed using both the cyclic voltammetry (CV) ( Figure 10) and galvanostatic cycling ( Figure 11). The intercalation and extraction mechanism are followed by CV, which indicates, for sample BatS1, the absence of Li + ion diffusion through anode material. On the contrary, initial sweep cycle of samples BatS2 and BatS3, shows cathodic peak (Li alloying), current increases sharply below 0.5 V vs. Li/Li +, which is related to intercalation of Li + ions resulting in the transformation of crystalline Si to a disordered phase [ 58, 60]. In the reverse (discharge) process, a broad anodic peak is due to the extraction of Li + ion from Li xSi regenerating to Si. Two anode peaks at BatS2 and BatS3, characteristic for extraction of lithium ion from silicon anode, indicate that Li + ion is extracted from different crystalline phases. Sample BatS3 shows much higher charge values compared to samples BatS1 and BatS2. Moreover, the current values for sample BatS3 were higher for several orders of magnitude in comparison to samples BatS1 and BatS2. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements show intercalation and extraction cycles which demonstrates good stability, which can undergo over 100 cycles for sample BatS1, 500 cycles for sample BatS2 and 700 cycles for sample BatS3 ( Figure 12). The efficiency of the BatS1 is quite diffuse, for sample BatS2 is slightly smaller and more stable over a longer cycle, whereas for sample BatS3 it has higher efficiency and much longer stability over many cycles. This allows us to conclude that sample S3 may indeed provide a good quality anode material.",NaN,NaN,"['sample', 'samples', 'diffraction lines', 'size', 'silicon', 'diffraction', 'particle size', 'Figure', 'lines', 'pore size']"

Results and Discussion The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the NiCo 2O 4, CuCo 2O 4, and Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 powders are shown in  Figure 1. It is discovered that the characteristic peaks of the NiCo 2O 4 and CuCo 2O 4 are very similar. All the diffraction peaks of the NiCo 2O 4, CuCo 2O 4 powders correspond to the (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), and (440) plane reflections of cubic spinel NiCo 2O 4 or CuCo 2O 4. Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 has similar characteristic peaks as NiCo 2O 4 [ 35] and CuCo 2O 4. We can regard Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 as a composite of NiCo 2O 4 and CuCo 2O 4 [ 36]. The peak at 25° for anode materials is attributed to the disorderedly stacked carbon, derived from incomplete decomposition of organic ingredients [ 37]. There is a small peak in NiCo 2O 4 at 44° indexing as NiO (JCPDS NO. 65-2901), which is also found in previous literature [ 38]. The peak at 33° for CuCo 2O 4 may be indexed as CuO (JCPDS NO. 44-0706). According to the Scherer’s formula, the average crystal size of a material can be calculated [ 39, 40],  (1)D=0.89λ/(βcosθ) where  D is the average gain size, λ is X-ray wavelength and constant of 0.154 nm, β is half-height width of diffraction peak, and θ is Bragg diffraction angle. The average crystalline sizes of NiCo 2O 4 and CuCo 2O 4 are 16.5, and 24.9 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, that of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 is 18.0 nm, which is between 16.5 nm and 24.9 nm, indicating that the formation of composite of NiCo 2O 4 and CuCo 2O 4 will not result in a pronounced change in crystalline size. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are used to observe the morphology and structures of materials, as shown in  Figure 2. Apparently, the samples of the NiCo 2O 4 and Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 consist of nanowires with an average diameter of ca. 50 nm. Interestingly, all these nanowires are assembled by small nanoparticles. The structure of CuCo 2O 4 is nanoparticles with an average diameter of ca. 30 nm. The TEM images of three anode materials in  Figure 3, present the inner structures for NiCo 2O 4, Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4, and CuCo 2O 4. The anode materials are solid instead of hollow. Besides, inner structure of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 is similar with NiCo 2O 4 rather than CuCo 2O 4.  Figure 3g is high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of the Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4. The lattice spacing of ca. 0.23 nm, 0.2 nm, 0.28 nm, and 0.24 nm can be seen, corresponding to the crystal surfaces (222), (400), (220), and (311) planes of cubic spinel Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4. Element mapping of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 is measured in  Figure 4. The elements of Co, Ni, Cu, and O can be found in the mapping picture, indicating that these elements are uniformly distributed. The result of ICP measure shows the ratio of Cu, Ni, and Co is 0.61:0.41:1.99, which are well match with the designed values. In order to investigate the elements and chemical states on the surface of the anode materials, XPS analysis is carried out and the results are shown in  Figure 5. In the XPS survey spectrum of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 ( Figure 5c), the signals of elements of Co, Ni, and Cu can be observed, which was different from those of NiCo 2O 4 and CuCo 2O 4 ( Figure 5a,b), as the former has both Cu and Ni elements, and the three transition elements Cu, Ni, and Co will affect the outer electronic structure of each other. As shown in  Figure 5a,b, no signal of Ni is found in CuCo 2O 4, while the Cu signal was absent in NiCo 2O 4, which are as expected.  Figure 5d–f is the Ni 2p, Cu 2p, and Co 2p spectrum of the anode materials, respectively. There are six peaks in Ni 2p spectrum for NiCo 2O 4 and Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4. The peaks are at 854.2 eV and 871.5 eV of Ni 2+, and 855.8 eV and 872.8 eV of Ni 3+ for Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4. Comparing to the peaks for NiCo 2O 4, binding energy of Ni 2p for Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 are stronger. The peak areas mean the relative content of element valence. It’s noted that the peak area of them is various, which shows the relative content of Ni 2+ is lower in Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4. It indicates the amount of Ni 2+ decreases in the presence of Cu 2+. There are four peaks in Cu 2p spectrum for CuCo 2O 4 and Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4, indicating copper is divalent. Six peaks of Co 2p for the three materials can be found, manifesting the cobalt is trivalent and divalent. Similar, binding energy of Cu 2p, Co 2p for Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 are stronger than CuCo 2O 4, and NiCo 2O 4, respectively. The peak positions are corresponding to previous reports [ 32, 39, 41], indicating that Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 is prepared successfully and Cu 2+ reduces the content of Ni 2+. The electron density of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 in the outermost shell is affected by doping elements. Transition metal oxides undergo a conversion reaction in the lithiation, with the change in metal valence and the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and Li 2O [ 3].  Figure 6 shows the CV test of NiCo 2O 4, CuCo 2O 4, and Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 anode electrodes for the first three curves at a scan of 0.2 mV s −1 between 0.01 and 3 V. For the NiCo 2O 4 anode material, during the first scan, the main cathodic peaks locate in 0.7 V corresponding to the reduction of NiCo 2O 4 to metallic Ni and Co (Equation (2)), and the broad peaks at ca. 0.37 V corresponds to SEI layer [ 42]. The anode peaks are at the 1.63 V and 2.3 V, corresponding to oxidation of metallic Ni 0 to Ni 2+ and Co to Co 3+, respectively. (Equations (5), (7) and (8)). For the CuCo 2O 4, during the initial scan, the main cathodic peaks locate in 0.75 V, corresponding to the reduction of CuCo 2O 4 to metallic Cu and Co (Equation (3)). It is mentioned that there are two peaks at ~0.5 V and ~0.6 V, revealing formation of SEI layer. The anode peaks were at the 1.1 V, 1.5 V and 2.2 V, corresponding to oxidation of metallic Cu and Co to CuCo 2O 4 (Equations (6), (7) and (8), respectively). For Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4, during the first scan, the main cathodic peaks locate in 1.2 V and 0.8 V, assigning to reduction of metal oxide and formation of SEI film (Equation (4)). The anode peaks are at the 1.63 V and 2.3 V, corresponding to oxidation of metallic Ni, Cu and Co to Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 (Equations (5)–(8)). At the same time, the peaks of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 are narrower and stronger than those of NiCo 2O 4 and CuCo 2O 4. This can be due to co-work of Co, Cu, and Ni, which stabilizes the structure and enhance the electronic conductivity in the process of electrochemical reaction, resulting in a longer cycle life and a lower potential polarization. The different positions of the peaks reveal that the REDOX potential can be changed slightly by composition and content of metal oxide in the chemical reaction. The first cathodic scan of the three anode materials, in addition to the reduction of metals, the formation of SEI film and Li 2O were occurred, so the second anode scan is quite different from the first one [ 43, 44]. While, the second cycle anode scan of the three materials is roughly the same as the first cycle, demonstrating good cycle performance. The total reaction equations during charging and discharging are described as following: (2)NiCo2O4+8Li++8e−→Ni+2Co+4Li2O(3)CuCo2O4+8Li++8e−→Cu+2Cu+4Li2O(4)Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4+8Li++8e−→0.6Cu+0.4Ni+2Co+4Li2O(5)Ni+Li2O→NiO+2Li++2e−(6)Cu+Li2O→CuO+2Li++2e−(7)Co+Li2O→CoO+2Li++2e−(8)CoO+1/3Li2O→1/3Co3O4+2/3Li++2/3e− Figure 7 shows specific capacities of the NiCo 2O 4, CuCo 2O 4, Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 at the current density of 50 mA g −1 between 0.01 and 3 V (vs. Li +/Li). The first discharge specific capacities of NiCo 2O 4, CuCo 2O 4, and Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 are 950, 901, and 1120 mAh g −1, respectively ( Figure 7a). The first charge specific capacities of NiCo 2O 4, CuCo 2O 4, and Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 are 785, 633, and 972 mAh g −1, there are large specific capacity losses in the first charge/discharge cycle. We attribute them to some irreversible electrochemical reactions, including the SEI film formation, electrolyte decomposition, and so on. This phenomenon can be observed for most anode materials, which leads to the low coulombic efficiency in the first cycle and explains a large difference in the peak position of the reduction peak between the first and the second cycles in the CV test. The NiCo 2O 4 electrode shows a specific discharge capacity of 743 mAh g −1 in second cycle, and the specific capacity declines to 245 mAh g −1 after 50 cycles. The CuCo 2O 4 electrode shows a specific discharge capacity of 690 mAh g −1 at the second cycle, while the specific capacity is attenuated to 375 mAh g −1 after 50 cycles. The Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4, which can be regarded as a compound of CuCo 2O 4 and NiCo 2O 4, exhibits the excellent electrochemical performance. The specific discharge capacity of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 is maintained 880 mAh g −1 from the second to the fiftieth cycle, and the coulombic efficiency close to 100%. As shown in  Figure 7b, the change of the specific capacity of the three samples with the number of cycles is clearly visible. The capacities of NiCo 2O 4 and CuCo 2O 4 material go through a huge decay after 20 cycles, which is due to material pulverization. Meanwhile, Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4′s capacity has been well-maintained. The electrochemical stability is significantly improved because of better electronic conductivity of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 and the synergistic effect of the elements. Due to the various insertion voltages for the metal oxides, the other inactive metal oxides can be “volume-buffering reservoir” to release volume stress when the active metal oxide is in a lithiation/delithiation process at a certain voltage [ 45]. The capacity rate performance of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 was also studied and the results are showed in  Figure 7c. The charge/discharge current density gradually increases to 2000 mA g −1 and then returns to 50 mA g −1. The charge-discharge voltage platform was found to be almost kept same. The stable reversible discharge capacities decrease from 830 to 150 mAh g −1 as the current density increases from 200 mA g −1 to 2000 mA g −1. Furthermore, when the current density is restored to 50 mA g −1, the discharge capacity is 780 mAh g −1, which is ca. 88% of the initial discharge capacity. These results demonstrate that the Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 has a better rate performance and a higher cycling stability. To further compare the properties of the materials and the modification effects. The charge transfer behaviors of NiCo 2O 4, CuCo 2O 4, and Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 are measured according to electrochemical impedance spectroscopies (EIS). The Nyquist plots of the electrodes, with frequency range between 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz are shown in  Figure 8. All plots make up a semicircle and a sloped line, the fitting circuit is shown insert. In the high intermediate frequency region, the diameter of the semicircle indicates charge transfer resistance ( R  ct) in the interface between the electrolyte and grains of active material [ 46]. It is easy to see that the diameter of the semicircle of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 is much smaller than the diameter of NiCo 2O 4 and CuCo 2O 4. The electron transfer resistance of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 (120 Ω) is less than of NiCo 2O 4 (300 Ω) and CuCo 2O 4 (380 Ω), which shows Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 sample has the lowest charge-transfer resistance. The low-frequency line stands for the Warburg resistance (Wo) related to the lithium ions diffusion in electrode materials. The line slope of Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 is larger than of NiCo 2O 4 and CuCo 2O 4, indicating faster solid-state diffusion of lithium ion is in the Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4. This evidence further proves that Cu 0.6Ni 0.4Co 2O 4 has better electrochemical performance and lower charge transfer resistance due to co-work of Cu 2+, Ni 2+/Ni 3+ and Co 2+/Co 3+.",NaN,NaN,"['NiCo', 'CuCo', 'Figure', 'peaks', 'anode materials', 'anode', 'peak', 'materials', 'anode peaks', 'capacity']"

Two broad peaks at about 26° and 44° can be clearly found. The broad peak at 26° is ascribed to the (002) crystal plane of graphite (JCPDS No. 65-6212), while the peak around 44° relates to the (100) crystal plane of sp 2-hybridized carbon [ 35, 36, 37]. These results demonstrate that the as-prepared HPC possess a graphitic structure [ 38, 39, 40].  Figure 2b presents Raman spectroscopy of the HPC material. Two peaks at ~1342 cm −1 and ~1599 cm −1 correspond to the D band and G band, respectively [ 30, 31]. The D band represents defect and disorder [ 41, 42], while the G band corresponds to the existence of SP 2-hybridized carbon [ 43]. The intensity ratio of D to G is 1.0, which suggests that the HPC possesses a large number of defects and good electrical conductivity [ 44, 45]. These characteristics are good for electron transfer and rate performance [ 46]. In order to evaluate the specific surface area and porosity of the HPC, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore size distributions curves were measured and shown in  Figure 2c,d, respectively. As shown in  Figure 2c, the curve displays a typical type-IV adsorption-desorption isotherm with a type-H4 hysteresis loop [ 38], demonstrating the existence of both micropores and mesopores. A relatively high specific surface area of ~1714.83 m 2 g −1 and a big pore volume (~1.13 cm 3 g −1) are obtained based on the BET test. These data are much greater than those of other biomass carbon material [ 26, 27, 28, 38]. It can be seen from  Figure 2d that the pore sizes of the HPC mainly distribute between 2 and 5 nm, presenting obvious mesoporous characteristics. These mesopores, as second-class pores, together with the first-class pores (macropores, ~70 nm), form a hierarchically porous structure. The large specific surface area makes the electrolyte–electrode interface large enough to accumulate rich charges and ions [ 47, 48]. Moreover, the hierarchically porous structure can provide a fast channel for the migration of Li ions and electrons and provides enough space for the volume expansion/contraction during cycling to obtain a stable Li storage [ 49]. Figure 3a shows a SEM image of the HPC. It is clearly shown that the HPC exhibits a typically porous structure with rich macropores (a few hundred nanometers in diameter).  Figure 3b–e presents TEM images of the HPC. A large number of pores (tens to hundreds of nanometers in diameter) can be found in  Figure 3b,c, forming the first class pores. Plenty of mesopores with a diameter of a few nanometers can be seen in  Figure 3d, constituting the second-class pores. In this situation, a hierarchical porous structure containing the first-class pores (macropores) and the second-class pores (mesopores) is successfully obtained. This result is coincidence with the pore size distribution result ( Figure 2d). Furthermore, the lattice fringe spacing of 0.36 nm marked in  Figure 3e is consistent with the (002) planes of the graphite (JCPDS No. 65-6212), corresponding well with the XRD result. CV curves ( Figure 4a) towards the HPC anode were measured at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s −1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V. A broad reduction peak is found in the first cycle, suggesting the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film on the HPC electrode surface [ 50]. An obvious cathodic peak between 0.01 and 2.0 V can be found, corresponding to reversible insertion of lithium into the carbon layers and nanopores [ 51]. The intensity of the above cathodic peak in the first loop is much higher than that of the rest, which may be due to the formation of the SEI, the electrolyte decomposition, and the irreversible insertion of Li + into special sites of carbon material [ 52].  Figure 4b shows the discharge and charge curves from the 1st to 100th cycle of the HPC anode under a current density of 100 mA g −1 in a voltage range of 0.01–3 V. The HPC anode presents the 1st discharge and charge capacities of 1062.5 and 649.2 mAh g −1, respectively. The primary coulombic efficiency of HPC anode is about 61.1%. The irreversible capacity loss could be attributed to the formation of SEI, the irreversible lithium-ion intercalation on the new-formed surfaces, and even disordered carbon binder [ 53, 54, 55, 56]. In the first discharge curve, a plateau is found at about 0.5 V and then disappears in the subsequent discharge curves. This phenomenon is also in line with the CV result. The discharge and charge capacities of the 2nd cycle are 662.5 and 641.7 mAh g −1, respectively, and the coulombic efficiency increases to 97.7%. Compared with the 50th and 100th discharge and charge curves, they almost overlap with each other, showing an outstanding cycling stability.  The rate property of the HPC anode is shown in  Figure 5a. Reversible capacities of 604, 512, 399, 279, and 175 mAh g −1 are achieved at different current densities from 100 to 2000 mA g −1. When the current density comes back to 100 mA g −1, the specific capacity returns to 460 mAh g −1, revealing a goodish rate performance. To further improve the rate performance, some previous reported methods, including nitrogen/phosphorus doping, conductive metal doping, and forming a three-dimensional conductive cross-linked carbon network, can be adopted [ 29, 57, 58, 59]. The related work can be carried out in the future. The HPC electrode also exhibits good cycling performances ( Figure 5b). When cycled for 50 cycles, the reversible capacity of the HPC anode reaches 593.4 mAh g −1. After cycling for 100 cycles, the reversible capacity of the HPC anode can be stabilized at 581.2 mAh g −1. Even cycling at a high current density of 1000 mA g −1, the HPC anode shows a discharge capacity around 300 mAh g −1 invariably, revealing an outstanding cycling stability. After 1000 cycles, a reversible capacity of 298.5 mAh g −1 still remains ( Figure 5c). The good rate and cycling performance could be ascribed to the unique hierarchical porous structure of the biomass carbon material. Figure 6a displays the EIS of the HPC anodes before and after cycling at 1000 mA g −1 for 1000 cycles. The semicircles in the high-frequency region are contact with the interface charge-transfer process, and the straight lines in the low-frequency region correspond to the Warburg diffusion inner the networks [ 48, 49]. It can be found that the semicircle of the electrode becomes smaller and that the slope of the straight line becomes larger after 1000 cycles, which is due to the dissolution and redistribution of the active material. The SEM image of the HPC anode after 1000 discharge/charge cycles at 1000 mA g −1 is shown in  Figure 6b. Many macropores maintain their initial shapes and sizes after cycling at such a high current density, which is favourable for obtaining good cycling stability.  Figure 6c,d presents digital photographs of a yellow light emitting diode (LED) bulb propelled by an HPC half battery. The bulb darkens gradually. After 5 min, the brightness of the LED bulb decreases obviously compared with its initial state, while the bulb still can work. Table 1 [ 27, 28, 38, 44, 45, 46, 53, 60, 61, 62] compares the electrochemical performance of the current study with the previously reported works. It can be seen that the electrochemical performance of the HPC anode is superior to most of reported biomass-based carbon materials. The outstanding electrochemical property can be ascribed to the following aspects. Firstly, the HPC with high specific surface area can make the electrolyte–electrode interface large enough to accumulate rich charges and ions. In addition, it also can provide large contact area and mutual interactions between the electrolyte and active materials. Secondly, the first-class pores in the hierarchically porous structure can relieve the volume change during the cycling procedure while the second-class pores can provide rich and fast paths for the transfer of ions and electrons. Thirdly, the value of I D/I G is 1.0, indicating that the materials contain both defects and good electrical conductivity. The defects are good for electron transfer, and the great electrical conductivity is beneficial to improve the rate property of the battery. Based on the above discussions, we can conclude that the HPC synthesized from biomass material in this study has great potential as anodes for LIBs. Moreover, this paper also provides us a new proposal for the fabrication of low-cost carbon-based anode materials, and the route is expected to be extended and applied to various biomasses in future.",NaN,NaN,"['HPC anode', 'HPC', 'Figure', 'anode', 'HPC electrode', 'cycling', 'pores', 'HPC anodes', 'porous structure', 'carbon']"

Results and Discussion The X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted to substantiate the structural attribute of the samples. As shown in  Figure 2a, the B-SFO@C and B-SFO samples exhibit the analogous XRD patterns. The diffraction peaks could be assigned to both the tetragonal SnO 2 (JCPDS card No. 41-1445) and the rhombohedral Fe 2O 3 (JCPDS card No. 33-0664), manifesting that the successful generation of SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3. In addition, the diffraction peaks indexed to Fe 2O 3 vanish in B-SO@C, evidencing that the Fe 2O 3 phase has been eliminated after etching using the oxalic acid solution. The surface electronic structure and chemical element valance state of B-SFO@C was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The survey spectrum ( Figure 2b) corroborates existence of C, Sn, Fe, and O. Two predominant strong peaks are monitored at 487.4 and 495.9 eV, corresponding to the Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 for Sn 4+ in the Sn 3d core emission ( Figure 2c), respectively, which indicates the presence of Sn 4+ in B-SFO@C [ 22]. Meanwhile, the XPS spectrum of Fe 2p ( Figure 2d) can be deconvoluted into two envelopes at 711.3 eV and 716.3 eV. These two bands should be assigned to the Fe 3+ 2p 3/2 and Fe 4+ 3p 3/2, respectively, which implies the coexistence of Sn 4+ and Fe 3+ in B-SFO@C [ 23]. The C 1s signal ( Figure S1) can be fitted into three peaks, responsible for the C–C/C=C (284.6 eV), C–O (286.0 eV) and C=O (288.6 eV) [ 24]. Noteworthily, the weight fractions of SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3 calculated from XPS are considerably lower than those computed from the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP) as shown in  Table S1, elucidating that most of SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3 nanoparticles are located inside carbon matrix to yield a metal oxide nanoparticle-intercalated carbon structure. Such preferential in-carbon-lattice enrichment can also be validated by TEM images ( Figure 3c,d). Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was carried out to further quantify the carbon content in B-SFO@C ( Figure S2) and the final carbon content is approximately 32%. In other words, the overall metal or/and metal oxide percentage is as high as 68%, suggesting a high metal loading density. Raman spectrum of B-SFO@C ( Figure S3) illuminates that the intensity ratio between D-band and G-band (I D/I G) is as high as 0.98, indicating that the carbon in B-SFO@C is amorphous [ 25]. The relatively low graphitization can ensue from the low pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C. The micromorphology of B-SFO@C was determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements ( Figure 3a). Clearly, the B-SFO@C sample presents a dense bulk structure with a size ranging from 10 up to 20 μm, indicating that the xerogels frameworks were effectively stabilized and maintained during oxygen-lean pyrolysis. A close inspection of the magnified SEM image ( Figure 3b) unveils that the surface of the monolithic B-SFO@C is constituted of closely packed fine particles, with only an extremely small number of pores/voids. In addition, the element mapping images ( Figure S4) reveal the uniform spatial distribution of C, O, Sn, and Fe elements throughout the whole framework of B-SFO@C. The tap density of B-SFO@C measured using the tap density tester is about 0.71 g cm −3—higher than that of various nanosized SnO 2-based composites (about 0.4 g cm −3) reported previously [ 26, 27]. Such high tap density will become largely useful to facilitate homogenous slurry mixing and heighten the energy density and volumetric performance. The N 2 volumetry ( Figure S5) displays that the BET surface area of B-SFO@C is only 12.3 m 2 g −1, which is one order of magnitude lower than a variety of the nanosized SnO 2-based composites (>100 m 2 g −1) recorded before [ 24, 28]. Such textural feature again signifies a compact structure of B-SFO@C, in good consistency with SEM pictures ( Figure 3a,b). Besides, the B-SO@C and B-SFO samples also demonstrate the similar bulk structure ( Figure S6a,b). However, the surface of B-SFO ( Figure S6c) is rougher than that of B-SFO@C and is made up of many particles with a size of 100–200 nm. The morphology disparity between B-SFO@C and B-SFO is due to the fact that the carbon matrix can serve as the strong spacer to effectively encumber the agglomeration, growth, and coarsening of metal oxide particles during pyrolysis. Detailed microstructures of B-SFO@C can be further analysed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In  Figure 3c, a high density of dark spots as metal nanoparticles are closely and homogeneously distributed in the carbon matrix. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern ( Figure 3c inset) shows the bright polycrystalline diffraction rings of SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3 [ 29]. The magnified TEM image ( Figure S7) further reveals that the ultra-small nanoparticles with a size of about 5 nm are evenly implanted within the interiors of the carbon framework, giving rise to a unique metal particles-in-carbon sandwich-like configuration. In addition, as shown in  Figure 3d, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) sheds light on two sets of the well-defined crystal lattice fringes with the interplanar distances of 0.33 nm and 0.27 nm, pertinent to the (110) facet of SnO 2 and (104) facet of Fe 2O 3, respectively. Besides, a clear monolithic contour with no well-observable porosity (including mesopores and macropores) occurs in the TEM images ( Figure 3c,d), again proving non-porous/compact structural motifs. The vermiculate domains tightly around dark spots (metal nanoparticles) with the poorly visible lattice lines can be indexed as amorphous carbon layers, in good consistency with the noncrystalline characteristics revealed by the XRD and Raman analysis. According to the previous rationale that stress can be assuaged through downscaling towards the nanometre, a dimension threshold to cause the expansion and spread of fracture in the materials has been proven to be roughly 150 nm [ 30, 31, 32]. Aa a result, multitudinous exquisite morphological engineering toward highly hierarchical structures have been under study, to fulfil the Sn stress relaxation during the lithiation process. For instance, the marked boosts of long-cycle stability have come true by exploiting the sub-10-nm-sized Sn/SnO 2-based nanoparticles encapsulated inside the nitrogen/phosphorus co-doped hierarchically porous carbon and reduced graphene oxides [ 14], a mesoporous carbon@SnO 2@ carbon hollow nanosphere with dual shells [ 33], the Sn-SnO 2 hybrid nanoclusters embedded inside carbon nanotubes [ 34], the heterostructured SnS-ZnS@C hollow nanoboxes embedded in the graphene [ 35], the carbon-coated SnO 2–CoO yolk–shell microspheres [ 36], the double shell micro-cube assembled by nanosized Co 3Sn 2/SnO 2 heterostructures with amorphous carbon layers wrapped inside the three-dimensional graphene matrix [ 37], a mixture of porous hollow SnO 2 nanocube and graphene aerogel [ 38], the novel honeycomb-like composite composing of the carbon encapsulated SnO 2 nanospheres embedded in the carbon film [ 39], the sandwich-like C@SnO 2/Sn/void@C hollow spheres [ 40], the carambola-shaped SnO 2 wrapped within the carbon nanotube network [ 41], the core-shell structured Cu 6Sn 5@SnO 2-C nanocomposites [ 42], the chestnut-like SnO 2/SnO 2/C nanocomposites with the hierarchical structures [ 43], and the ultrafine SnO 2 aggregates in interior of porous carbon nanotubes [ 44]. Disappointingly, the realistic usage of such examples has been hampered by the small tap density [ 26, 27] of the hierarchical layouts, as a consequence of the existence of empty room/volume and other topological problems. Worse still, to secure the empty rooms will deprive the materials of vital virtues during the tight calendaring in that majority of empty volume might undergo the utter devastation. Herein, the tap density increases through constructing a compact secondary architecture featuring the inactive/active buffers by composites. Confining a high population of the ultrafine metal nanoparticles inside the bulk-like carbon monolith can not only modulate the stress but also obviate a great deal of void space and, therefore, the related morphological problems. In this sense, such a binary metal oxide nanoparticles-intercalated carbon monolith structure is concluded to be more amenable to traditional electrode preparation than other designer nanomaterials, particularly taking into account the real-world utilization based upon the high average energy/power density rating. As for LIBs, this material is projected to be distinguished by an elevated specific capacity, endurable cyclic behaviour, and oppressed volume swelling; thus, a small irreversible capacity loss and a resultant high capacity retention. The CV curves of the B-SFO@C electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s −1 from 0.005 up to 3.0 V were shown in  Figure 4a. The reaction between B-SFO@C and lithium occurs in three domains from 0.7 to 1.41 V, with the three regions very analogous to the ones identified for other Sn-based materials, for example, SnO 2/C, Co 3Sn 2/SnO 2, and SnS-ZnS@C. Thus, the peaks emerging at 1.41 V, 0.77 V and < 0.7 V in the first cathodic scan process can deal with conversion reaction of SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3, formation of SEI film and alloying process of Li + inserting into Sn, respectively [ 45, 46]. In the subsequent anodic scan process, the strong peaks at 0.59 V and the weak peak at 1.89 V originate from the dealloying event of Li xSn to Sn and the oxidation of Fe to Fe 2O 3, respectively. The peak occurring around 1.3 V is assumed to be reversible conversion reaction of Sn to SnO 2 although the conversion reaction of SnO 2 is universally deemed irreversible [ 47]. To set forth the chemical valence state of Sn-based oxides at a full-charged state, the XPS was conducted ( Figure 4b). The XPS spectrum of the Sn 3d core shell can be partitioned into four main peaks. The ones at 487.4 and 495.9 eV belong to the 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 for Sn 4+, respectively. The signals at 486.7 and 495.2 eV match with the 3d 5/2 and 3d 3/2 for Sn(0), respectively, supporting the fact that the metallic Sn phase was indeed oxidized to SnO 2. In addition, the SAED pattern of the full-charged B-SFO@C electrode ( Figure 4c) clearly demonstrates the diffraction rings attributable to SnO 2, Sn and Fe 2O 3, while the HRTEM image ( Figure 4d) reveals the characteristic crystal lattice stripes of SnO 2, Sn and Fe 2O 3. This further indicates the coexistence of SnO 2 and Sn. The supra results doubtless suggest the reversible conversion reaction between Sn and SnO 2. The most recent reports have also postulated that metallic nanoparticles such as Fe, Co and Mn can work as a trigger or catalyst to trigger off the decomposition of Li 2O, thereby conducive to the reversible generation of SnO 2 [ 48]. The different oxidation potentials of Sn to SnO 2 and Fe to Fe 2O 3 in B-SFO@C allow the Fe phases produced from the conversion reaction of Fe 2O 3 to call into play the unique role of such triggers or catalysts. Therefore, the electrochemical reactions of the B-SFO@C electrode during cycling can be described as follows: SnO  2 + 4Li  + + 4e  − ↔ Sn + 2Li  2O  (1)Sn +   xLi  + +   xe  − ↔ Li  xSn (0 ≤   x ≤ 4.4)  (2)Fe  2O  3 + 6Li  + + 6e  − ↔ 2Fe + 3Li  2O  (3) Galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles of B-SFO@C, B-SO@C and B-SFO electrodes at 0.2 A g −1 between 0.005–3.0 V are shown in  Figure 5a to probe the favourable bulk or micro-dimensional effect of the metal-intercalated carbon structure upon battery performance. In comparison to the B-SO@C electrode, the B-SFO@C electrode features a more obvious charge plateau in the range of 1.0–1.5 V, hinting that reversibility of the conversion reaction of Sn/SnO 2 in the B-SFO@C electrode is superior to that of the B-SO@C electrode. This also reveals the vital impacts which the Fe component exerts upon manipulating the electrochemical features of SnO 2-based materials. The initial discharge/charge capacity of B-SFO@C, B-SO@C and B-SFO electrodes reaches 1389/973, 1103/662 and 1353/842 mAh g −1, respectively, with corresponding initial Coulombic efficiencies (ICE) of 70%, 60% and 62%. Strikingly, the ICE of the B-SFO@C electrode here exceeds not only the values of B-SO@C and B-SFO electrodes, but also the counterparts of many elaborated nanosized SnO 2-based composite anodes (45–55%) recorded to date [ 26, 49, 50]. The central reason behind the high ICE of the B-SFO@C electrode is that the irreversible capacity loss engendered by both the formation of SEI film and by the irreversible conversion chemistry of SnO 2 is pronouncedly weakened. In other words, the much smaller ICE of B-SO@C and B-SFO correlate with the absence of the binary intercalation structure, which leads to the production of irreversible phases of Li 2O and Li xSn components in the lithiation event. Besides, the inherently poor electrical conductivity of single metal Sn phases induces the relatively unsatisfactory initial discharge/charge capacities. Such disadvantage can be addressed via introducing the second component of Fe (irrespective of carbon skeleton), which remarkably enhances both the ion access to and the electron conveyance along the electroactive materials. The kinetics of the B-SFO@C, B-SO@C and B-SFO electrodes were evaluated over a varying range of current densities between 0.2 and 3.2 A g −1, and B-SFO@C features the attractive bulk rate capability in standard electrode formulations. As seen in  Figure 5c, the average discharge capacities of B-SFO@C at 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 A g −1 amount to 958, 890, and 774 mAh g −1, respectively. Thus, roughly 5.60~4.53 Li +/TM (TM means transition metal) can be reversibly intercalated to deliver energy, while B-SFO@C sustains a capacity of 3.71 Li +/TM, despite a gain in rate by a factor of eight. At 3.2 A g −1, which means a rate enhancement by 16 folds, it still remains probable to swap 2.70 Li +/TM and access 462 mAh g −1. For the sake of checking the rate behaviour in more rigorous environments, immediately after being assessed at 3.2 A g −1, the current density reverts to 0.2 A g −1, at which the test was cycled over 50 runs. In such circumstances, 4.46 Li +/TM (around 762 mAh g −1) can get reversibly inserted, with a 4.82 Li +/TM exchanged for a reactivated/settled capacity of 825 mAh g −1 after 40 consecutive cycles. The rate behavior in the binary metal-in-carbon configuration exceeds a variety of anode materials and even keeps abreast with some lithium solid electrolytes. The high rate capability inherently correlates with the excellent mobility/transport of lithium ions in the composite under diverse current densities. In this sense, the rate outcomes suggest that the speedy lithium ion motion can be achieved to the large lithium contents (up to 2.7 Li +/TM). Supposing the further optimization of this binary metal-inserted carbon structure, its intrinsic scope for the high-rate multi-redox chemistry will escalate up to a much greater level of Li +/TM. The finding that the micrometer-sized monolith of the binary metal-intercalated carbon composite (B-SFO@C) shows extraordinary rate behavior and could be cycled under the very elevated rates unravels the superior structural resilience, particularly given its good electrolyte infiltration and the short Li +/electron diffusion length. By contrast, the exceptional lithium storage properties cannot be detected for the other two composites with different chemical compositions and structural motifs. B-SO@C attains an average capacity of 663, 580, 474, 338 and 190 mAh g −1 at 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 A g −1, respectively, convincingly uncovering that the iron component takes an essential part in enhancing the discharge capacities. The B-SFO electrode confers an average capacity of 588, 282 and 138 mAh g −1 under 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 A g −1, respectively, and is even hardly discharged to store Li ions at 1.6 and 3.2 A g −1, which reveals a very poor rate ability. The rather similar capacity at the low current density and the increasing gulf at high current density between these electrodes justifiably unveil the primary role which the carbon skeleton plays in improving the lithium diffusion. That is to say, regardless of a single or binary metal system, the carbon matrix is in high demand for attaining the elevated capacity retention, though a small discharge capacity occurs to B-SO@C. The vivid performance comparison above univocally denotes the indispensable implications that both the carbon framework and iron phase have upon tuning the lithium ion storage process. Put another way, the intercalation of binary metals inside a carbonaceous bulk matrix can result in a good integration of the innate functions of the respective entities in the nanoscale, in a manner which produces the novel composite materials for optimizing the insertion of lithium ions at broad rate loading. In addition, the long-term cycling performances of the B-SFO@C, B-SO@C and B-SFO electrodes were appraised at 0.2 A g −1 ( Figure 5b). The B-SFO@C electrode can maintain a very stable and high capacity of 927 mAh g −1 with a sustainable retention of 95.1% even after 100 cycles, indicating an exceptional cyclic lifetime. Note that, though the ICE of B-SFO@C is relatively low, the coulombic efficiency can rapidly increase to 92% in the second cycle and can remain over 98% in subsequent runs. However, both the B-SFO and B-SO@C electrodes only give the decaying cycling performance over 100 cycles with a capacity of 51 and 488 mAh g −1, respectively, concomitant with a corresponding retention of merely 6% and 68.4%. The pure carbon matrix delivers a constant but low capacity of 232 mAh g −1 after 50 cycles ( Figure S8), whereas the carbon-free B-SFO sample abruptly deteriorates from roughly 800 to 200 mAh g −1 during first 30 cycles, confirming that the carbon substrate does matter to the structural tolerance and thin/stable SEI layer during cycling. It must be accentuated that the reversible capacity and capacity retention of the B-SFO@C electrode significantly outnumber B-SO@C, which is due to the fact that the divergent electroactive potentials of SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3 in the B-SFO@C electrode can permit the Fe 2O 3 nanocrystals to not only act as active materials, but also to serve as structural stabilizers [ 51], and simultaneously enable the amelioration of the reversibility of the conversion reactions of Sn/SnO 2 in the B-SFO@C electrode to contribute an extra capacity. Specifically speaking, the large work function difference between SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3 can make the lattice of the SnO 2/Fe 2O 3 composite adapt suitably, inducing the construction of a relatively big internal electric field. Such an in-built electric field is able to introduce an additional electromotive force to augment the electronic mobility of the active materials and, finally, strikingly enhance reaction dynamics and ionic/electronic transportation/migration at the interior hetero-interfaces of SnO 2/Fe 2O 3. Actually, TEM and HRTEM have clearly identified the intimately and uniformly packed metal oxide/metal oxide nanoparticles and typical carbon layers. Abundant robust hetero-junctions and -interface boundaries arising from a lattice adaptation between SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3 phase must occur. When such heterostructures come into being between SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3, the electrons will drift to the Fe 2O 3 nanoparticles possessing the greater work function from the SnO 2 (a lower work function), triggering off a positive space charge region on the Fe 2O 3 side and a negative space charge region on the SnO 2 side of the SnO 2/Fe 3O 2 hetero-interfaces. Thus, the built-in electric field takes place around the junction region and the direction is pointed from Fe 2O 3 to SnO 2. This is the identical direction to the electric field of the initial battery, which underlies the gain of the electromotive force of the lithium battery. Furthermore, the long-term high-rate cycling test of the B-SFO@C electrode even at an extremely great current density of 1 and 3 A g −1 can still sustain a nearly invariable lithium ion storage behavior, further showing an outstanding high-rate cyclic lifespan ( Figure 5d,e). Note that an activation at low current density of 0.2 A g −1 was introduced to in advance complete the formation of the unvaried SEI film. The B-SFO@C electrode can afford a reversible capacity of 701 mAh g −1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g −1 and stores an ultra-stable capacity of 429 mAh g −1 even after 1800 cycles at 3 A g −1. The electrochemical performances of the B-SFO@C electrode are compared to the SnO 2-based anode materials published previously ( Table S2). It can be unequivocally disclosed that B-SFO@C can ascend into the first echelon of the cutting-edge SnO 2 based materials, showing that B-SFO@C can vie as the very promising anode material candidate for LIBs. Besides, considering that the (de)alloying reaction that incurs the volume change proceeds mainly below 1 V, the B-SFO@C electrode was purposely measured at 0.2 A g −1 in the range of 0.005–1.0 V to trace the morphological variation and the corresponding results ( Figure S9) demonstrate the superb cyclic durability with a steady capacity of 343 mAh g −1 after 150 cycles. This confirms that capacity fading caused by volume change has been largely alleviated. The electrochemical lithiation must lead the interface boundaries between the Li-enriched Li xSn and Sn phases to come into being and resultantly trigger off the stress reinforcement, whilst the gain in the strain energy induces the anisotropic dilation/expansion and abnormal topological evolutions, thus initiating the dramatic mechanical fracture and breakage [ 30, 31, 32]. The foregoing events can re-expose the fresh Sn surfaces to electrolytes, thereby resulting in an enhancement in the thickness of the SEI layer upon cycling, and a serious battery performance degeneration. Given that these issues are innately related to stress reinforcement, the endeavor towards the stress regulation approach for Sn-based electrode materials constitutes the paramount footing to enhance a cyclic durability. Seeing that the aggressive volume fluctuation inherently stems from the stress intensification over particle surface layers, such superior cycling stability unambiguously emphasizes that the assembly of the unique sandwich metal–carbon bulk structures with the binary small-sized metal oxides uniformly embedded inside carbon layers can effectively manage and relax the strain energy in the large-volume-variation SnO 2 anodes for the high-performance LIBs to fulfill the necessary, extraordinary morphological and structural stability requirements (as further supported by the TEM images after cycling in Figure 7). Without the supra mechanism, the material surface will become rather vulnerable to resisting the stress in the lithiation experience, so inducing a limited capacity retention. What’s worse, a high initial discharge capacity and excellent long-term cyclic durability always fall short of being satisfied synchronously thanks to the compromise nexus between the two of them resting with the surface layer thickness. Nevertheless, in spite of such compromise, B-SFO@C can still split the difference to attain a decent cyclability (with 95.1% capacity retention at 100 cycles) at an elevated capacity of 927 mAh g −1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to further explore reasons for the excellent performance of B-SFO@C.  Figure 6a shows the EIS spectra evolution at different states of charge (SOC) in the first cycle, wherein OCV, D to 0.7 V and C to 3.0 V, for example, represent the open circuit voltage, and discharge to 0.7 V and charge to 3.0 V, respectively. All the spectra were well-fitted utilizing equivalent circuits (as described in inset), and comprised of an x-axis intercept at a high frequency, semicircle at high-medium frequencies and the linear line at lower frequencies, which are representative of overall cell resistance ( R  e), charge transfer resistance ( R  ct) and Warburg impedance, respectively. Combined with the fitted results ( Figure 6b), it can be deduced that during the discharge process  R  ct gradually increases from 31 to 67 Ω as the potential switches from OCV to 0.7 V, which is due to the formation of poor electronic conductivity of Li 2O accompanied by reduction of SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3. Then,  R  ct substantially increases from 67 to 101 Ω when the potential further dwindles to 0.005 V, which should have the intimate relation with the poor electronic conductivity of SnLi x in situ produced from the alloying reaction. In the subsequent re-charge process,  R  ct continuously diminishes back to 29 Ω until the end of charging, which indicates that the electrochemical reaction is highly reversible. The trend of  R  ct in the first cycle agrees with prior results [ 52]. Interestingly, an atypical rise takes place to  R  e at 0.005 V ( Figure S10), which could relate to the decline in the electrical contacts sparked off due to the dramatic volume expansion [ 53]. Additionally, the EIS spectra of the B-SFO@C electrode at the different cycles were also depicted in  Figure 6c. Similarly, all the spectra also consist of the  x-axis intercept at the high frequency, half-loop at the high-medium frequencies and the linear line at the lower frequencies. All spectra at the different cycles are very similar except the 10th cycle, implying that over 100 cycles the transfer dynamics can be well retained. Fitted results are provided in  Figure 6d, and  R  ct is 31 Ω for the fresh B-SFO@C electrode, 48 Ω for the fresh B-SO@C electrode but 82 Ω on the fresh B-SFO electrode ( Figure S11). This interprets that the carbon matrix can greatly reinforce the electronic conductivity of B-SFO@C and B-SO@C electrodes, thereby supplying a robust fast electronic connection. The low  R  ct in B-SFO@C is responsible for the exceptional rate capability of the B-SFO@C electrode. To be specific, at the 10th cycle,  R  ct of the B-SFO@C electrode substantially rises to 42.6 Ω, which can closely correlate with the initial structural rearrangement in first cycles that could arise from the SEI thickening or the formation of the segregated granules [ 54, 55]. Subsequently, the  R  ct drops to 27 Ω at the 50th cycle and finally stabilizes at 22 Ω at the 100th cycle, indicating that no appreciable cycling-triggered gain in resistance offers itself. On the one hand, the repeated volume swelling and contraction during cycling make contacts between active materials and carbon matrix closer and closer, which facilitates transfer of electrons from the carbon matrix to the active materials [ 56, 57]. On the other hand, the metallic Sn derived from the irreversible part of conversion reaction of SnO 2 is a good conductor and acts as conductive matrix, which further reduce the  R  ct [ 58]. As the SEI layer thickening can augment resistance, the  R  ct evolution combined with post-characterization ( Figure 7) can reveal that the excellent structural resilience/flexibility of B-SFO@C to maintain textural stability can aid in yielding the stable and thin SEI layer and keeping small resistance in spite of fierce electrochemical events. To further disclose the structural elasticity/robustness, the micro-morphology of B-SFO@C subjected to 500 cycles at 1 A g −1 was further examined by SEM and TEM. As shown in  Figure 7a, the cycled B-SFO@C electrode can still preserve a micron-sized construction well, without any cracks on its surface even if the surface is somewhat distinguished from that of the fresh B-SFO@C electrode. After cycling, the surface becomes smoother and denser, owing to SEI formation. The magnified SEM image ( Figure 7b) indicates no obviously spotted fracturing, aggregation, or pulverization on the electrode surface, which verifies the excellent morphologic stability. Such phenomena ensue from a symmetric and uniform volume variation of the metal phases, further elucidating that the shortcomings of Sn-based materials seem to be fully overcome by a straightforward structuring (namely, embedment of the binary small-sized metal particles into the carbon lamella of a compact monolithic geometry). The microstructural integrity can further be confirmed by TEM image ( Figure 7c), where the metal-in-carbon sandwich structure of constituent particles is retained. That is, the metal nanoparticles are observed to be still well dispersed and intercalated inside carbon layers with no obvious carbon aggregation/fracturing taking place, very similar to the structural motifs revealed by  Figure 3c,d. The size of metal nano-particles is very close to the case in the fresh one, suggesting that the metal particle coarsening can be powerfully inhibited and that the unique intercalation layout is able to strongly protect the metal particles from cracking due to the nonuniform and huge volume evolution over initial cycles. These effects can make sure that the morphologic evolutions will not become increasingly serious over the cycling to circumvent the fracturing/pulverization, thus avoiding both the breakage of the preformed SEI layer and endless SEI amassment upon repeated cycles. Corresponding SAED pattern displays the diffraction rings of Sn; however, no diffraction rings characterizing SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3 are discerned. Nevertheless, the HRTEM image ( Figure 7d) reveals that there are plentiful ultrafine amorphous nanoparticles being detected (noted by red circle) except for the crystalline Sn. On the grounds of the preceding reports [ 59, 60], these ultrafine amorphous nanoparticles may be SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3—which accounts for the absence of diffraction rings of SnO 2 and Fe 2O 3 in SAED pattern. Coupling the electron spectroscopy with the cyclic behavior, the characteristics of the surface and morphological integrity can become manifest in the production of steady and thin SEI layers, bringing forth the improved cyclic performance. In short, in conjunction with the excellent cyclic longevity and rate handling, the morphologic characterization before and after the prolonged cycling can undeniably disclose an extraordinary shape memory effect for the topologically frustrated lattice reorganization during the reduplicative (de)lithiation chemistry, leading the electrode to survive even over long-term cycling, i.e., the intercalation structure permits metals to dilate and constringe without disintegration during cycling. As discussed above, in essence, the transcendent structural and morphologic resilience arises from effective stress management from binary metal nanoparticles-in-carbon structures. Accordingly, we are convinced that although it features the micro-sized dimensionality the binary metal-in-carbon architecture not only acts as a stress relaxation regulator to mitigate the compressive stress of lithiated metal phase but also retains the morphological integrity without any mechanical failure by dwindling the tensile stress intensified to carbon layers, inducing the low electrode expansion effect.",NaN,NaN,"['B-SFO', 'Figure', 'SnO', 'carbon', 'B-SFO electrodes', 'electrode', 'capacity', 'metal', 'carbon matrix', 'carbon layers']"
18,C:\Users\shweata\openDiagram\physchem\liion\PMC7080552\eupmc_result.json,PMC7080552,"2 Results and Discussion 2.1 Characteristics of Li–B–Mg Composite The schematic diagram ( Figure1a) depicts the processing course of the Li–B–Mg composite as well as the Li electrodissolution/electrodeposition behavior during electrochemical cycling. Figure  1b schematically shows the electrodissolution/electrodeposition behavior of pure Li during electrochemical cycling. From Figure  1a it can be noted that the synthesized composite ingot is mainly composed of randomly oriented LiB fiber skeleton that is in situ formed and free Li (Mg solubilizes in Li phase, marked as Li(Mg)). The composite ingot has been densified after rolling and the density of the composite plate is measured to be 0.844 g cm −3. During the rolling process, some LiB fibers may align roughly in parallel along with the rolling direction. When Li is electrochemically dissolved, the skeleton maintains the integrity of the composite anode while in the reverse process it regulates the electrochemical deposition of Li and inhibits dendrite formation. In addition, the introduction of Mg forms Li(Mg) solid solution filled in LiB skeleton. Besides the enhanced affinity to Li and regulation of Li + flux, it could transform into a Li‐deficient phase during Li stripping process and connect the fibers, contributing to the stability of the electrode. In comparison, Figure  1b shows that pure Li foil would experience large volume change and inevitable growth of dendritic Li during electrochemical cycling could occur. The properties of the obtained Li–B–Mg composite have been further characterized. Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows that the Li–B–Mg composite plate has a yellowish metallic sheen color while the pure Li has a silver color.  Figure2a shows the X‐ray powder diffraction (XRD) results of the Li–B–Mg composite, from which three main peaks located at 25.53°, 45.02°, and 52.48° can be assigned to LiB phase (PDF#52‐1033, note that the disappearance of the peak at 40.77° of LiB phase is caused by the rolling process, which is in agreement with previous report. 20). Peaks at 25.53° and 29.36° can be assigned to the tape used for the sample preparation. The remaining three peaks (at 36.16°, 52.08°, and 65.05°) belong to Li(Mg) solid solution (approximately Li 0.98Mg 0.02, for details of the calculation see the Supporting Information). The composite is thus confirmed to be composed of two phases, i.e., the LiB compound and Li(Mg) solid solution. In addition, the mass percent of the LiB in the composite is calculated to be 42.693 wt% (see details in the Supporting Information). Overall, the structure of the obtained Li(Mg) solid solution filled in LiB fibers skeleton is similar to that of pure Li (PDF#15‐0401) which possesses a body‐centered cubic phase. The similarities of the structure between the Li(Mg) solid solution and Li could in theory avoid phase transformation during Li electrodissolution/electrodeposition, which facilitates the structural stability of the obtained Li–B–Mg composite. 21,  22,  23 The 3D LiB skeleton structure was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after soaking the Li–B–Mg composite in naphthalene (10 wt. %)‐containing tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution to dissolve the Li component. 24 Figure S2a (Supporting Information) shows that the remaining 3D plate structure possesses pores of several micros in size and that the remaining LiB fibers align in parallel along the rolling direction, in accordance with the previous reports. 25 In addition, it can be seen from Figure S2b (Supporting Information), the cross‐section of the plate, that LiB fibers of different lengths were interlaced with one another mainly in a direction parallel to the surface. The pores between LiB skeletons are thus the ideal accommodations for free Li encapsulation. To examine the practical capacity of the prepared Li–B–Mg composite anode, it has been charged at 0.2 mA cm −2 in a Li‐half battery and the voltage profile result is shown in Figure  2b. From Figure  2b, a long stage below 0.1 V, which can be assigned to the stripping of free Li, can be observed. This capacity is calculated to be 1832 mA h g −1 based on the mass of the whole composite anode. In addition, three small platforms located at 0.46, 0.67, and 0.80 V, which can be attributed to the Li electrodissolution from the LiB compound, can be observed. 26 To further examine the compositional and morphological change of the 3D Li–B–Mg composite anode during Li electrodissolution, ex situ XRD and SEM measurements have been conducted during the charge process at specific stages (marked from A–H in Figure  2b) and the corresponding results are shown in Figure  2c,d. From Figure  2c, it can be observed that one of the XRD peaks of the Li(Mg) solid solution, which is located at 36°, gradually decreases during Li electrodissolution process (Figure S3a, Supporting Information). This implies that the original Li(Mg) solid solution which has filled in the pores of the fibrous LiB skeleton has gradually transformed into a Li‐deficient phase during the charge process. Meanwhile, Figure  2c shows that the XRD peaks belonging to the LiB compound, which is located at 45.06°, rise first and then fall during Li electrodissolution. This indicates that the Li in the LiB compound could be dissolved to some extent during the charge process. It has to be noted that although the Li in the LiB compound can contribute extra capacity during the charge process, yet it will jeopardize the structural integrity of the LiB compound structure, resulting in an unstable 3D Li–B–Mg composite anode. The deterioration of the LiB compound can be observed via the appearance of the dark LiB color as shown in Figure S3b (Supporting Information, see also below) especially after the voltage reaches greater than 0.8 V. 10 The Li–B–Mg composite anode which has been charged to several specific stages (B, D, and F in Figure  2b) is chosen to study its morphology changes and the corresponding results are shown in Figure  2d. One can clearly observe the appearance of large pores among the LiB fibers during the Li electrochemical dissolution under the voltage of 0.1 V (B panel in Figure  2d). With almost all available Li in Li(Mg) solid solution dissolved (D panel in Figure  2d), the pores among the LiB fibers became larger. The surface morphology and the cross‐sectional SEM images of the Li–B–Mg composite anode after Li in the LiB compound has been partially dissolved are shown in Figure  2d (F panel) and Figure S3c (Supporting Information). Moreover, one can clearly observe the fragmentation of the Li–B–Mg composite anode after the voltage has increased to 1 V, as shown in Figure S3d (Supporting Information; H point in Figure  2d). The unambiguous observation provides supporting evidence that the structure of the obtained 3D Li–B–Mg composite could be significantly damaged after the stripping of Li in LiB skeleton. 23 On the basis of the measurements, the capacity below 0.1 V (D point) is defined as the available free Li capacity (≈1832 mA h g −1) and the cut‐off voltage of the following electrochemical measurement of the battery is set to be 0.4 V to avoid the destruction of LiB skeleton. High temperature melting test and DFT calculation have been further conducted to investigate the structural stability of the obtained 3D Li–B–Mg composite. The results are respectively shown in Figure  2e,f. Figure  2e clearly shows the intact structure of the Li–B–Mg composite plate (no free Li melts out) even when it is heated to a high temperature of 288.6 °C. In comparison pure Li has melted into a ball shape under this high temperature condition. This investigation clearly demonstrates a strong structural stability under high temperature condition. To further study the chemical affinity between lithium alloy skeleton and lithium, we calculated the adsorption energies of Li on different sites and substrates by using the DFT and the results are illustrated in Figure  2f. From Figure  2f, it can be seen that the adsorption energy is −2.03 eV between a Li atom and the top Li atom of the LiB skeleton. However, when Li is adsorbed on the top of B atom in the LiB, the adsorption energy has decreased to −2.63 eV, which suggests a stronger adsorption preference in the LiB substrate (LiB–Li2). The strong interaction between LiB and Li facilitates the absorption of Li + by the LiB skeleton, highlighting its lithiophilicity and availability of the host. The influence of Mg toward the affinity to Li has been also studied. In the first place the adsorption energy between Li atom and the unoccupied site and the bridge site of Mg metal are found respectively to be −1.49 and −1.48 eV. After Mg was introduced into the LiB compound, the calculation indicates an enhanced adsorption energy of Li (by about 0.19 eV relative to the adsorption energy (LiB–Li2) of −2.63 eV). The results declare an important role played by Mg atom and the enhanced chemical affinity of Li to the skeleton in the presence of Mg is thus obtained. To further elaborate the effect of Mg, the Li–B composite was synthesized without adding Mg during the preparation process. The component contents of Li–B alloy are 74 wt.% Li and 26 wt.% B. The obtained Li–B alloy is consisted of two phases of LiB compound and free Li according to XRD patterns in Figure S4a (Supporting Information). The practical available capacity of the prepared Li–B anode (below 0.1 V) is calculated to be 1890.4 mA h g −1 based on the whole composite, which is a little higher than that of Li–B–Mg composite. After the free Li stripped (A stage marked in Figure S4b in the Supporting Information), the morphology of Li–B compound was shown in Figure S4c (Supporting Information). Compared with Li–B–Mg composite, the surface of LiB fibers is smoother with less adhesion after the free Li stripped (D stage) in Figure  2d. It demonstrates that after free Li stripped from Li–B–Mg, the remaining Li‐deficient Li(Mg) alloy helps connect LiB fibers to stabilize the whole skeleton. This is one of the advantage of addition of Mg. 2.2 Mitigation of the Volume Change The in situ formed lithiophilic 3D skeleton is designed to function as a “host” for Li metal to maintain the structural integrity and stability of the electrode. The ability to alleviate the significant volume change is verified through the cross‐sectional SEM, as shown in  Figure3. It has to be noted that the experiment adopted about 0.2 mm thick Li–B–Mg composite plate and 0.6 mm thick Li foil. As displayed in Figure  3a, the thickness of the pristine Li–B–Mg is measured to be 247.6 µm. After 15.3 mA h of Li (25% free Li in Li–B–Mg composite) was stripped from the composite, the thickness of the composite plate decreased only by 5.3 µm (Figure  3b), less than the theoretical value of 37.11 µm (calculation details are shown in the Supporting Information). Besides, the even Mg distribution in the cross‐section of the composite after Li stripped (Figure  3c,d) corroborates that Mg remains homogeneous in the whole stripping process. It is noted that Li(Mg) alloy could act as a dual‐conductive host for Li due to the transition to a Li‐deficient material. 23 As the concentration of Mg increases with Li stripped, the strength of the composite is enhanced, and it helps to protect the Li in LiB from being stripped. So the exist of Mg contributes to the stability of the electrode. In contrast, Figure  3e,f show that the “hostless” Li foil experienced a vast reduction in thickness of 149.3 µm after 60 mA h Li has been stripped (24.3% of the total Li corresponding to a theoretical thickness of 145.55 µm, see detailed calculations in the Supporting Information). Figure  3g shows a cracked Li surface which may result from the large volume variation during extraction of Li, as schematically illustrated in Figure  1b. The inhomogeneous Li electrodissolution/electrodeposition would lead to the observed Li electrode pulverization. In a word, the current experiment verifies that LiB skeleton can work as a scaffold to alleviate the volume variation and support the whole electrode after Li has been stripped. 2.3 Symmetrical Battery Performance of Li–B–Mg Composite and Li The electrochemical performance of the symmetrical batteries assembled with either Li–B–Mg composite or pure Li is compared in  Figure4. Batteries of both types were cycled at 0.5, 1, and 2 mA cm −2 with a fixed capacity of 0.5 mA h cm −2. As displayed in Figure  4a, the symmetrical battery of Li–B–Mg composite experiences an activation process at first with a large overpotential due to a few contaminants on the surface, but it quickly tends to be stable with a smaller voltage overpotential of less than 50 mV. The duration of cycle life for the Li–B–Mg symmetrical battery exceeds 500 h, whereas pure Li foil assembled battery exhibits an increasing voltage overpotential and short‐circuited after 170 hours cycling. The cycle lives of both types of batteries reduce when the current density is increased to 1 and 2 mA cm −2, as shown in Figure  4b,c. Nevertheless, the Li–B–Mg composite assembled symmetrical batteries show superior cycle lifespan compared with the pure Li assembled symmetrical batteries (Figure  4b,c), illustrating a stable interface and impedance formed by the Li–B–Mg composite anode. 19 Detailed comparisons of the overpotentials are depicted in the right column of Figure  4. It has been reported that the poor performance of Li symmetrical battery results from the large volume change and formation of dendritic Li. 5 On the contrary, the currently proposed 3D Li–B–Mg composite anode could not only reduce the local current density and mitigate the large volume change, but also regulate the uniformity of electric field (the electric field distribution is simulated hereinafter) and induce the homogeneous Li + deposition. All these merits contribute tremendously to the long and stable cycling lifespan of Li–B–Mg composite assembled symmetrical batteries. Figure S5 (Supporting Information) compares the electrochemical properties of the Li–B–Mg and Li–B composites in symmetrical batteries under the current density of 1 mA cm −2. It is obvious that the overpotential of Li–B–Mg composite is lower than that of Li–B anode especially in the partial enlarged figures, which is consistent with the above calculation results of enhanced adsorption energy with the addition of Mg. The electrochemical performance of the Li–B–Mg composite in the ether‐based electrolyte was also explored since the ether‐based electrolyte is widely employed in Li–S and Li–O 2 batteries. Figure S6 (Supporting Information) clearly shows the enhanced cycling stability of the 3D Li–B–Mg composite cycled at 1 mA cm −2 (over 500 h) and 2 mA cm −2 (250 h) compared with that of the pure Li assembled symmetrical batteries. This study further verifies the stability of the Li–B–Mg composite as a metal electrode. 2.4 Inhibition Mechanisms of Li Dendrite Growth During Cycling The uneven electric field distribution is regarded as a main driving force for the uncontrolled Li dendrites growth. 27 The currently proposed porous and conductive 3D LiB skeleton is expected to decentralize the electric field, reduce the local current density and regulate the Li + deposition. To elucidate the effect of the LiB skeleton on electric field distribution, electrical conduction model via finite element analysis (FEA) simulation is conducted. (Note that the simulation is concentrated mainly on the electric field distribution on the composite surface during the initial Li deposition process.) The results are shown in  Figure5 (details and Figure S7 are shown in the Supporting Information). As illustrated in Figure  5a–d, the uniformly distributed electric field generated from the LiB skeleton facilitates the uniform deposition of Li, inhibiting the formation of Li dendrite. Moreover, the remaining Li(Mg) solid solution with high Mg concentration will also help to guide the uniform deposition of Li + due to the strong affinity to Li as mentioned earlier. In comparison, the Li tips on the Li surface would eventually evolve into Li dendrites due to the inhomogeneous incoming Li + flux (Figure  5e,f). The morphology evolution of Li–B–Mg composite and pure Li after electrochemical cycling are characterized by SEM to further investigate the superior dendrite inhibition of Li–B–Mg composite and the results are presented in  Figure6a. The first image in Figure  6a shows a relatively smooth and flat surface of the composite after 25 cycles cycled at 1 mA cm −2 with a fixed capacity of 0.5 mA h cm −2. This indicates that the 3D Li–B–Mg composite can successfully accommodate the electrochemically deposited Li. By contrast, a great deal of dendrites of several micrometers in diameter can be observed on the surface of Li foil (second row in Figure  6a). These entangled dendrites grow randomly and form a porous layer on planar Li foil (Figure S8, Supporting Information). It has been reported that this porous layer would undoubtedly bring detrimental effect to Li + diffusion and contribute significantly to the generation of electrochemically “dead Li.” 28 The Li–B–Mg composite electrode also shows superior dendrite inhibition ability at increased cycle numbers and current density (the middle and right columns in Figure  6a). In situ optical microscopy was employed to record the Li electrodeposition on the 3D Li–B–Mg composite and pure Li electrode in the carbonate‐based electrolyte. The results are shown in Figure  6b and Videos S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information. From Figure  6b, one can hardly observe dendrite formation on Li–B–Mg electrode surface, as shown in the first row of Figure  6b. However, tremendous amount of Li cluster appears and it grows rapidly into irregular bulges during electrochemical plating. These results illustrate that the Li–B–Mg electrode is indeed capable of maintaining relatively flat surface by inhibiting dendrite growth during cycling. EIS measurements were also carried out to examine the interfacial stability of the Li–B–Mg anode and pure Li anode over the range of 0.01–10 5 Hz during cycling. Figure S9 (Supporting Information) shows the results of the interfacial resistance measurements after different cycles at 0.5 mA cm −2 with a fixed capacity of 0.5 mA h cm −2. It can be clearly observed from Figure S9 (Supporting Information) that the Li–B–Mg composite assembled symmetrical battery exhibits a stable and ultralow interfacial resistance of less than 15 Ω during the cycling after the first cycle. On the contrary, pure Li assembled symmetrical battery displays erratic resistance behavior, indicating that an unstable interface between metallic Li and the electrolyte has been formed. 2.5 Full Batteries Paired with LiCoO 2 To explore the practical application of the Li–B–Mg composite, coin‐type full battery using commercial LiCoO 2 as cathode was assembled. The full battery employed carbonate‐based electrolyte and its voltage profiles within the voltage range of 3.0–4.2 V at different cycles are presented in  Figure7a. Under the current density of 0.5 C (1 C = 274 mA h g −1), LiCoO 2|Li–B–Mg full battery displays a discharge specific capacity of 134.7 mA h g −1 with a distinct voltage plateaus at ≈3.9 V in the first cycle. In the subsequent cycles, the voltage plateau remains unchanged. Figure  7b compares the cycling stability of the batteries assembled respectively with the Li–B–Mg composite and pure Li anodes at 0.5 C. The initial discharge specific capacity of the LiCoO 2|Li full battery approximates to that of the LiCoO 2|Li–B–Mg full battery (134.3 vs 134.7 mA h g −1). However, the LiCoO 2|Li full battery decays quickly during the 100 cycles while the LiCoO 2|Li–B–Mg full battery exhibits a much longer cycling life (250 cycles with a capacity retention of 77.3%). The pouch‐type battery was also assembled to test the practical performance of the Li–B–Mg composite. Its first discharge capacity is 67.657 mA h (≈6 mA h cm −2). In addition, the pouch‐type battery demonstrates a similar charge–discharge curve to that of the coin‐type battery (Figure  7c) and a very stable cycling over 35 cycles is shown in Figure  7d. Meanwhile, its Coulombic efficiency maintains over 99.7%, verifying its feasibility for practical application. Safety concerns of LMBs are of paramount importance in practical applications. A series of safety tests of the pouch‐type battery using the Li–B–Mg composite as anode, namely, the acupuncture, impact and overcharge tests, were conducted after preformation procedure. Among them, the acupuncture test is the simulation of a battery under the circumstance of a forced internal short circuit. Video S3 (Supporting Information) recorded the process of the acupuncture test, from which no instant explosion and no open fire can be observed after the needle puncture (the inset on the upper right in Figure S10A in the Supporting Information). The pouch battery also withstood the impact test without explosion and open fire (Video S4 and Figure S10B, Supporting Information), which is aimed at simulating a heavy object impacting the power supply. Resistance to overcharge is also an essential aspect of the safety properties for monomer battery so an overcharge test has been conducted and the results are shown in Figure S10C (Supporting Information). Although it can be observed that swelling has occurred during the rise of voltage yet no explosion nor smoke occurred even when the voltage has reached to 10 V. This experiment demonstrates a higher safety characteristic of the LiCoO 2|Li–B–Mg pouch battery.",NaN,NaN,"['Supporting Information', 'Figure', 'Composite', 'LiB', 'Supporting', 'Information', 'composite anode', 'LiB skeleton', 'LiB compound', 'LiB fibers']"
