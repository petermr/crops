However, whether brain dysfunction occurs in adolescents with Internet addiction who attempt suicide remains unknown. This observational cross-sectional study enrolled 41 young Internet addicts, aged from 15 to 20 years, from the Department of Psychiatry, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China from January to May 2018. The participants included 21 individuals who attempted suicide and 20 individuals with Internet addiction without a suicidal attempt history. Brain images in the resting state were obtained by a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The results showed that activity in the gyrus frontalis inferior of the right pars triangularis and the right pars opercularis was significantly increased in the suicidal attempt group compared with the non-suicidal attempt group. In the resting state, the prefrontal lobe of adolescents who had attempted suicide because of Internet addiction exhibited functional abnormalities, which may provide a new basis for studying suicide pathogenesis in Internet addicts.

In this case, residents of the villages in northern Iran have close familial relationships and residents commonly share medicines with one another. Therefore, the issue of contamination was a major concern. A cluster randomized design in which the village was the cluster was chosen to mitigate the risk of contamination through pill sharing [ 20]. Obtaining informed consent from trial participants Although the PolyIran trial is a CRT, the trial interventions (polypill tablet and nonpharmacological prevention) were offered to all village residents over the age of 50â€‰years. As the study intervention is delivered at the level of the individual, the trial is an individual-cluster trial. In individual-cluster trials, it is typically feasible to obtain the informed consent of participants. Thus, in the PolyIran trial, informed consent was obtained for the polypill and augmented care interventions and use of outcome data. The high illiteracy rate in the study population (almost 80%) [ 22] presented a challenge to obtaining informed consent. Research staff who are native Turkmen speakers were trained to obtain informed consent, provided information verbally to participants, and answered any questions. Research staff then documented the disclosure and the participantâ€™s consent (or refusal) to participation in the PolyIran trial. Members of the Golestan cohort study provided informed consent for the collection and use of data within the cohort study, but they did not provide consent for their data to be used in the PolyIran trial. Consequently, Golestan study cohort members who were randomly selected for the comparator cohort neither provided their permission nor were they aware that their data were to be used in the PolyIran trial. While the outcome data collection was identical between the two studies, both studies have differing purposes and objectives. After deliberation, the research ethics committee responsible for the PolyIran study concluded that no additional consent was required from Golestan study cohort members to use their outcome data in the PolyIran trial. Dealing with current clinical practice in the study population As with many trials conducted in LMICs, recruitment for the PolyIran trial was not undertaken in conjunction with the participants’ primary or secondary care physician, but rather through a separate and study-specific group of physicians. Some participants were already receiving treatment for cardiovascular disease. For control arm participants, their medications were recorded. However, for intervention arm participants, the researchers sent a letter to patients’ physicians explaining the trial and the composition of the polypill tablet. In case of medication duplication, physician were asked to adjust participants’ prescribed medications accordingly. All changes to medications were recorded for future follow-up and analysis. Post-trial access to the study interventions It is widely acknowledged that, particularly in an LMIC setting, participants should have access to a trial intervention when it is found to be effective [ 23]. In the PolyIran trial, if the polypill is shown to be safe and effective, it is anticipated that it will be provided to participants in the polypill and augmented care trial arms for 5 years. However, for how long should the polypill tablet be provided to participants at the expense of the researchers and sponsor? Naturally, there are concerns regarding feasibility of this decision for long-term access. Added complications follow when considering the issue of whether members of the Golestan cohort study selected for the comparator cohort should be provided with the study intervention should it be found to be effective. Not only does this have larger resource and cost implications, but also as their informed consent for data use in the PolyIran trial was not obtained, comparator cohort participants were not aware of the trial. It was decided that members of the comparator cohort would not be provided with the polypill tablet after completion of the trial. Research ethics committee review Consistent with other international ethics documents, the Ottawa Statement requires that all CRTs be submitted to a research ethics committee (TableÂ  1). The PolyIran trial was reviewed and approved by the research ethics committee of the Digestive Diseases Research Institute at the Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran. In its review, the research ethics committee did not refer to the Ottawa Statement. However, the research ethics committee had reviewed CRTs before and is knowledgeable about cluster randomized designs.

In its review, the research ethics committee did not refer to the Ottawa Statement. However, the research ethics committee had reviewed CRTs before and is knowledgeable about cluster randomized designs. Ethical issues raised by the PASTAL trial Justification of the use of an adaptive cluster randomized design The study interventions (letters, self-test kits and financial incentives) are administered at the level of the individual and thus, in principle, an individually randomized trial is possible. However, for administrative and logistical reasons, and concerns over contamination, a cluster randomized design was preferred [ 44]. Obtaining informed consent from trial participants Although the PASTAL trial is a CRT, the unit of intervention is the individual. Accordingly, the written informed consent of all female participants was obtained. On each day of recruitment, trial staff provided women attending the antenatal care clinic with general information about the trial. The intervention to which the antenatal care clinic day had been randomized was not disclosed to the woman. After women completed their antenatal care visit, they met one-on-one with a trial staff member who screened them for eligibility and completed the informed consent process and disclosed the trial arm. While male partners of the female participants were the direct targets of the intervention, their consent to participate was not obtained. A waiver of consent for male participants was sought and granted by the research ethics committee. The waiver of consent was sought for logistical reasons (male partners typically did not accompany women to the antenatal clinic) and scientific reasons (willingness to consent was thought to be correlated with subsequent clinic attendance, the primary outcome measure). A number of concerns might be raised about this approach. First, it compromises the autonomy of male partners. Second, it may pose a risk to women in the study if male partners discover they were enrolled without their consent, as the prevalence of intimate partner violence is high in the region [ 45]. Having conducted an interim analysis that showed the usual care arm to be suboptimal, was there equipoise to justify continuation to the second stage of the trial? The original sample size calculation assumed that the usual care arm would have 25% of male partners achieving testing for HIV [ 46]. The analysis at the end of stage one revealed this proportion in the usual care arm was just 13%. Given that so few men in the usual care arm were undergoing HIV testing, data safety and monitoring board members debated whether the usual care should be carried forward to the second stage or dropped. The need to include a usual care arm is a contentious issue not only in adaptive trial designs; not including a usual care arm would mean the trial would be unable to provide a direct comparison to the care provided routinely outside of the trial, limiting its applicability to the local population. Post-trial access to study interventions In the past 10 years, there has been considerable interest in behavioral economics interventions, such as financial incentives, to improve HIV outcomes [ 47]. The PASTAL trial found that only the two fixed financial incentive interventions of $3 and $10 significantly improved the primary outcome. However, local policy makers remain unwilling to scale up these programs despite the strong evidence in favor of their effectiveness. This raises the question of sustainability or indeed whether there is social value in conducting trials with these types of interventions in contexts where routine implementation cannot be guaranteed. To what degree a trial must begin with assurances that effective interventions will be implemented is a question requiring further reflection and guidance. Research ethics committee review The PASTAL trial was reviewed and approved by the College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee in Malawi, and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee in London, UK. In their reviews, neither research ethics committee referred to the Ottawa Statement. However, both research ethics committees have reviewed CRTs previously and are knowledgeable about cluster randomized designs.

In their reviews, neither research ethics committee referred to the Ottawa Statement. However, both research ethics committees have reviewed CRTs previously and are knowledgeable about cluster randomized designs."," Background Cluster randomized trials are common in health research in low- and middle-income countries raising issues that challenge interpretation of standard ethical guidelines. While the Ottawa Statement on the ethical design and conduct of cluster randomized trials provides guidance for researchers and research ethics committees, it does not explicitly focus on low- and middle-income settings. Main body In this paper, we use the lens of the Ottawa Statement to analyze two cluster randomized trials conducted in low- and middle-income settings in order to identify gaps or ethical issues requiring further analysis and guidance. The PolyIran trial was a parallel-arm, cluster trial examining the effectiveness of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease in Golestan province, Iran. The PASTAL trial was an adaptive, multistage, parallel-arm, cluster trial evaluating the effect of incentives for human immunodeficiency virus self-testing and follow-up on male partners of pregnant women in Malawi. Through an in-depth case analysis of these two studies we highlight several issues in need of further exploration. First, standards for verbal consent and waivers of consent require methods for operationalization if they are to be employed consistently. Second, the appropriate choice of a control arm remains contentious. Particularly in the case of implementation interventions, locally available care is required as the comparator to address questions of comparative effectiveness. However, locally available care might be lower than standards set out in national guidelines. Third, while the need for access to effective interventions post-trial is widely recognized, it is often not possible to guarantee this upfront. Clarity on what is required of researchers and sponsors is needed. Fourth, there is a pressing need for ethics education and capacity building regarding cluster randomized trials in these settings. Conclusion We identify four issues in cluster randomized trials conducted in low- and middle-income countries for which further ethical analysis and guidance is required.","['Informed consent', 'Ethics', 'Research Ethics', 'Equipoise', 'Low- And Middle-income Countries', 'Cluster Randomized Trial', 'Research Ethics Committee', 'Post-trial Access']","['research ethics', 'ethics committee', 'trial', 'PolyIran trial', 'ethics', 'Research', 'committee', 'informed consent', 'Ottawa Statement', 'PASTAL trial']",['of'],NaN

We investigated the association of psychologic stress with disease activity in patients with IBD, especially in terms of mental state and sleep condition. METHODS:This was a multi-center observational study comprising 20 institutions. Data were collected using survey forms for doctors and questionnaires for patients, and the association of psychologic stress with clinical parameters was investigated. Mental state was evaluated using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, and sleep condition was evaluated by querying patients about the severity of insomnia symptoms. RESULTS:A total of 1078 IBD patients were enrolled, including 303 patients with Crohn's disease and 775 patients with ulcerative colitis. Seventy-five percent of IBD patients believed that psychologic stress triggered an exacerbation of their disease (PSTE group) and 25% did not (non-PSTE group). The CES-D scores were significantly higher for patients with clinically active disease than for those in remission in the PSTE group (median (interquartile range) = 7 (4-9.5) vs. 5 (3-7), p < .0001), but not in the non-PSTE group (5 (2-8) vs. 4 (3-7), p = 0.78). Female sex and disease exacerbation by factors other than psychologic stress were independent factors of psychologic stress-triggered disease exacerbation. Also, patients with insomnia had higher disease activity than those without insomnia, especially in the PSTE group. CONCLUSIONS:A worsened mental state correlates with disease activity in IBD patients, especially those who believe that their disease is exacerbated by psychologic stress.",[],[],[],NaN

The establishment of codes of ethics are foundational events in the social history of a profession. Within these documents it is possible to find statements of values and culture that serve a variety of purposes. Codes of ethics in dentistry have not frequently presented as the subjects of analyses despite containing rich information about the priorities and anxieties within the profession's membership at the time that the code was written. MAIN TEXT:This essay uses critical discourse analysis to explore the 2012 and 2018 versions of the Code of Ethics produced by the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Dental Association. This method of discourse analysis examines contradictions between the discourses within the codes and how these relate to broader social realties that surround the dental profession in New South Wales. By analysing the 2012 and 2018 codes together, it is possible to understand how the dental profession views its commitments to society as established through the social contract. Through this assessment, it will be demonstrated that both codes suffer due to their failure to consider the public as a key stakeholder in the creation and curation of the Code of Ethics and how this this relates intimately with the social contract between the profession and the public. CONCLUSION:Without the public being the central consideration, both codes amount to declarations of professional privilege and dominance. Although the more recent 2018 Code of Ethics demonstrates insight into the changes in public trust placed in the professions, this analysis shows that that the current code of ethics is still reluctant to recognise and engage with the public as an equal stakeholder in the planning and provision of oral health care and the development of the profession's values and cultural trajectory.","['Sociology', 'Dentistry', 'Code Of Ethics', 'Professionalism', 'Critical Discourse Analysis']",[],[],NaN

Cancer screenings can detect precancerous cells and allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment. Our purpose was to better understand risk factors for cancer screenings and assess the effect of cancer screenings on changes of Cardiovascular health (CVH) measures before and after cancer screenings among patients. METHODS:We used The Guideline Advantage (TGA)-American Heart Association ambulatory quality clinical data registry of electronic health record data (n = 362,533 patients) to investigate associations between time-series CVH measures and receipt of breast, cervical, and colon cancer screenings. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks was employed to predict receipt of cancer screenings. We also compared the distributions of CVH factors between patients who received cancer screenings and those who did not. Finally, we examined and quantified changes in CVH measures among the screened and non-screened groups. RESULTS:Model performance was evaluated by the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC): the average AUROC of 10 curves was 0.63 for breast, 0.70 for cervical, and 0.61 for colon cancer screening. Distribution comparison found that screened patients had a higher prevalence of poor CVH categories. CVH submetrics were improved for patients after cancer screenings. CONCLUSION:Deep learning algorithm could be used to investigate the associations between time-series CVH measures and cancer screenings in an ambulatory population. Patients with more adverse CVH profiles tend to be screened for cancers, and cancer screening may also prompt favorable changes in CVH. Cancer screenings may increase patient CVH health, thus potentially decreasing burden of disease and costs for the health system (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and cancers).",[],"['Ethics statement', 'Washington University', 'fully anonymized', 'Institutional Review', 'Review Board', 'University School', 'Heart Association', 'American Heart', 'Washington', 'University']",[],NaN

All patients completed and signed an informed consent form in the local language before starting treatment.," Background Since a meta-analysis showed little or no effect of second-line injectables on treatment success, and using injectables may induce ototoxicity, injectable-free rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) treatment regimens are recommended. However, acquired resistance preventing activity was overlooked. No previous study assessed the effect of shortening the duration of kanamycin administration to 2 months during the intensive phase of the RR-TB shorter treatment regimen (STR). Methods Retrospective cohort study of the effect of using 2 months of kanamycin instead of the standard 4(+) months (extension if lack of smear conversion at 4 months) on recurrence (either treatment failure or relapse) and fluoroquinolone acquired drug resistance, in patients treated with a gatifloxacin-based STR in Damien Foundation supported clinics in Bangladesh. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations. Results Five of 52 (9.6%) treated with a STR containing two months of kanamycin had recurrence, compared to 21 of 738 (2.8%) patients treated with the standard STR containing 4(+) months of kanamycin (OR 3.7; 95%CI:1.5-10.3). In those with initially fluoroquinolone-susceptible TB, acquired resistance to fluoroquinolone was detected in none of 639 patients treated with 4(+) months of kanamycin and two (4.5%) of 44 treated with two months of kanamycin (OR 75.2; 95%CI:3.6-1592.1). Conclusion Two months of kanamycin was insufficient to prevent recurrence with acquired resistance to gatifloxacin, the core drug of the most effective RR-TB STR. Injectable mediated resistance prevention is important to reach high effectiveness, to safeguard all treatment options after recurrence, and to prevent the spread of resistant TB. Studies on all-oral regimens should also assess the effect of regimen composition on resistance acquisition. Until evidence shows that other drugs can assure at least the same strong resistance preventing activity of the injectables, it seems wise to continue using this group of drugs, and adapt the regimen if any ototoxicity is detected.",[],"['Medicine Antwerp', 'Bangladesh Medical', 'Institutional Review', 'Review Board', 'Tropical Medicine', 'National Research', 'Medical Research', 'Research Council', 'Ethics Committee', 'Research Ethics']",[],NaN

Preterm babies are at high risk of morbidity and mortality so an alternative strategy is to identify them soon after birth is needed for early referral and management. Objective The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy in assessing prematurity of newborn, over and above birthweight, using a pictorial Simplified Gestational Age Score adapted for use as a Tablet App. Methods Two trained nurse midwives, blinded to each other's assessment and the actual gestational age of the baby used the app to assess gestational age at birth in 3 hospitals based on the following 4 parameters-newborn's posture, skin texture, breast and genital development. Inter-observer variation was evaluated and the optimal scoring cut-off to detect preterm birth was determined. Sensitivity and specificity of gestational age score using the tablet was estimated using combinations of last menstrual period and ultrasound as reference standards to assess preterm birth. The predictive accuracy of the score using the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve was also determined. To account for potential reference standard bias, we also evaluated the score using latent class models. Results A total of 8,591 live singleton births whose gestational age by last menstrual period and ultrasound was within 1 weeks of each other were enrolled. There was strong agreement between assessors (concordance correlation coefficient 0.77 (95% CI 0.76-0.78) and Fleiss' kappa was 0.76 (95% CI 0.76-0.78). The optimal cut-off for the score to predict preterm was 13. Irrespective of the reference standard, the specificity of the score was 90% and sensitivity varied from 40-50% and the predictive accuracy between 74%-79% for the reference standards. The likelihood ratio of a positive score varied between 3.75-4.88 while the same for a negative likelihood ratio consistently varied between 0.57-0.72. Latent class models showed similar results indicating no reference standard bias.

We included 193 treated patients in two institutions achieving CR, for which both bone marrow aspirates and biopsies were available. Results We found that neither the serum free light chain ratio, clonality by immunohistochemistry (IHC) nor plasma cell bone marrow infiltration identified CR patients at distinct risk. Patients with sCR had slightly longer progression-free survival. Nevertheless, persistent clonal bone marrow disease was detectable using MFC or NGS and was associated with significantly inferior outcomes compared with MRD-negative cases. Conclusion Our results confirm that sCR does not predict a different outcome and indicate that more sensitive techniques are able to identify patients with differing prognoses. We suggest that MRD categories should be implemented over sCR for the future classification of MM responses.",[],[],[],NaN

Mechanical stretching may be a crucial cause of vascular remodeling. While, the underlining mechanism of mechanical stretching-induced in remodeling of pulmonary vein in the early stage of PH-LHD has not been completely elucidated. In our study, the PH-LHD model rats were successfully constructed. After 25 days, doppler echocardiography and hemodynamic examination were performed. In addition, after treatment, the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were determined by ELISA, immunohistochemistry and western blot assays in the pulmonary veins. Moreover, the pathological change of pulmonary tissues was evaluated by H&E staining. Our results uncovered that left ventricular insufficiency and interventricular septal shift could be observed in PH-LHD model rats, and the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and mean left atrial pressure (mLAP) were also elevated in PH-LHD model rats. Meanwhile, we found that MMP-9 and TGF-β1 could be highly expressed in PH-LHD model rats. Besides, we revealed that stretch-activated channel (SAC)/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway could be involved in the upregulations of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 mediated by mechanical stretching in pulmonary vein. Therefore, current research revealed that mechanical stretching induced the increasing expressions of MMP-9 and TGF-β1 in pulmonary vein, which could be mediated by activation of SAC/MAPKs signaling pathway in the early stage of PH-LHD.",[],[],[],NaN

The aim of the present study was to see the ability to recognize different bioethical issues in relation to patient care among 3 rd  semester undergraduate students and also the change in the pattern of recognition of bioethical issues after formal training. Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out using self-administered questionnaire among the fifty 3 rd  semester undergraduate MBBS students. Each question was designed in a ""Likert scale"" pattern carrying a minimum score of 1 (1 = strongly disagree) and maximum score of 5 (5 = strongly agree). After 6 months of training and bedside clinical exposure, students were assessed again with same set of questionnaire. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0. Results All of the respondents in the study group were of the opinion that medical ethics is very important but only 24% aware about existence of ethics committee in the institute. Changes has been observed after clinical exposure in response like disclosure of patient's condition to close relatives (agreed 54% versus 84% pre and postexposure, respectively) and discussion of related ethical issues with clinical case discussion (agreed 74% versus 94% pre and postexposure, respectively). Some of the issues needs further clarification even after clinical exposure like doctors must not refuse to do abortion (56% disagreed and 38% agreed), consent regarding treatment in children (60% disagreed and 32% agreed), and uses of branded versus generic drugs (76% generic and 26% branded). Conclusion There is a need to stress the importance of ethical practice in the undergraduate curriculum to make the doctors confident enough to deal the ethical dilemma for themselves and better professional efficiency.","['Patient Care', 'Undergraduate Medical Students', 'Medical Bioethics', 'Indian Medical Graduate']",[],[],NaN

This study used a retrospective, observational analysis of deidentified tests performed at a national clinical laboratory to determine if circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity rates. Over 190,000 patients from all 50 states with SARS-CoV-2 results performed mid-March through mid-June, 2020 and matching 25(OH)D results from the preceding 12 months were included. Residential zip code data was required to match with US Census data and perform analyses of race/ethnicity proportions and latitude. A total of 191,779 patients were included (median age, 54 years [interquartile range 40.4-64.7]; 68% female. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 9.3% (95% C.I. 9.2-9.5%) and the mean seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D was 31.7 (SD 11.7). The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was higher in the 39,190 patients with ""deficient"" 25(OH)D values (<20 ng/mL) (12.5%, 95% C.I. 12.2-12.8%) than in the 27,870 patients with ""adequate"" values (30-34 ng/mL) (8.1%, 95% C.I. 7.8-8.4%) and the 12,321 patients with values ≥55 ng/mL (5.9%, 95% C.I. 5.5-6.4%). The association between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was best fitted by the weighted second-order polynomial regression, which indicated strong correlation in the total population (R2 = 0.96) and in analyses stratified by all studied demographic factors. The association between lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates and higher circulating 25(OH)D levels remained significant in a multivariable logistic model adjusting for all included demographic factors (adjusted odds ratio 0.984 per ng/mL increment, 95% C.I. 0.983-0.986; p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2 positivity is strongly and inversely associated with circulating 25(OH)D levels, a relationship that persists across latitudes, races/ethnicities, both sexes, and age ranges.

Explicit discussion of ethical dimensions of patient management is often neglected, as clinical teachers may feel inadequately skilled to do this. Methods We developed a suite of online modules. Each consisted of a clinical scenario filmed using virtual reality (VR) technology, linked to an adaptive, interactive, online tutorial which explicitly discussed the relevant ethical issues and guidelines. These were embedded in clinical placements of students to encourage the transfer of knowledge from these modules to clinical skill competency. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate these modules which examined student engagement, knowledge gains (self-perceived and measured) and user experience. We also reviewed reflections to assess the incorporation of these modules and transfer of knowledge into the clinical learning and skill development of the students. Results Engagement and self-perceived knowledge gains were extremely high. Students found these modules realistic, interesting and helpful. The measured knowledge gains (module exit quiz) were moderate. User experience was positive overall, although students were intolerant of any technical glitches. There was mixed feedback on whether the VR aspect of the clinical scenarios added value. Student reflections showed high level incorporation of these modules into clinical practice of the students and evidence of knowledge transfer (level 3 Kirkpatrick model of evaluation) in over ¾ of students. Conclusions This study showed that the use VR clinical scenarios combined with interactive online learning modules resulted in demonstrable high-level student engagement and learning gains in medical ethics and transfer of knowledge to clinical application.

Its intent is that participants enter research voluntarily, with an understanding of what their participation entails. Despite agreement on the necessity to obtain informed consent in research, opinions vary on the threshold of disclosure necessary and the best method to obtain consent. We aimed to investigate Australian researchers' views on, and their experiences with, obtaining informed consent. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 researchers from NSW institutions, working in various fields of research. Interviews were analysed and coded to identify themes. Results Researchers reported that consent involved information disclosure, understanding and a voluntary decision. They emphasised the variability of consent interactions, which were dependent on potential participants' abilities and interests, study complexity and context. All researchers reported providing written information to potential participants, yet questioned the readability and utility of this information. The majority reported using signed consent forms to 'operationalise' consent and reported little awareness of, and lack of support in implementing more dynamic informed consent procedures, such as verbal informed consent, that was fit for the purposes of their studies. Views on Human Research Ethics Committees (HRECs) varied. Some reported inconsistent, arduous inputs on the information form and consent process. Others expressed reliance on HRECs for guidance, viewing them as institutional safeguards. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of transparent relationships, both between researchers and participants, and between researchers and HRECs. Where the relationship with study participants was reported as more robust, researchers felt that they were better able to ensure participants made better, more informed decisions. Where the relationship with HRECs was reported as more robust, researchers were more likely to view them as institutional safeguards, rather than as bureaucratic hindrances. Conscientious and mindful researchers are paramount to ensuring the procedure accommodates individual requirements. This study advocates that when designing ethical informed consent practices, researchers should be integrated as autonomous players with a positive input on the process, rather than, in the worst case, predatory recruiters to be curtailed by information forms and oversight.","['Informed consent', 'Ethics', 'National Statement', 'Researchers’ Views']",[],[],NaN

The research participants received a link to the survey with the following message: “We will appreciate your participation in a study carried out at the University of Haifa, which focuses on the work on practicing nurses and nursing interns during the COVID-19 outbreak. To complete a short and anonymous survey please press the following link.” After the potential participants clicked the link they reviewed an explanation sheet detailing about the research purposes and significance, the researcher’s background, the expected structure of the survey, its ethical approval, funding issues, and protection of privacy and anonymity of participants. Participants were asked to give their consent to completing the survey by clicking Yes or No, following a specific acknowledgement that they can stop participation at any time. All information obtained from participants was coded and kept in the researcher's computer and no other use of the information has been made. Ethical dilemmas during the pandemic This research also examined nurses’ responses to various ethical dilemmas that reflect values such as professional autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, equality, and justice. The dilemmas are described in  Figure 1. First, it is evident from the data that most nurses (74.7%) do not believe they have the right to refuse treating certain patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. In all, 63.7% agreed that neither a registered nurse nor an intern have the right to refuse to treat patients who may place them at risk. A significant negative correlation was found between respondent’s sense of competency to treat the patients that they are responsible for and their belief that they have the right to refuse treatment to certain patients because of the COVID-19 outbreak (r = -0.21; p = 0.00): The more the nurses felt confident and competent to treat these patients, the less they felt that they had a right to refuse treatment of selective patients. Alternatively, a significant positive correlation was found between respondent’s fear of treating sick or carrier patients and their belief that they have a right to refuse treatment of certain patients because of the COVID-19 outbreak (r = 0.19; p = 0.00): the more the nurses feared treating these patients, the more they believed that they have a right to refuse to provide treatment. No significant correlations were found between respondents’ sense of being protected from the virus at their workplace or their perceived risk and their view on the having the right to refuse treatment. Second, on a scale of 1 (very true) to 5 (not at all true), respondents were asked to rate the degree in which their medical team is capable of making ethical decisions including with regard to rationing limited medical resources in difficult situations. Almost half the respondents (49.5%) replied that in such a scenario, their team is highly capable (1–2). About a quarter (24.7%) replied that their team is incapable in most cases (4–5), and the remainder were undecided. As to nurses’ views on rationing resources, the average maximum age of patients who would receive care—if such a decision had to be made—was 84 (SD = 19). While 69.4% of respondents referred to an 80–99 age range, 8% refused to give an age limit (rating either zero or 120). Responses for this question can be seen in  Figure 2. Furthermore, with regard to possible cases of resource shortages, while most respondents (47.2%) did not think that older patients should be connected to respirators, a large majority (60.3%) did not think that older patients should be disconnected them from such machines once connected. A large majority (81.4%) believed that all patients have the right to equal optimal treatment during pandemics, regardless of their age and medical background. Similarly, most respondents (70.7%) did not think that patients who are responsible for their medical condition, such as smokers or people who did take protective measures, should receive less priority for treatment compared to other patients in times of shortage. Overall, no significant correlations were found between respondents’ gender, age, nationality, educational level, work experience, type of unit and its geographical location, proximity to at-risk persons, and attitudes regarding various ethical scenarios. However, the level of respondents’ religiousness was found to correlate with their responses, but only in two scenarios: The more religious the respondents, the less likely they are to agree that older patients should be disconnected from ventilators for the sake of younger patients (r = -0.24; p = 0.00), and the more likely they are to agree that every patient has a right to equal and optimal treatment during pandemics, regardless of age and medical background (r = 0.21; p = 0.01). Nurses who agreed with the statements that they would prefer to care for non-COVID-19 patients (r = 0.18; p = 0.01), that they would only care for COVID-19 patients if asked to do so (r = 0.19; p = 0.01), and that they have the right to refuse treating certain patients during the COVID-19 outbreak (r = 0.16; p = 0.03), were more likely to agree to stopping or avoiding offering treatment through scarce medical resources based on age or personal responsibility than other nurses. These respondents also tended to refer to younger age levels as the maximum age for offering life-saving medical treatment in times of shortage (r = -0.25, p = 0.000; r = -0.23, p = 0.00; and r = -0.27, p = 0.00, respectively). Finally, respondents’ attitudes regarding ethical scenarios were all inter-correlated, except for respondents’ beliefs that their medical team was qualified to make ethical decisions with regard to preferring patients in difficult situations and that patients should be prioritized based on personal responsibility (r = 0.08; p = 0.26)—or with regard to patients’ maximum age for receiving life-saving resources in times of shortage and scarcity (r = -0.13; p = 0.12)."," Background Positioned at the frontlines of the battle against COVID-19 disease, nurses are at increased risk of contraction, yet as they feel obligated to provide care, they also experience ethical pressure. Research question and objectives The study examined how Israeli nurses respond to ethical dilemmas and tension during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to what extent this is associated with their perceived risk and motivation to provide care? Research design The study implemented a descriptive correlative study using a 53-section online questionnaire, including 4 open-ended questions. Participants and research context The questionnaire was complete by 231 registered and intern nurses after being posted on nurses' Facebook and WhatsApp groups, and through snowball sampling. Ethical considerations The research was pre-approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at the University of Haifa, Israel. Findings In all, 68.8% of the respondents had received some form of training about COVID-19. Respondents positioned themselves at perceived high risk levels for contracting the virus. About one-third feared going to work because of potential contraction and due to feeling inadequately protected. While 40.9% were scared to care for COVID-19 patients, 74.7% did not believe they have the right to refuse to treat certain patients. When asked about defining an age limit for providing patients with scarce resources (such as ventilation machines) in cases of insufficient supplies, respondents stated that the maximum age in such scenarios should be 84 (standard deviation (SD = 19) - yet most respondents (81.4%) believed that every patient has the right to receive optimal treatment, regardless of their age and medical background. Discussion Correlating with their strong commitment to care, nurses did not convey intention to leave the profession despite their stress, perceived risk, and feelings of insufficient support and protection at work. The nurses did not hold a utilitarian approach to resource allocation, thereby acknowledging the value of all people and their entitlement to care, regardless of optimal outcomes. Conclusion While experiencing significant personal risk and emotional burden, nurses conveyed strong dedication to providing care, and did not regret working in the nursing profession, yet they did seek a supportive climate for their needs and ethical concerns.","['Motivation', 'risk', 'Ethical Dilemmas', 'Duty Of Care', 'Covid-19', 'Allocation Of Scarce Medical Resources']","['Social Welfare', 'Health Sciences', 'patients', 'refuse treatment', 'treatment', 'age', 'refuse', 'Ethical', 'medical', 'respondents']",[],NaN

Patients being currently treated in an orthopaedic practice and pedestrians were more eager to accept a follow-up by a mobile app than participants from social media. Conclusion The majority of participants would accept a mobile application, collecting personal health-related data for postoperative follow-up, and saw a direct benefit for the patient in such an application.","['Follow-up', 'Ehealth', 'Big Data', 'Mhealth', 'Smartphone Application']",[],[],NaN

Local approval in Switzerland was also obtained from the Swiss Cantonal Ethics Commission (approval number 2019–00926). Chiropractors who completed either the Q-sort table or demographic questionnaire were assumed to have given implied consent to participate in the study."," Background Swiss chiropractors have been licensed since 1995 to prescribe from a limited formulary of medications for treating musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions. In January 2018, this formulary was expanded to include additional muscle relaxant, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory medications. Internationally, controversy remains over whether or not medication prescribing should be pursued within the chiropractic profession. Objective The purpose of this study was to assess Swiss chiropractors' attitudes, beliefs, and practices regarding their existing medication prescription privileges. This information will provide new insights on the topic and help inform research and policy discussions about expanding chiropractic prescription rights in other jurisdictions. Methods A 13-item questionnaire and Q-methodology approach were used to conduct the assessment. Recruitment was conducted by e-mail between December 2019 and February 2020, and all members of the Swiss Chiropractic Association were eligible to participate. Data were analyzed using by-person factor analysis and descriptive statistics. Results In total, 187 Swiss chiropractors participated in this study (65.4% response rate). Respondents reported prescribing analgesics, anti-inflammatories, and muscle relaxants to a median of 5, 5, and 0% of patients, respectively. Forty-two percent of respondents expressed interest in further expanding the range of current medications available to Swiss chiropractors for treating MSK conditions. Only 15% expressed interest in expanding this range to include medications for treating non-MSK conditions. In the Q-methodology analysis, four salient viewpoints/groups regarding medication prescribing emerged: prescribers, non-prescribers, collaborators, and integrators. All except non-prescribers thought medication prescription privileges were advantageous for the chiropractic profession in Switzerland. There was also strong consensus among all four groups that medication prescribing should not replace manual therapy in chiropractic practice. Conclusion This was the first national survey on attitudes toward prescribing medications among Swiss chiropractors since the year 2000, and the first using Q-methodology. With this approach, four unique groups of chiropractic prescribers were identified. Even with diversity among clinicians, the findings of this study showed general support for, along with conservative use of, prescribing privileges within the Swiss chiropractic profession. Studies in jurisdictions outside of Switzerland are needed to assess whether chiropractors are interested in expanding their scopes of practice to include similar prescribing privileges.","['Switzerland', 'Chiropractic', 'Beliefs', 'Attitudes', 'Drug Prescription', 'Q-methodology']","['Hamilton Integrated', 'Integrated Research', 'McMaster University', 'considerations Prior', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics Board', 'Ethical considerations', 'data collection', 'approval number', 'Ethics Commission']","['2019–7612).', '2019–00926).']",NaN

Knowledge of the usual presentation of scalp melanoma can help to understand the reasons for the poor outcomes of treatment. This is the first publication to describe the clinical, histopathological and epidemiological profile of patients with scalp melanoma in a Latin American population. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed of all primary cutaneous melanoma seen by the A.C.Camargo Cancer Center between 2008 and 2018, using an electronic health records to access clinical and pathology data. Results When compared to trunk and limbs, increasing age is expected for patients with scalp melanoma (10.865; CI (95%) = [8.303; 13.427]). Regarding risk of invasion, scalp melanomas have a higher chance to be invasive than in situ (OR = 1.783; CI (95%) = [1.196; 2.657]) and present with higher Breslow thickness (OR = 3.005; CI (95%) = [2.507; 3.601]). Scalp site was significantly associated with male sex (OR = 3.750; CI (95%) = [2.533; 5.554]), perineural invasion (OR = 13.739; CI (95%) = [5.919; 31.895]), ulceration (OR = 2.311; CI (95%) = [1.488; 3.588]), and mitosis (OR = 2.366; CI (95%) = [1.701; 3.292]), when compared to trunk and limbs melanoma. Conclusion In the present study, head and neck melanomas represented 14.9% of all melanomas, a frequency slightly lower than that described in the literature and the mean age of melanoma on the scalp found was lower than that reported in the literature. These results could be explained by the demographic characteristics of Brazil, which has a population with a lower life expectancy compared to the European and North American population.

We estimated the optimal timing interval for IRS using a statistical approach. Methods Six rounds of IRS were implemented in Tororo District, a historically high malaria transmission setting in Uganda, during the study period (3 rounds with bendiocarb active ingredient (Ficam®): December 2014 to December 2015, and 3 rounds with pirimiphos methyl active ingredient (Actellic 300®CS): June 2016 to July 2018). A generalized additive model was used to estimate the optimal timing interval for IRS based on the predicted malaria incidence. The model was fitted to clinical incidence data from a cohort of children aged 0.5-10 years from selected households observed throughout the study period. Results 494 children, 67% aged less than 5 years at enrolment were analysed. Six-months period incidence of malaria decreased from 2.96 per person-years at the baseline to 1.74 following the first round of IRS and then to 0.02 after 6 rounds of IRS. The optimal time interval for IRS differed between bendiocarb and pirimiphos methyl and by IRS round. To retain an optimum impact, bendiocarb would require respraying 17 (95% CI: 14.2-21.0) weeks after application whereas pirimiphos methyl could remain impactful for 40 (95% CI: 37.0-42.8) weeks, although in the final year this estimates 36 (95% CI: 32.7-37.7) weeks. However, we could not estimate from the data the optimal time after the second and third rounds of bendiocarb and after the second round of pirimiphos methyl. Neither the amount of rainfall nor the EIR nor the distribution of nets were found to be statistically significant for determining the time period between spray rounds. Conclusion In our setting, the effect of the two IRS products was distinct. Statistically, pirimiphos methyl provided a longer window of protection than bendiocarb, although impact varied between different spray rounds and years which was not explained by rainfall or EIR or distribution of nets in our statistical approach. Understanding the effectiveness of IRS and how long it lasts can help for planning campaigns, but one should consider the financial cost and insecticide resistance.

Main body This scientific statement, developed by the cardiology department at Cairo University, emphasized 6 different aspects that are intended to guide healthcare providers during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlighted the importance of dealing with all cardiac arrest victims, during the pandemic, as potential COVID-19 cases, and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) by health care providers during the procedure. It also stated that the CPR procedure should be done in a separate room with the door closed and that the number of providers present during the procedure should be limited to only those who are essential for patient resuscitation. It also stressed that family members and accompanying personnel of patients with possible COVID-19 should not be in the vicinity of CPR site. The statement also pointed out that CPR procedure should be done in the standard manner with precautions to minimize spread of infection to the staff and accompanying people. Early intubation was prioritized, and the use of rapid sequence intubation with appropriate PPE was recommended. For delivery of CPR for the prone ventilated patient, delivery of chest compressions by pressing the patient's back, while a team prepares to turn the patient supine, was recommended. During intra-hospital transport, it was emphasized that the receiving intensive care unit (ICU) should be notified about the possibility of the patient being COVID-19 positive, so that appropriate infection control precautions are taken.

51,C:\Users\shweata\ethics_statement_2000_generic\PMC7607543\eupmc_result.json,PMC7607543,"Research ethics and compassionate use Another function of research ethics is to provide guidance on the “compassionate use” of drugs unapproved for Covid-19. In the past months we have read about compassionate use access of Covid-19 patients to hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. 100 By compassionate use (otherwise known as expanded access), we refer to 101: …a potential pathway for a patient with an immediately life-threatening condition or serious disease or condition to gain access to an investigational medical product (drug, biologic, or medical device) for treatment outside of clinical trials when no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy options are available. In principle compassionate use must have regulatory oversight and, in some countries such as the US, Spain, and Italy, research ethics committee approval as well. 102 US regulations as well as those of individual EU member states stipulate the requirements before an investigational drug can be offered to either an individual, a limited group, or a wider population. 103 But what exactly is the role of research ethics? Compassionate use is therapy in the sense that the purpose of it is to cure. However, compassionate use is not only therapy. 104 It is, after all, the provision of a drug with yet-to-be determined levels of efficacy and safety. Considering the not very impressive success rate of an investigational drug of only 14% (i.e., from phase 1 to successfully being licensed for market distribution), 105 the risks of compassionate use, especially when doctors cannot be provided with definitive guidance on dosage or exclusion criteria, can actually be worse than the risks of a controlled clinical trial. This being the case, research ethics guidance is imperative for access to investigational drugs via compassionate use. Also, faced with a surge of sick patients suffering from a new unknown disease, well-motivated clinicians and investigators all over the world, including drug companies and funding agencies, should adopt “a more integrated approach to learning while doing”, and they should join forces, i.e. engage in collaborative efforts so as to increase the “exploitation/exploration trade-offs”, and, hopefully, shorten “the period until effective treatments are discovered and implemented”. 106 Research ethics and post-trial access One of the tenets of research ethics is the provision of the benefits of research to the intended patient population. All major international ethics guidelines for research have provisions with different degrees of specifications. The Declaration of Helsinki article 34, for example, requires clinical trial “sponsors, researchers, and host country governments” to ensure post-trial provisions to participants who, at the end of the trial, might still need the trial intervention that has been “identified as beneficial in the trial”. 107 UNESCO’s Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights provides more specificity and directive. Article 15 says the following 108: Benefits resulting from any scientific research and its applications should be shared with society as a whole and within the international community, in particular with developing countries. In giving effect to this principle, benefits may take any of the following forms: (a) special and sustainable assistance to, and acknowledgement of, the persons and groups that have taken part in the research; (b) access to quality health care; (c) provision of new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities or products stemming from research; (d) support for health services; (e) access to scientific and technological knowledge; (f) capacity-building facilities for research purposes; (g) other forms of benefit consistent with the principles set out in this Declaration. Guideline 2 of CIOMS’ International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research involving Humans provides a similar specification in terms of provision of the fruits of research to the population or community where the research was carried out, most especially for research conducted in low-resource settings. 109 Then, on Guideline 20, it stipulates the applicability of Guideline 2 for research during disaster and disease outbreaks. 110 During the Covid-19 pandemic, we see these principles tested again and again. There were moments filled with high spirits and solidarity. The sequencing of the genome of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the identification of relevant proteins and enzymes, happened at lightning speed because of spontaneous collaboration between universities from different countries. 111 We also saw how public funds were earmarked Covid-19 research and therapy development. 112,113,114 At the same time, we saw how public funds were used to secure advanced orders of potential Covid-19 vaccines originally researched using public funds 115 and how pharmaceutical companies played hardball with the public for Covid-19 testing kits. 116 There were real reasons to be worried, most especially if pharmaceutical companies continue to be granted free rein in pricing, which usually means paying “a small fortune” for new interventions. 117 To address potential access concerns brought about by patent market exclusivity, 118 Costa Rica spearheaded what is now the WHO Solidarity Call for a Covid-19 Technology Access Pool. 119 Specifically, this is a call for “key stakeholders and the global community to voluntarily pool knowledge, intellectual property and data necessary for Covid-19”. 120 It was this same spirit of solidarity that spurred the sequencing of the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 and it is this same spirit of pooling, collaboration, and sharing of benefits that provides hope for timely and equitable access to much needed interventions. 121 Research ethics has provided this foundation, as we saw above, and it remains research ethics’ task to ensure that Covid-19 drug discovery and development take this course. To date, 38 countries have signed the WHO Solidarity Call, which countries such as the US and the UK have yet to become signatories.","The Covid-19 pandemic creates an unprecedented threatening situation worldwide with an urgent need for critical reflection and new knowledge production, but also a need for imminent action despite prevailing knowledge gaps and multilevel uncertainty. With regard to the role of research ethics in these pandemic times some argue in favor of exceptionalism, others, including the authors of this paper, emphasize the urgent need to remain committed to core ethical principles and fundamental human rights obligations all reflected in research regulations and guidelines carefully crafted over time. In this paper we disentangle some of the arguments put forward in the ongoing debate about Covid-19 human challenge studies (CHIs) and the concomitant role of health-related research ethics in pandemic times.

Analysis of samples with very low DNA inputs, such as formalin fixed (FFPE) biopsy specimens from clinical trials or circulating tumour DNA is challenging at the genome-wide level because of lack of available input. We present the results of low input experiments into the Illumina Infinium HD methylation assay on FFPE specimens and ctDNA samples. Methods For all experiments, the Infinium HD assay for methylation was used. In total, forty-eight FFPE specimens were used at varying concentrations (lowest input 50 ng); eighteen blood derived specimens (lowest input 10 ng) and six matched ctDNA input (lowest input 10 ng)/fresh tumour specimens (lowest input 250 ng) were processed. Downstream analysis was performed in R/Bioconductor for quality control metrics and differential methylation analysis as well as copy number calls. Results Correlation coefficients for CpG methylation were high at the probe level averaged R2 = 0.99 for blood derived samples and R2 > 0.96 for the FFPE samples. When matched ctDNA/fresh tumour samples were compared, R2 > 0.91 between the two. Results of differential methylation analysis did not vary significantly by DNA input in either the blood or FFPE groups. There were differences seen in the ctDNA group as compared to their paired tumour sample, possibly because of enrichment for tumour material without contaminating normal. Copy number variants observed in the tumour were generally also seen in the paired ctDNA sample with good concordance via DQ plot. Conclusions The Illumina Infinium HD methylation assay can robustly detect methylation across a range of sample types, including ctDNA, down to an input of 10 ng. It can also reliably detect oncogenic methylation changes and copy number variants in ctDNA.

Methods In order to create a comprehensive list of secular medical and surgical societies, the results of a systematic search using Google were cross-referenced with a list of societies that have a seat on the American Medical Association House of Delegates. Societies with position statements were identified. These statements were divided into 5 categories: opposed to PAS and/or euthanasia, studied neutrality, supportive, acknowledgement without statement, and no statement. Linguistic analysis was performed using RapidMinder in order to determine word frequency and sentiment respective to individual statements. To ensure accuracy, only statements with word counts > 100 were analyzed.

I argue that through the lens of public health ethics literature, the ban on running falls short of the criterion of proportionality that public health ethics scholars and international guidelines for the ethical management of infectious disease outbreak recommend for any measure that restricts essential individual freedoms, such as the freedom of movement. The public health ethics framework, however, falls short of explaining the widespread public support that the running ban has had in Italy. I discuss possible factors which could explain the public support for the ban in Italy. Finally, I raise the question of what societal implications the abandonment of the public health ethics framework based on proportionality might have. I conclude that if it is the case, as the history of pandemics teaches us, we will experience further waves of COVID-19 outbreaks, it becomes very important to raise these questions now, with an eye towards informing public health policies for the management of future COVID-19 outbreaks.

Ritodrine infusion can result in serious maternal complications, and pulmonary edema is a particular concern among these. The cause of pulmonary edema following ritodrine treatment is multifactorial; however, the contributing genetic factors remain poorly understood. This study investigates the genetic variants associated with ritodrine-induced pulmonary edema. Methods In this case-control study, 16 patients who developed pulmonary edema during ritodrine infusion [case], and 16 pregnant women who were treated with ritodrine and did not develop pulmonary edema [control] were included. The control pregnant women were selected after matching for plurality and gestational age at the time of tocolytic use. Maternal blood was collected during admission for tocolytic treatment, and whole exome sequencing was performed with the stored blood samples. Results Gene-wise variant burden (GVB) analysis resulted in a total of 71 candidate genes by comparing the cumulative effects of multiple coding variants for 19729 protein-coding genes between the patients with pulmonary edema and the matched controls. Subsequent data analysis selected only the statistically significant and deleterious variants compatible with ritodrine-induced pulmonary edema.

However, LTBI screening among HIV-infected individuals in resource limited setting is largely based on a negative symptom screen, which has low specificity. Methods In a cross sectional diagnostic study, 115 HIV infected participants with a negative symptom screen will be consented and enrolled. They will be requested to donate 5 ml of blood for complete blood count (CBC) and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) testing. In a nested prospective study, the 115 participants will be initiated on Tuberculosis Preventive Therapy and the CBC testing repeated after 3 months. In the analysis of study finding, the monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) will be derived from the dividend of the absolute monocyte and lymphocyte counts. The optimal MLR positivity cut-off for elevated or normal MLR will be the highest value of Youden's index, J (sensitivity + specificity-1). The MLR will be cross tabulated with the IGRA status to determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of the MLR. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve will be determined to give the overall diagnostic accuracy of MLR. The baseline and 3 month CBC will be used to determine the change in MLR, and a random effect logistic regression will be used to determine factors associated with the change in the MLR. Discussion If positive results are realized from this study, the MLR could become an inexpensive alternative biomarker with potential to improve the specificity of the negative symptom screen in identifying individuals that should be targeted for TB preventive therapy.",[],"['Health Sciencesâ', 'Makerere University', 'University College', 'Ethics Review', 'Review Committee', 'Uganda National', 'National Council', 'Bio-medical Sciences', 'Sciences Ethics', 'report forms']",['only'],NaN

Minimal in vivo data is available on undisturbed gastrointestinal motility to improve relevance of predictive dissolution models and in silico tools such as physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging methods could provide novel data and insights that can be used as a reference to validate and, if necessary, optimize these models. The conventional method for measuring gastrointestinal motility is via a manometric technique involving intubation. Nevertheless, it is feasible to measure gastrointestinal motility with magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this study was is to develop and validate a magnetic resonance imaging method using the most recent semi-automated analysis method against concomitant perfused manometry method. Material and methods Eighteen healthy fasted participants were recruited for this study. The participants were intubated with a water-perfused manometry catheter. Subsequently, stomach motility was assessed by cine-MRI acquired at intervals, of 3.5min sets, at coronal oblique planes through the abdomen and by simultaneous water perfused manometry, before and after administration of a standard bioavailability / bioequivalence 8 ounces (~240mL) drink of water. The magnetic resonance imaging motility images were analysed using Spatio-Temporal Motility analysis STMM techniques. The area under the curve of the gastric motility contractions was calculated for each set and compared between techniques. The study visit was then repeated one week later. Results Data from 15 participants was analysed. There was a good correlation between the MRI antral motility plots area under the curve and corresponding perfused manometry motility area under the curve (r = 0.860) during both antral contractions and quiescence. Conclusion Non-invasive dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of gastric antral motility coupled with recently developed, semi-automated magnetic resonance imaging data processing techniques correlated well with simultaneous, 'gold standard' water perfused manometry. This will be particularly helpful for research purposes related to oral absorption where the absorption of a drug is highly depending on the underlying gastrointestinal processes such as gastric emptying, gastrointestinal motility and availability of residual fluid volumes.

Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people perceive wellbeing and quality of life (QOL) differently from the Western biomedical models of health underpinning existing QOL instruments. Any instrument to measure the wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be culturally appropriate and safe, include relevant dimensions, and be informed by their own values and preferences. Existing QOL instruments do not meet these standards. This study will generate a new preference-based wellbeing measure, WM2Adults, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults, underpinned by their values and preferences. Methods A mixed methods approach will be used; we will employ decolonising methodologies, privilege Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices and perspectives, and adopt a strengths-based approach rather than a deficit lens. Yarning Circles will be conducted with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across Australia. A candidate item pool will be developed from these data, on which psychometric analysis and validity testing will be undertaken to develop a descriptive system. Following finalisation of the descriptive system, wellbeing states will be valued using a quantitative preference-based approach (best-worst scaling) with a diverse sample of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults (n = 1000). A multinomial (conditional) logit framework will be used to analyse responses and generate a scoring algorithm for the new preference-based WM2Adults measure.

A quest back questionnaire with similar questions about patient care and work conditions was sent to the personnel working with these patients, and 46 of 81 responded. Most patients welcomed the strict measures that were applied, including a visitation ban for inpatients and a reduction in consultations for the outpatients.

69,C:\Users\shweata\ethics_statement_2000_generic\PMC7675378\eupmc_result.json,PMC7675378,"Ethical decision-making against the backdrop of finite health care resources It is remarkably challenging to give the “right” answer to an ethical quandary. We are not authoritative enough to weigh in on whether the long-term survival or the life-expectancy standards ought to be applied as the more ethically sound one. We have on the other hand realized that irrespective of the prioritizing standard adopted, several institutions have illustrated the characteristics that any sound decision-making process should have, when defining the allocation of scarce resources. According to a recent statement by the University of Sidney, any suitable procedure aimed at resource allocation during the current COVID-19 pandemic should directly lay out “the reasons for those decisions, who made them, and the possibility of revising decisions in the light of new evidence or new relevant considerations” [ 12]. In an ideal scenario, all those who contributed to the decision should be heard and given the chance to appeal. Nevertheless, such a time-consuming process may be hard to implement when decisions must be made swiftly, and answers are immediately required in order to meet pressing needs under fast-evolving circumstances. Clarity and transparency in the decision-making process under such demanding conditions could well constitute the only viable, albeit partial, solution should professionals be accused of having violated individual rights. In Italy, the prevalent therapeutic approach overall has been to implement standardized respiratory and circulatory support for seriously ill patients, whereas mildly symptomatic patients have been supervised with no therapeutic intervention. Such a monotherapy-based course of action, which has left out a significant share of patients who would have needed it due to shortages in intensive care unit beds in the hardest-hit regions, has brought to the forefront the ethical quandary of having to decide which patients to prioritize on account of the limited resources available. The difficulties and extraordinary burden of having to make such decisions have led to many doctors seeking ethical guidance. As a response to that need, the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) has issued a set of recommendations, grounded in a “clinical soundness” standard, which tend to lean towards prioritizing patients with higher life expectancy, which could be defined as a “moderately utilitarian” approach, in the face of not enough resources to meet everyone’s needs [ 4]: giving artificial ventilation to patients who are unlikely to survive anyway would in fact mean denying the same care to others with higher chances of surviving and recovering. By that rationale, some have suggested that it might be necessary to set an age limit for admission to critical care units. The utilitarian reasoning is after all deemed ethically acceptable by various groups, such as the Jewish community [ 5]. Such a stance is of course liable to be criticized as discriminatory against elderly and otherwise unhealthy patients, and possibly running counter to universal principles whose vital nature should never be demeaned, not even in times of pandemic. That argument has been recently reasserted by international institutions such as the UNESCO, which has released a statement on ethical issues and COVID-19, drawing attention to the need to care for those most at risk because of “poverty, discrimination, gender, illness, loss of autonomy or functionality, elder age, disability, ethnicity…”, and stressing how such groups are likely to be even more vulnerable in emergency circumstances [ 6]. The Italian Committee for Bioethics (CNB), in an opinion released on 8th April 2020, has drawn upon some of the principles spelled out in the UNESCO statement, and criticized any selection criteria outside of clinical standards, which are viewed as the only appropriate guidance for managing access to critical care units; the Committee has however acknowledged triage as a valuable tool to that end. Patient selection criteria ought to be grounded in the principles of preparedness, adequacy and the capability to meet current needs. If the preparedness-based strategy should turn out to be lacking in terms of ensuring the highest benefit to every patient, those for which the treatment can be more effective and with the higher chances of surviving should be prioritized; that assessment needs to take into account not only patients who are physically in the facilities, but also those examined at an earlier time and found to be in critical conditions. The CNB opinion has not been unanimously approved: a minority position has in fact criticized the vague and ill-defined nature of the “higher chances of survival” standard, arguing that in cases of identical clinical evaluations, it would be far preferable to apply the standard of “higher life expectancy”, in agreement with the SIAARTI position [ 7]. In the United Kingdom, NICE-issued guidelines recommend a triage phase centered around patient fragility, although they offer a somewhat vague set of indications when it comes, for instance, to the assignment of artificial ventilators [ 8]. Hence, in a context of insufficient resources, decisions are bound to be made at the local level, which entails the risk of creating a sort of “lottery effect”, i.e. applying different criteria based on the location and facilities in which each patient is hospitalized. The first hand experiences of doctors in the front line all over the world show that the issue of setting ethically acceptable priorities, when operating with meager resources, cannot be sidestepped. To deal with that issue, shared decision-making pathways have been devised, of which a primary distinctive trait is to separate health care professionals who carry out therapeutic procedures from those who operate at the triage level (thus establishing who is to be admitted to critical care units), so as to ease the psychological and ethical burden borne by medical crews; secondly, the triage phase needs to be based on clearly defined parameters, meaning that the highest possible degree of transparency must be guaranteed throughout the process of defining priority standards. In that regard, even before the Coronavirus pandemic broke out, a standard was set by which only those with the higher chances for short-term survival were to be admitted into intensive care units, such as patients with no known comorbidities, for instance [ 9]. Although age is not mentioned in the framework, the age factor is bound to carry a certain weight in terms of inclusion criteria. Broadly speaking, even though it might be possible, and even advisable, to discuss and plan in advance on several aspects, in real life situations any decision is influenced by, and must conform with, the current emergency setting and the scarce resources available. All debates centered around ethics have a tendency to gloss over legal aspects; still, we believe that it is essential to take into account the fallout resulting from possible violations of legal rights of all those involved. In that respect, it would be remiss to overlook a key point: all decisions made on a case-by-case basis, thus not based on a recognized and officially acknowledged scale of priorities, are liable to be contested and impugned as unwarranted, unsound, arbitrary or even discriminatory [ 10]. Decisions about the allocation of finite resources are likely to be called into question as well, as it is to be expected when ethical quandaries are at play [ 11]. Said decisions are however as likely to be accepted as the decision-making process is transparently articulated, intelligible and accessible by all those involved (patients and their family members, operators, health care facility officials and the public opinion). Ethical dilemmas arising from non-conventional treatment Another relevant topic pertaining to the realm of ethics has to do with the administration of innovative treatment under emergency conditions. That point has great practical relevance as well, since the therapeutic aspect may well have contributed to determining the high Coronavirus fatality rate, particularly in Italy. The Italian path has tragically laid bare all the flaws of standardized oxygen therapy in patients who spiral into severe respiratory failure, which is often impervious to oxygen therapy. The clinical records for such patients point to elevated D-dimer levels along with fibrinogen decreases and lower platelet levels, and a deterioration of coagulation factors, which is consistent with the histopathological outcome of capillary microtrombosis. Antagonism of IL6 receptors, for instance, may inhibit the massive release of cytokines, thus preventing or delaying an evolution towards massive capillary microthrombosis. In turn, a plasma transfusion may prove helpful by providing specific antibodies and coagulation factors. Unlike what happened in Italy, in other countries (China, France, Spain, US) a large number of patients have received off-label and compassionate use therapies such as chloroquine, idroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, favipiravir, remdesivir, ribavirin, interferon, convalescent plasma, steroids, and antiâ€“IL-6 inhibitors, based on either their in vitro antiviral or anti-inflammatory properties, immune therapy with convalescent plasma. In China and elsewhere, from the initial stages of the epidemic, various trials have been carried out using antiviral, anti-inflammatory or anti-malarial drugs, at times in combination, and plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients [ 13]. The results of such trials have likely contributed to molding the general therapeutic approach towards COVID-19 patients. As a matter of fact, in Italy no drug-based therapeutic program was undertaken in COVID-19 cases for a long time, nor were any trials carried out. Only recently has the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) announced that Italy is set to participate in two WHO-sanctioned phase-3 studies (“Solidarity Trial”), aimed at assessing the degree of effectiveness and safety of the drug remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients. Research will be conducted at the Sacco hospital in Milan, the Polyclinic Hospital of Pavia, the University Hospital of Parma, and Rome’s National Institute for Infectious Diseases “Lazzaro Spallanzani”. In addition, AIFA has authorized a study, due to be coordinated by the Pascale Institute of Naples, to evaluate the efficacy of tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), mainly administered for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [ 14]. As for the immune therapy with convalescent plasma, the first Italian protocol was not released until 23rd April 2020 [ 15]. Kalil has recently issued a warning on the compassionate use of experimental drug therapies, arguing that “numerous drugs that have been highly promising in vitro for other infectious diseases have failed in clinical studies”, adding that many such drugs “have a variety of adverse effects, including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, neutropenia, and anaphylaxis” and “could potentially increase the risk of cardiac death”. He also pointed out that “it is critical to evaluate these drugs in studies that have a concurrent control group”, which could be constituted by “the standard of care with or without placebo”. The placebo group will always be safer (in terms of possible adverse effects) than the experimental group, because patients in the placebo group will receive the established standard of care [ 16]. We agree with Kalil when he argues that: “If the disease is not 100% lethal and it is not known whether the experimental drug would help or harm a patient (ie, a situation with true equipoise), then it is ethical to conduct an RCT. Without a control group, it is not possible to accurately determine the harms of any experimental drug”. During an outbreak, the type of Randomized Controled Trials (RCTs) that should be prioritized are the ones with an adaptive design, because they are able to rapidly accept or reject multiple experimental therapies throughout the trial, while being adequately gauged for meaningful clinical outcomes. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, RCTs have been launched around the world, including an adaptive trial sponsored by the NIH [ 17]. In Italy, with the epidemic already running for weeks, it has proven necessary to intervene on administrative procedures in order to expedite the system of authorization and validation of protocols, which was bogged down by bureaucracy. The new, streamlined system has been phased in through a government decree that was enacted about one month after the first Covid-19 case had been recorded in the country [ 18]. Such systemic dysfunctions have however delayed the start of controlled experimentation of new forms of treatment, and that by itself may have contributed to the high fatality rate. It is noteworthy for initiatives of such a broad scope to have been implemented in just a few weeks, and proves that clinical trials can be swiftly initiated even in the middle of a pandemic. The rapid and simultaneous combination of supportive care and RCTs is the only way to find effective and safe treatments for COVID-19 and any other future outbreak."," Background The Authors have laid out an analysis of Italian COVID-19 confirmed data and fatality rates, pointing out how a dearth of health care resources in northern regions has resulted in hard, ethically challenging decisions in terms of granting patient access to intensive care units (ICU). Main text Having to make such decisions certainly entails substantial difficulties, and that has led many health care professional to seek ethical guidance. The Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) has attempted to meet that growing need by a set of recommendations, applying ""clinical soundness"" as a beacon standard; that approach tends to prioritize patients with higher life expectancy, which could be characterized as a ""moderately utilitarian"" approach. Yet, such a selection has engendered daunting ethical quandaries. The authors believe it can only be warranted and acceptable if rooted in a transparent decision-making process and verifiable, reviewed criteria. Moreover, the authors have stressed how clinical experimentation in a pandemic setting is a subtext of great interest from an ethical perspective. In Italy, no drug therapy and trials were undertaken for COVID-19 patients for a rather long period of time. When the epidemic was already circulating, an intervention proved necessary on the system of administrative procedures, aimed at expediting the authorization and validation of protocols, then bogged down by bureaucracy. A new system has since been instituted by a government decree that was signed about one month after the first Covid-19 case was officially recorded in the country. Such a swift implementation, which took just a few weeks, is noteworthy and proves that clinical trials can be initiated in a timely fashion, even with a pandemic unfolding. The concerted, action of supportive care and RCTs is the only way to attain effective forms of treatments for COVID-19 and any other future outbreak. Conclusions The authors have arrived at the conclusion that the most effective and ethically sound response on the part of any national health care system would be to adequately reconfigure its organizational mechanisms, by making clinical trials and all related administrative procedures consistent with the current state of emergency.","['Emergency', 'Ethics', 'Covid-19']","['patients', 'care', 'care units', 'intensive care', 'critical care', 'resources', 'Ethical', 'decisions', 'standard', 'Italy']",['of'],NaN

For 16S sequencing data a standard 16S processing pipeline based on the Amplicon Sequence Variant concept and the qiime2 software package will be employed; for shotgun data, for each sample we will assemble the reads and obtain and analyze metagenome-assembled genomes. Results The primary expected results of the study is to characterize the specific composition of the biliary microbiota in situations of disease and health. In addition, it seeks to demonstrate the existence of changes in the case of illness and also possible disease biomarkers, diagnosis, interventions and therapies in hepatobiliopancreatic diseases.

As more patients' genomic data is being held by the public health system, there will be increased requests from researchers to access this data. It is important that public policy reflects public expectations for how genomic data that is generated from clinical tests is used. To inform public policy and discussions around genomic data sharing, we sought public opinions on using genomic data contained in medical records for research purposes in the Australian state of Queensland. Methods A total of 1494 participants completed an online questionnaire between February and May 2019. Participants were adults living in Australia. The questionnaire explored participant preferences for sharing genomic data or biological samples with researchers, and concerns about genomic data sharing. Results Most participants wanted to be given the choice to have their genomic data from medical records used in research. Their expectations on whether and how often they needed to be approached for permission on using their genomic data, depended on whether the data was identifiable or anonymous. Their willingness to sharing data for research purposes depended on the type of information being shared, what type of research would be undertaken and who would be doing the research. Participants were most concerned with genomics data sharing that could lead to discrimination (insurance and employment), data being used for marketing, data security, or commercial use. Conclusions Most participants were willing to share their genomic data from medical records with researchers, as long as permission for use was sought. However, the existing policies related to this process in Queensland do not reflect participant expectations for how this is achieved, particularly with anonymous genomics data. This inconsistency may be addressed by process changes, such as inclusion of research in addition to clinical consent or general research data consent programs.","['Genomic', 'data sharing', 'Data Linkage', 'Health Information', 'Secondary Use', 'Public Views']",[],[],NaN

Methods Twelve databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, CINAHL, PsycINFO, JBI (Joanna Briggs institute), Web of Science, and four Chinese databases) were searched to identify qualitative studies on experiences and perspectives of Ramadan fasting in participants with diabetes. CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Program) Qualitative Checklists were applied to appraise the included studies. A meta-synthesis approach was used to analyze the included studies. Through the strategy of inductive thematic synthesis and reciprocal interpretation, the findings and quotations of the included studies were integrated into new themes and categories. The CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research) tool was used to grade the confidence of the new themes. Results A total of 11 qualitative studies were included, and 43 findings were isolated. Ten new themes were identified and synthesized from the findings. Finally, four new categories were integrated, including the knowledge and understanding of observing Ramadan fasting, well-being and challenges, self-efficacy, and needs and expectations of participants with diabetes during Ramadan. Conclusions Insulin-dependent individuals call for special concern during Ramadan fasting. Ramadan-focused education needs to be developed and generalized, and existing guidelines should be improved to optimize the management of diabetes. Professional HCPs contribute to weigh the health risks and mental satisfaction for their patients, partly, to balance health and religion.

Both PCOS and NAFLD are more severe in South Asian women. Data on NAFLD in South Asian women with PCOS are lacking. Aim To investigate prevalence and predictors of NAFLD and liver fibrosis in PCOS patients from South Asia. Methods We conducted an observational routine screening program by means of transient elastography (TE) with associated controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). NAFLD was defined as CAP ≥ 288 decibels per meter. Significant liver fibrosis (stage 2 and higher out of 4) was defined as TE measurement ≥ 8.0 kilopascals. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was defined as ALT > 24 IU/L, as per upper limit of normal reported in South Asian women. Biochemical hyperandrogenism was defined as free androgen index > 5. Predictors of NAFLD were determined by logistic regression analysis. Results 101 PCOS patients (mean age 36.3 years) with no significant alcohol intake or viral hepatitis were included. Prevalence of NAFLD and significant liver fibrosis was 39.6% and 6.9%, respectively. Elevated ALT was observed in 40% and 11.5% of patients with and without NAFLD, respectively. After adjusting for duration of PCOS and insulin resistance measured by homeostasis model for assessment of insulin resistance, independent predictors of NAFLD were higher body mass index [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-1.52], hyperandrogenism (aOR: 5.32, 95%CI: 1.56-18.17) and elevated ALT (aOR: 3.54, 95%CI: 1.10-11.47). Lifetime cardiovascular risk was higher in patients with NAFLD compared to those without NAFLD (0.31 ± 0.11  vs  0.26 ± 0.13). Conclusion Despite their young age, NAFLD diagnosed by TE with CAP is a frequent comorbidity in South Asian women with PCOS and is strongly associated with higher body mass index and hyperandrogenism. Non-invasive screening strategies could help early diagnosis and initiation of interventions, including counselling on weight loss, cardiovascular risk stratification and linkage to hepatology care where appropriate.","['body mass index', 'alanine aminotransferase', 'Transient Elastography', 'Controlled Attenuation Parameter', 'Lifetime Cardiovascular Risk', 'Hyperadrogenism']",[],[],NaN

These issues may limit progress toward the 3R principle for animal research, promote waste of public resources, and generate biased interpretations of clinical outcomes. To investigate current publishing practices and to gain some understanding of the extent to which research results are reported, we examined publication rates of research projects that were approved within an internal funding program of the Faculty of Medicine at a university medical center in Germany, which is exemplary for comparable research funding programs for the promotion of young researchers in Germany and Europe. Methods We analyzed the complete set (n = 363) of research projects that were supported by an internal funding program between 2004 and 2013. We divided the projects into four different proposal types that included those that required an ethics vote, those that included an animal proposal, those that included both requirements, and those that included neither requirement. Results We found that 65% of the internally funded research projects resulted in at least one peer-reviewed publication; this increased to 73% if other research contributions were considered, including abstracts, book and congress contributions, scientific posters, and presentations. There were no significant differences with respect to publication rates based on (a) the clinic/institute of the applicant, (b) project duration, (c) scope of funding or (d) proposal type. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore publication rates associated with early-career medical research funding. As >70% of the projects ultimately generated some form of publication, the program was overall effective toward this goal; however, non-publication of research results is still prevalent. Further research will explore the reasons underlying non-publication. We hope to use these findings to develop strategies that encourage publication of research results.",[],[],[],NaN

Current asthma medications are ineffective in treating fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mitochondrial phenotype in fibroblasts isolated from airway biopsies of non-asthmatic and severe asthmatic subjects by examining mitophagy as a mechanism contributing to fibroblast persistence and thereby, fibrosis in severe asthma. Methods Bioinformatics analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data was performed to identify the top enriched pathways in asthmatic fibroblasts. Endogenous expression of mitophagy markers in severe asthmatic and non-asthmatic fibroblasts was determined using qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence. Mitophagy flux was examined by using lysosomal protease inhibitors, E64d and pepstatin A. Mitochondrial membrane potential and metabolic activity were also evaluated using JC-1 assay and MTT assay, respectively. Results Bioinformatics analysis revealed the enrichment of Pink/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in asthmatic fibroblasts compared to healthy controls. In severe asthmatic fibroblasts, the differential expression of mitophagy genes, PINK1 and PRKN, was accompanied by the accumulation of PINK1, Parkin and other mitophagy proteins at baseline. The further accumulation of endogenous LC3BII, p62 and PINK1 in the presence of E64d and pepstatin A in severe asthmatic fibroblasts reinforced their enhanced mitophagy flux. Significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and metabolic activity were also demonstrated at baseline confirming the impairment in mitochondrial function in severe asthmatic fibroblasts. Interestingly, these fibroblasts displayed neither an apoptotic nor senescent phenotype but a pro-fibrotic phenotype with an adaptive survival mechanism triggered by increased AMPKα phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Conclusions Our results demonstrated a role for mitophagy in the pathogenesis of severe asthma where the enhanced turnover of damaged mitochondria may contribute to fibrosis in severe asthma by promoting the persistence and pro-fibrotic phenotype of fibroblasts.",[],[],[],NaN

Here we describe the concurrent cortical and spinal plasticity induced by fMV in a chronic stroke survivor, as assessed with 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT, peripheral nerve stimulation, and gait analysis. A 72-years-old patient was referred to our stroke clinic for a right leg hemiparesis and spasticity resulting from a previous (4 years before) hemorrhagic stroke. He reported a subjective improvement of his right leg's spasticity and dysesthesia that occurred after a30-min ride on a  Vespa  scooter as a passenger over the Roman Sampietrini (i.e., cubic-shaped cobblestones). Taking into account both the patient's anecdote and the current guidelines that recommend fMV for the treatment of post-stroke spasticity, we then decided to start fMV treatment. 12 fMV sessions (frequency 100 Hz; amplitude range 0.2-0.5 mm, three 10-min daily sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks) were applied over the quadriceps femoris, triceps surae, and hamstring muscles through a specific commercial device (Cro®System, NEMOCOsrl). A standardized clinical and instrumental evaluation was performed before (T0) the first fMV session and after (T1) the last one. After fMV treatment, we observed a clinically relevant motor and functional improvement, as assessed by comparing the post-treatment changes in the score of the Fugl-Meyer assessment, the Motricity Index score, the gait analysis, and the Ashworth modified scale, with the respective minimal detectable change at the 95% confidence level (MDC 95 ). Data from SPECT and peripheral nerve stimulation supported the evidence of a concurrent brain and spinal plasticity promoted by fMV treatment trough activity-dependent changes in cortical perfusion and motoneuron excitability, respectively. In conclusion, the substrate of post-stroke motor recovery induced by fMV involves a concurrently acting multisite plasticity (i.e., cortical and spinal plasticity). In our patient, operant conditioning of both cortical perfusion and motoneuron excitability throughout a month of fMV treatment was related to a clinically relevant improvement in his strength, step symmetry (with reduced limping), and spasticity.","['Stroke', 'Motor Recovery', 'Brain Plasticity', 'Spinal Cord Plasticity', 'Focal Muscle Vibration']","['ethics committee', 'Helsinki Ethical', 'Ethical Principles', 'Good Clinical', 'Clinical Practices', 'Ethics Statement', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'local ethics']",['3661).'],NaN

Approval project number: 2016/136.," Absract BACKGROUND: With increased student numbers in the Sydney Medical Program, and concerns regarding standardisation across cohorts, student satisfaction of the problem-based learning (PBL) model had decreased in recent years. In 2017, Team-based learning (TBL) replaced PBL in Years 1 and 2 of the medical program. This study sought to explore students' perceptions of their experience of TBL, and to consider resource implications. Methods In 2017, Years 1 and 2 medical students (n = 625) participated in weekly TBL sessions, with approximately 60 students per class, consisting of 11 teams of five or six students. Each class was facilitated by a consultant, a basic scientist and a medical registrar. Prior to each class, students were given pre-work, and completed an online Individual Readiness Assurance Test (IRAT). During face-to-face class, students completed the Team Readiness Assurance Test (TRAT), and received feedback with clarification from facilitators, followed by clinical problem-solving activities. Student feedback was collected by questionnaire, using closed and open-ended items. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results In total, 232/275 (84%) Year 1 and 258/350 (74%) Year 2 students responded to the questionnaire. Students found positive aspects of TBL included the small group dynamics, intra- and inter-team discussions, interactions with facilitators, provision of clinical contexts by clinicians, and the readiness assurance process. Suggested improvements included: better alignment of pre-reading tasks, shorter class time, increased opportunity for clinical reasoning, and additional feedback on the mechanistic flowchart. Resource efficiencies were identified, such as a reduction in the number of teaching sessions and required facilitators, and the ability to provide each classroom with clinical expertise. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that TBL, as a replacement for PBL in Years 1 and 2 of the medical curriculum, provided a standardised approach to small group learning on a large scale, and also provided resource efficiencies. Students perceived benefits related to the active learning strategy of TBL that encourage individual learning, consolidation of knowledge, retrieval practice, peer discussion and feedback. However, improvements are needed in terms of better alignment of pre-reading tasks with the TBL patient case, and greater facilitator interaction during the problem-solving activities. Additionally, consideration should be given to reducing class time, and providing TRAT scores.","['Team-based Learning', 'Medical Curriculum']","['Sydney Human', 'Human Research', 'Ethics Committee', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics approval', 'Ethics', 'approval Ethics', 'Committee', 'University', 'Sydney']",['2016/136.'],NaN

Especially after the implementation of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ( GDPR, 2016), the legal basis of secondary use of clinical trial data have been just under discussion between the European Commission ( European Commission, 2019) and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) ( EDPB, 2018;  EDPB, 2019). This regulation specific to the EU has great impact to the world because sharing personal data of the individual from the EU with countries outside the EU is governed by this regulation. Anonymized (de-identified) data is out of the scope of GDPR. ICMJE’s statement on IPD sharing is about this type of data, and anonymization methodology has been standardized by some clinical trial-related initiatives ( PhUSE, 2015) or by each academic society. However, genuine anonymized data may have more limitations, and processing personal data into anonymized ones before secondary use also requires a legal framework. Justification of secondary use of personal data, pseudo-anonymized and/or coded, is a prerequisite. In terms of GDPR, there are two possible avenues for justification: a) application of its article 89 of the GDPR for scientific research allows waiver of explicit consent of an individual, subject to appropriate privacy protection; b) justifiable consent to secondary use in line with Recital 33 (GDPR Recital 33) of the GDPR, which can be interpreted as broad consent, being subject to “recognized ethical standards”. To provide justification to above mentioned both approaches, the WGE argues the combined use of DoH and DoT should be the ethical basis in the framework of GDPR for secondary use of IPD based in the following reasons: The EDPB already recognized the DoH as the ethical foundation of informed consent (   EDPB, 2018), thus the DoT should be the foundation of valid consent for future secondary use of personal data;  The EU Clinial Trial Regulation already defined such consent for secondary use separate from consent to clinical trial participation (   EU Clinical Trial Regulation, 2014); and  The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) have already recognized “Broad informed consent” to secondary use in its guidelines (   CIOMS, 2016).  ","Expansion of data-driven research in the 21st century has posed challenges in the evolution of the international agreed framework of research ethics. The World Medical Association (WMA)'s Declaration of Helsinki (DoH) has provided ethical principles for medical research involving humans since 1964, with the last update in 2013. To complement the DoH, WMA issued the Declaration of Taipei (DoT) in 2016 to provide additional principles for health databases and biobanks. However, the ethical principles for secondary use of data or material obtained in research remain unclear. With such a perspective, the Working Group on Ethics (WGE) of the International Federation of Associations of Pharmaceutical Physicians and Pharmaceutical Medicine (IFAPP) suggests a closer scientific linkage in the DoH to the (Declaration of Taipei) DoT focusing specifically on areas that will facilitate data-driven research, and to further strengthen the protection of research participants.","['data sharing', 'Declaration Of Helsinki', 'Research Ethics', 'Privacy Protection', 'Data Science', 'Medicines Development', 'Declaration Of Taipei']","['European Unionâ', 'European Commission', 'Protection Regulation', 'Data Protection', 'General Data', 'GDPR', 'Data', 'European Data', 'European', 'Trial Regulation']",[],NaN

Additionally, an overview of the amount and quality of research on these instruments will be provided. Methods and analysis This review will be conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. We will adhere to the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guidelines and use a set of characteristics developed for assessment instruments for persons with ID, the Characteristics of Assessment Instruments for Psychiatric Disorders in Persons with Intellectual Developmental Disorders. Two comprehensive, systematic literature searches will be applied in 10 international databases, including ASSIA, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, OpenGrey and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. Risk of bias and quality assessment will be done according to COSMIN guidelines. We will apply the modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to rate the overall quality of the available evidence. Ethics and dissemination No ethics statement is needed for this study. The results will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and will be presented at international conferences.","['Dementia', 'Mental health', 'Statistics & Research Methods', 'Old Age Psychiatry']","['ethics statement', 'Ethics', 'study', 'peer-reviewed journal', 'dissemination', 'statement', 'needed', 'systematic review', 'leading peer-reviewed', 'international conferences']",[],NaN

However, applying natural variation among individuals requires careful evaluation among target species, snakes for example have little validation of such methods. Here we introduce a mark-free identification method for King Cobras (Ophiophagus hannah) from the Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve, in northeast Thailand using both subcaudal scale pholidosis (scale arrangement and number) and unique ventral body markings to distinguish individuals. This project aims to evaluate the impact of observer error on individual identification. Observers of varying expertise, will distinguish between King Cobra individuals using identifying photographs from a previous study. We will ask randomly assigned observers to distinguish individuals via: 1) subcaudal pholidosis, 2) ventral body markings, and 3) combination of both measures. Using Bayesian logistic regression, we will assess the probability observers correctly distinguish individuals. Based on exploratory observations, we hypothesise that there will be a high probability of correct identifications using subcaudal pholidosis and ventral body markings. We aim to stimulate other studies implementing identification techniques for scrutinous assessment of such methods, in order to avoid subsequent errors during long-term population studies.",[],"['Purpose Development', 'Suranaree University', 'Ethics Committee', 'Technology Ethics', 'Scientific Purpose', 'Ethics approval', 'licences held', 'ethical approval', 'National Park', 'Conservation Department']",[],NaN

Despite the constant increase in prevalence of obesity in the canine population and the major health consequences of this affection, few investigations have been carried out on the association between birth weight and the development of overweight in dogs. The purpose of the current study was to examine the association between birth weight and some other neonatal characteristics and overweight at adulthood in a population of purebred Labrador dogs. Information was collected about the sex, age, neuter status, birth weight, and growth rates (between 0-2 days and 2-15 days of age) in 93 Labrador dogs raised under similar environmental conditions until two months old. The body condition scores (BCS, scale of 1-9) of these dogs at adulthood were recorded, with BCS equal to or greater than 6 classified as overweight. Dogs were split into two groups based on the median birth weight in the population: lower than the median (LTM) and higher than the median (HTM). A logistic regression model was applied to analyse associations between the general characteristics of the dogs (sex, age, neuter status), early life parameters (birth weight, growth rates) and overweight at adulthood. Birth weight was the only early-life parameter found to be associated with overweight (p value = 0.032) with a prevalence of overweight of 70% among the dogs with LTM birth weight vs. 47% in dogs born with HTM birth weight. Overweight was also associated with age and neuter status (p value = 0.029 and 0.005 respectively). Our results suggest that, as in humans, dogs with the lowest birth weights are more likely to become overweight at adulthood. More studies are needed to further examine this relationship and to explore the underlying mechanisms. A subsequent objective could be to identify preventive strategies such as an adapted early nutrition programme for at-risk individuals.",[],"['Royal Canin', 'Canin Committee', 'Animal Ethics', 'Ethics approval', 'reference', 'Welfare', 'Ethics', 'Royal', 'Canin', 'Committee']",[],NaN

Qatar has a single trauma center, at the Hamad General Hospital, which serves as the hub for the trauma system that was verified as a level 1 trauma system by the Accreditation Canada International Distinction program in 2014. We hypothesized that this international accreditation was a major step, in the maturation process of the Qatar trauma system, that has positively impacted patient care, reduced complications and improved outcomes of trauma patients in such a rapidly developing country. Methods A retrospective analysis of data was conducted for all trauma patients who were admitted between 2010 and 2018. Data were obtained from the level 1 trauma center registry at Hamad Medical Corporation. Patients were divided into Group 1- pre-accreditation (admitted from January 2010 to October 2014) and Group 2- post-accreditation (admitted from November 2014 to December 2018). Patients' characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were analyzed and compared. Data included patients' demographics; injury types, mechanism and injury severity scores, interventions, hospital stay, complications and mortality (pre-hospital and in-hospital). Time series analysis for mortality was performed using expert modeler. Results Data from a total of 15,864 patients was collected and analyzed. Group 2 patients had more severe injuries in comparison to Group 1 (p Conclusions The international recognition and accreditation of the trauma center in 2014 was the key factor in the maturation of the trauma system that improved the in-hospital outcomes.

Design Prospective Randomised Interventional Study. Setting Renal Transplant Department in a tertiary centre in the United Kingdom. Participants 200 Renal transplant patients aged between 20 and 88 years. Telephone interviews were undertaken between 1st May, 2020 and 29th May, 2020, at the height of 'shielding' from COVID-19. Interventions Participants were randomised into 2 groups, with 1 group receiving a simple 'priming question' regarding the COVID pandemic and the other group having no prior contact. Main outcome measurements Individuals were then asked to rate their own overall lifetime happiness; desire to change; overall life satisfaction and momentary happiness on a scale of 1 to 10 for each measure. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare results between the two groups, with a type 1 error rate below 5% considered statistically significant. Results Participants' overall happiness with their life as a whole revealed that individuals who were primed with a question about COVID-19 reported increased overall happiness with their life compared to individuals who had not been primed (+0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 1.35, p = 0.0002). In addition, participants in the primed group reported less desire to change their life when compared to the non-primed group (-1.35, 95% confidence interval -2.06 to -0.65, p = 0.0002). Participants who were primed with the COVID-19 question also reported a higher overall satisfaction with their life than individuals who had not been primed (+1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.52, p = 0.0001). Finally, the participants who received the priming question demonstrated increased reported momentary happiness (+0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.24, p = 0.04). Conclusions The results demonstrated that bringing salience to the COVID-19 pandemic with a simple question leads to positive changes in both momentary happiness and other components of global life satisfaction, thereby extrapolating evidence for the application of the mood-as-information theory to more extreme life circumstances. Given the importance of patient-reported evaluations, these findings have implications for how, when and where accurate and reproducible measurements of life satisfaction should be obtained.",[],"['Elizabeth Hospital', 'Queen Elizabeth', 'CARMS committee', 'approval Protocol', 'relevant CARMS', 'Ethical approval', 'clinical audit', 'Hospital', 'Protocol', 'CARMS']",[],NaN

We investigated whether elevated NLR and a predominance of cholangiocarcinoma might predict poor prognosis in patients with resectable CHCC-CC. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic data of forty-two patients with CHCC-CC receiving hepatectomies at our hospital. We used Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression to analyze survival. Results Two-year disease-free survival and five-year overall survival rates were 43.2% and 32.9%, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that patients with NLR ≥3 had significantly worse 2-year DFS and 5-year OS rates. Univariant Kaplan-Meier survival analysis also associated these rates with a predominance in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, AJCC tumor stage, pathological T stage and lymph-vascular invasion. However, our multivariate analysis found NLR ≥3 to be the only independent predictor of disease recurrence and poorer survival. Conclusions Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was the most important independent predictor of poorer survival in patients with resectable CHCC-CC. Predominance of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, advanced AJCC tumor stage and pathological T stage, and lymph-vascular invasion also may affect poor prognosis in patients receiving complete tumor resections.",[],[],[],NaN

Demands for folate increase dramatically during pregnancy, low folate level has been associated with psychiatric disorders, and supplementation may improve symptomatology. The MTHFR C677T variant influences folate metabolism and has been implicated in depression during pregnancy. Objective To conduct a prospective longitudinal study to explore the relationship between MTHFR C677T genotype, folate levels, and postpartum psychopathology in at-risk women. Hypothesis In the first three months postpartum, folate will moderate a relationship between MTHFR genotype and depression, with TT homozygous women having more symptoms than CC homozygous women. Methods We recruited 365 pregnant women with a history of mood or psychotic disorder, and at 3 postpartum timepoints, administered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS); Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania (CARS-M) and the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) and drew blood for genotype/folate level analysis. We used robust linear regression to investigate interactions between genotype and folate level on the highest EPDS and CARS-M scores, and logistic regression to explore interactions with PANSS psychosis scores above/below cut-off. Results There was no significant interaction effect between MTHFR genotype and folate level on highest EPDS (p = 0.36), but there was a significant interaction between genotype, folate level and log(CARS-M) (p = 0.02); post-hoc analyses revealed differences in the effect of folate level between CC/CT, and TT genotypes, with folate level in CC and CT having an inverse relationship with symptoms of mania, while there was no relationship in participants with TT genotype. There was no significant interaction between MTHFR genotype and folate level on the likelihood of meeting positive symptom criteria for psychosis on the PANSS (p = 0.86).

In total, 855 community-dwelling individuals aged 65 and above, with an uninterrupted follow-up from August 2015 to March 2016, were enrolled. The participants wore a wristband sensor for an average of 7.8 days every three months. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between daily walking steps and sleep parameters, including the total sleep time, sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset (WASO), awakening time count during the night, and naptime. The median (interquartile range, IQR) age of the participants was 73 (69-78) years, with 317 (37.1%) men and 538 (62.9%) women. The median (IQR) educational level was 12 (11-12) years, and the median (IQR) Mini-Mental State Examination score was 29 (27-30) points.

Most of the nucleic acids, including genomic DNA from the bacilli and the host, binds to the filter paper. Next, several protocols were evaluated to elute the DNA from the paper, using qPCR to detect the insertion sequence IS6110, a M. tuberculosis complex genomic marker. The limit of detection (LOD) of the best protocol was then evaluated using parallel seeding and colony counting. The protocol was also evaluated using seventeen sputum samples, previously characterized by the GeneXpert or culture. Two instruments (the ABI7500 Standard and the Q3-Plus system) and two reagents storage formats (frozen or ready-to-use) were evaluated. Solutions containing guanidine isothiocyanate exerted the best liquefying effect on the mucin-based matrix extracted from one 6-mm punches, followed by a brief incubation at 95°C. The resulting DNA contained impurities, but a simple 1:10 dilution elicited the detection of MTB and human genomic targets. The described protocol presented an apparent LOD of 02 CFU/mL of MTB. Challenging the protocol with previously characterized samples showed substantial agreement with GeneXpert MTB/RIF results (sensitivity of 90%, agreement of 88.9%, kappa coefficient of 0.77), and moderate agreement with culture results (sensitivity of 100%, agreement of 78.9%, kappa coefficient of 0.58).

Methods:  Field notes from numerous team discussions and improvised internal training sessions were compiled into a checklist. Each author edited and revised the checklist and a consensus has been reached after an in-person discussion. Feedback from an academic expert in emergency services has been incorporated into the final version of the checklist.  Results:  Three main topics were identified: the need for quality-assured professional training, the clarification of role expectations including assigned responsibilities, opportunities to contribute and participate in the team building process, and the development of area-related ethical competence in the sense of shared moral public health literacy. Hence, we developed the following ad - hoc teaching methods: use of online teaching videos, practical exercises on intubation models and the collective development of an annotated, detailed checklist for all relevant work processes of the mobile corona unit based on everyday debriefings.

This study was premised on the null hypothesis that an artificially induced Ed or negative pressure does not impact MTI discharge. Moistube tubing was enclosed in a 1 m long PVC conduit. A 20 l water reservoir placed on an electronic balance provided a continuous supply of water whilst a three-speed hot air blower facilitated the radiative factor and advection process. The procedure was conducted under varied climatic conditions with three air velocity (ua) treatments namely; 1.2 m.s-1, 2.5 m.s-1, and 3.0 m.s-1 and the experiment run times were 159 h, 134 h and 10 h, respectively. The average temperature (Tave) and relative humidity (RH) data for ua = 1.2 m.s-1 were 53°C and 7.31%, whilst for ua = 2.5 m.s-1, Tave was 56°C and RH = 7.19%, and for ua = 3.0 m.s-1, Tave was 63°C and RH = 6.16%. The experimental data was input into the four variable Penman-Monteith method to compute the evaporative demand (Ed). For each Ed, the instantaneous mass flow rate ([Formula: see text]) was recorded using an electronic balance and subsequently converted to volumetric flow rates. For each of the air velocities, the respective Ed values obtained were 0.16, 0.31 and 0.36 mm.d-1. The Bowen ratios (r) were well below 1 (r < 1), which suggested a sufficient supply of moisture to evaporate. For Ed = 0.16 mm.d-1 the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was 113.08 mbars, whilst for Ed = 0.31 mm.d-1 and for Ed = 0.36 mm.d-1 the VPD were 129.93 mbars and 150.14 mbars, respectively. The recorded discharges (q) at normalised time (t*) = 1 h for Ed = 0.16 mm.d-1 was 7.67*10-3 l.hr-1.m-1 length, whilst for Ed = 0.31 mm.d-1 q = 14.5*10-3 l.hr-1.m-1 length, and for Ed = 0.36 mm.d-1 q = 20.8*10-3 l.hr-1.m-1 length. The imposed negative pressure causes an exponential increase in Moistube™ discharge, thus disproving the null hypothesis. The higher the evaporative demand the higher the discharge.

This position completely relegated the paternalistic model of physician-patients relationships. Nevertheless, some very unprotected and needy sectors request assistance, fully trusting on suitability and integrity of physicians without perceiving that they may be in a disadvantageous situation in which COIs could occurs. Harmful decisions can be made, biased towards defenseless people, so these COIs must be treated more rigorously than in other settings in medical fields. In relation to COI in medical research, it is well known that there are research studies where results have been reported in a biased way as a consequence of COI, these effects may prove harmful and may be reversed only after a considerably long time. In relation to teaching and in recommendations elaboration, deviations can occur due to COI that installs concepts that late rare transferred for years to clinical practice and that persist over time. Likewise, there are doubts in society about the integrity of health professionals who lose credibility in front of public opinion. This loss of credibility is due to the mantle of doubt that is installed before the eyes of patients who may consider that gifts, invitations or other types of benefits can affect their health and finally, their lives. It is difficult to prevent all negative effects of COI as Chren et al mentioned ( 15) “preserving justice, the trusteeship relationship with our patients, and our own altruism are regulative ideals — that is, standards not always achievable by all of us, but useful templates ‘against which all efforts can be measured.” From a legal point of view, the responsibility for the administration done by anybody who acts for or on behalf of another person has limits on his/her autonomy and freedom as there is a more powerful party entrusted to protect interests of a less powerful party. This could be similar to physician/patient relationship so any possibility of COI should be avoided to preserve the interests of the protected part. In order to regulate health care professionals, specific codes for various professionals have been approved. These codes for example prohibit members of a health care professional for practicing the profession if they are in a COI or in a professional misconduct ( 16). Many professions have their own COI legal documents. These documents were composed quite some years ago, but for medicine it was not until about 40 years ago that legal bodies were incorporated. Many medical organizations and journals were concerned about interactions between the industry and the medical profession and have introduced requirements for authors to disclose any financial interest they have in a study ( 16) Moreover, different types of articles written by authors with a financial interest were rejected. For example a very complete and excellent disclosure form was approved by American Association of Clinical Chemistry (AACC) ( 17). In the 1990s, many Colleges and Associations of Physicians from several countries outlined in position papers how to deal with relations between physicians and the industry, and it was acknowledged that not only real bias but also perceived bias should be avoided ( 18). Moreover, gifts or subsidies from industry “ought not to be accepted if acceptance might influence or appear to others to influence the objectivity of clinical judgment”. Also detailed recommendations on gifts and subsidies can be found in an opinion of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, which the American Medical Association (AMA) incorporated into its Code of Medical Ethics ( 18, 19). Sections on continuing education, research, clinical evaluation and surveillance studies were included, nonetheless, it was remarked that the main focus on patient care must be included. The guidelines do not forbidden research and education sponsoring by industry but only under regulated nature of manufacturers’ and physicians’ alliances. In relation to this, conference and courses organizers must have under control the content of events and no reference for endorsement of a sponsor’s product should be done. As regards to industry gifts, some associations guidelines are stricter. Furthermore, health professionals are discouraged from investing in companies where commercial success could be affected by practices of the professional. Criticism has frequently emerged and proposal for improvement have been sought ( 16). In 2012, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) approved a statement for all members integrating its structure at different levels that they are required to read this policy and sign the disclosure statement ( 20). As part of the statement definition, conditions for participantâ€™s exclusion, examples of potential COI and disclosure statement were included. At the same time also a statement for Ethics publication was also approved. Also Council of International Medical Societies (CIOMS) in its Ethical Guidelines for clinical research in COI guideline 25 dedicated to researchers, research institutions and research ethics committee mention, as an important topic for disclosure, requirements for education and highlight recommendations on disclosure to research ethics committees and to participants ( 21). The World Medical Association produced a statement on conflict of interest ( 22) with recommendations for research, needs in education and also items for health organization and Institution conflicts were included. Two other aspects of interest for laboratory medicine are included. One is related to self-referrals and fee-splitting as a point to keep in consideration and expresses that “all referrals and prescriptions (whether for specific goods or services) should be based on an objective assessment of the quality of the service or of the physician to whom the patient has been referred. Referral by physicians to health care facilities (such as laboratories) where they do not engage in professional activities but in which they have a financial interest is called self-referral. This practice has the potential to significantly influence clinical decision-making and is not generally considered acceptable unless there is a need in that particular community for the facility and other ownership is not a possibility (for example, in small rural communities)”. Also mentions that “kickbacks (or fee-splitting) occur when a physician receives financial benefit for referring a patient to a specific practitioner or for a specific service for which a fee is charged. This practice is not acceptable”. Second important point considers for “patient convenience, occurs if many physician offices are located in close geographic proximity to other medical services such as laboratories. The physician should not receive any financial compensation or other consideration either for referring a patient to these services, or for being located in close geographical proximity to them” ( 22). Some authors have researched the extent to which physicians interact with industry. Considering this goal there are many different types of articles published from 70s up to now referred to COI, industry and medical specialties and organizations in which frequency, relevance and implications of gifts from companies to researchers and others members in academic life, such as scientists, and found that these studies indicate that interactions are common and in various forms. Unfortunately studies have shown these interactions influence physicians and medical researchers for example on prescribing patterns ( 23), and the outcome of research studies to support a product. These findings did not show something unexpected and are in parallel with the budget spent for products promotion. Even taking into account these finding, many physicians consider that they are not likely to be influenced by their interactions with industry. In relation to publication ethics, focus on duplicate publication, inappropriate authorship, fabrication of data, plagiarism, and conflict of interest (COI) is paramount. The issue of COI is an important problem for medical journals. Relevant documents related to COI definition and disclosure include the COI Disclosure Form are those done by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) ( 24) and flowcharts by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) dealing with the omission of essential COI notes in research publications ( 25), which provide advice for publishers and editors.","Conflicts of interest (COI) exist in every step of life, including in medicine and science. Professionals who work in different areas of Health systems, such as physicians in care patient, in pharmaceutical and biomedical devices industries, in management positions, in teaching or in research, all must apply rigid ethical principles. It is possible with these actions that COI were detected in several circumstances such as in the prescribing therapy, in production or employment of technology in services of Health system, in article publications, and in decision-making for those who have decided to occupy positions of responsibility in scientific and healthcare institutions, in industry or professional associations, among others. These actions must be consistent with the essential principles of Bioethics. At present, COI disclosure has been irreversibly installed in Medicine. A detailed description of the classification of conflicts of interest and its ethical and legal implications in the practice of health sciences such as those that appear in the practice of clinical and laboratory medicine, pharmaceutical industry and also, research and publications are included. Final considerations on the management of COI are also included.","['Management', 'Ethics', 'Disclosure', 'Conflict Of Interest']","['COI', 'Belmont report', 'medical', 'HEALTH SCIENCES', 'LEGAL IMPORTANCE', 'research', 'HEALTH', 'Medical Association', 'clinical', 'INTEREST']",[],NaN

More than 60% of preventable maternal deaths occur in conflict areas and especially among the internally displaced persons (IDP). Between 2016 and 2018, unprecedented violence erupted in the Kasaï's region, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), called the Kamuina Nsapu Insurgency. During that period, an estimated three million of adolescent girls and women were forced to flee; and have faced growing threat to their health, safety, security, and well-being including significant sexual and reproductive health challenges. Between August 2016 and May 2017, the ""Sous-Cluster sur les violences basées sur le genre (SC-VBG)"" in DRC (2017) reported 1,429 Gender Based Violence (GBV) incidents in the 49 service delivery points in the provinces of Kasaï, Kasaï Central and Kasaï Oriental. Rape cases represented 79% of reported incidents whereas sexual assault and forced marriage accounted for respectively 11% and 4% of Gender Based Violence (GBV) among women and adolescent girls. This study aims to assess the availability of SRHS in the displaced camps in Kasaï; to evaluate the SRHS needs of young girls and women in the reproductive age (12-49). Studies of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have often included adolescent girls under the age of 15 because of high prevalence of child marriage and early onset of childbearing, especially in the humanitarian context. According to the 2013 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), about 16% of surveyed women got married by age 14 while the prevalence of early child marriage (marriage by 15) was estimated at 30%; to assess the use of SRHS services and identify barriers as well as challenges for SRH service delivery and use. Findings from this study will help provide evidence to inform towards more needs-based and responsive SRH service delivery. This is hoped for ultimately improve the quality and effectiveness of services, when considering service delivery and response in humanitarian settings. Data and methods We will conduct a mixed-methods study design, which will combine quantitative and qualitative approaches. Based on the estimation of the sample size, quantitative data will be drawn from the community-based survey (500 women of reproductive age per site) and health facility assessments will include assessments of 45 health facilities and 135 health providers' interviews. Qualitative data will comprise materials from 30 Key Informant Interviews (KII) and 24 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), which are believed to achieve the needed saturation levels. Data analysis will include thematic and content analysis for the KIIs and FGDs using ATLAS.ti software for the qualitative arm. For the quantitative arm, data analysis will combine frequency and bivariate chi-square analysis, coupled with multi-level regression models, using Stata 15 software. Statistic differences will be established at the significance level of 0.05. We submitted this protocol to the national ethical committee of the ministry of health in September 2019 and it was approved in January 2020. It needs further approval from the Scientific Oversee Committee (SOC) and the Provincial Ministry of Health.

Methods 133 patients with back pain, aged  Results The average age was 38.9 years. 47 (35.3%) patients received SpA diagnosis according to the clinical opinion. IBP was highly specific, 0.81 and sensitive, 0.83. HLA B27 was positive in a half of the SpA patients. SPBME ≥2 provided a great specificity, 0.94 and an acceptable sensitivity, 0.79. Erosion was significantly more frequent in SpA patients (72% vs 7%), specificity 0.93. The addition of erosion ≥1 to the WPBME ≥2 noticeably improved specificity, 0.98, although slightly decreased sensitivity, 0.64. Fat metaplasia and backfill were highly specific, but poorly sensitive. Factors forecasting positive diagnosis were IBP, followed by SpA features and increased CRP. Conclusions At the onset, IBP might be a good marker for selecting patients with suspicion of SpA. The addition of erosion to the ASAS criterion might be helpful for early diagnosis, especially in patients with doubtful STIR imaging where BME is present but it is hard to determinate whether the ASAS ""highly suggestive"" criterion is met.",[],"['Research Committee', 'Clinical Research', 'Ethics statement', 'Helsinki Declaration', 'study protocol', 'Committee', 'Research', 'Clinical', 'clinical practice', 'study']",['as'],NaN

It accounts for about 1-2% of pediatric kidney stones. In this study, we sought to identify the clinical characteristics of patients with cystinuria in a national cohort. Methods This was a retrospective study involving 30 patients from the Polish Registry of Inherited Tubulopathies. Initial data and that from a 6-month follow-up were analyzed. Mutational analysis was performed by targeted Sanger sequencing and, if applicable, MLPA analysis was used to detect large rearrangements. Results  SLC7A9  mutations were detected in 15 children (50%; 10 males, 5 females),  SLC3A1  mutations in 14 children (47%; 5 males, 9 females), and bigenic mutations in one male patient. The first clinical symptoms of the disease were detected at a median of 48 months of age (range 3-233 months). When individuals with different mutations were compared, there were no differences identified in gender, age of diagnosis, presence of UTI or urolithiasis, eGFR, calcium, or cystine excretion. The most common initial symptoms were urolithiasis in 26 patients (88%) and urinary tract infections in 4 patients (13%). Urological procedures were performed in 18 out of 30 (60%). Conclusions The clinical course of cystinuria is similar among patients, regardless of the type of genetic mutation. Most patients require surgery before diagnosis or soon after it. Patients require combined urological and pharmacological treatment for prevention of stone recurrence and renal function preservation.","['Children', 'Treatment', 'Urolithiasis', 'Cystinuria', 'Clinical Profile']","['approval Informed', 'Informed consent', 'Ethical approval', 'genetic testing', 'patients included', 'Informed', 'local ethics', 'study', 'Ethical', 'approval']",[],NaN

Academic success was evaluated twofold, i) whether the first state exam (M1) was passed at the earliest possible, after completion of the second year and ii) via the grades obtained. Results 81 out of 226 students enrolled participated in our study. Passing the M1 was best explained by semantic fluency including task switching. Moreover, academically successful students achieved significantly higher levels in the AMI-facets ""compensatory effort"" and ""engagement"". All students scored above average in the TMT-A and average in the ToL. Conclusion Alternating semantic fluency-requiring simultaneously inhibition, updating and task shifting-turned out highly predictive of academic success in medical school.

Resilience might buffer against psychophysiological stress response and therefore be crucial for well-being in professional caregivers.  Objectives:  We aimed to investigate if measures related to resilience [sense of coherence (SoC), self-efficacy and self-care] and attachment security of caregivers were cross-sectionally associated with stress markers in hair samples [cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)].  Method:  Participants ( n  = 134; 64.2% women) reported on individual resilience measures and provided hair samples for cortisol and DHEA assays. Attachment was assessed in a subsample using the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP,  n  = 69). Linear regression models were fitted to estimate the association between resilience measures and the Cortisol:DHEA ratio, cortisol and DHEA, controlling for gender and age.  Results:  SoC was associated with a lower Cortisol:DHEA ratio (β = -0.36,  p   p  = 0.002). Self-care was also associated with lower Cortisol:DHEA ratios (β = -0.24,  p  = 0.005), due to self-care being associated with higher DHEA (β = 0.21,  p  = 0.016).

The main finding of the research is that students start with the belief that ethics and CSR are developed for reasons of image and legitimacy; however, after receiving training on these topics through tools that take into account emotions and values, they start to value the importance of the company as an agent of social change. The main practical and managerial implication is that methods based on Web 2.0 and social media tools are useful to teach ethics and CSR; the theoretical contribution is that students take into account the welfare of others.

The scarcity of relevant resources in the contexts of some developing countries adds a further layer of difficulty to ethics education in these contexts. We used a consultative approach with students, teachers and external experts to develop a practical approach to medical ethics education. This study aimed to develop and refine a contextually relevant approach to ethics education in the region of Saudi Arabia. Methods The study utilised an explorative qualitative methodology to seek views of students and faculty of Rabigh Faculty of Medicine, Saudi Arabia, and international experts in the field of ethics and education to review and enhance a new ethics learning strategy which included a workbook-based tool. Three focus groups with 12 students, in-depth interviews with four faculty members and qualitative feedback from eleven external experts enabled the study participants to objectively critique the WBEL and provide feedback to enhance its quality. Thematic content analysis of the data was done to draw inferences which were used to refine the educational strategy. Results The analysis generated twenty-one sub-themes within four main themes: design features, content, teaching methods and assessment. These findings helped to design the educational strategy to improve its effectiveness in the given context. Conclusion The study drew on the views of students, faculty and external experts to systematically develop a novel approach to ethics education for countries like Saudi Arabia. It also demonstrated the use of the consultative approach for informing a culturally relevant educational strategy in the Middle East context.","['Ethics', 'Undergraduate Medical Education', 'Workbook', 'Educational Strategy']","['ethics review', 'Ethical considerations', 'review committee', 'ethics approval', 'South Wales', 'ethics', 'KAU', 'approval', 'study', 'Information Statement']","['393â€“15,', 'HC15640,']",NaN

The main aim of this study was to compare the demographic and clinical parameters between two cohorts before the onset of lockdown and within the pandemic. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed between two groups A and B, who presented with acute appendicitis three months prior to and after initiation of lockdown on March 24 2020 respectively in one of the tertiary centers of Nepal. These two cohorts were compared in demographics, clinicopathological characteristics and surgical aspects of acute appendicitis. Results There were 42 patients in group A and 50 patients in group B. Mean age of the patients was 31.32±17.18 years with male preponderance in group B (N = 29). Mean duration of pain increased significantly in group B [57.8±25.9(B) vs 42.3±25.0(A) hours, P = 0.004] along with mean duration of surgery [51.06±9.4(B) vs 45.27±11.8(A) minutes, P = 0.015]. There was significant decrease in post-operative hospital stay among group B patients [3.04±1.1(B) vs 3.86±0.67(A) days, P = 0.0001]. Complicated cases increased in group B including appendicular perforation in 10 cases. Similarly, mean duration of presentation to hospital significantly increased in group B patients with perforation [69.6±21.01 vs 51.57±17.63 hours, P = 0.008]. Conclusion During the adversity of the current pandemic, increased number of cases of acute appendicitis can be dealt with surgery as the chances of late presentation and complexity of the lesion exists.",[],[],[],NaN

In Bhutan, although guidelines exist on the prevention and management of wastes, the implementation is still hampered by technological, economic, social difficulties and inadequate training of staff responsible for handling these waste. The study aimed at assessing the awareness and practice of medical waste management among health care providers and support staff at the National Referral Hospital and its compliance with the existing National guidelines and policies. Materials and methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2019. Three research instruments were developed and used; (i) Demographic questionnaire, (ii) Awareness questions, and (iii) the Observational checklist. The data was coded and double entered into Epi data version 3.1 and SPSS version 18 was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to present the findings of the study. Results The majority of the respondents were female (54.1%) with a mean age of 32.2 (±7.67) years, most of whom have not received any waste management related training/education (56.8%). About 74.4% are aware of medical waste management and 98.2% are aware on the importance of using proper personal protective equipment. Only 37.6% knew about the maximum time limit for medical waste to be kept in hospital premises is 48 hours. About 61.3% of the observed units/wards/departments correctly segregated the waste in accordance to the national guidelines. However, half of the Hospital wastes are not being correctly transported based on correct segregation process with 58% of waste not segregated into infectious and general wastes. Conclusion The awareness and practice of medical waste management among healthcare workers is often limited with inadequate sensitization and lack of proper implementation of the existing National guidelines at the study site. Therefore, timely and effective monitoring is required with regular training for healthcare workers and support staff. Furthermore, strengthening the waste management system at National Referral Hospital would provide beneficial impact in enhancing safety measures of patients.",[],[],[],NaN

The technology is surrounded by value-conflicts and is subject to ongoing discussions. This study aims at contributing to the empirical-ethical debate by exploring women's viewpoints on egg freezing in Austria, where egg freezing for social reasons is currently not allowed. Methods Q-methodology was used to identify prevailing viewpoints on egg freezing. 46 female participants ranked a set of 40 statements onto a 9-column forced choice ranking grid according to the level of agreement. Participants were asked to explain their ranking in a follow-up survey. By-person factor analysis was used to identify distinct viewpoints which were interpreted using both the quantitative and the qualitative data. Results Three distinct viewpoints were identified: (1) ""women should decide for themselves"", (2) ""we should accept nature but change policy"", and (3) ""we need an informed societal debate"". These viewpoints provide insights into how biomedical innovations such as egg freezing are perceived by women in Austria and illustrate the normative tensions regarding such innovations. Conclusions Acknowledging the different prioritizations of values regarding assisted reproductive technologies is important to better understand the underlying normative tensions in a country where egg freezing for social reasons is currently not allowed. The study adds new empirical insights to the ongoing debate by outlining and discussing viewpoints of those directly affected: women. Following up on the lay persons perspective is particularly important in the context of future biomedical innovations that may challenge established norms and create new tensions. It therefore also adds to the societal debate and supports evidence-informed policy making in that regard.","['Ethics', 'Austria', 'Oocyte Cryopreservation', 'Social Egg Freezing', 'Viewpoints', 'Q-methodology', 'Egg Freezing']",[],[],NaN

We sought to explore the outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients treated with a multi-mechanism approach (MMA) in addition to standard-of-care (SC) versus patients who only received SC treatment. Materials and methods Data were collected retrospectively for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This observational cohort study was performed at five institutions, 3 in the United States and 2 in Honduras. Patients were stratified for MMA vs. SC treatment during ICU stay. MMA treatment consists of widely available medications started immediately upon hospitalization. These interventions target immunomodulation, anticoagulation, viral suppression, and oxygenation. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) for the index hospitalization and were measured using logistic regression. Results Of 86 patients admitted, 65 (76%) who had severe COVID-19 were included in the study; 30 (46%) patients were in SC group, compared with 35 (54%) patients treated with MMA group. Twelve (40%) patients in the SC group died, compared with 5 (14%) in the MMA group (p-value = 0.01, Chi squared test). After adjustment for gender, age, treatment group, Q-SOFA score, the MMA group had a mean length of stay 8.15 days, when compared with SC group with 13.55 days. ICU length of stay was reduced by a mean of 5.4 days (adjusted for a mean age of 54 years, p-value 0.03) and up to 9 days (unadjusted for mean age), with no significant reduction in overall adjusted mortality rate, where the strongest predictor of mortality was the use of mechanical ventilation.

In-Action Ethics The notion of in-action ethics is useful for elucidating emerging collaborative practices. A growing body of evidence is suggesting that practitioners are linking anticipatory ethics with their practice [ 30]. Healthcare professionals (and patients) are in other words struggling with ethical questions while they care. Instead of deciding in advance (and universally), what is “good”, people are challenged by situations. In other words, they act mindfully, and they improvise based on the stock of knowledge they bear [ 31, 32]. The notion of in-action ethics draws among other things on the well-known educational idea of “the reflective practitioner”. Here, the practitioner, rather than from schooling, learns from the complexity of situations by interacting with the world and its demands and materiality [ 33]. The concept of in-action ethics involves ethical reflections in practice and opens the possibility that not only researchers identify ethics in their fields of study. In addition, practitioners learn about ethics while they carry out their tasks. The notion of in-action ethics is helpful in opening up the discussions at the workshop, and to understand more of the clashes, contestations, and meaning making among groups articulating different care values."," Background Lately, patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease use telemonitoring services from home. We discuss three professional groups' idea of good care in terms of living as a chronically ill patient. Methods We scrutinize a workshop consisting of the following: (1) presentation of pre-workshop interviews focusing on good patient flows; (2) presentation of the participants' photos illustrating their idea of the good life with telemonitoring; (3) discussion of what the three social worlds of care can do together. We understand workshops as learning events founded on the symbolic interactionist idea of learning as reflexism. That is, the process where participants make joint action an object of attention. Results We propose that not only people, but also objects such as applications, gold standards, and financial arrangement are actively involved in hampering collaboration across social worlds.

The role of cardiac arrhythmias in COVID-19 is insufficiently understood. This study assesses the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and their prognostic implications in hospitalized COVID-19-patients. Methods A total of 166 patients from eight centers who were hospitalized for COVID-19 from 03/2020-06/2020 were included. Medical records were systematically analyzed for baseline characteristics, biomarkers, cardiac arrhythmias and clinical outcome parameters related to the index hospitalization. Predisposing risk factors for arrhythmias were identified. Furthermore, the influence of arrhythmia on the course of disease and related outcomes was assessed using univariate and multiple regression analyses. Results Arrhythmias were detected in 20.5% of patients. Atrial fibrillation was the most common arrhythmia. Age and cardiovascular disease were predictors for new-onset arrhythmia. Arrhythmia was associated with a pronounced increase in cardiac biomarkers, prolonged hospitalization, and admission to intensive- or intermediate-care-units, mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality. In multiple regression analyses, incident arrhythmia was strongly associated with duration of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Cardiovascular disease was associated with increased mortality. Conclusions Arrhythmia was the most common cardiac event in association with hospitalization for COVID-19. Older age and cardiovascular disease predisposed for arrhythmia during hospitalization. Whereas in-hospital mortality is affected by underlying cardiovascular conditions, arrhythmia during hospitalization for COVID-19 is independently associated with prolonged hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Thus, incident arrhythmia may indicate a patient subgroup at risk for a severe course of disease.","['Arrhythmia', 'Atrial fibrillation', 'Risk stratification', 'Hospitalization', 'Covid-19']",[],[],NaN

Participant consent was obtained verbally during the phone interview with the participants and recorded in the data collection system; no call recording took place in this study.","Food allergies are a potentially life-threatening health issue, and few studies have determined their prevalence throughout Saudi Arabia. The main objective of our study was to estimate the prevalence and distribution of self-reported food allergies, and explore their association with other health conditions among adults in Saudi Arabia. This study was a nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted via phone interviews in June 2020. A proportional quota-sampling technique was used to obtain equal distributions of participants by age and gender across the 13 regions of Saudi Arabia. Self-reported food allergy, height, weight, health conditions, mental health status, and demographic variables were collected. Of the 6239 participants contacted, 4709 (75.48%) participants responded and completed the interview. Furthermore, 50.1% of the participants were female, with a mean age of 36.4 ± 13.5 years (18-90 years). The prevalence of food allergies was 19.7%. The most self-reported food allergies were egg, shellfish and shrimp, and peanuts, with a prevalence of 3.7%, 3.1%, and 3.0%, respectively. There was an association between the presence of food allergies and reported bariatric surgery, asthma, colon disease, and being at risk of depression. Bariatric surgery was significantly associated with lower likelihood of self-reported allergy (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.22-2.34,  p  = 0.002). This study revealed, for the first time, a high prevalence of self-reported food allergies among adults in Saudi Arabia in a large nationwide sample, and food allergy association with bariatric surgery, asthma, colon disease, and being at risk of depression.

We aimed to determine whether lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) surgery in isolation is successful in restoring spinopelvic harmony, and whether the surgery maintained the relationship in those who present in a balanced state. Methods A retrospective radiographic analysis was performed on patients who underwent LLIF surgery, followed by posterior instrumented fusion, between January 2012 to August 2019 by a single surgeon (AD). Pre- and post-operative X-rays were reviewed by two authors using Surgimap spinal imaging 2.2.15.5. The LL, PI, and PI-LL mismatch, as well as a range of coronal and segmental sagittal radiographic parameters, were recorded. Results A total of 71 patients with 170 levels treated via LLIF were analysed. A mean pre-operative PI-LL of 14.3 degrees and post-operative value of 13.4 degrees was recorded (P=0.43). Of the 41 patients who were imbalanced pre-operatively, 13 (31.7%) were restored to a LL within 10 degrees of PI post-LLIF procedure. 30 patients presented in spinopelvic harmony, and 25 (83.3%) of those maintained that relationship following LLIF.

143,C:\Users\shweata\ethics_statement_2000_generic\PMC7799159\eupmc_result.json,PMC7799159,"Ethics and unintended consequences of stabilization care The ethics of stabilization and/or secure care further underscore a need for caution related to its implementation (Clark et al.  2019). From a public health ethics standpoint, the more coercive and intrusive an intervention (i.e., the extent to which it infringes upon individual liberties, including competent choice), the more it necessitates strong empirical and ethical substantiation to be considered justifiable (Nuffield Council on Bioethics  2007). Yet, the empirical evidence related to the effectiveness of stabilization care is of poor quality, and this intervention has the very real potential to violate a number of ethical principles. For example, stabilization care interventions and the contexts in which they would be implemented (locked psychiatric units and emergency rooms—likely in adult hospitals, due to the lack of pediatric hospitals across BC) greatly reduce youth’s liberty and autonomy to consent via highly restrictive and coercive actions. This undermining of youths’ decision-making capacity in substance use care—where youth may already be characterized as lacking in autonomy, due to paternalistic assumptions related to addiction and age—is both unwarranted and ethically problematic. This is particularly so in this setting, where other, less restrictive, ethical interventions are available to support the health and well-being of youth who use drugs, including drug-checking technologies, supervised consumption services, and voluntary substance use treatment. As is the case with other adolescent health issues (e.g., contraception, suicidality), supportive healthcare and family approaches that actively engage youth as participants in their care—rather than coercive and enforcement-oriented interventions—are most needed. If implemented in BC, we are highly concerned that the potential harms associated with stabilization and/or secure care may outweigh its benefits. It is well documented that rapid-withdrawal and abstinence-focused treatments among adults lower one’s opioid tolerance, which, given the high incidence of post-treatment relapse among people who use drugs, poses significant risk for (re)experiencing an overdose (Pilarinos et al.  2018; Srivastava et al.  2017). This issue is also relevant to youth who use drugs, as is reflected in BC’s Chief Coroner’s statement in response to stabilization care legislation (British Columbia Government News  2020). Of further concern, stabilization care risks jeopardizing access to healthcare. Within our own programs of research and clinical practice, youth frequently tell us that they actively avoid services, care providers, and/or peer and family supports that they experience as or perceive to be coercive. Taking this into account, stabilization care risks undermining clinician-client and family-child relationships, along with the linkages to supports that youth may benefit from most, including harm reduction and voluntary substance use treatment and care (Pilarinos et al.  2018). Moreover, fear of and/or experiences with stabilization care may deter youth from future engagement with the health care system, including calling 911 in the event of an overdose, due to concerns over potential (re)apprehension. Given the severity of the overdose crisis, and given that concerns about policing and enforcement are already known to deter people from seeking emergency help following an overdose (Karamouzian et al.  2019), the need to maintain youth engagement and trust in healthcare services is paramount. Like all public health interventions, the effects (both positive and negative) of stabilization care will also be inequitably distributed along a social gradient, with socially marginalized subgroups of youth experiencing the worst social and health outcomes. Unfortunately, it is well documented that intersecting forms of stigma and discrimination, including those related to substance use, are pervasive within the Canadian healthcare system (Public Health Agency of Canada  2019). And while substance use stigma may harm  all youth in stabilization care, key subpopulations of youth (e.g., those who are structurally vulnerable due to indigeneity, racialization, LGBTQ2+ identity, orÂ involvement with the child welfare system) are likely to face additional and heightened harms. Given healthcare access inequities faced, we urge proponents of stabilization care to consider the potential for inadvertent and unevenly distributed harms.","As is the case across Canada, the province of British Columbia is in the midst of an opioid overdose crisis. In response to the devastating impacts of this crisis on youth (under 19 years of age), the provincial government is considering amending the Mental Health Act to allow for involuntary, hospital-based stabilization care of youth following an overdose. This policy change represents one concrete action that the provincial government is exploring in response to public advocacy for enhanced supports for youth who overdose. At this juncture, however, we are concerned that stabilization care requires further interrogation in the context of key, interrelated public health and ethical dimensions pertaining to this legislation. In this commentary, we describe three key areas for public health deliberation: (1) the evidence underpinning stabilization care, (2) ethical considerations, and (3) the potential for unintended and unevenly distributed consequences. We then offer ways forward to guide and provide opportunities for a more equitable public health response to the overdose crisis and its impacts on youth. In doing so, we emphasize the need for meaningful engagement of youth as key stakeholders in the development of evidence- and ethics-informed substance use care and policy interventions.","['Youth', 'Opioid', 'Ethics', 'Health Policy', 'Substance Use', 'Overdose']","['stabilization care', 'care', 'stabilization', 'youth', 'Nuffield Council', 'health', 'unintended consequences', 'Clark', 'public health', 'Ethics']",['of'],NaN

The flow in AVFs is associated with the diameter of its vessels and thus with the AVF location. The main objective of this study is to assess the influence of AVF location and its patency on the self-reported quality of life (QOL) of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with past history of hemodialysis. Methods To gain clinical data, during a scheduled visit, 353 KTRs were asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire. From this group, 284 respondents were found eligible for analysis. The outcome was defined as prevalence of symptoms and health status, measured with the Left Ventricular Dysfunction-36 (LVD-36) Questionnaire in symptomatic patients. Results The hemodialysis patients ( n  = 243) were divided into two groups according to AVF location, i.e., DAVF - distally located AVF - ( n  = 174) and PAVF - proximally located AVF - ( n  = 69). The proportion of patients with heart failure (HF) was higher in PAVF group (24% vs. 12%,  p  = 0.0482). In the multivariable regression, PAVF, serum creatinine levels, and the presence of HF or coronary artery disease (CAD) remained independent predictors of lower functional capacity. Among patients with heart disease, the presence of active AVF was independently associated with worse functional outcome (higher LVD-36 scores). Conclusions The influence of persistent PAVF in KTRs seems to be unfavorable, especially when coexisting with CAD or HF.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease is suggested to be a rare complication of ESWL since it was reported in several cases to occur after ESWL. However, the clinical and immunological features of the ESWL-associated anti-GBM disease have not been fully investigated so far. Case presentation Here, we present the clinical, pathological, and immunological characteristics of three patients with the post-ESWL anti-GBM disease in our hospital. Anti-GBM disease occurred within a median of 22 months after ESWL treatment. It presented with similar clinical features to the classic anti-GBM disease, including fever, gross hematuria, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with poor renal prognosis. Sera from all patients recognized the α3(IV)NC1 in GBM, but with IgG2 and IgG4 as the dominant IgG subclasses. Conclusion Although further exploration is required to prove the causal relationship in this rare condition, our study reminds physicians that patients developing acute renal insufficiency after ESWL should lead to the suspicion of anti-GBM disease and in-time diagnosis and treatment.","['Antigen', 'Lithotripsy', 'ESWL', 'Anti-glomerular Basement Membrane Disease']","['statement Written', 'Written informed', 'Ethical policy', 'accompanying images', 'institutional review', 'review board', 'board statement', 'informed consents', 'Peking University', 'Written']",[],NaN

Study design Data were drawn from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, which starting in 1990 mailed questionnaires to 14,735 mothers in the UK, over 7 years from pregnancy onwards. Marginal structural models and multiple imputation were used to address time-varying confounding of the primary variables, testing for interaction between concurrent emotional/physical IPV and financial adversity, and adjusted for baseline age, ethnicity, education, partner's alcohol use, parity, depression, and social class. Results Emotional IPV (HR 1.44 (1.13,1.84)), physical IPV (HR 2.05 (1.21,3.49)), and financial adversity (HR 1.59 (1.44,1.77)) each predicted a multiplicative increase in the discrete-time hazard of incident homelessness. We identified joint effects for concurrent emotional IPV and financial adversity (HR 2.09 (1.35,3.22)) and concurrent physical IPV and financial adversity (HR 2.79 (1.21,6.44)). We further identified a temporary decline in self-reported physical IPV among mothers during pregnancy and up to 8 months post-partum. Conclusions Emotional and physical IPV and financial adversity independently and jointly increase the risk of incident homelessness. The effects of emotional and physical IPV are comparable to or greater than the risk of financial adversity. Homelessness prevention policies should consider IPV victims as high-risk, regardless of financial status. Furthermore, self-reported physical IPV declines temporarily during pregnancy and up to 8 months post-partum. Screening for IPV in this period may miss high-risk individuals.",[],[],[],NaN

Purpose The purpose of this study was to validate a scale created in order to assess the importance and fulfillment of information needs in patients after PCI. Methods A 10-item scale was created by the researchers to explore the level of information needs and the level of fulfillment of these needs. The total scores have a possible range of 10 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher importance and fulfillment. The validation of the questionnaire included face and content validity, construct validity, internal consistency, repeatability, and discriminant validity. Results Forty patients contributed to this validation. Mean and median scores for each question separately and also overall scores suggest that patients consider the need to be informed very important and that it was fulfilled to a very high degree (mean scores 39.5 and 39.3, respectively). All questions were found to be significantly correlated with the overall scores (rho > 0.3) meaning strong construct validity. Cronbach's α coefficients were high (>0.7) indicating great consistency. Both total scores had great repeatability, which suggests a high degree of reliability of the participants' responses (ICCs > 0.8). Regarding discriminant validity, a statistically significant association was observed only between marital status and the degree of fulfillment of the need to be informed (p = 0.036). More specifically, divorced or widowed patients had a lower degree of fulfillment than married patients (mean 38.6 vs. 39.6). Conclusion It is a reliable instrument that will help clinicians who are at close contact with patients after PCI to gain a better understanding of their needs.","['Validation', 'Heart Failure', 'Patient Needs']",[],[],NaN

Integrated knowledge translation (IKT) is a strategy of sustained stakeholder engagement that intends to address barriers to evidence use. We highlight an example of an IKT project alongside a randomized controlled trial of a public policy intervention that tested different disbursement patterns of income assistance among people who use drugs in Vancouver, British Columbia. Methods A case study design was used where an IKT strategy led by a knowledge broker embedded within the research team acts as the case. This case study evaluates the process and effectiveness of the integrated knowledge translation project by measuring intermediate outcomes within a Theory of Change created to map pathways to impact. Content analysis was performed using an evaluation template through document review, post-event evaluations, and detailed tracking of media, knowledge translation activities and requests for information. Results A host of knowledge translation products synthesized existing research about the harms of synchronized income assistance disbursement and supported stakeholder engagement, facilitating conversation, relationship building and trust with stakeholders. Engagement improved knowledge of the contextual feasibility for system change, and contributed experiential knowledge to study findings. A combination of access to information and stakeholder and media engagement led to increased acknowledgement of the issue by policy makers directly involved in the income assistance system. Conclusions This project shows how a multipronged approach to IKT addressed barriers to evidence-informed public policy and successfully contributed to increased public discourse around income assistance policy reform. Additionally, sustained engagement with diverse stakeholders led to improved contextual knowledge and understanding of potential community level impacts that, along with scientific results, improved the evidence available to inform system change. This case study provides insight into the role IKT can play alongside research aimed at public policy improvements.

Methods We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the relationship between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk using 33 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with coffee consumption from a genome-wide association (GWA) study on 212,119 female UK Biobank participants of White British ancestry. Risk estimates for breast cancer were retrieved from publicly available GWA summary statistics from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) on 122,977 cases (of which 69,501 were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, 21,468 ER-negative) and 105,974 controls of European ancestry.

One of the serious complications is mineral-bone disorder (CKD-MBD) which might determine the prognosis of patients and their quality of life. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is a phosphaturic hormone which is involved in the pathogenesis of CKD-MBD. The purpose of the study was to determine what comes first in children with CKD: FGF-23 or phosphate.  Materials and Methods:  This cross-sectional study included 73 children aged 2-18 years with CKD stages 1-5. We measured FGF-23 and other bone markers in blood samples and studied their associations.  Results:  Early elevations of FGF-23 were identified in children with CKD stage 2 compared with stage 1 (1.6 (1.5-1.8) pmol/L versus 0.65 (0.22-1.08),  p  = 0.029).

Our study revealed that the elevated level of FGF-23 went ahead hyperphosphatemia and elevated PTH. Thus, more than 50% of children with CKD stage 2 had the elevating level of serum FGF-23, and that index became increasing with the disease progression and it achieved 100% at the dialysis stage. The serum phosphate increased more slowly and only 70.6% of children with CKD stage 5 had the increased values. The PTH increase was more dynamic.

Results Five hundred and twenty HCV-infected PWID treated with all-oral DAA-based regimens were enrolled; a total of 168 (32.3%) patients presented genotype 1a, 109 (21.0%) genotype 1b, and 174 (33.5%) genotype 3; a total 152 of the 520 subjects (29.2%) were cirrhotics; a total 118 (22.7%) and 373 (71.7%) were treated with DAA regimens of second and third generation, respectively; a total 169 (33.6%) patients were receiving an opioid agonist at the start of antiviral therapy. Only 11 subjects (2.1%) did not show an SVR12. A significant correlation was found between treatment with opioid substitution therapy ( p   p  = 0.002), and treatment with first- or second-generation regimens ( p  = 0.0015) and HCV failure. Upon multivariate analysis, treatment with a first- or second-generation DAA was the only factor independently associated with failure (OR 10.4, 95% CI: 1.43 to 76.1,  p  = 0.02). Conclusions Treatment with DAAs led to a high SVR12 rate (97.9%) in a large cohort of HCV-infected PWID.

Developed for use with the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP), it is a highly individualized approach to measurement. CO-OP is currently being studied in childhood-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders (HMD) and deep brain stimulation. The purpose of this study was to compare two different approaches to rating performance, generic (PQRS-G) and individualized (PQRS-I), for children with childhood-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders (HMD) including dystonia. Method Videotaped activity performances, pre and post intervention were independently scored by two blind raters using PQRS-G PQRS-I. Results were examined to determine if the measures identified differences in e performance on goals chosen by the participants and on change scores after intervention. Dependent t-tests were used to compare performance and change scores. Results The two approaches to rating both have moderate correlations (all data: 0.764; baseline: 0.677; post-intervention: 0.725) and yielded some different results in capturing performance. There was a significant difference in scores at pre-intervention between the two approaches to rating, even though post-intervention score mean difference was not significantly different. The PQRS-I had a wider score range, capturing wider performance differences, and greater change between baseline and post-intervention performances for children and young people with dystonic movement. Conclusions Best practice in rehabilitation requires the use of outcome measures that optimally captures performance and performance change for children and young people with dystonic movement. When working with clients with severe motor-performance deficits, PQRS-I appears to be the better approach to capturing performance and performance changes.","['Performance', 'Deep brain stimulation', 'Dystonia', 'Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders', 'Performance Quality Rating Scale', 'Co-op Approach']",[],[],NaN

","A clinical trial performed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), among persons with epilepsy (PWE) infected with  Onchocerca volvulus  treated with anti-seizure medication suggested that ivermectin reduces the seizure frequency. We assessed the effect of ivermectin treatment on seizure frequency in PWE with and without anti-seizure medication in three onchocerciasis endemic areas (Maridi, South Sudan; Aketi, DRC; and Mahenge, Tanzania). Pre- and 3-5 months post-ivermectin microfilariae densities in skin snips and seizure frequency were assessed. After ivermectin, the median (IQR) percentage reduction in seizure frequency in the study sites ranged from 73.4% (26.0-90.0) to 100% (50.0-100.0). A negative binomial mixed model showed that ivermectin significantly reduced the seizure frequency, with a larger decrease in PWE with a high baseline seizure frequency. Mediation analysis showed that ivermectin reduced the seizure frequencies indirectly through reduction in microfilariae densities but also that ivermectin may have a direct anti-seizure effect. However, given the short half-life of ivermectin and the fact that ivermectin does not penetrate the healthy brain, such a direct anti-seizure effect is unlikely. A randomized controlled trial assessing the ivermectin effect in people infected with  O. volvulus  who are also PWE on a stable anti-seizure regimen may be needed to clarify the causal relationship between ivermectin and seizure frequency.","['Epilepsy', 'Ivermectin', 'Seizures', 'Onchocerciasis']","['Public Health', 'South Sudan', 'Medical Research', 'National Institute', 'Ethical Approval', 'Participate Ethical', 'Ethical', 'ethical committee', 'Health', 'participants']",[],NaN

Consumers' preferences for food attributes have been extensively examined, focusing on specific aspects of attributes with specific food products. It is less clear how consumers evaluate the relative importance of the key food attributes in general. Applying the commonly adopted classification of food attributes into endogenous attributes (i.e., safety and freshness) and exogenous attributes (i.e., genetically modified (GM)-free and organic), the relative importance of these attributes for consumers was investigated. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of preferences was explored to identify distinct subgroups of consumers who may differ in valuing various food attributes. An online survey of 489 city dwellers in Australia revealed that the endogenous attributes were regarded as the most important in an order of safety and freshness. The exogenous attributes were rated as much less important. Three profiles with distinctive preferences for food attributes were identified: Not Fussy (12% of participants), Quality First (49%) and Choosy (39%). The findings suggest that consumers value the importance of various food attributes in a hierarchical order, and there is significant heterogeneity in consumers' food preference.

Therefore, induction and etiology are largely unclear. It is controversial if the induction of autoimmunity occurs in the liver or in the spleen. In our experimental murine AIH model, the induction of autoimmunity did not occur in the spleen. Instead, a protective role of the spleen could be more likely. Therefore, we splenectomized mice followed by induction of experimental murine AIH. Splenectomized mice presented more severe portal inflammation. Furthermore, these mice had more IL-17, IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) and caspase 3 (casp3) and a decreased amount of erythropoietin in serum, while intrahepatic T cell compartments were unaffected.

We used a modified multimodal odd-ball paradigm with fearful facial expressions accompanied by congruent and non-congruent emotional vocalizations (sounds of women screaming and laughing) to investigate the impairment of emotional perception and reactions to other people's emotions in schizophrenia. We compared subjective ratings of emotional state and event-related potentials (EPPs) in response to congruent and non-congruent stimuli in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. The results showed the altered multimodal perception of fearful stimuli in patients with schizophrenia. The amplitude of N50 was significantly higher for non-congruent stimuli than congruent ones in the control group and did not differ in patients. The P100 and N200 amplitudes were higher in response to non-congruent stimuli in patients than in controls, implying impaired sensory gating in schizophrenia. The observed decrease of P3a and P3b amplitudes in patients could be associated with less attention, less emotional arousal, or incorrect interpretation of emotional valence, as patients differed from healthy controls in the emotion scores of non-congruent stimuli. The difficulties in identifying the incoherence of facial and audial components of emotional expression could be significant in understanding the psychopathology of schizophrenia.","['EEG', 'Schizophrenia', 'Event-related potentials', 'perception', 'Fearful Expressions', 'Non-congruent Sounds']","['Higher Nervous', 'Nervous Activity', 'Clinical Hospital', 'Ethical Statement', 'Alekseev Psychiatric', 'Psychiatric Clinical', 'ethical board', 'ethics board', 'study protocol', 'IHNA']",[],NaN

In patients with ovarian carcinoma, a high amount of ascites (>500 mL) is an independent negative prognostic marker. The composition and constituents of ascites reflect the inflammatory environment of the underlying tumor. Increased cellular resistance of ascites-derived tumor cells and the development of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) are major risks for these patients, especially in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma. In this study, we discuss the release of tissue factor-bearing extracellular vesicles (TF +  EVs) from tumor cells into the environment (ascites fluid) and their systemic spreading as a possible causal explanation of the pathologic coagulation status in these patients. We obtained ascites from patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma, collected during surgery or therapeutic paracentesis (n = 20). Larger ectosome-like EVs were isolated using sequential centrifugation, quantified by high-resolution flow cytometry and analyzed using nanoparticle tracking analysis. Furthermore, the pro-coagulant properties (TF activity) of EVs were determined. Compared to published TF activities of EVs from healthy persons, TF activities of EVs derived from ascites of patients with ovarian cancer were very high, with a median of 80 pg/mL. The rate of VTE, as reported in the patient files, was high as well (35%, 7 out of 20). Furthermore, all but one patient with VTE had EV concentrations above the median within their ascetic fluid ( p  < 0.02). Since VTE continues to be a frequent cause of death in cancer patients, prophylactic antithrombotic treatment might be worth considering in these patients. However, given the risk of bleeding, more clinical data are warranted. Although the study is too small to enable reaching a conclusion on direct clinical implementation, it can well serve as a proof of principle and a rationale to initiate a prospective clinical study with different patient subgroups. We also show ex vivo that these larger ectosome-like EVs induce intracellular ERK phosphorylation and tumor cell migration, which is not directly related to their pro-coagulative potency, but might help to understand why cancer patients with thromboembolic events have a poorer prognosis.","['Thrombosis', 'Tissue factor', 'ascites', 'Extracellular Vesicles']",[],[],NaN

Adolescents with a visible difference (ie, disfigurement) often experience challenging social situations such as being stared at, receiving unwanted questions or being teased. As a consequence, some of these adolescents experience adverse psychosocial outcomes and appearance-related distress. To address this appearance-related distress, an online psychotherapeutic intervention, YP Face IT, has been developed. YP Face IT uses social interaction skills training and cognitive-behavioural therapy. The Dutch YP Face IT Study tests whether this intervention is effective in reducing social anxiety and improving body esteem. Methods and analysis Participants are adolescents aged 12-18 with a visible difference and experiencing appearance-related distress.

Many differences in academic performance have been associated with the sex of the student.  Objectives : This study aims to understand the impact of absenteeism on the final grades earned by full-time medical laboratory sciences undergraduate students and whether this is affected by sex. Academic performance was analyzed using students' final grades from two consecutive semesters (January to April and September to December 2019). The differences between male (n = 43) and female (n = 72) students were evaluated by Pearson's correlation. During the semester, all teaching and assessment methods were standardized across both course sections to avoid confounding effects derived from the teaching method. Academic performance was assessed both objectively (multiple-choice questions) and subjectively (short essay questions). The mean scores of male and female students during two semesters were significantly different (p = 0.0180). To correlate marks with absenteeism, the correlation coefficient (r) was negative, which indicates an inverse correlation between absence rate and scores. Interestingly, a statistically significant correlation between absenteeism and final grades was found in the male sample population (p = 0.0011 for the first semester; p = 0.0255 for the second semester) that was not observed for their female counterparts (p = 0.2041; p = 0.1537). The results indicate that academic performance among women is not solely dependent on class attendance but likely involves other factors such as self-learning, and group discussion. The mean scores of female medical sciences students were significantly higher than the male students for two consecutive semesters. Male overall scores seem to be conditional on the instructor's explanation. This sex-based variation in academic performance revealed by taking absenteeism rate into account warrant further investigation.","['Sex', 'Grade', 'Absenteeism', 'Academic Performance', 'Self-learning']","['King Khalid', 'Khalid University', 'University Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'approval number', 'sensitive data', 'personal information', 'Ethics approval', 'ECM', 'Ethical Committee']","['ECM#2020-183â€“(HAPO-06-B-001),', 'ECM#2020-183â€“(HAPO-06-B-001)']",NaN

There are very few studies reporting spectrum of predialysis patients' symptoms in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Furthermore, the clinical significance of predialysis patients' symptoms for PD patients' prognosis remains unknown. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, patients who started PD during 1 January 2006 to 31 January 2018 were included. Patients' predialysis symptoms and clinical parameters were obtained. Both the short- and long-term patients' outcome were investigated by Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier's survival analysis to identify the relationship between clinical symptoms and patients' mortality on PD. Results A total of 898 incident PD patients were included. The anorexia (58%) was the most common predialysis symptom in the present cohort, followed by insomnia (32.7%), fatigue (27.6%), syndromes of heart failure (27.6%), and nausea (20.5%). The only symptom significantly associated with both six-months and 12-months mortality on PD was nausea (HR 2.359, 95% CI 1.377-4.040,  p =.002 and HR 1.791, 95% CI 1.176-2.729,  p =.007, respectively).

Most COVID-19 related studies in Ethiopia mainly focused on the general population, whereas, this study aimed to assess the knowledge of COVID-19 and preventive behaviors among waiters in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 1 to June 15, 2020, among waiters working in food and drinking establishments found in Mizan-Aman, Jemu, and Masha towns in Southwest Ethiopia. A total of 422 waiters were selected using a simple random sampling technique, and the data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. The data were entered into Epi-data manager version 4.0.2 and analyzed using SPSS version 22.

This includes the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, and Lishui People’s Hospital, Lishui City, respectively. Prior to direct sequencing of 16S rDNA PCR products, bacterial identification was conducted routinely using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) [ 40]. The isolated  K. pneumoniae ( Table S1) were cultivated overnight on either MacConkey agar media [or Luria-Bertani Broth (LB) agar plates] or LB liquid medium at 37°C for further sequence typing and plasmid isolation.","Co-occurrence of hypervirulence and KPC-2 carbapenem resistant phenotypes in a highly-transmissible ST11 clone of Klebsiella pneumoniae  has elicited deep concerns from public health stand point. To address this puzzle, we conducted a large-scale epidemiological, clinical and genomic study of  K. pneumonia  ST11 clones with both hypervirulence and carbapenem resistance in two tertiary hospitals in Zhejiang province. Most of the patients (15/23) were diagnosed with exclusively carbapenem-resistant  K .  pneumoniae  (CRKP) infections. Ten death cases were reported, some of which are due to the failure of antibiotic therapies. As a result, we identified one new rare sequence types (ST449) to KPC-2-producing CRKP, in addition to the dominant ST11. These clinical isolates of  K. pneumoniae  are multi-drug resistant and possess a number of virulence factors. Experimental infections of wax moth larvae revealed the presence of hypervirulence at varied level, suggesting the complexity in bacterial virulence factors. However, plasmid curing assays further suggested that the  rmpA2 -virulence plasmid is associated with, but not sufficient for neither phenotypic hypermucoviscosity nor virulence of  K .  pneumoniae .

We recruited 12 individuals using trans community-based networks facilitated by the Gender Centre. Each individual participated in an in-depth, semi structured interview conducted by a peer interviewer. Interviews were analysed thematically. Findings Participants had a range of complex health needs to manage, including ongoing access to gender-affirming hormones, mental health care and sexual health care. Some also had chronic diseases. Accordingly, scheduling appointments and affording the co-payments required were major preoccupations. Most participants were not in full time work, and economic hardship proved to be a major compounding factor in issues of healthcare access, impacting on the choice of clinician or practice. Other barriers to accessing health included issues within health services, such as disrespectful attitudes, misgendering, 'deadnaming' (calling the person by their previous name), displaying an excessive interest is aspects of the participants' life that were irrelevant to the consultation, and displaying ignorance of trans services such that the participants felt an obligation to educate them. In addition, participants noted how stereotyped ideas of trans people could result in inaccurate assumptions about their healthcare needs.

However, pulmonary tuberculosis is diagnosed in some patients, and healthcare workers could therefore be exposed to tuberculosis if sufficient precautions are not taken. In this study, we examined the proportion of and factors associated with unexpected exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis during bronchoscopy using radial probe EBUS. Methods This retrospective study included 970 patients who received bronchoscopy using radial probe EBUS between December 2015 and November 2018. Clinical, histological, radiological, and microbiological data were reviewed. Results Pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 31 patients (3.2%) during bronchoscopy using radial probe EBUS. Patients with a lower age were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with tuberculosis than elderly patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.951; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.924-0.978; P = 0.001).

We aimed to evaluate the performance of the assay compared with 5' UTR sequencing in clinical samples. Materials and methods Eligible individuals were treatment chronic hepatitis C patients that were enrolled consecutively in a medical center and two core regional hospitals in southern Taiwan from Oct 2017 through Aug 2018. The patient with genotype 1 without subtype and indeterminate previously genotyped by Abbott RealTime HCV GT II will further determinate by Abbott HCV RealTime HCV GT Plus. All of the genotype results were validated by 5' UTR sequencing as a reference standard. Results A total of 100 viremic CHC patients were recruited, including 63 G-1 patients (male: 28), and 37 patients (male: 15) of indeterminate genotyped by Abbott RealTime HCV GT II assay (HCV GT II), respectively.

The aim of this study was to explore postoperative morbidity and mortality and long-term outcomes of cirrhotic patients after LPD. The study was a one-center retrospective study comprising 353 patients who underwent LPD between October 2010 and December 2019. A total of 28 patients had liver cirrhosis and were paired with 56 non-cirrhotic counterparts through propensity score matching (PSM). Baseline data, intra-operative data, postoperative data, and survival data were collected. Postoperative morbidity was considered as primary outcome whereas postoperative mortality, surgical parameters (operative durations, intraoperative blood loss), and long-term overall survival were secondary outcomes. Cirrhotic patients showed postoperative complication rates of 82% compared with rates of patients in the control group (48%) (P = 0.003). Further, Clavien-Dindo ≥III complication rates of 14% and 11% (P = 0.634), Clavien-Dindo I-II complication rates of 68% and 38% (P = 0.009), hospital mortality of 4% and 2% (P = 0.613) were observed for cirrhotic patients and non-cirrhotic patients, respectively. In addition, an overall survival rate of 32 months and 34.5 months (P = 0.991), intraoperative blood loss of 300 (200-400) ml and 150 (100-250) ml (P<0.0001), drain amount of 2572.5 (1023.8-5275) ml and 1617.5 (907.5-2700) ml (P = 0.048) were observed in the cirrhotic group and control group, respectively. In conclusion, LPD is associated with increased risk of postoperative morbidity in patients with liver cirrhosis. However, the incidence of Clavien-Dindo ≥III complications and post-operative mortality showed no significant increase. In addition, liver cirrhosis showed no correlation with poor overall survival in patients who underwent LPD.

Patient data received from CPRD is fully anonymised.," Background Bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract are a frequent complication of influenza and contribute to the widespread use of antibiotics. Influenza vaccination may help reduce both appropriate and inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics. Electronic health records provide a rich source of information for assessing secondary effects of influenza vaccination. Methods We conducted a retrospective study to estimate effects of influenza vaccine on antibiotic (amoxicillin) prescription in the elderly based on data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. The introduction of UK policy to recommend the influenza vaccine to older adults in 2000 led to a substantial increase in uptake, creating a natural experiment. Of 259,753 eligible patients that were unvaccinated in 1999 and aged≥65y by January 2000, 88,519 patients received influenza vaccination in 2000. These were propensity score matched 1:1 to unvaccinated patients. Time-to-amoxicillin was analysed using the Prior Event Rate Ratio (PERR) Pairwise method to address bias from time-invariant measured and unmeasured confounders. A simulation study and negative control outcome were used to help strengthen the validity of results. Results Compared to unvaccinated patients, those from the vaccinated group were more likely to be prescribed amoxicillin in the year prior to vaccination: hazard ratio (HR) 1.90 (95% confidence interval 1.83, 1.98). Following vaccination, the vaccinated group were again more likely to be prescribed amoxicillin, HR 1.64 (1.58,1.71). After adjusting for prior differences between the two groups using PERR Pairwise, overall vaccine effectiveness was 0.86 (0.81, 0.92). Additional analyses suggested that provided data meet the PERR assumptions, these estimates were robust. Conclusions Once differences between groups were taken into account, influenza vaccine had a beneficial effect, lowering the frequency of amoxicillin prescribing in the vaccinated group. Ensuring successful implementation of national programmes of vaccinating older adults against influenza may help contribute to reducing antibiotic resistance.",[],"['Advisory Committee', 'Independent Scientific', 'Scientific Advisory', 'CPRD Independent', 'Ethics approval', 'approval Approval', 'ISAC', 'Committee', 'approval', 'Independent']",[],NaN

No qualitative assessment has yet described the physical and mental health conditions of frontline medical personnel in the COVID-19 outbreaks.  Methods:  Here, 251 frontline medical personnel involved in COVID-19 missions completed electronic questionnaires, consisting of 31 categorical variables related to their physical and mental health status, medical history and environmental conditions. We constructed a correlation amongst these variables through pairwise Kendall rank correlation coefficient test. Then, clusters of highly correlated variables were identified using the leading eigenvector. Finally, we used the network and clusters to clarify the correlations amongst variables.  Results:  This qualitative study identified the six clusters. Cluster 1 was characterized by skin allergy. Cluster 2 was predominantly associated with anxiety. Cluster 3 consisted mostly of respiratory symptoms. The participants in cluster 4 had medical history. Cluster 5 and cluster 6 were characterized by disinfection and demography, respectively. Finally, we revealed three major findings. First, more than 80% of medical personnel worry about COVID-19-related infection and experience newly appearing anxiety (56.2%), airway or heart symptoms (34.3%) and skin allergies (20.3%). Second, COVID-19-related worry significantly associates with all variables in the anxiety and respiratory symptom clusters. Third, new-onset skin allergies did not associate with either disinfection or anxiety, but did associate with a previous history of allergies.  Conclusions:  COVID-19-related worry leads to physical and mental health problems amongst medical personnel.

Chiropractic students from 25 chiropractic training institutions completed interrelating surveys (combined response rate 21.9%) between 2013 and 2018. The survey instrument investigated student viewpoints about chiropractic professional identity, role, practice setting and future direction of chiropractic practice. Student attitudes about chiropractic were described using weighted proportions to adjust for unequal population sampling across the three geographical regions. The frequency of concordant and discordant student responses was described by combining identity items with items that explored responses about practice role, setting and future direction. The relationship between student characteristics (age, sex, education, association membership and geographical region) and ideologically conflicting responses were assessed using the Chi-squared test and Cramér's V. Results Data from 2396 student chiropractors (50.8% female; from Europe 36.2%, North America 49.6% and Australia/New Zealand 14.5%) were analysed. For identity, nearly half of the chiropractic students (weighted 45.1%) agreed that it is important for chiropractors to hold strongly to the traditional chiropractic theory that adjusting the spine corrects ""dis-ease"" and agreed (weighted 55.5%) that contemporary and evolving scientific evidence is more important than traditional chiropractic principles. The frequency of discordant (ideologically conflicting) student responses ranged from 32.5% for statements about identity versus role, to 51.4% for statements about identity versus future. There was no association between student age, sex and internally conflicting responses. Chiropractic students' professional association membership status, pre-chiropractic education and geographical region were associated with ideologically conflicting responses. Conclusions Chiropractic students in this analysis show traditional and progressive attitudes towards the chiropractic profession.

There are differences in the prognosis and treatment of CCAM and BPS, and the clinical diagnosis and treatment plan is usually prepared prior to birth. Therefore, it is quite necessary to make a clear diagnosis before delivery. CCAM and BPS have similar imaging features, and the differentiation mainly relies on the difference in supply vessels. However, it is hard to distinguish them due to invisible supplying vessels on some images. Aim To explore the application value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the differential diagnosis of fetal CCAM and BPS. Methods Data analysis for 32 fetuses with CCAM and 14 with BPS diagnosed by prenatal MRI at Huzhou Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital and Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital from January 2017 to January 2020 was performed to observe the source blood vessels of lesions and their direction. Pathological confirmation was completed through CT examination and/or operations after birth. Results After birth, 31 cases after birth were confirmed to be CCAM, and 15 were confirmed to be BPS. The CCAM group consisted of 21 macrocystic cases and 10 microcystic cases. In 18 cases, blood vessels were visible in lesions. Blood supply of the pulmonary artery could be traced in eight cases, and in 10 cases, only vessels running from the midline to the lateral down direction were observed. No lesions were found in four macrocystic cases and one microcystic case with CCAM through CT after birth; two were misdiagnosed by MRI, and three were misdiagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography. The BPS group consisted of 12 intralobar cases and three extralobar cases. Blood vessels were visible in lesions of nine cases, in four of which, the systemic circulation blood supply could be traced, and in five of which, only vessels running from the midline to the lateral up direction were observed. Three were misdiagnosed by MRI, and four were misdiagnosed by prenatal ultrasonography. Conclusion CCAM and BPS can be clearly diagnosed based on the origin of blood vessels, and correct diagnosis can be made according to the difference in the direction of the blood vessels, but it is hard distinguish microcystic CCAM and BPS without supplying vessels.

Independently, these two morbidities are responsible for high risk of in-hospital and post-discharge deaths and hospital readmissions. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the risk of death among severely anaemic children with moderate to severe acute malnutrition compared to children with severe anaemia alone. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of data collected from a large prospective study that was investigating severe anaemia in children aged less than 5 years old. The study was conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre and Chikhwawa district hospital in southern Malawi. Children aged less than five years old; with severe anaemia were screened and enrolled. Each child was followed up for eighteen months at one, three, six, twelve and eighteen months after enrolment. Data were analysed using STATA 15. Results Between July 2002 and July 2004, 382 severely anaemic children were enrolled in the main study. A total of 52 children were excluded due to missing anthropometric data. Out of the 330 included, 53 children were moderately to severely malnourished and 277 were not. At the end of the 18-month follow period, 28.3% of children with MAM/SAM died compared to 13% of children without MAM/SAM (RR 2.1, CI 0.9-4.2, p = 0.03). Similarly, children with moderate to severe malnutrition reported a significantly higher number of malaria infection cases (33.9%) compared to children with severe anaemia alone (27.9%, p = 0.02). However, the number of hospitalizations and recurrence of severe anaemia was similar and not statistically significant between the two groups (RR 0.8 (0.4-1.4), p = 0.6 and RR 1.1 (0.3-2.8), p = 0.8).

Aim The demographic description of reported patients with parkinsonism (including Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonian syndromes) according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) from the national health registries. Methods Retrospective analysis of data available from the National Health Information System-NHIS and the National Registry of Reimbursed Health Services (NRRHS). Analyzed epidemiological data are intending to determine the regional and specific prevalence of Parkinsonism in the Czech Republic. The International Classification of Diseases diagnoses (ICD-10) of G20 (Parkinson's disease-PD) and G23.1, G23.2, G23.3 (other degenerative disorders of basal ganglia), and G31.8 (another degenerative disease of basal ganglia) from the period of 2012 to 2018 were included into the analysis.

EEG was recorded concurrently in all patients. The effects of inhaled carbogen on patient EEG recordings were investigated using band-power, functional connectivity and graph theory measures. Carbogen effect was quantified by measuring effect size (Cohen's d) between ""before"", ""during"" and ""after"" carbogen delivery states. Results Carbogen's apparent effect on EEG band-power and network metrics across all patients for ""before-during"" and ""before-after"" inhalation comparisons was inconsistent across the five patients. Conclusion The changes in different measures suggest a potentially non-homogeneous effect of carbogen on the patients' EEG.

The site became known mainly for a high number of so-called 'trenches', oblong pit features (breadth around 1 m, length 4-7 m), remarkable not only for their specific shape but also for their contents (unusual amounts of pottery, daub, loom weights and other finds, often with traces of a strong fire). In 2018-20, a research project focusing on the study of the site was realized. Magnetometer survey became an integral part of the project since it represented a way to obtain an overall image of the site. A 5-channel fluxgate gradiometer from Sensys (Germany) was used; the vertical gradient of the Z component of the Earth magnetic field was measured. In total, the survey covered an area of over 17 hectares and included over 1.8 million measurements. Profiles were orientated from east to west and data taken bidirectionally (alternate lines in opposite directions), in a 0.5 × 0.2 m grid. The site is extraordinary due to the fact that all archaeological features discovered so far belong to a single archaeological period (Late Bronze Age). This makes the acquired data set exceptional. It can be further used by archaeologists and geophysicists, both to create alternative models of the dynamics of prehistoric settlements and to better understand the nature and interpretive possibilities of the magnetometer data in archaeology as such.","['Magnetometry', 'Source Data', 'Bronze Age Settlement Site', 'House Burning', 'Intra-Site Patterning', 'Prehistoric Homestead Clusters']","['Ethics Statement', 'controversial issues', 'publication ethics', 'Statement', 'Ethics', 'authors', 'aware', 'controversial', 'issues', 'publication']",[],NaN

We aimed to evaluate the PRS in the genomes of Korean early-onset AMI patients (n = 265, age ≤50 years) following PCI and controls (n = 636) to examine whether the PRS improves risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors. Results The odds ratio of the PRS was 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.69-1.99) for early-onset AMI patients compared with the controls. For the classification of patients, the area under the curve (AUC) for the combined model with the six conventional risk factors (diabetes mellitus, family history of CAD, hypertension, body mass index, hypercholesterolemia, and current smoking) and PRS was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.94) while that for the six conventional risk factors was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93).

High levels of bicarbonates, phosphates, chlorides and suspended matters were also found. The aim of this study was to assess the microbiological and chemical qualities of domestic water sources in 5 localities of the West region of Cameroon. Water samples from 22 water sources (wells, springs, water drilling and river) were aseptically collected in plastic bottles and transferred in 50 ml sterile tubes. For chlorinated water sources, 1 ml of Thiosulfate was added to the water sample; immediately placed in an ice box and transported to the laboratory for analysis. Water temperature and pH were measured on site. The microbiological quality of water was determined by testing Total Coliforms (TC) using the Micro Biological Survey method. 1 ml of each water sample was inoculated in the MBS vial initially rehydrated with 10 ml of sterile distilled water. The initial color of the vials is red. Color changes were monitored at three different time intervals (12h, 19h and 24h), corresponding to three levels of contamination. The chemical quality of water was assessed using micronucleus (MN) test in selected Vicia faba seeds secondary root tips permanently mounted in Dibutylphthalate Polystyrene Xylene mountant for histology after 72 hours of direct exposition in water samples and in dark. The mitotic indices and MN frequencies were evaluated in 10 root tips per site analysing 5000 cells per tip. Statistical analyses were done using Stata IC/15.0 software. The Student t-test was used for mean comparison and the significance level was set at 1%. The majority of samples were collected from wells (63.6%). The mean water pH ranged from 5.5 to 8.3 and the temperature varied from 23 to 26°C.

Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factor 1 Alpha 2 (EEF1A2) has been revealed to have carcinogenic properties and promote tumor progression in many cancers. We want to investigate the biological function and mechanism of EEF1A2 in OS. Methods The expression of EEF1A2 in OS was investigated using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The biological function of EEF1A2 in OS was studied using cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, Transwell assay, and OS of xenograft nude mice model. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression level of EEF1A2 mRNA in OS tissues and cell lines. Western blot was used to detect the phosphorylation level of Akt and mTOR. Results There was high expression of EEF1A2 in OS, which was closely related to the Enneking stage and tumor size of OS.  In vitro , EEF1A2 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OS cells;  in vivo , EEF1A2 promoted the growth of OS tumors. The mechanism study showed that EEF1A2 can promote protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation, thereby activating the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in OS. Conclusion There is high expression of EEF1A2 in OS, which can promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OS cells  in vitro  and the growth of OS tumors in vivo via activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.","['Osteosarcoma (Os)', 'Akt/mtor Signaling Pathway', 'Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factor 1α2']",[],[],NaN

In addition, there are associations between previous preeclampsia and stroke, dementia and epilepsy later in life. The cerebral biomarkers S100B, neuron specific enolase, (NSE), tau protein and neurofilament light chain (NfL) have proven useful as predictors and diagnostic tools in other neurological disorders. This case-control study sought to determine whether cerebral biomarkers were increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a marker of cerebral origin and potential cerebral injury in preeclampsia and if concentrations in CSF correlated to concentrations in plasma. Methods CSF and blood at delivery from 15 women with preeclampsia and 15 women with normal pregnancies were analysed for the cerebral biomarkers S100B, NSE, tau protein and NfL by Simoa and ELISA based methods. MRI brain was performed after delivery and for women with preeclampsia also at six months postpartum. Results Women with preeclampsia demonstrated increased CSF- and plasma concentrations of NfL and these concentrations correlated to each other. CSF concentrations of NSE and tau were decreased in preeclampsia and there were no differences in plasma concentrations of NSE and tau between groups. For S100B, serum concentrations in preeclampsia were increased but there was no difference in CSF concentrations of S100B between women with preeclampsia and normal pregnancy.

Recently, constitutive ULBP4 expression by human monocytes was reported, questioning the view of tissue-restricted ULBP4 expression. Here, we scrutinized ULBP4 expression by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytes by analyzing ULBP4 transcripts and ULBP4 surface expression. In contrast to MICA, there was no ULBP4 expression detectable, neither by freshly isolated monocytes nor by PAMP-activated monocytes. However, a commercial antibody erroneously indicated surface ULBP4 on monocytes due to a non-ULBP4-specific binding activity, emphasizing the critical importance of validated reagents for life sciences.

In this study, we aimed to analyze the changes and characteristics of hepatitis A antibody titers in South Korea following the epidemic. The results of hepatitis A antibody tests performed at clinical laboratories from 2009 to 2019 were analyzed based on year, age, region, sex, and medical institution. The average 2009-2018 positive anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin G rate was 51.8%, but it increased (56.06%) in 2019. Significantly different antibody-positive rates were observed based on age: <10 years, 54.5%; 20-29 years, 19.5%; ≥50 years, almost 100%. The positive rate of individuals in their teens and 20s gradually increased, whereas that of those in their 30s and 40s gradually decreased. Males had higher antibody-positive rates than females, and samples from higher-level general hospitals exhibited higher antibody rates. The positive anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M rates gradually decreased after 2009 and were <1% after 2012. However, a high positive rate of 3.69% was observed in 2019 when there was an epidemic. Anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin G-positive rates were similar throughout the year, but the anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M-positive rates increased from January, peaked in April, and decreased from July, exhibiting distinct seasonality. This is considered to be related to groundwater pollution during the spring drought season.

Methods We assessed 4002 temporal bone CT scans and identified 34 patients with reported ossicular joint dislocation due to trauma. We excluded those with no proven traumatic ossicular dislocation in CT scan and patients with bilateral temporal bone fractures. We measured four parameters such as malleus-incus axis distance, malleus-incus angle at midpoints, malleus- incus axis angle and ossicular joint space. The contralateral healthy side served as its own control. Hearing outcome 1-3 months after the index visit was analyzed. We assessed diagnostic accuracy and performed a logistic regression using radiologic measurement parameters for outcome prediction of conductive hearing loss (defined as >20dB air-bone gap). Results We found excellent inter-rater agreement on the measurement of axis deviation between incus and malleus in CT scans (interclass correlation coefficient 0.81). The larger the deviation of incus and malleus axis, the higher probability of poor hearing outcome (odds ratio (OR) 2.67 per 0.1mm, p = .006).

However, only a few pregnancy complications have been reported in patients with pseudoexstrophy.  Case Presentation:  This report presents the case of a woman with pseudoexstrophy, who survived recurrent placental abruption during the second trimester of her pregnancy. The patient presented with a bicornuate uterus and survived placental abruption twice, which may have resulted from the malformation of the uterus. Placental abruption occurred at 20 weeks during her first pregnancy, and because she was already in labor, uterine contraction was augmented until vaginal delivery was achieved. The second pregnancy, however, could not be terminated quickly enough; therefore, a cesarean section was performed to save the patient's life.  Conclusions:  Our study makes a significant contribution to the literature although pregnancy complications have been reported in patients with pseudoexstrophy. Our findings show that in female patients with pseudoexstrophy who are or wish to become pregnant, detailed imaging studies must be performed to identify any deformities of the pelvis or reproductive organs, in order to make a pregnancy-related risk assessment. Our experience also indicates that if surgery is inevitable, the obstetrician must be more careful when entering the abdominal cavity during the surgery to avoid secondary injury. Furthermore, the peritoneum and fascia layers must be sutured more firmly when closing the abdomen to avoid an abdominal wall hernia, because of the lack of abdominal muscle and fat tissue in such patients.","['Pregnancy', 'Cesarean section', 'Placental Abruption', 'Case Report', 'Pseudoexstrophy']","['Statement Written', 'Ethics Statement', 'Written informed', 'informed consent', 'potentially identifiable', 'identifiable images', 'data included', 'Statement', 'Written', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

Methods This interventional study was performed with two groups of intervention and control and a pretest and posttest design. Seventy-nine nursing students were selected and assigned to the intervention or control groups by random sampling. Virtual education of the information literacy was uploaded on a website in the form of six modules delivered in four weeks. Questionnaires of demographic information and information literacy for EBP were used to collect data before and one month after the virtual education. Results The results showed no significant difference between the control and intervention groups in all dimensions of information literacy competency in the pre-test stage.

The margin is defined as the distance from the tumor to the cut surface of the resection specimen. The consensus among surgeons and radiation oncologists is that there should be no tumor left within 1 to maximum 2 mm from the surface of the surgical specimen. If a positive margin remains, there is substantial risk for tumor recurrence, which may also result in potentially reduced cosmesis and eventual need for mastectomy. In this paper we report a novel multimodal optical imaging instrument based on combined high-resolution confocal microscopy-optical coherence tomography imaging for assessing the presence of potential positive margins on surgical specimens. Since rapid specimen analysis is critical during surgery, this instrument also includes a fluorescence imaging channel to enable rapid identification of the areas of the specimen that have potential positive margins. This is possible by specimen incubation with a cancer specific agent prior to imaging. In this study we used a quenched contrast agent, which is activated by cancer specific enzymes, such as urokinase plasminogen activators (uPA). Using this agent or a similar one, one may limit the use of high-resolution optical imaging to only fluorescence-highlighted areas for visualizing tissue morphology at the sub-cellular scale and confirming or ruling out cancer presence. Preliminary evaluation of this technology was performed on 20 surgical specimens and testing of the optical imaging findings was performed against histopathology. The combination of the three imaging modes allowed for high correlation between optical image analysis and histological ground-truth. The initial results are encouraging, showing instrument capability to assess margins on clinical specimens with a positive predictive value of 1.0 and a negative predictive value of 0.83.",[],[],[],NaN

The ethics committee at each site approved the study.," Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral sitafloxacin versus levofloxacin in Chinese adults with acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) or complicated UTI. Methods In this randomized, active-controlled clinical trial, the patients with acute uncomplicated UTI were randomized to receive sitafloxacin 100-mg once-daily (qd) or levofloxacin 500-mg qd orally for 3-5 days. The patients with complicated UTI were randomized to receive sitafloxacin 100-mg twice daily or levofloxacin 500-mg qd orally for 10-14 days. The primary endpoint was the clinical efficacy at test-of-cure (TOC) visit. Results At TOC visit, the clinical cure rate was 89.2% (58/65) in sitafloxacin group and 97.1% (68/70) in levofloxacin group for the patients with acute uncomplicated UTI corresponding to the bacterial eradication rate of 97.1% (34/35) and 97.6% (41/42) (all  p  > .05), respectively. For the patients with complicated UTI, the clinical cure rate was 81.8% (27/33) in sitafloxacin group and 76.9% (20/26) in levofloxacin group corresponding to the bacterial eradication rate of 93.3% (14/15) and 63.6% (7/11) (all  p  > .05), respectively. Sitafloxacin and levofloxacin showed similar incidence of drug-related adverse events. Conclusions Oral sitafloxacin is as effective and safe as levofloxacin in treating acute uncomplicated and complicated UTI.

Critics argue that current research assessments focus on productivity and that they increase unhealthy pressures on scientists. Yet, the precise ways in which assessments should change is still open for debate. We circulated a survey with Flemish researchers to understand how they work, and how they would rate the relevance of specific indicators used in research assessments. We found that most researchers worked far beyond their expected working schedule. We also found that, although they spent most of their time doing research, respondents wished they could dedicate more time to it and spend less time writing grants and performing other activities such as administrative duties and meetings. When looking at success indicators, we found that indicators related to openness, transparency, quality, and innovation were perceived as highly important in advancing science, but as relatively overlooked in career advancement. Conversely, indicators which denoted of prestige and competition were generally rated as important to career advancement, but irrelevant or even detrimental in advancing science. Open comments from respondents further revealed that, although indicators which indicate openness, transparency, and quality (e.g., publishing open access, publishing negative findings, sharing data, etc.) should ultimately be valued more in research assessments, the resources and support currently in place were insufficient to allow researchers to endorse such practices. In other words, current research assessments are inadequate and ignore practices which are essential in contributing to the advancement of science.

Despite its impacts, there is no evidence on the magnitude and associated factors of refractive error among pregnant women in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of refractive error and its associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care unit at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2020. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was employed. An ocular examination was performed using Retinoscope and Snellen's illiterate ""E"" chart. The required data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire which comprised socio-demographic, clinical and pregnancy-related variables. EpiData 3.02 and STATA 14 were used for data entry and analysis respectively. Both bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were executed to identify factors associated with refractive error. Variables with a p-value ≤ 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression analysis were declared as significantly associated factors with refractive error. Results A total of 401 pregnant women with a median age of 27 (IQR = 24-31) years participated in this study. The overall prevalence of refractive error among the study participants was 35.66% (95% CI: 30.95-40.37). Of the total study participants, ninety-two (22.90%) of them were myopic, forty-five (11.22%) were hyperopic and the rest were antimetropic. Increased maternal age (AOR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.16-1.48)), increased parity (AOR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.92-5.25), increased gestational age (AOR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.08-1.22), and regular use of computers/ watching television (AOR = 6.19, 95% CI: 2.46-15.59) were significantly associated with refractive error. Conclusion The prevalence of refractive error among pregnant women was high where myopia was the most common variety. Advanced maternal age, increased gestational age, increased parity and regular use of computer or watching television were significantly associated with refractive error among pregnant women. Therefore, apart from providing other maternal health services, routine screening and evaluation of pregnant women for refractive error during antenatal care visit is recommended to avoid its negative impacts.",[],"['Review Board', 'Institutional Review', 'Ethical approval', 'participate Ethical', 'Ethical clearance', 'Ethical', 'study participant', 'consent', 'study', 'informed consent']","['of', 'of']",NaN

Retrospective progression of PTH, calcium and phosphate were documented, starting from the time she started the hemodialysis seven years ago and it eliminated the presence of preexisting functioning adenomas prior to the kidney failure. The development of multiple parathyroid adenomas in a patient with Tertiary HPT who is on hemodialysis is rare with only one study of a similar case in Japan in 1982. We present a rare case of Tertiary HPT patient on hemodialysis for seven years with double parathyroid adenomas that developed after the establishment of kidney failure. This case may give some insight to the factors that might lead to the formation of parathyroid adenomas, and it provides a unique follow-up of biochemical parameters during 7 years of parathyroid adenomas development.","['Parathyroid adenoma', 'hemodialysis', 'Case Report', 'Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism']",[],[],NaN

There are few reports about the risks and effectiveness of a remote-access endoscopic parathyroidectomy. Herein, we evaluated the risks and benefits of total endoscopic parathyroidectomy (TEP) for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). We retrospectively compared the surgical outcomes of TEP and open minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP). Methods We analyzed the cases of 28 patients with PHPT who were scheduled to undergo a MIP at Mita Hospital (Tokyo) during the period from April 2015 to March 2019, all of whom were presumed preoperatively to have a single adenoma. Results Eleven of the patients underwent a TEP (10 females, one male; mean age 54.2 years). The other 17 patients underwent an open MIP (11 females, 6 males; mean age 63.5 years). The younger patients and the females tended to select endoscopic surgery as their treatment.

However, results of Ki67 evaluation are affected by the method employed for sample fixation or biopsy, as well as by intratumor heterogeneity. Here, we aimed to compare the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67LI) between core-needle biopsy specimens (CNBSs) and surgically resected specimens (SRSs) of invasive breast cancer, and verify whether the discordance in Ki67LI can be reduced by analyzing the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) obtained from pretreatment whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in combination with Ki67LI. Methods Tumor tissues were obtained from 118 patients with invasive breast cancer. Ki67LI was evaluated in CNBSs and SRSs by immunohistochemistry. First, we directly compared Ki67LI between CNBS and SRS, ""allowing a tolerance margin of 5%."" We divided the Ki67LI values into three groups (Low: 0≤ Ki67LI ≤10, Intermediate: 10 Results The median Ki67LI was 17.8% (0.5-75.9%) and 17.0% (1.0-75.7%) in CNBS and SRS, respectively. The overall Ki67LI concordance rate between CNBS and SRS was 37.3% (44/118). The concordance was improved in the Low and High Ki67LI groups by applying SUVmax thresholds of 4 [82.6% (19/23), P=0.033 and 8 (92.3% (12/13), P=0.009], respectively. Conclusions Our results indicated that CNBS Ki67LI alone was not able to reflect SRS Ki67LI with sufficient accuracy.

We propose a novel procedure that involves ligating the pancreas in advance to allow for MPD dilation. Methods We compared the data of 16 patients who underwent PD followed by PJ with advance ligation (AL) for soft pancreas with a nondilated MPD with that of 17 patients who underwent a conventional procedure (conventional group) without AL at a single institution between January 2015 and April 2017. MPD diameters were assessed using preoperative computed tomography and intraoperative ultrasonography. Pancreatic consistency was judged intraoperatively. The pancreatic parenchyma and MPD were ligated in advance to allow time for MPD dilation. After AL, we divided the pancreatic parenchyma. AL led to MPD dilation and facilitated PJ. Results There were significantly fewer complications in the AL group than in the conventional group (P=0.005). There were no cases of pancreatitis or death in either group.

Many centers perform liver NMP to viability test suboptimal grafts, often for prolonged periods. In addition, several researchers are investigating NMP as a drug delivery platform, which usually necessitates prolonged perfusion of otherwise non-viable liver grafts. We describe two instances of methaemoglobinaemia during NMP of suboptimal livers.  Methods:  The NMP of eight human livers rejected for transplantation is described. Methaemoglobinaeima developed in two; one perfused using generic Medtronic™ perfusion equipment and one using the OrganOx Metra®.  Results:  The first liver (53 years DBD) developed methaemoglobinaemia (metHb = 2.4%) after 13 h of NMP, increasing to metHb = 19% at 16 h. Another liver (45 years DBD) developed methaemoglobinaemia at 25 h (metHb = 2.8%), which increased to metHb = 28.2% at 38 h. Development of methaemoglobinaemia was associated with large reductions in oxygen delivery and oxygen extraction. Both livers were steatotic and showed several suboptimal features on viability testing. Delivery of methylene blue failed to reverse the methaemoglobinaemia. Compared to a matched cohort of steatotic organs, livers which developed methaemoglobinaemia showed significantly higher levels of hemolysis at 12 h (prior to development of methaemoglobinaemia).  Conclusions:  Methaemglobinaemia is a complication of NMP of suboptimal liver grafts, not limited to a single machine or perfusion protocol. It can occur within 13 h (a timepoint frequently surpassed when NMP is used clinically) and renders further perfusion futile. Therefore, metHb should be monitored during NMP visually and using blood gas analysis.","['Transplantation', 'Steatosis', 'blood gas', 'Methaemoglobinaemia', 'Normothermic Machine Perfusion']","['National Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Statement Ethical', 'Ethics System', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Commission', 'Ethical approval', 'research projects', 'research', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

It has been established that increased GDF15 levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the detail effect of GDF15 on cardiovascular system in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) needs detail analysis. Methods Patients with CKD who did not need dialysis were enrolled in the study. Blood pressure (BP), endothelial function, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and heart rate variability (HRV) were taken in all subjects. Plasma GDF15 concentration was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Among the 355 participants, the mean age was 57.4 (±14.2) years old and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 50.1 (±33.2) mL/min/1.73m 2 . The average plasma GDF15 level was 1394.7 (±610.1) pg/mL. Higher GDF15 concentrations were significantly associated with decreased eGFR and increased urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR). In multivariable models, after adjusting for potential confounders, plasma GDF15 has negative concerning with HRV parameters including the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal (NN) interval (SDNN), the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals (RMSSD) and Triangular Index. Conclusion We observed there was a link between increased plasma of GDF15 and decreased HRV.

While numerous frameworks are widely used to develop and evaluate interventions, the steps detailing how to create an intervention are not as clear because the process of linking behaviour analysis to the intervention design is seldom discussed. We document the application of the Behaviour Centred Design (BCD) approach to the development of an intervention to improve hand hygiene (HH) rates among nurses' hospital units in the USA. Methods Intervention development is divided into the first three steps of the BCD approach: Assess, Build, and Create. The Assess step centres on understanding the target behaviour. The Build step expands the knowledge of the target behaviour and population through formative research which leads to a creative brief that explains the focus of the intervention. In the Create step, the creative brief guides the intervention design. Results Drawing from the main findings of the Asses and Build steps, a focal insight was developed positing that nurses can rediscover the meaning and purpose of their role as a nurse and thus as a caregiver by practicing HH; in the process of cleaning their hands, nurses are living up to their ideal nurse-self. The focal insight was linked linguistically into a theory and change. The outcome was a simple intervention, called the Mainspring Intervention, which consisted of three major parts: a self-affirmation exercise to reduce defensiveness, a message that challenged nurses' perceptions about their HH practice, and an implementation intention activity to help nurses link HH behaviour to a cue. Conclusions We detailed the creation of an original HH intervention that used the BCD approach. The intervention is relatively simple compared to most HH initiatives in the literature, both in terms of having relatively few components to the intervention and relatively easy field implementation. This intervention will allow us to test how specific psychological processes contribute to the problem of low HH rates, how our proposed intervention changes these processes in the hospital setting, and how the expected change in nurses' cognition transforms over time because of the intervention.","['Hand Hygiene', 'Healthcare Workers', 'Behaviour Change', 'Intervention Development', 'Hand Hygiene Compliance', 'Intervention Design', 'Behaviour Change Techniques', 'Behaviour Centred Design (Bcd)']",[],[],NaN

Sherkole refugee camp is stratified under high risk for malaria. Knowledge on malaria prevalence and associated factors among under-five children in Sherkole refugee camp is lacking. Methods and materials Institution-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among under-five children in Sherkole refugee camp from October to November 2019. Total sample size was 356. Stratified random sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. Standardized questionnaire was used to collect data.

All procedures and protocols have been approved by the committees on the ethics of animal experiments of the University of Würzburg and of the Government of Lower Franconia (license 55.2–2531.01-81/10). Sacrifice was performed under deep isoflurane anesthesia. All efforts were made to minimize suffering.,"The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is a key molecule of serotoninergic neurotransmission and target of many anxiolytics and antidepressants. In humans, 5-HTT gene variants resulting in lower expression levels are associated with behavioral traits of anxiety. Furthermore, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies reported increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) during resting state (RS) and amygdala hyperreactivity. 5-HTT deficient mice as an established animal model for anxiety disorders seem to be well suited for investigating amygdala (re-)activity in an fMRI study. We investigated wildtype (5-HTT+/+), heterozygous (5-HTT+/-), and homozygous 5-HTT-knockout mice (5-HTT-/-) of both sexes in an ultra-high-field 17.6 Tesla magnetic resonance scanner. CBF was measured with continuous arterial spin labeling during RS, stimulation state (SS; with odor of rats as aversive stimulus), and post-stimulation state (PS). Subsequently, post mortem c-Fos immunohistochemistry elucidated neural activation on cellular level. The results showed that in reaction to the aversive odor CBF in total brain and amygdala of all mice significantly increased. In male 5-HTT+/+ mice amygdala RS CBF levels were found to be significantly lower than in 5-HTT+/- mice. From RS to SS 5-HTT+/+ amygdala perfusion significantly increased compared to both 5-HTT+/- and 5-HTT-/- mice. Perfusion level changes of male mice correlated with the density of c-Fos-immunoreactive cells in the amygdaloid nuclei. In female mice the perfusion was not modulated by the 5-Htt-genotype, but by estrous cycle stages. We conclude that amygdala reactivity is modulated by the 5-Htt genotype in males. In females, gonadal hormones have an impact which might have obscured genotype effects.

Furthermore, the rising cost of health services and the absence of competition among publicly owned health facilities demands strong follow up of efficiency. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the technical efficiency of the health posts and determinants in Southwestern Ethiopia. Methods and materials We used data for one Ethiopian fiscal year (from July 2016 to June 2017) to estimate the technical efficiency of health posts. A total of 66 health posts were included in the analysis. We employed a two-stage data envelopment analysis to estimate technical efficiency. At the first stage, technical efficiency scores were calculated using data envelopment analysis program version 2.1. Predictors of technical efficiency were then identified at the second stage using Tobit regression, with STATA version 14. Results The findings revealed that 21.2% were technically efficient with a mean technical efficiency score of 0.6 (± 0.3), indicating that health posts could increase their service volume by 36% with no change made to the inputs they received. On the other hand, health posts had an average scale efficiency score of 0.8 (± 0.2) implying that the facilities have the potential to increase service volume by 16% with the existing resources. The regression model has indicated average waiting time for service has negatively affected technical efficiency. Conclusion More than three-quarters of health posts were found inefficient. The technical efficiency score of more than one-third of the health posts is even less than 50%. Community mobilization to enhance the uptake of health services at the health posts coupled with a possible reallocation of resources in less efficient health posts is a possible approach to improve the efficiency of the program.",[],"['Jimma University', 'Ethical considerations', 'review board', 'institutional review', 'IRB', 'Health', 'Jimma', 'University', 'Institute', 'Ethical']",[],NaN

Results The mean age ± standard deviation of the women was 51.37 ± 5.91 years. Ninety (27.8%) participants were premenopausal, 124 (38.5%) perimenopausal and 110 (33.7%) postmenopausal. The majority of these women (228; 70.4%) were local indigenous inhabitants of Sarawak. The findings show that 22.5% of the participants agreed that problems during menopause are a natural process. While 21.9% of the participants suggested that menopause should be treated medically, 32.3% argued that natural approaches for menopause symptoms are better than hormonal treatments. Seventy-five per cent of the women agreed that the absence of menses after menopause is a relief; meanwhile, 61.2% stated that menopause causes unpleasant symptoms. Notably, 51.7% were not sure whether women become less sexually attractive after menopause, and 51.1% were uncertain as to whether they feel less of a woman following menopause.

However, previous studies reported inadequate diagnostic accuracy for dementia in primary care settings. Many hospitals use the automated quantitative evaluation method known as the Voxel-based Specific Regional Analysis System for Alzheimer's Disease (VSRAD), wherein brain MRI data are used to evaluate brain morphological abnormalities associated with AD. Similarly, an automated quantitative evaluation application called the easy Z-score imaging system (eZIS), which uses brain SPECT data to detect regional cerebral blood flow decreases associated with AD, is widely used. These applications have several indicators, each of which is known to correlate with the degree of AD. However, it is not completely known whether these indicators work better when used in combination in real-world clinical practice. Methods We included 112 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 128 participants with early AD in this study. All participants underwent MRI, SPECT, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed by univariate analysis, and logistic regression analysis with a combination of MMSE, VSRAD and eZIS indicators was performed to verify whether the diagnostic accuracy in discriminating between MCI and early AD was improved. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the MMSE score alone was 0.835. The AUC was significantly improved to 0.870 by combining the MMSE score with two quantitative indicators from the VSRAD and eZIS that assessed the extent of brain abnormalities. Conclusion Compared with the MMSE score alone, the combination of the MMSE score with the VSRAD and eZIS indicators significantly improves the accuracy of discrimination between patients with MCI and early AD. Implementing VSRAD and eZIS does not require professional clinical experience in the treatment of dementia. Therefore, the accuracy of dementia diagnosis by physicians may easily be improved in real-world primary care settings.",[],"['Human Subjects', 'Japanese Ethical', 'Ethical Guidelines', 'Involving Human', 'ethics committee', 'Health Research', 'Research Involving', 'City Hospital', 'Towada City', 'Ethics']","['1â€“4,']",NaN

For added value, we also measured changes in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) using logistic regression and Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI), in which each CPR was added to the basic model. Results In Validation cohort 1 (360 subjects), compared to a Model 1 (Basic Model) AUC of 0.69 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.59-0.80), the AUC of Model 2 (Basic model + BAC-HD score) and Model 3 (Basic model + Shapiro's score) increased to 0.8 (95% CI: 0.71-0.88) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.63-0.83), respectively. In validation cohort 2 (96 subjects), compared to a Model 1 AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68-0.94), the AUCs of Model 2 and Model 3 increased to 0.83 (95% CI: 0.72-0.95) and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.76-0.94), respectively. NRIs on addition of the BAC-HD score and Shapiro's score were 0.3 and 0.06 in Validation cohort 1, and 0.27 and 0.13, respectively, in Validation cohort 2. Conclusion Either the BAC-HD score or Shapiro's score may improve the ability to diagnose bacteremia in HD patients. Reclassification was better with the BAC-HD score.",[],[],[],NaN

Medical ethics Taking the bio-ethical approach of four principles [ 30], especially the items “benevolence” and “non-maleficence”, we observed a major interference with MDRO management. Patients with MDRO are usually (following national guidelines) segregated from others to keep other from being MDRO-colonized and infected [ 43]. Especially in persons (lay and staff) with limited knowledge (as participants mentioned several times here and in our preceding study) managing MDRO is equated with highly contagious diseases. Taking a utilitarian approach [ 44], an MDRO-infected patient’s segregation is justified to protect the majority from the infected minority—putting MDRO-patients at risk for worsening social, economic and health-care related vulnerability. People perceive MDROs as a kind of pestilence. However, our findings only reveal bio-ethics and there is need for more investigation and work in this topic."," Introduction Multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are usually managed by separating the infected patients to protect others from colonization and infection. Isolation precautions are associated with negative experiences by patients and their relatives, while hospital staff experience a heavier workload and their own emotional reactions. Methods In 2018, 35 participants (nurses, physicians, pharmacists) in an antimicrobial-stewardship program participated in facilitated discussion groups working on the emotional impact of MDRO. Deductive codings were done by four coders focusing on the five basic emotions described by Paul Ekmans. Results All five emotions revealed four to 11 codes forming several subthemes: Anger is expressed because of incompetence, workflow-impairment and lack of knowledge. Anxiety is provoked by inadequate knowledge, guilt, isolation, bad prognoses, and media-related effects. Enjoyment is seldom. Sadness is experienced in terms of helplessness and second-victim effects. Disgust is attributed to shame and bad associations, but on the other hand MDROs seem to be part of everyday life. Deductive coding yielded additional codes for bioethics and the Calgary Family Assessment Method. Conclusion MDRO are perceived to have severe impact on emotions and may affect bioethical and family psychological issues. Thus, further work should concentrate on these findings to generate a holistic view of MDRO on human life and social systems.",[],"['MDRO', 'MDRO management', 'managing MDRO', 'ethics Taking', 'Medical ethics', 'Taking', 'perceive MDROs', 'major interference', 'approach', 'bio-ethical approach']",[],NaN

Hence, we investigated the feasibility of telesimulation for neonatal resuscitation training, assessed participants' attitudes towards telesimulation as well as its effect on neonatal resuscitation knowledge, and compared results between medical students and neonatal nurses.  Methods : For this prospective observational pilot study, medical students and neonatal nursing staff were recruited on a voluntary basis. Pre- and post-training knowledge was assessed using a 20-question questionnaire. Following the educational intervention, participants further answered a six-item questionnaire on their perception of telesimulation. For the telesimulation session, participants received a simulation package including a low-fidelity mannequin and medical equipment. The one-hour telesimulation session was delivered by an experienced instructor and broadcasted via Cisco Webex for groups of 2-3 participants, covering all elements of the neonatal resuscitation algorithm and including deliberate technical skills practice.  Results : Nine medical students and nine neonatal nurses participated in a total of seven telesimulation sessions. In general, participants enjoyed the telesimulation session, acknowledged a positive learning effect and found telesimulation suitable for neonatal resuscitation training, but were critical of potential technical issues, training logistics, and the quality of supervision and feedback. Neonatal resuscitation knowledge scores increased significantly after the educational intervention both for medical students and nurses.  Conclusions : Telesimulation is feasible for neonatal resuscitation training and associated with significant improvements in knowledge of current resuscitation guidelines, without differences between medical students and neonatal nurses.","['Neonate', 'Resuscitation', 'Education', 'Simulation Training', 'Telesimulation']","['voluntary participation', 'pseudo-anonymized manner', 'ethics committee', 'Ethical approval', 'observational study', 'educational topic', 'participant data', 'committee approval', 'approval', 'Ethical']",[],NaN

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to evaluate the potential splicing effect of this variant, which confirmed that the variant caused a deletion of exon 27 (103 bp) by disrupting the splice-donor site and changed the reading frame with the insertion of at least three stop codons. Our finding not only expands the mutation spectrum of  NIPBL  gene but also establishes the crucial role of WES in searching for underlying genetic variants.

In this study, we examine the effects of the new policy and the view of HCWs on the new policy. Methods A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in Kuopio University Hospital among HCWs working in close patient contact. The statistics on vaccination coverage were obtained from the hospital's own databases, where employees were asked to self-report their suitability for work. An anonymous survey was sent to HCWs in 2015-2016 ( n  = 987) and 2018-2019 ( n  = 821). Results Vaccination coverage increased from 59.5 to 99.6%, according to the hospital's own records. Among the survey respondents, the seasonal influenza vaccination coverage of HCWs increased from 68.2 to 95.4%. 83.8% of doctors and 49.4% of nurses supported the new policy. 12.7% of doctors and 41.5% of nurses found the new mandate coercive or that it restricted their self-determination. Conclusions Our study confirms the positive effects of mandating the administrators of health care institutions to only employ vaccinated HCWs. The majority (57.9%) of all HCWs supported the new policy, with doctors being more compliant than nurses. Key messages Finland became the first European country to mandate influenza vaccination for HCWs by mandating that administrators of health care institutions only employ vaccinated HCWs.

The purpose of this study was to review our experience in these patients, describe their characteristics, and discuss the possible pathogenesis.  Methods:  Seven pediatric patients diagnosed with ARM associated with both labioscrotal fold malformation and perineal mass were included in this study. Medical records of these patients were retrospectively reviewed, and follow-up was held through telephone contact or outpatient service.  Results:  Among the seven patients were six females and one male, and the age at surgery was between 5.2 and 12.4 months. The ratio of lateral-type to mid-perineum-type labioscrotal fold malformation was 5:2. The ARM type was all rectoperineal fistula. Operation was excision of the malformation and perineal mass at the same time of anoplasty. The pathology was lipoma (three cases), fibroma (one case), lipofibroma (one case), angiolipoma (one case), and mesenchymal hamartoma (one case). All the seven patients had no wound complication, and during the follow-up period of 7-100 months after surgery, none of the seven patients suffered perineal mass recurrence. Bowel control was satisfactory in the follow-up period.  Conclusions:  There is a low incidence for the triad of ARM, labioscrotal fold malformation, and perineal mass. The nature of this disease is neoplastic overgrowth of intervening mesenchymal tissue, which impedes the continuity of caudal development into normal labioscrotal fold and affects the extension of urorectal septum, leading to ARM.

This concern is due to overlapping nephrotoxicity of the drugs, and nephropathy from the diseases themselves. There is limited literature available for the short-term renal outcomes for HIV-positive patients with ICC during routine clinical management. This study aimed to assess if HIV-infection increased the risk of renal impairment in ICC patients treated with CCRT, and explore the respective risk factors. Materials and methods This was a retrospective review of records of ICC patients treated with at least one cycle of weekly cisplatin during CCRT at the Parirenyatwa Radiotherapy Center from January 2017-December 2018. The RIFLE criteria were used to classify renal impairment. Analyses were performed with Fisher's Exact tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Odds ratios (OR) were generated using logistic regression. All statistical tests were 2-sided at a 5% level of significance. Results Seventy-two eligible patients were identified, 32 (44.44%) were HIV-positive. HIV-positive patients were younger (p = 0.002), had lower albumin levels (p = 0.014) and received lower cisplatin doses (p = 0.044). The mean percent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline was -19% (95% CI: -25.9% to -13.2%) for all patients. Thirty-one (43.1%) patients experienced renal impairment, 50% and 37.5% of HIV-positive and -negative patients respectively (p = 0.287). HIV-infection was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.16 (95% CI 0.35-3.43, p = 0.769). Baseline eGFR Conclusion HIV-infection was not associated with elevated risk of renal impairment. Patients with an eGFR<60ml/min appear to be managed more cautiously reducing their risk for renal impairment during cisplatin therapy. The high prevalence of renal impairment in this population suggests the need for optimization of pre-treatment protocols.",[],"['fully anonymized', 'Ethical approvals', 'Joint Research', 'Zimbabwe College', 'Health Sciences', 'Parirenyatwa Group', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics approvals', 'Ethical', 'accessed']",[],NaN

Patients with this disease suffer from a degeneration of their cerebellar Purkinje neurons and retinal photoreceptors that result in a progressive ataxia and loss of vision. As with many neurodegenerative diseases, studies of pathogenesis have been hindered by a lack of disease-relevant models. To this end, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a cohort of SCA7 patients in South Africa. First, we differentiated the SCA7 affected iPSCs into neurons which showed evidence of a transcriptional phenotype affecting components of STAGA (ATXN7 and KAT2A) and the heat shock protein pathway (DNAJA1 and HSP70). We then performed electrophysiology on the SCA7 iPSC-derived neurons and found that these cells show features of functional aberrations. Lastly, we were able to differentiate the SCA7 iPSCs into retinal photoreceptors that also showed similar transcriptional aberrations to the SCA7 neurons. Our findings give technical insights on how iPSC-derived neurons and photoreceptors can be derived from SCA7 patients and demonstrate that these cells express molecular and electrophysiological differences that may be indicative of impaired neuronal health. We hope that these findings will contribute towards the ongoing efforts to establish the cell-derived models of neurodegenerative diseases that are needed to develop patient-specific treatments.",[],"['HREC REF', 'Health Sciences', 'Sciences Human', 'Human Research', 'Ethics approval', 'Ethics Committee', 'Research Ethics', 'Cape Town', 'patient recruitment', 'recruitment Ethics']",[],NaN

Management of obstetrical patients with suspected COVID-19 infection is a complex task with safety considerations for mother, fetus and healthcare workers. Implementation of new workflow algorithms to ensure safety is critical but is challenging to implement in real-time. We sought to improve pandemic preparedness by designing and deploying a high-fidelity simulation exercise involving the admission of a labouring obstetrical patient with suspected COVID-19 into a labour room, urgent transfer to the operating room and neonatal resuscitation. The creation of the simulation scenario was a multi-disciplinary effort with input from a focus group of key clinical stakeholders from within and outside of our centre to ensure clinical validity. Simulations were performed on the clinical unit during regular work hours so workflow could be observed in real-time with access to the equipment and personnel in which this clinical scenario would occur. We completed a total of 11 simulation sessions involving 42 participants. Feedback, obtained from debrief sessions and anonymous surveys, was categorized based on the human factors framework, and used as part of an iterative process to adapt, revise and improve the simulation scenario.

Two studies using community samples with diverse demographic characteristics in two different cultures (Study 1: the United States; Study 2: Singapore) obtained consistent findings. The results showed that independent self-construal, which emphasizes separateness from others in the social contexts, moderated the relationship between the need to belong and nature relatedness.

Twenty-six resistance-trained athletes (11/26 or 42% female) who had completed 12 weeks of intermittent energy restriction participated in this study. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 29.3 (6.4) years, a weight of 72.7 (15.9) kg, and a body fat percentage of 21.3 (7.5) %. During the 1-week diet break, energy intake was increased (by means of increased carbohydrate intake) to predicted weight maintenance requirements. While the 1-week diet break had no significant effect on fat mass, it led to small but significant increases in mean body weight (0.6 kg, P<0.001), fat-free mass (0.7 kg, P<0.001) and in resting energy expenditure, from a mean (and 95% confidence interval) of 7000 (6420 to 7580) kJ/day to 7200 (6620 to 7780) kJ/day (P = 0.026). Overall, muscle endurance in the legs (but not arms) improved after the diet break, including significant increases in the work completed by the quadriceps and hamstrings in a maximum-effort 25-repetition set, with values increasing from 2530 (2170 to 2890) J to 2660 (2310 to 3010) J (P = 0.018) and from 1280 (1130 to 1430) J to 1380 (1220 to 1540) J (P = 0.018) following the diet break, respectively.

Evaluating the sleep quality of a person may be a first step to prevent further health issues that diminish their independence and quality of life. Polysomnography (PSG) is the ""gold standard"" for sleep studies, but this technique presents some drawbacks. Thus, this study intends to assess the capability of the new Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 5 to be used as a tool for sleep self-assessment. (2)  Methods : This study will be an observational and prospective study set at the sleep unit of a hospital in A Coruña, Spain. Forty-three participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be asked to participate. Specific statistical methods will be used to analyze the data collected using the Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 5 and PSG. (3)  Discussion : This study offers a promising approach to assess whether the Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 5 correctly records our sleep. Even though these devices are not expected to replace PSG, they may be used as an initial evaluation tool for users to manage their own sleep quality and, if necessary, consult a health professional. Further, the device may help users make simple changes to their habits to improve other health issues as well.

The psychiatric emergency department (ED) plays a key role during this mental health crisis. This study aimed to investigate differences in admissions at a Swiss psychiatric ED from 1 April to 15 May during a ""pandemic-free"" period in 2016 and a ""during-pandemic"" period in 2020. The study included 579 consultations at psychiatric ED in the ""during-pandemic"" period and 702 in the ""pandemic-free"" period. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared, and logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with psychiatric admissions during the pandemic. A reduction in total psychiatric ED admissions was documented during COVID-19. Logistic regression analysis predicted the independent variable (ED admission during the pandemic) and estimated odds ratio (OR) for being unmarried/not in a relationship, arrival in an ambulance, suicidal behavior, behavioral disorders and psychomotor agitation. Though only statistically significant in bivariate analysis, patients were also more likely to be involuntarily hospitalized. This picture appears to be reversed from a sociodemographic and clinical point of view to our observation of psychiatric ED consultation in 2016. These findings highlight that the reduction in psychiatric ED admissions during the pandemic seems to be associated with living alone and more severe psychopathologies, which must alert psychiatrists to ensure access to mental health care in times of pandemic.","['Depression', 'Coronavirus', 'Suicidal behavior', 'Suicide', 'Emergency Department', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Public Mental Health', 'Psychiatric Admissions', 'Psychotic Episode', 'Covid-19 Pandemic']",[],[],NaN

Attitudes towards risk prediction and motives for its approval or rejection were categorized inductively and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The anticipated impact on self-determination was a driving decision component, regardless of whether a person would decide for or against risk prediction. Results revealed diverse, sometimes contrasting, motives for both approval and rejection (e.g., the desire to control of one's life as a reason for and against risk prediction). Knowledge about a higher risk as a potential psychological burden was one of the major reasons against risk prediction. The decision to make use of risk prediction is expected to have far-reaching effects on the quality of life and self-perception of potential users.

Wearing face masks, regular handwashing and cough hygiene all reached compliance rates of over 90% while physical distancing and avoiding to touch the face reached a compliance rate of 80-90%. A multivariable model investigating factors associated with adherence found that being older, more educated, and belonging to the healthcare sector increased the odds for higher adherence. Private workers and retired people, respondents receiving COVID-19 information through social media, and those who reported flu-like symptoms were less likely to adhere. 6% of respondents reported flu-like symptoms which aligned with the WHO clinical definition of COVID-19, suggesting low level community transmission. In conclusion, most respondents in this online survey in Mozambique complied well with strategies to prevent COVID-19.

Design A cross-sectional study. Participants A total of 509 community-dwelling elders living in the Tokyo metropolitan area participated in a comprehensive survey conducted in October 2013. Measurements The basic characteristics were sex, age, and body mass index. Undernutrition was examined through serum albumin levels. Chewing ability was examined through color-changeable xylitol gum by evaluating the color changes in chewing gum. Nutritional intake was examined using the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Results In the poor chewing ability group, all nutrient intake levels were significantly low, except for carbohydrates, and intake levels for all food groups were significantly low, except for cereals, confectionery, sugars, seasonings, and spices. Additionally, after adjusting for covariates for sex, age, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology-Index of Competence (TMIG-IC) score, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, body mass index (BMI), stroke, number of functional teeth, energy intake, and protein intake, chewing ability was found to be significantly associated with undernutrition. Conclusion We concluded that chewing ability was closely associated with nutrient and different food groups' intake, as well as undernutrition, among Japanese community-dwelling elders.

Objectives To establish an efficient, time and resource-saving and cost-effective methods, and to propose an ad hoc pooling approach for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2. Methods We evaluated pooling approach on both direct clinical and NA samples. The standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of the SARS CoV-2 was employed targeting the nucleocapsid (N) and open reading frame (ORF1ab) genomic region of the virus. The experimental pools were created using SARS CoV-2 positive clinical samples and extracted RNA spiked with up to 9 negative samples. For the direct clinical samples viral NA was extracted from each pool to a final extraction volume of 200μL, and subsequently both samples tested using the SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Results We found that a single positive sample can be amplified and detected in pools of up to 7 samples depending on the cycle threshold (Ct) value of the original sample, corresponding to high, and low SARS CoV-2 viral copies per reaction. However, to minimize false negativity of the assay with pooling strategies and with unknown false negativity rate of the assay under validation, we recommend pooling of 4/5 in 1 using the standard protocols of the assay, reagents and equipment. The predictive algorithm indicated a pooling ratio of 5 in 1 was expected to retain accuracy of the test irrespective of the Ct value samples spiked, and result in a 137% increase in testing efficiency. Conclusions The approaches showed its concept in easily customized and resource-saving manner and would allow expanding of current screening capacities and enable the expansion of detection in the community.

Re-calcified whole blood is perfused over the endothelium at venous and arterial shear rate. Neutrophil adhesion, platelet and fibrin thrombus formation, is measured over time by the addition of fluorescent antibodies to a whole blood sample.

Inhibitors of neutrophil adhesion and anti-inflammatory agents, such as isoquercetin, decrease neutrophil adhesion. Our model offers the advantage of the use of (1) fixed endothelium, (2) whole blood, instead of isolated neutrophils, and (3) a small amount of blood (1 mL).

Animal Ethics Orientations and Welfare-Enhanced Meat It is well-documented that many vegetarians and vegans are motivated by their beliefs about animal rights [ 9, 10, 11]. Furthermore, it is also known that concern about animal welfare can motivate people to purchase meat and other animal products that have been produced with extra concern for animal welfare [ 8]. However, the specific animal ethics viewpoints and arguments driving the consumption of welfare products have not received much scholarly attention to date. The notion of an animal ethics orientation can be defined as an underlying set of ethical beliefs about how we—human beings—should treat animals [ 12, 13]. Such orientations shape people’s opinions about, and behavior toward, animals [ 14, 15]. Investigations of the attitudinal and moral drivers associated with a preference for welfare meat have already looked at the following factors: general moral views [ 16]; personal values [ 17]; environmental awareness [ 16]; perceptions of, and opinions about, farmers and the conditions in which farm animals are managed [ 18, 19]; attitudes toward production systems [ 20]; and concern about animal welfare [ 8, 21]. Other research has examined the willingness-to-pay for welfare meat [ 22] and the effect of information on consumer preferences for animal food production methods [ 23].  Studies of animal ethics orientations could be an important addition because such orientations may be attitudinal precursors that shape how people think and form opinions about farm animal welfare and, in the end, whether there is a preference for and willingness to purchase welfare products. The attitudinal measures related to animal use developed (mainly) in the 1990s and 2000s did not include distinct animal ethics orientations [ 24, 25, 26]. Contemporary measures have been developed [ 10, 14, 15] that allow the empirical identification of the multiple animal ethics orientations that are assumed to co-exist in Western societies [ 12, 13]. The orientations identified in the studies comprise a combination of “pure” animal ethics theories and lay (or intuitive) ethical orientations that are likely to be prevalent in modern societies.  There are overlaps in the multi-dimensional measures developed. Here, we briefly highlight the orientations identified in the measure presented by Lund et al. [ 14], because it is used in the present study. Lund et al. [ 14] identified an animal rights orientation, the central idea of which is that animals matter in the same way as humans do because they are all sentient beings. Consequently, animals should not be used and sacrificed for the sake of humans. In contrast, the anthropocentric orientation assumes that human beings are the center of the moral universe, and that animals are a means of satisfying human needs and interests. Animal protection is characterized by the principle that it is acceptable for humans to use animals, as long as they are treated well and do not experience pain, stress or other forms of suffering. Finally, the lay utilitarian orientation takes its point of departure in the weighting of the utility derived from the use of animals and the harm that animals suffer as a result. It primarily relates to extreme trade-offs between animal pain and human benefits (e.g., the use of animals in bio-medical research), and uses that would ordinarily be regarded as morally contentious. "," Background The relationship between animal ethics orientations and consumer demand for meat with high standards of animal welfare, and the way this relationship plays out in different countries, is not well understood. Using pork as a case study, this comparative study aims to identify the animal ethics orientations that drive purchases of welfare meat in Denmark, Germany, and Sweden. Methods Cross-sectional questionnaire data from representative samples of approximately 1600 consumers in each country were collected. A segmentation of pork consumers (using latent profile analysis) was carried out. Results In all three countries, two subgroups were concerned about farm animal welfare: the first subgroup was driven by animal rights values; the second subgroup by animal protection values, where the main principle was that ""it is all right to use animals as long as they are treated well"". Other consumer groups are less concerned about farm animal welfare and display little or no preference for welfare pork. Conclusions In all three countries, dual demand for welfare pork exists. The findings of this study can be used, among others, to understand the marketability of enhanced welfare animal products and the potential for market-driven animal welfare improvements.","['Cross-cultural Comparison', 'Meat Consumption', 'Animal Ethics', 'Consumer Segmentation', 'Market-driven Animal Welfare Improvements', 'Welfare-enhanced Meat']","['Animal Ethics', 'Animal', 'Ethics Orientations', 'animals', 'animal welfare', 'Orientations', 'Ethics', 'welfare', 'welfare meat', 'Meat']",[],NaN

An ultrasound transducer was moved on a pre-specified 3 cm distance over the semitendinosus muscle of eleven adults (35.8 ± 9.8 years), stopping briefly at intervals of 0.5 cm. Transducer motion was quantified (1) measuring the 2-D displacement of the shadow produced by reflective tape (RT) attached to the skin and (2) using a marker-based, three-dimensional movement analysis system (MAS).

Bland-Altman plots showed narrow limits of agreement for both RT (-0.49 to 0.13 cm) and MAS (-0.49 to 0.34 cm) versus TD. RT and MAS are valid methods to quantify US transducer movement. In view of its low costs and complexity, RT can particularly be recommended for application in research and clinical practice.","['ultrasound', 'Reflective Tape', 'Transducer Movement']","['Clinical Practice', 'Ethics Committee', 'Good Clinical', 'Ethics', 'Goethe-University Frankfurt', 'June', 'Department', 'Frankfurt', 'Practice', 'cross-sectional study']",[],NaN

To characterize this risk, we performed a sero-epidemiological survey in small-animal-practice workers and healthy blood donors in Miyazaki prefecture, which is the prefecture with the highest per capita number of recorded cases of SFTS in Japan. Three small-animal-practice workers were identified as seropositive by ELISA, but one had a negative neutralization-test result and so was finally determined to be seronegative, giving a seropositive rate of 2.2% (2 of 90), which was significantly higher than that in healthy blood donors (0%, 0 of 1000;  p  < 0.05). The seroprevalence identified here in small-animal-practice workers was slightly higher than that previously reported in other high-risk workers engaged in agriculture and forestry in Japan. Thus, enhancement of small-animal-practice workers' awareness of biosafety at animal hospitals is necessary for control of SFTSV.","['Dogs', 'Japan', 'Public Health', 'Cats', 'Sfts', 'Bandavirus']","['Miyazaki Prefectural', 'Prefectural Institute', 'Public Health', 'Miyazaki prefecture', 'serum samples', 'Sample Collection', 'Miyazaki', 'Ethical Statement', 'samples', 'Cross Society']","['2', '30J0025).']",NaN

Ethical Justification of Obligatory Medical Procedure Once herd immunity is established and the direct benefit of vaccination for an individual is low, the challenge is to maintain a sufficient level of immunity in a population [ 90]. Because education about risks and benefits is of limited value when herd immunity is achieved, it turned out in recent years that outbreaks of diseases (e.g., measles) can happen again in the countries with voluntary vaccination and not a sufficient degree of herd immunity [ 29, 90, 92]. To prevent outbreaks and protect also vulnerable members of society, obligatory vaccination is sometimes justified [ 5, 61, 87, 93, 94, 95]. Gostin proposed conditions for ethical justification of obligatory medical procedure, which are as follows: Inefficient measure on a voluntary basis, absence of a less coercive alternative, unambiguous scientific grounds and presence of risk to the members of society, which they are unaware of [ 96]. He claims that restricting non-medical exemptions from vaccination is consistent with freedom of religion and conscience, because this policy does not target a particular community, but is applied equally throughout the society [ 61]. Similarly, Giubilini argues that individuals have a moral obligation to be vaccinated, although contribution of a single individual to the realisation of herd immunity is insignificant. When individuals do not fulfil their duty, coercive vaccination policies are justified. They should be implemented gradually by the principle of least restrictive alternative [ 5, 78]. Flanigan also claims that compulsory vaccination is justified, because vaccine refusal can harm innocent people that are susceptible to certain diseases. He provides an analogy of vaccine refusal to randomly firing a gun [ 93]. On the other hand, some authors claim that solidarity should be a goal, not conformity. Parents should have a sense of moral responsibility, which is possible only if they are free to decide [ 29]. Coercive measures can have even an adverse effect, especially in the long term [ 7, 82]. However, a French survey showed that implementation of mandatory vaccination in 2018 and simultaneous promotion strategies had a positive impact on the mothersâ€™ opinions regarding vaccination [ 97]. To achieve adequate levels of responsibility, regardless of vaccination policy, a trustful dialogue between healthcare providers and parents should be established, as well as public deliberation to foster a sense of the community benefit of vaccination and to enable parents to participate as citizens [ 7, 29, 82].","Although vaccination is recognised as the top public health achievement of the twentieth century, unequivocal consensus about its beneficence does not exist among the general population. In countries with well-established immunisation programmes, vaccines are ""victims of their own success"", because low incidences of diseases now prevented with vaccines diminished the experience of their historical burdens. Increasing number of vaccine-hesitant people in recent years threatens, or even effectively disables, herd immunity levels of the population and results in outbreaks of previously already controlled diseases. We aimed to apply a framework for ethical analysis of vaccination in childhood based on the four principles of biomedical ethics (respect for autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice) to provide a comprehensive and applicable model on how to address the ethical aspects of vaccination at both individual and societal levels. We suggest finding an ""ethical equilibrium"", which means that the degree of respect for parents' autonomy is not constant, but variable; it shall depend on the level of established herd immunity and it is specific for every society. When the moral obligation of individuals to contribute to herd immunity is not fulfilled, mandatory vaccination policies are ethically justified, because states bear responsibility to protect herd immunity as a common good.","['Children', 'Vaccination', 'Herd immunity', 'Autonomy', 'Justice', 'Bioethics', 'Beneficence', 'Nonmaleficence', 'Common Good', 'Principles Of Biomedical Ethics']","['herd immunity', 'vaccination', 'Obligatory Medical', 'Medical Procedure', 'immunity', 'herd', 'Ethical Justification', 'Obligatory', 'obligatory vaccination', 'society']",[],NaN

It has a significant impact on health, especially the development of mental disorders, causing occupational imbalance. There is a growing interest in the development of tools with a positive effect on workers. To this end, wearable technology is becoming increasingly popular, as it measures biometric variables like heartbeat, activity, and sleep. This information may be used to assess the stress a person is suffering, which could allow the development of stress coping strategies, both at a professional and personal level. (2) Methods: This paper describes an observational, analytical, and longitudinal study which will be set at a research center in A Coruña, Spain. Various scales and questionnaires will be filled in by the participants throughout the study. For the statistical analysis, specific methods will be used to evaluate the association between numerical and categorical variables. (3) Discussion: This study will lay the foundation for a bigger, more complete study to assess occupational stress in different work environments.

Three PAEP SNPs were also found to be polymorphic with heterozygotes being most frequent. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was observed for eight variants. It was shown that only CSN3_6 was not in HWE. The fact that many of investigated SNPs were monomorphic may suggest that in the past the reproduction program favored one of these genotypes.

Eosinophils are multifunctional leukocytes implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory processes including viral infections. We focus our study on the prognostic value of eosinopenia as a marker of disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods Between 1 March and 30 April 2020, we conducted a multicenter and retrospective study on a cohort of COVID-19 patients (moderate or severe disease) who were hospitalized after presenting to the emergency department (ED). We led our study in six major hospitals of northeast France, one of the outbreak's epicenters in Europe. Results We have collected data from 1035 patients, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. More than three quarters of them (76.2%) presented a moderate form of the disease, while the remaining quarter (23.8%) presented a severe form requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Mean circulating eosinophils rate, at admission, varied according to disease severity ( p   p  = 0.306). Extreme eosinopenia (=0/mm 3 ) was predictive of severity (aOR = 1.77,  p  = 0.009); however, it was not predictive of mortality (aOR = 0.892,  p  = 0.696). The areas under the Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve were, respectively, 58.5% (CI95%: 55.3-61.7%) and 51.4% (CI95%: 46.8-56.1%) for the ability of circulating eosinophil rates to predict disease severity and mortality. Conclusion Eosinopenia is very common and often profound in cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Eosinopenia was not a useful predictor of mortality; however, undetectable eosinophils (=0/mm 3 ) were predictive of disease severity during the initial ED management.","['Mortality', 'eosinophils', 'Severity', 'Eosinopenia', 'Covid-19']","['French legislation', 'retrospectively studied', 'informed consent', 'local ethics', 'ethics committee', 'France', 'Ethics', '2020-39', 'University', 'Strasbourg']",[],NaN

In this study, we enrolled 96 aHCC patients treated with bimonthly hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (B-HAIC) with cisplatin or sorafenib monotherapy (oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily) not only to demonstrate its efficacy and significance but also to indicate preferable candidates by setting a response-related biomarker. Differences in treatment had no significant effect on overall survival (OS). The response rate in patients treated with B-HAIC was relatively higher than those treated with sorafenib. HFR was well maintained over the treatment course with B-HAIC, while it was significantly impaired with sorafenib. By employing multivariate analysis, we found negative trends between progression-free survival (PFS) periods and serum levels of alpha fetoprotein as well as des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP). In addition, a logistic regression analysis of the relationship between serum DCP levels and PFS periods over 420 days (14 months) showed that the PFS periods of patients with higher DCP was significantly shorter than those of patients with lower DCP ( p  = 0.02). Subsequently, the present study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of B-HAIC and identified a predictor of unpreferable patients.

This study reports the process of establishing a smartphone palpitation and pre-syncope ambulatory care Clinic (SPACC) service.  Materials and Methods:  A clinical standard operating procedure (SOP) was devised, and funding was secured through a business case for the purchase of 40 AliveCor devices in the first instance. The clinic was launched on 22 July 2019.  Results:  Between 22 July 2019 and 31 October 2019, 68 patients seen in the emergency departments (EDs) with palpitations or pre-syncope were referred to SPACC. Of those, 30 were male and 38 were female, and the mean age was 45.8 years old (SD 15.1) with a range from 18 years old to 80 years old. A total of 50 (74%) patients underwent full investigation. On the first assessment, seven (10%) patients were deemed to have non-cardiac palpitations and were not fitted with the device. All patients who underwent full investigation achieved symptomatic rhythm correlation most with sinus rhythm, ventricular ectopics, or bigeminy. A symptomatic cardiac dysrhythmia was detected in six (8.8%) patients. Three patients had supraventricular tachycardia (4%), two had atrial fibrillation (3%), and one had atrial flutter (2%). Qualitative feedback from the SPACC team suggested several areas where improvement to the clinic could be made.  Conclusion:  We believe a smartphone palpitation service based on ambulatory care is simple to implement and is effective at detecting cardiac dysrhythmia in ED palpitation patients.","['Diagnosis', 'Emergency Department', 'Ecg Monitoring', 'Cardiac Dysrhythmias']",[],[],NaN

Methods A cross-sectional study was performed in a regional hospital in Central Taiwan. The sample consisted of 318 patients who came to the clinic from May 2018 to April 2019, and who were diagnosed by the physicians with CDR scores ≧ 0.5. The Chi-Square test and binary logistic regression analyses were performed for inferential statistical analysis. Results The mean age of the sample was 78.7 ± 8.51 years, and 61.6% of the samples' CDR scores were equal or less than 1.0. Patients visiting the clinic were accompanied by spouses (21.7%), sons or daughters-in-law (40.6%), daughters (23.6%). Of the sample, 142 (44.3%) patients live with sons. Patients with a lower educational level had higher CDR scores. Compared to the patients who went to the clinic by themselves, the higher OR values of CDR scores ≧ 2 are found in patients who were accompanied by other relatives (OR = 18.871, 95% C.I. = 3.117-114.237,  p  = 0.001), or spouse (OR = 10.783, 95% C.I. = 1.996-58.245,  p  = 0.006).

We conducted two studies aimed at determining whether the associations of at-risk personality traits (sensation-seeking [SS], impulsivity [IMP], hopelessness [HOP], and anxiety-sensitivity [AS]) with increased problematic alcohol use could be explained through these variables' associations with decreased PBS use. We tested two mediation models in which the relationship between at-risk personality traits and increased problematic alcohol use outcomes (Study 1: Alcohol volume; Study 2: Heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related harms) was partially mediated through decreased PBS use. Two samples of college students participated (N 1  = 922, Mage 1  = 20.11, 70.3% female; N 2  = 1625, Mage 2  = 18.78, 70.3% female). Results partially supported our hypotheses, providing new data on a mechanism that helps to explain the relationships between certain at-risk personality traits and problematic alcohol use, as these personalities are less likely to use PBS. In contrast, results showed that AS was positively related to alcohol-related harms and positively related to PBS, with the mediational path through PBS use being protective against problematic alcohol use. This pattern suggests that there are other factors/mediators working against the protective PBS pathway such that, overall, AS still presents risks for alcohol-related harms.","['Personality', 'risk factors', 'Alcohol-related Problems', 'Protective Behavioral Strategies', 'Harm-reduction']",[],[],NaN

Materials and Methods:  Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed for SPNS2 protein expression in samples from 264 cases of OSCC. Correlations of SPNS2 expression with clinicopathological variables and patient survival were analyzed.  Results:  Our results revealed that the cytoplasmic protein expression of SPNS2 in OSCC tissue specimens was lower than in normal tissue specimens. Negative cytoplasmic protein expression of SPNS2 was significantly correlated with T status and stage. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis revealed that negative cytoplasmic SPNS2 expression was predictive of poorer overall survival of OSCC patients in stage III/IV. We also determined that low SPNS2 expression was an independent prognostic factor related to overall survival among OSCC patients in stage III/IV from univariate Cox proportional hazard models. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models revealed that cytoplasmic SPNS2 expression, T status, lymph node metastasis, and histological grade were independent prognostic factors for survival.

This study's aim was to investigate the prevalence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus in football players compared to population based non-elite athlete control subjects. Initially 1100 male volunteers, (550) football players, and (550) population based non-elite athlete control subjects were interviewed. After socio-demographic and medical history analysis, 756 (378) nonsmoker male football players and (378) nonsmoker male control subjects were recruited. The control subjects were not involved in regular sports activities such as football, volleyball, badminton, cricket, hockey, and swimming. Participants with a known history of anemia, blood diseases, diabetes mellitus, and malignancy were excluded from the study. The mean age of football players was 31.80 ± 5.46 years, Body Mass Index (BMI) was 26.40 ± 2.08 (kg/m 2 ), and the mean age of control subjects was 32.32 ± 4.37 years, and BMI was 26.66 ± 1.87 (kg/m 2 ). The selected football players have been playing football for about 2 h a day, 3 days per week, and so the total mean duration of playing football was 1.08 years. American Diabetes Association (ADA) based criteria on Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) was used to investigate prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In football players the prevalence of prediabetes was 30 (7.93%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was 6 (1.59%) compared to population based matched non-elite athlete control subjects where the prediabetes was 71 (18.78%) and T2DM was 89 (23.54%) ( p  = 0.001). Among football players there was a 7-fold decrease in T2DM compared to control subjects. Football recreational activities markedly reduce the prevalence of prediabetes and T2DM.

The Universal Varicella Vaccination (UVV) program was introduced in Tuscany (Italy) in 2003, with a two-dose vaccine schedule given to children between their 13th and 15th month, and at 5-6 years old, as a monovalent for varicella (V) or tetravalent (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV)) formulation. Although varicella notifications have dramatically fallen in the last two decades, varicella disease underreporting remains a challenge.  Methods : A qualitative immunoenzymatic test (ELISA) was used to measure the presence of anti-varicella antibodies in 165 sera of subjects aged 1-18 years residing in the province of Florence (Italy). Information regarding the anamnestic and vaccination status (including disease notification) was also collected.  Results:  Our study showed an overall varicella seropositivity of 75.8% (reaching the maximum at 96.3% in the 15-18 years age group). We found that varicella disease notification had been recorded for only 7/165 subjects; however, since 42/165 recalled having had the disease, we can hypothesize that some of them must have been underreported. Furthermore, our study showed that the presence of antibodies after the varicella vaccination remained over time, lasting up to 12 years.  Conclusions:  Although varicella seroprevalence is <95% in almost all our age groups (except for the 15-18 years age group), our data are encouraging and reflect the success of the introduction of the UVV program and the vaccination campaigns promoted in the Tuscany region.","['Immunization', 'Adolescent', 'Pediatric', 'Italy', 'Notification', 'Underreporting', 'Seroprevalence', 'Varicella', 'Vaccination Coverage', 'Tuscany']",[],[],NaN

Recently, pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) analysis was introduced as a second-tier test with the aim of reducing recalls for second DBS cards while keeping sensitivity high. For 28 months, when IRT was elevated (65-130 ng/mL), PAP was measured from the first DBS ( n  = 198,927) with a two-step cut-off applied. For the last 12 months of the observation period ( n  = 85,421), an additional IRT×PAP cut-off was introduced. If PAP or IRT×PAP were above cut-off, a second card was analyzed for IRT and in case of elevated values identified as screen-positive. Above 130 ng/mL IRT in the first DBS, newborns were classified as screen-positive. IRT analysis of first DBS resulted in 1961 (1%) tests for PAP. In the first 16 months, 26 of 93 screen-positive were confirmed to have CF. Two false-negatives have been reported (sensitivity = 92.8%). Importantly, less than 30% of families compared to the previous IRT-IRT screening scheme had to be contacted causing distress. Adding IRT×PAP caused a marginally increased number of second cards and sweat tests to be requested during this period (15 and 3, respectively) compared to the initial IRT-PAP scheme. One case of confirmed CF was found due to IRT×PAP, demonstrating an increase in sensitivity. Thus, the relatively simple and economical algorithm presented here performs effectively and may be a useful model for inclusion of CF into NBS panels or modification of existing schemes.","['Neonatal Screening', 'False-positives', 'Recalls', 'Irt-Pap', 'Irt×Pap']",[],[],NaN

In 94 morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG), over-time changes in anthropometric and biochemical measures-including insulin resistance (IR) indexes-were correlated with serum sclerostin levels. Sclerostin was positively associated with anthropometric indexes of obesity, and inversely with IR, namely homeostatic model assessment for peripheral insulin sensitivity (HOMA2%S) (r = -0.218;  p  = 0.045). Sclerostin emerged as the only significant predictor of HOMA2-%S normalization, independently of demographic and anthropometric variables (OR 1.01 (95% CI 1.00-1.02);  p  = 0.024). We also identified two distinct patterns of serum sclerostin change: the higher/lower sclerostin levels at baseline, the greater their post-surgical reduction/increase ( p  < 0.001 for all subgroups). Among those two patterns, especially the post-surgery increase in serum sclerostin was associated with lean mass reduction, without any association with IR indexes. Although counterintuitive, this change was likely dependent on the post-surgical increase in bone turnover. In conclusion, baseline serum levels of sclerostin correlate with anthropometric measures of obesity and IR, and the ability to predict glycemic improvements after SG.

This situation changed in the mid-1990s with the arrival of several publications arguing for the direct moral considerability of animals within the Kantian ethical framework. Against this, another contemporary Kantian approach has continued to defend Kant's indirect duty view. In this approach it is argued, first, that it is impossible to establish direct duties to animals, and second, that this is also unnecessary because the Kantian notion that we have indirect duties to animals has far-reaching practical consequences and is to that extent adequate. This paper explores the argument of the far-reaching duties regarding animals in Kant's ethics and seeks to show that Kantians underestimate essential differences between Kant and his rivals today (i.e., proponents of animal rights and utilitarians) on a practical and fundamental level. It also argues that Kant's indirect duty view has not been defended convincingly: the defence tends to neglect theory-immanent problems in Kant's ethics connected with unfounded value assumptions and unconvincing arguments for the denial of animals' moral status. However, it is suggested that although the human-animal relationship was not a central concern of Kant's, examination of the animal question within the framework of Kant's ethics helps us to develop conceptual clarity about his duty concept and the limitations of the reciprocity argument.","['Animal Rights', 'Kantian Ethics', 'Animal Ethics', 'Animal Turn', 'Duties Regarding Animals', 'Indirect Duty View']",[],[],NaN

The amplitudes of systolic murmurs were evaluated using the signal-to-noise ratio and compared between healthy neonates and those with congenital heart defects. In addition, the correlation between the amplitudes of systolic murmurs recorded by the piezoelectric sensor and electronic stethoscope was determined. The amplitudes of systolic murmurs detected by the piezoelectric sensor were significantly higher in neonates with congenital heart defects than in healthy neonates ( p   p  < 0.01, respectively). The piezoelectric sensor can detect heart murmurs objectively.

Methods Data were included from 70,750 NHW and NHB postmenopausal women from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI OS). Body Mass Index (BMI) at baseline was used to classify women as having normal weight, overweight, obese class I, obese class II or obese class III. Cox proportional hazards was used to estimate the hazard of a 10% or more increase in weight from baseline. Results In both crude and adjusted models, NHBs were more likely to experience ≥10% weight gain than NHWs within the same category of baseline weight status. Moreover, NHBs who were normal weight at baseline were most likely to experience ≥10% weight gain in both crude and adjusted models. Age-stratified results were consistent with overall findings. In all age categories, NHBs who were normal weight at baseline were most likely to experience ≥10% weight gain. Based on the results of adjusted models, the joint influence of NHB race/ethnicity and weight status on risk of postmenopausal weight gain was both sub-additive and sub-multiplicative. Conclusion NHBs are more likely to experience postmenopausal weight gain than NHWs, and the disparity in risk is most pronounced among those who are normal weight at baseline.

Thus, understanding client's knowledge about SARS-COV2 causes, roots of transmissions, and prevention strategies are urgently warranted. Although there were global studies reported knowledge and preventive practices of COVID-19, but the information is not representative and inclusive for Ethiopia. Thus, the current study is done to identify the knowledge and the prevention strategies for COVID-19 among clients in South Wollo, Ethiopia. Methods An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 21 to 30, 2020 among clients seeking service in Dessie town health facilities. A total of 81 clients were included from the selected health facilities with simple random sampling technique. We developed measuring tools by adopting from World Health Organization and center for disease prevention recommendation manual for assessing service providers' knowledge and preventive practices. For data entry Epi-data 3.1 version was employed and further data management and analysis was performed using STATA Version 14. Student T-test and one way ANOVA were computed to see the mean difference in knowledge and practice between and among the group. Chi-square test was also done to portray the presence of association between different co-variants with client's knowledge and preventive practices. Results Findings of the study showed that more than half (56.8%) of the participants had good knowledge about its symptoms, way of spread and prevention of the virus. Furthermore, 65.4% of clients demonstrated five or more preventive practice measures of COVID-19. The mean preventive practice score with standard deviation was (4.75±1.28 from 6 components). In the current study, knowledge had no significant difference among sex, education status, and monthly income. However, COVID-19 transmission knowledge was significantly higher among urban residents. Thus, clients who were knowledgeable about way of transmission and symptoms of COVID-19 had significantly higher COVID-19 preventive practice. Conclusion Our findings revealed that clients' knowledge and preventive practice of COVID-19 were not optimal. Clients with good knowledge and urban residents had practiced better prevention measures of the pandemic, signifying that packages and programs directed in enhancing knowledge about the virus is useful in combating the pandemic and continuing safe practices.",[],"['Wollo University', 'Health Sciences', 'participate Ethical', 'Ethical clearance', 'ethical review', 'Ethics approval', 'review committee', 'Ethical', 'University', 'College']",[],NaN

Shed β2-m is measurable in circulation, and various disorders are accompanied by increases in β2-m levels, including several viral infections. Therefore, we explored whether β2-m levels could also be elevated in Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and whether they predict disease severity. Serum β2-m levels were measured in a cohort of 34 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 on admission to a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as well as in an approximately age-sex matched group of 34 uninfected controls. Mean β2-m level was 3.25±1.68 mg/l (reference range 0.8-2.2 mg/l) in patients (mean age 48.2±21.6) and 1.98±0.61 mg/l in controls (mean age 48.2±21.6). 17 patients (mean age 36.9± 18.0) with mean β2-m levels of 2.27±0.64 mg/l had mild disease by WHO severity categorization, 12 patients (mean age 53.3±18.1) with mean β2-m levels of 3.57±1.39 mg/l had moderate disease, and five patients (of whom 2 died; mean age 74.4±13.8) with mean β2-m levels of 5.85±1.85 mg/l had severe disease (P < = 0.001, by ANOVA test for linear trend). In multivariate ordinal regression β2-m levels were the only significant predictor of disease severity. Our findings suggest that higher β2-m levels could be an early indicator of severity of disease and predict outcome of Covid-19. As the main limitations of the study are a single-center study, sample size and ethnicity, these results need confirmation in larger cohorts outside the Arabian Peninsula in order to delineate the value of β2-m measurements.

Chagas disease can lead to chronic cardiomyopathy and cardiac complications, with variable cardiac presentations in pediatrics making it difficult to recognize. The purpose of our study is to better understand current knowledge and experience with Chagas related heart disease among pediatric cardiologists in the U.S. Methods We prospectively disseminated a 19-question survey to pediatric cardiologists via 3 pediatric cardiology listservs. The survey included questions about demographics, Chagas disease presentation and experience. Results Of 139 responses, 119 cardiologists treat pediatric patients in the U.S. and were included. Most providers (87%) had not seen a case of Chagas disease in their practice; however, 72% also had never tested for it. The majority of knowledge-based questions about Chagas disease cardiac presentations were answered incorrectly, and 85% of providers expressed discomfort with recognizing cardiac presentations in children. Most respondents selected that they would not include Chagas disease on their differential diagnosis for presentations such as conduction anomalies, myocarditis and/or apical aneurysms, but would be more likely to include it if found in a Latin American immigrant. Of respondents, 87% agreed that they would be likely to attend a Chagas disease-related lecture.

In general, we noted that the vaccination status among the women was heterogeneous, ranging from 8.3% (vaccine against Human Papillomavirus, HPV) to 65.6% (vaccine against Diphtheria Tetanus and Pertussis, DTaP). Excluding the women who contracted the diseases in the past, the main ground for refusal was the lack of information.

Mitigation of this risk can be achieved via surveillance or prophylactic mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction. Those that choose surgery expect to reduce their chance of developing cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of patients developing breast cancer prior to surgery and to identify modifiable contributing factors within the patient journey. This is a historical cohort study of all BRCA mutation carriers identified through the British Columbia Cancer Hereditary Cancer Program between 2000 and 2012. Patients were divided into two groups: surveillance (S) and prophylactic mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (PM/IBR). The incidence of cancer, time to PM/IBR and patient journeys were analyzed. A total of 333 women were identified. The time to surgery from mutation disclosure was a median of 31 (5.3, 75.7) months. During this period, 6% of patients developed breast cancer compared with a 14% incidence of breast cancer in patients choosing surveillance. The majority of time to surgery was attributed to the period between mutation disclosure and the decision to proceed with surgery. Strategies to facilitate decision-making as well as wait list prioritization and dedicated operative time should be targeted to this population to decrease the number of women developing an interval cancer prior to surgery.","['Breast cancer', 'Breast Reconstruction', 'Brca', 'Prophylactic Surgery']","['British Columbia', 'Cancer Program', 'Cancer Agency', 'Columbia Clinical', 'Columbia Cancer', 'Clinical Research', 'Hereditary Cancer', 'Ethics Board', 'Ethics Approval', 'Research Ethics']",[],NaN

Background Nurse navigators are registered nurses employed by public hospitals in Queensland, Australia, to coordinate the care of patients with multiple chronic conditions, who frequently miss hospital appointments. The role of the nurse navigator is to improve care management of these patients. Evidence for this is measured through improvement in patient self-management of their conditions, a reduction in preventable hospital admissions and compliance with attendance at outpatient clinics. Failure to attend (FTA) is one measure of hospital utilisation, identifying outpatient appointments that are cancelled or not attended. Method The cohort for this study was patients with multiple chronic conditions, and nurse navigators coordinating their care. Data describing the concept of FTA were thematically analysed twelve months into this three year evaluation. Results Although the patient is blamed for failing to attend appointments, the reasons appear to be a mixture of systems error/miscommunication between the patient and the health services or social reasons impacting on patient's capacity to attend. Themes emerging from the data were: access barriers; failure to recognise personal stigma of FTA; and bridging the gap. Conclusion The nurse navigators demonstrate their pivotal role in engaging with outpatient services to reduce FTAs whilst helping patients to become confident in dealing with multiple appointments. There are many reasons why a patient is unable to attend a scheduled appointment. The phrase 'Failure to Attend' has distinctly negative connotations and can lead to a sense of blame and shame for those with complex chronic needs. We propose the use of the neutral phrase ""appointment did not proceed"" to replace FTA. Implications for nursing management This article advocates for further consideration of collaborative models that engage the patient in their care journey and for consideration of the language used within the outpatient acute hospital setting, proposing the term 'appointment did not proceed.'",[],[],[],NaN

Several genospecies of  B. burgdorferi  are pathogenic to humans.  B. burgdorferi  sensu stricto, which is prevalent in North America, causes reactive arthritis, whereas  B. garinii  and  B. afzelii,  common in Europe, can affect the skin, heart, or nervous system; it has been shown that the clinical symptoms of the disease may be very different. The objective of this study was to identify the baseline characteristics of Lyme disease and to elucidate the frequency of different Lyme disease syndromes in Lithuania.  Materials and Methods:  Patients who were diagnosed with Lyme disease during an ambulatory visit to the Center of Infectious Diseases, Vilnius University Santaros clinics, from 2014 to 2016, were enrolled in this study. A retrospective material analysis was conducted.  Results:  In total, 1005 patients were enrolled with the following prevalence of clinical syndromes: erythema migrans (EM), 945 (94.02%); Lyme arthritis, 32 (3.18%); neuroborreliosis, 23 (2.28%); Lyme carditis, 4 (0.39%); and acrodermatitis, 1 (0.09%). Erythema migrans was dominant among middle-aged women, with a rash appearing mainly on the lower extremities. Lyme arthritis mainly manifested among middle-aged women as an oligoarthritis, mostly affecting the knee joint. Neuroborreliosis was seen more often in middle-aged women than men and the main symptom was nervus facialis neuropathy. Lyme carditis, manifested as an atrioventricular block, with a male/female ratio of 3:1, and the median age was 51. Acrodermatitis was diagnosed in a 61-year-old woman, as a painful, red rash on the hand.  Conclusions:  According to the prevalence of  B. garinii  and  B. afzelii  in Europe, previously it was thought that Lyme disease presented as erythema migrans, and less frequently as neuroborreliosis; however, this study revealed that other syndromes may also be seen.

In this paper, we report two pathogenic  EPHA2  variants in unrelated families presenting with bilateral microphthalmia and congenital cataracts. Whole genome sequencing through the 100,000 Genomes Project and cataract-related targeted gene panel testing identified autosomal dominant heterozygous mutations segregating with the disease: (i) missense c.1751C>T, p.(Pro584Leu) and (ii) splice site c.2826-9G>A.

Ligands for NKp30, including BAG6 and B7-H6, are upregulated in virus-infected and tumor cells but rarely detectable on healthy cells. These ligands are released by tumor cells as part of the cellular secretome and interfere with NK cell activity. BAG6 is secreted via the exosomal pathway, and BAG6-positive extracellular vesicles (EV-BAG6) trigger NK cell cytotoxicity and cytokine release, whereas the soluble protein diminishes NK cell activity. However, the extracellular format and activity of B7-H6 remain elusive. Here, we used HEK293 as a model cell line to produce recombinant ligands and to study their impact on NK cell activity. Using this system, we demonstrate that soluble B7-H6 (sB7-H6), like soluble BAG6 (sBAG6), inhibits NK cell-mediated target cell killing. This was associated with a diminished cell surface expression of NKG2D and NCRs (NKp30, NKp40, and NKp46). Strikingly, a reduced  NKp30  mRNA expression was observed exclusively in response to sBAG6. Of note, B7-H6 was marginally released in association with EVs, and EVs collected from B7-H6 expressing cells did not stimulate NK cell-mediated killing. The molecular analysis of EVs on a single EV level using nano flow cytometry (NanoFCM) revealed a similar distribution of vesicle-associated tetraspanins within EVs purified from wildtype, BAG6, or B7-H6 overexpressing cells.

Its intensive care units (ICUs) consist of interdisciplinary ICUs (103 beds), medical ICUs (36 + 14 beds) and a neurological intensive care unit for adults, as well as a neonatal/pediatric intensive care unit. In 2008, the EC service at UKA was founded as a clinical ethics committee by resolution of the management board of the hospital that thereby answered to a joint initiative of the Institute of History, Theory and Ethics of Medicine and the Clinic for Palliative Medicine (with both institutions being headed by medically trained directors). The committee has 18–20 members (part of whom have special, certified training in ethics consultation), is multidisciplinary and initially defined consultation, education and policy work (all upon request) as its main tasks. In doing so, it primarily aimed to support patients, relatives and professionals in ethically complex conflicts and decision-making. The committee drew up its own rules of procedure in 2009, which did not address the issue of recommendation giving in ethics consultations in detail. However, it had been the common understanding of the founding members that consultations are not only aiming at “ethics facilitation” in accordance with ASBH guidelines [ 1] (facilitating a “principled resolution” within the boundaries of widely accepted ethical principles [ 15]), but can also include recommendation giving. The rules of procedure, for example, state that no committee member can be forced to participate in a consultation or recommendation. A pure facilitation approach was never intended by the committee. The first contact for all consultation requests is a clinical ethicist (key contact person), who worked as a physician before specializing in clinical ethics and ethics consultation. She has additional training in conflict mediation. Only three members of the committee are nonclinicians (pastors and an ethicist), and the remaining members are physicians, nurses or case managers or have two qualifications (physician and ethicist).

In 2010/2011, the service implemented additional ethics rounds as a structure for continuous discussion of ethical aspects in patient-centered rounds in intensive care units. Usually, a clinical ethicist participates in these rounds—provides support based on professional expertise, if needed—and ensures that the reflection process follows given rules. In addition to the usual daily treatment plan resulting from interdisciplinary communication, during ethics rounds, the whole team explicitly reflects on ethical aspects in their discussion of each patient, including patient wishes, end-of-life issues, issues of patient autonomy, surrogate decision-making and differing perspectives among the staff when appropriate. This initiative was prompted by ICU teams, and ethics rounds were implemented in 2011. At the same time, requests for ethics consultation rose to 20–30 requests annually, with more than 80% coming from the intensive care units. The EC service at UKA addresses consultation requests using a tiered approach and always starts with facilitation efforts in one or several meetings with all parties involved to support clarification in value uncertainties or to mediate in case of conflict. These facilitation efforts can result in four different outcomes: The facilitation succeeds in the resolution of a conflict or the clarification of value uncertainties, so that the parties are able to reach a consensus regarding for example the next steps of the treatment plan or the limitation of therapy.It does not succeed in developing a resolution or clarification and the clients wish to proceed with a subsequent meeting in a conventional consultation setting, where the EC service typically gives a recommendation, i.e., offers advice as to what an ethically best course of action could be.The resolution or clarification developed in the facilitated meeting seem ethically unsupportable (i.e. clearly incompatible with widely accepted ethical principles) from the perspective of the EC service. Than the EC service proceeds with a subsequent meeting in a conventional consultation setting, where it typically gives a recommendation.As an additional option for example in urgent cases and again typically on request of clients, a recommendation can be given at the end of the first facilitated meeting without any further conventional consultation meeting. In such cases, the committee member involved has to switch roles during the meeting (from facilitator to consultant). Usually, three to five members of the committee (key contact person, one chairperson and one to three other members) take part in conventional consultations. Facilitated meetings, in contrast, are usually conducted by only one or two members of the committee (key contact person and a chairperson/other member)."," Background The theory and practice of ethics consultations (ECs) in health care are still characterized by many controversies, including, for example, the practice of giving recommendations. These controversies are complicated by an astonishing lack of evidence in the whole field. It is not clear how often a recommendation is issued in ethics consultations and when and why this step is taken. Especially in a facilitation model in which giving recommendations is optional, more data would be helpful to evaluate daily practice, ensure that this practice is in line with the overarching goals of this approach and support the development of standards. Methods We analyzed all consultations requested from an EC service working under a facilitation approach at a maximum-care university hospital in Germany over a period of more than 10 years. Our aim was to better understand why-and under what circumstances-some consultation requests result in a recommendation, whereas others can be sufficiently addressed solely by facilitated meetings. We especially wanted to know when and why clients felt the need for clear advice from the EC service while in other cases they did not. We compared ethics consultations in terms of the differences between cases with and without recommendations issued by the ethics consultants using χ 2  difference tests and Welch's t-test. Results A total of 243 ECs were carried out between September 2008 and December 2019. In approximately half of the cases, a recommendation was given. All recommendations were issued upon the request of clients. When physicians asked for an EC, the consultation was significantly more likely to result in a recommendation than when the EC was requested by any other party. ECs in cases on wards with ethics rounds resulted in comparably fewer recommendations than those in wards without ethics rounds. When interpersonal conflicts were part of the problem or relatives were present in the meeting, clients less frequently asked for a recommendation. Conclusion From the client's point of view, there does not seem to be only one ""right"" way to provide ethics consultations, but rather several. While facilitated meetings are obviously appreciated by clients, there also seem to be situations in which a recommendation is desired (especially by physicians). Further empirical and theoretical research is needed to validate our single-center results and re-evaluate the role of recommendations in ethics consultations.","['Professional Ethics', 'Ethics Consultation', 'Ethics Facilitation']","['RWTH Aachen', 'Uniklinik RWTH', 'maximum-care university', 'Ethics consultation', 'Ethics', 'university hospital', 'consultation', 'committee', 'large maximum-care', 'consultation requests']",['of'],NaN

Methods All members of Hungarian Society of Gastroenterology were invited between 7 and 17 April 2020 to participate in this cross-section survey study and to complete an online, anonymous questionnaire. Results Total of 120 endoscopists from 83 institutes were enrolled of which 35.83% worked in regions with high cumulative incidence of COVID-19. Only 33.33% of them had undergone training about infection prevention in their workplace. 95.83% of endoscopists regularly used risk stratification of patients for infection prior endoscopy. While indications of examinations in low risk patients varied widely, in high-risk or positive patients endoscopy was limited to gastrointestinal bleeding (95.00%), removal of foreign body from esophagus (87.50%), management of obstructive jaundice (72.50%) and biliary pancreatitis (67.50%). Appropriate amount of personal protective equipment was available in 60.85% of endoscopy units. In high-risk or positive patients, surgical mask, filtering facepiece mask, protective eyewear and two pairs of gloves were applied in 30.83%, 76.67%, 90.00% and 87.50% of cases, respectively. Personal protective equipment fully complied with European guideline only in 67.50% of cases.

While the challenges of conducting research in high-prevalence countries are well published, there is a paucity from low COVID-19 countries. Methods A PRISMA guided systematic review was conducted using the databases Ovid-Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science to identify relevant articles discussing ethical issues relating to research in low prevalence COVID-19 countries. Results The search yielded 133 original articles of which only 2 fit the inclusion criteria and aim, with neither specific to low prevalence. Most of the available literature focused on clinical management and resource allocation related to high prevalence countries. These results will be discussed under the ethical dimensions of equity, individual liberty, privacy and confidentiality, proportionality, public protection, provision of care, reciprocity, stewardship and trust.. Conclusions A systematic review failed to identify articles relating to COVID-19 research ethics, specific to low prevalence countries. It shows that there is a significant gap in the literature that warrants further investigation. Common ethical principles were used to present a distinct set of challenges experienced by a country with a low prevalence of COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and clinical features in a developing country, thereby providing some experience in the treatment and prevention of this particular type of injury.  Methods:  A 5-year retrospective review of patients with treadmill hand injury in Burn and Plastic Surgery ward at Children' Hospital of Chongqing Medical University was conducted. Demographics, injury details, therapy performed, length of hospital stay, complications, and outcome were analyzed.  Results:  Forty-six patients were surveyed, with a mean age of 3.5 ± 2.0 years old, including 24 males and 22 females. Injuries (77.8%) occurred between dinner to bedtime, and 95.7% happened indoors. Fingers were the most vulnerable part, of which the middle finger, ring finger, and index finger were the top three ones. The mean body surface area (BSA%) was 0.3 ± 0.2, but at least in deep dermal.

Methods Data come from the wave 9 (2017-19) of Understanding Society and the following April (n = 15,426) and May (n = 14,150) waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at both before and during the lockdown, and unpaid care work was measured during the lockdown. Linear regression models were used. Results Women spent much more time on unpaid care work than men during lockdown, and it was more likely to be the mother than the father who reduced working hours or changed employment schedules due to increased time on childcare. Women who spent long hours on housework and childcare were more likely to report increased levels of psychological distress. Working parents who adapted their work patterns increased more psychological distress than those who did not.

We herein report the incidence and risk factors for major bleeding in the Norwegian Coronary Stent Trial (NORSTENT). Materials and methods NORSTENT was a randomized, double blind, pragmatic trial among patients with acute coronary syndrome or stable coronary disease undergoing PCI during 2008-11. The patients (N = 9,013) were randomized to receive either a drug-eluting stent or a bare-metal stent, and were treated with at least nine months of DAPT. The patients were followed for a median of five years, with Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 3-5 major bleeding as one of the safety endpoints. We estimated cumulative incidence of major bleeding by a competing risks model and risk factors through cause-specific Cox models. Results The 12-month cumulative incidence of major bleeding was 2.3%. Independent risk factors for major bleeding were chronic kidney disease, low bodyweight (  80 years). A myocardial infarction (MI) or PCI during follow-up increased the risk of major bleeding (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1-29-2.15). Conclusions The 12-month cumulative incidence of major bleeding in NORSTENT was higher than reported in previous, explanatory trials. This analysis strengthens the role of chronic kidney disease, advanced age, and low bodyweight as risk factors for major bleeding among patients receiving DAPT after PCI.

There is lack of evidence regarding the risk factors for this postoperative complication. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of postoperative gastric perforation in patients undergoing CRS for peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) and to evaluate risk factors predisposing to this complication. Methods We designed a unicentric retrospective study to identify all patients who underwent an open upfront or interval CRS after a primary diagnosis of PC of different origins between March 2007 and December 2018 at a French Comprehensive Cancer Center. The main outcome was the occurrence of postoperative gastric perforation. Results Five hundred thirty-three patients underwent a CRS for PC during the study period and 13 (2.4%) presented a postoperative gastric perforation with a mortality rate of 23% (3/13). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 283 (53.1%) patients and 99 (18.6%) received hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). In the univariate analysis, body mass index (BMI), peritoneal cancer index, splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and histology were significantly associated with postoperative gastric perforation. After multivariate analysis, BMI (OR [95%CI] = 1.13 [1.05-1.22], p = 0.002) and splenectomy (OR [95%CI] = 26.65 [1.39-509.67], p = 0.029) remained significantly related to the primary outcome. Conclusions Gastric perforation after CRS is a rare event with a high rate of mortality. While splenectomy and increased BMI are risk factors associated with this complication, HIPEC does not seem to be related. Gastric perforation is probably an ischemic complication due to a multifactorial process. Preventive measures such as preservation of the gastroepiploic arcade and prophylactic suture of the greater gastric curvature require further assessment.",[],[],[],NaN

Objective To develop an unbiased and semi-automated imaging methodology to quantify dermal cystine crystal accumulation in patients to correlate with disease status. Design, setting and participants 101 participants, 70 patients and 31 healthy controls, were enrolled at the University of California, San Diego, Cystinosis Clinics, Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego and at the annual Cystinosis Research Foundation family conference for an ongoing prospective longitudinal cohort study of cystinosis patients with potential yearly follow-up. Exposures Intradermal reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging, blood collection via standard venipuncture, medical record collection, and occasional skin punch biopsies. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was to establish an automated measure of normalized confocal crystal volume (nCCV) for each subject. Secondary analysis examined the association of nCCV with various clinical indicators to assess nCCV's possible predictive potential. Results Over 2 years, 57 patients diagnosed with cystinosis (median [range] age: 15.1 yrs [0.8, 54]; 41.4% female) were intradermally assessed by RCM to produce 84 image stacks. 27 healthy individuals (38.7 yrs [10, 85]; 53.1% female) were also imaged providing 37 control image stacks. Automated 2D crystal area quantification revealed that patients had significantly elevated crystal accumulation within the superficial dermis. 3D volumetric analysis of this region was significantly higher in patients compared to healthy controls (mean [SD]: 1934.0 μm3 [1169.1] for patients vs. 363.1 μm3 [194.3] for controls, P Conclusions and relevance This study used non-invasive RCM imaging to develop an intradermal cystine crystal quantification method. Results showed that cystinosis patients had increased nCCV compared to healthy controls. Level of patient nCCV correlated with several clinical outcomes suggesting nCCV may be used as a potential new biomarker for cystinosis to monitor long-term disease control and medication compliance.",[],[],[],NaN

The participants accepted a consent statement to participate in this study.," Background:  Cervical cancer, caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, is the leading cause of female cancer deaths in South Africa. In 2014, the South African National Department of Health introduced a free public sector school-based HPV vaccination programme, targeting grade 4 girls aged ≥9 years. However, private sector school girls receive HPV vaccination through their healthcare providers at cost. This study investigated HPV vaccination knowledge, attitudes and practices of caregivers of girls aged ≥9 years in grades 4-7 attending South African private schools.  Methods:  A link to an online survey was circulated to caregivers via an email sent to school principals of all private schools in four provinces enrolling girls in grades 4-7. Following a poor post-reminder response, a paid Facebook survey-linked advert targeting South African Facebook users aged ≥25 years nationally was run for 4 days, and placed on the South African Vaccination and Immunisation Centre's Facebook page for 20 days.  Results:  Of 615 respondents, 413 provided HPV vaccination data and 455 completed the knowledge and attitudes tests. Most (76.5%) caregivers had good knowledge and 45.3% had positive attitudes. Of their daughters, 19.4% had received ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine. Of caregivers of unvaccinated girls, 44.3% and 41.1%, respectively were willing to vaccinate their daughters if vaccination was offered free and at their school. Caregivers of unvaccinated girls were more likely [odds ratio (OR): 3.8] to have been influenced by ""other"" influences (mainly online articles and anecdotal vaccine injury reports). Of caregivers influenced by their healthcare providers, caregivers of unvaccinated girls were more likely (OR: 0.2) to be influenced by alternative medical practitioners. Caregivers of vaccinated girls were more likely to have good knowledge (OR: 3.6) and positive attitudes (OR: 5.2). Having good knowledge strongly predicted (OR: 2.8) positive attitudes. Having negative attitudes strongly predicted (OR: 0.2) girls being unvaccinated.  Conclusion:  Providing free school-based HPV vaccination in the private sector may not increase HPV vaccination coverage to an optimal level. Since misinformation was the main driver of negative attitudes resulting in <20% of girls being vaccinated, an advocacy campaign targeting all stakeholders is urgently needed.","['South Africa', 'Vaccination Coverage', 'Human Papillomavirus Vaccine', 'Vaccine Hesitancy', 'Knowledge And Attitudes', 'Vaccine Confidence', 'Vaccine Misinformation', 'Private Sector Schools']","['Limpopo Turfloop', 'Turfloop Research', 'Ethics Committee', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics Statement', 'involving human', 'Committee', 'Ethics', 'study involving', 'human participants']",[],NaN

Methods:  From January 2005 to December 2019, 19 double outlet right ventricle patients (median age 4 years) with mirror image-dextrocardia and a major coronary artery crossing the right ventricular outflow tract received surgical repair. An autologous pericardial patch was used to enlarge the right ventricular outflow tract in four patients without pulmonary stenosis and three patients with mild pulmonary stenosis. A valved bovine jugular venous conduit was added to a hypoplastic native pathway in nine patients, among which six patients with moderate pulmonary stenosis received small-sized bovine jugular venous conduit implantation (diameter ≤ 16 mm). In comparison, a large-sized bovine jugular venous conduit (diameter >16 mm) was adopted in a total of three patients with severe pulmonary stenosis. Finally, three patients with preoperative pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥40 mmHg) did not undergo further intervention of right ventricular outflow tract due to the adequate outflow tract blood flow.  Results:  There was no hospital mortality. One patient with sub-pulmonary ventricular septal defect and concomitant severe pulmonary hypertension died from respiratory failure 11 months after the operation. Kaplan-Meier survival was 94% at 5, 10 years. Within a mean echocardiographic follow-up of 6.9 ± 3.6 years, a total of two patients received reintervention due to valvular stenosis of the bovine jugular venous conduit (pressure gradient > 50 mmHg at 4 and 9 years) after surgical operation. Actuarial freedom from reoperation was 90 and 72% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. During the last echocardiographic follow-up phase, all the survivors were in NYHA class I.  Conclusions:  Double outlet right ventricle with mirror image-dextrocardia is a rare and complicated congenital cardiac malformation. Surgical reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract should be individualized based on the degree of pulmonary stenosis and the specific anatomical features of each patient. Reconstructing the pulmonary artery using the various sizes of valved bovine jugular venous conduit is a safe and effective surgical method.","['Coronary artery', 'Pulmonary Stenosis', 'Dextrocardia', 'Double Outlet Right Ventricle', 'Individualized Reconstruction']","['Xiangya Hospital', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'informed consent', 'Ethics', 'legal guardian', 'Statement Prior']",[],NaN

GBS can have different clinical manifestations; hence, the initial symptoms are also varied. Here, we describe a rare case of GBS presenting as hemiparesis and cranial nerve palsy, which mimic brainstem stroke.  Case Presentation:  A 53-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a 3-h history of left-arm weakness, glossolalia, and right eyelid droop. After admission, his condition suddenly worsened, with quadriplegia, bilateral peripheral facial palsy, bilateral ophthalmoplegia, and other neurological symptoms. Based on the findings from a neurological examination, MRI, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and nerve conduction study, a diagnosis of GBS was made. He received intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 kg/day) for 5 days. After 20 days of systematic therapy, his dysphagia, dyspnea, facial paralysis, ocular movement disorder, and leg weakness recovered almost completely, but his arms were still moderately impaired, with a power of 4/5. Fortunately, the patient recovered well without any sequelae after 2 years of follow-up.  Conclusions:  In patients with an atypical presentation, the diagnosis of GBS is often delayed. With this case report, we intend to highlight the fact that some symptoms mimicking stroke may be a feature of GBS at onset; close observation and timely diagnosis are crucial for clinicians. Neuroimaging is a valuable diagnostic tool in differentiating stroke from GBS.","['MRI', 'Guillain-Barre syndrome', 'Stroke', 'Ivig', 'Anti-gq1b']","['Jilin University', 'Institutional Review', 'Review Board', 'Union Hospital', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'China-Japan Union', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants']",[],NaN

Most reports on BWS cases focus on childhood patients. Studies on adult BWS patients are scarce. Our study reports a BWS family in which the disorder appears to be caused by deletion of  H19  and its upstream regulatory elements. Genetic analysis showed a heterozygous microdeletion (~chr11:2009895-2070570 (GRCh37)) in the patients. Maternal deletion in  H19  can result in loss of function of the IGF2-H19 imprinting control element, which leads to BWS. The male proband in this family was affected by the testicular anomaly and cryptorchidism. Early orchidopexy did not rescue his azoospermia, which might be not the consequence of cryptorchidism, but due to genetic defects associated with H19 deletion. In summary, our study gives some insights on the presentation of BWS in adulthood.","['Imprinting', 'Azoospermia', 'Mlpa', 'Beckwith–wiedemann Syndrome', '11P15']","['Guangzhou Women', 'Ethics Statement', 'Reproductive Medical', 'Ethics Committee', 'Children medical', 'medical center', 'Medical Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

Results Sixty percent faculties strongly agree regarding the beneficial role of mandatory inclusion of AETCOM competencies in competency-based medical education. About 61.66% of faculties strongly agree that both formative assessment and summative assessment of AETCOM are essential. Although 48.33% of faculties believed that theoretical questions can be used to assess AETCOM, 51.66% of faculties do not agree that theory examination serves as an effective tool to assess AETCOM. They believe that AETCOM cannot be written on paper and attitude can change in reality when facing a real-world clinical scenario in contrast to what is written in answer script during creative writing. Conclusions Assessment of AETCOM is essential and it should be preferably done via a practical approach in a real-world simulated scenario and not by written theoretical examination.","['Technology', 'Assessment', 'Communication', 'Ethics', 'Medical education', 'Education', 'Attitude', 'Competency-based']",[],[],NaN

Methods Aggregate DVA-related ER visits data, using relevant ICD-10-CA codes, from 2012 to 2016 were retrieved from IntelliHealth Ontario. The 2011 ON-Marg (Ontario Marginalization) indices were linked at the Dissemination Area level to ER data. Descriptive analyses including total number and rate of visits per 100,000 people were calculated, stratified by age and sex. The Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII) were also assessed. Results From 2012 to 2016, 10,935 (81.2% by females and 18.8% by males) DVA-related visits were made to ERs in Ontario. An annual average of 25.5 visits per 100,000 females and 6.1 visits per 100,000 males was observed. Residential instability and deprivation were significant predictors of DVA-related ER visits.

Table  3 shows that the responses reveal that editors agree with the concerns raised in three of the four questions. Editors tend to be neutral/agree in their views that the use of only one reviewer as inappropriate for most journals (average score of 3.7 and entropy of .77) and they tend to also agree that they should avoid sending manuscripts to reviewers with a known bias (average score 3.8 and entropy of .76). 20 On average editors tend to be neutral with the statement that editors should be allowed to publish in their own journals. 21 Here, the average score is 3.1. However, there is little consensus in their views (a high relative entropy score of .91). While about 28 percent of editors either strongly disagree or disagree with this view, another 43 percent of editors agree or strongly agree with this view. Finally, editors’ sensitivities to potential concerns about editorial practices do not appear to get in the way of realism. Editors tend to believe that it is important/very important that a submitted article cites articles from the editor’s journal in their references (with an average score of 3.5 in which 3 is important and 4 is very important, and an entropy measure of .81).  The ordered probit results in Tables  5 show three questions concerning ethics and editorial practices where differences in views are associated with group characteristics. The first question where this is true asks about the inappropriateness of the use of only one reviewer. Both estimated coefficients on the editorial position ( associate editor) and the editorâ€™s sex ( female) are positive and statistically significant. This indicates that associate editors relative to lead editors/co-editors and women editors relative to male editors are  more likely to strongly agree or agree with this statement. The only other group characteristic showing a statistically significant relationship with views in this question is  rank top 25%. Here, the estimated coefficient is negative indicating that editors of the top journals are  more likely to strongly disagree or disagree with this statement. The largest differences in views are associated with journal rank. Among male lead editors, those who edit top-ranked journals are about 13 percentage points less likely to strongly agree or agree with this statement than are editors of lower ranked journals. The second question in this section on editorial practices asks if editors should avoid sending manuscripts to reviewers likely to have a bias for or against a particular paper. The coefficient estimate for  US affiliation is negative and statistically significant indicating that editors with a US affiliation tend to disagree more with the statement than editors outside the US. Editors with a US affiliation are about 11 percentage points  less likely to strongly agree or agree than are editors outside the US. The final question in this group on editorial practices showing significant differences in responses by group characteristics asks how important is it that a submitted article cites articles from your journal in their references. Only journal rank plays a statistically significant role and here the differences in views are quite large. Results show that editors of the top journals are  more likely to view this as “extremely important” or “very important” than are editors of lower ranked journals. Editors of the top journals are about 31 percentage points  more likely to view this as “extremely important” or “very important” than editor of lower ranked journals. Taken in total, the differences in views that emerge on ethics and editorial practices show that while editors may have some concerns about the potential fairness of these practices, their concerns vary depending on whether they are editing a top-ranked journal and whether they have a US affiliation. Editors of top-ranked journals and editors residing in the US are less likely to have issues with some editorial practices raised in our questions that others may view as problematic.","This study examines survey data on the views of editors of economics journals on common critiques of the discipline, ethics and editorial practices, and the role of prestige and status in publishing. We utilize an ordered probit model to investigate whether editors or journal characteristics are systematically related to editors' views, controlling for gender and editorial position. Regression results show that editors from top-ranked journals are less likely to agree with common disciplinary critiques, more likely to support market solutions and less likely to agree with concerns about editorial practices.","['Higher Education', 'Research Institutions', 'Sociology Of Economics']","['editors', 'Editorial Practices', 'agree', 'journals', 'Editorial', 'Practices', 'important', 'views', 'strongly agree', 'average score']",[],NaN

Through PPI, patients and members of the public are increasingly involved in the design and conduct of clinical trials. PPI has been shown to improve the quality and relevance of research. During the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical trials have been playing a vital role in helping us find ways to prevent and treat the infection and improve our understanding of the virus. It is important that patients and the public are actively involved in deciding how COVID-19 research is carried out. Unfortunately, Research Ethics Committees in the UK have seen far less PPI for COVID-19 research studies compared with research before the pandemic. A key reason for this is that research is being designed much faster than normal and researchers may feel they do not have time to properly involve patients and the public. In this paper, we share our experiences of PPI for a COVID-19 clinical trial. We show that it is possible to rapidly involve patients and the public in COVID-19 clinical trials. We also explain how the design of the clinical trial was changed in response to feedback from public contributors. Lastly, we discuss the wider learning from this process which might be useful for researchers planning PPI activities for COVID-19 clinical trials in the future. Background Clinical trials are playing a critical role in the global public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the increasing recognition of the value of PPI in clinical trials, just 22% of the COVID-19 research proposals reviewed by Research Ethics Committees in the UK at the start of the pandemic reported PPI. There is a perception that PPI might result in delays in delivering research and therefore delays in obtaining important results. In this paper, we report our experience of rapid PPI for a COVID-19 clinical trial. Methods RAPID-19 is a COVID-19 clinical trial which was planned to be submitted for fast-track ethics review in the United Kingdom. During the development of the trial protocol, the PPI Panel at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Clinical Trials Unit was involved in the design of the study. The meeting with the PPI Panel lasted just over 1 h and was conducted by teleconference. Results Although we only had a short period of time to explore the study with the PPI Panel, we were able to gain valuable insight into how the trial would be perceived by potential trial participants. Substantive changes were made to the trial to improve the acceptability of the research without compromising the study timelines. Having access to public contributors with relevant lived experience is an important resource for a Clinical Trials Unit and is critical for rapid PPI. The move to remote working due to lockdown required virtual discussions which helped to overcome some of the barriers to organising face-to-face meetings at short notice. Conclusions PPI for clinical trials can be conducted in a time-efficient manner within the pressured environment of a pandemic. Involving PPI contributors at an early stage in protocol development maximised the opportunity to shape and influence the trial as well as limited potential delays which could occur if changes to the protocol had to be made at a later stage.","['Clinical Trials', 'Patient And Public Involvement', 'Covid-19']",[],[],NaN

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between perceived stress with sleep quality, insomnia, anxiety, depression and kidney function in kidney transplant recipients during the Covid-19 pandemic. Material and methods A hundred-six kidney transplant recipients were enrolled. Questionnaire of ""Socio-demographics"", ""Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)"", ""Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)"", ""Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)"" and ""Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS)"" are performed. The laboratory data is recorded. The perceived stress related to Covid-19 pandemic and its associations were investigated. Results The mean age of patients was 44.2±13.3 years, and 65 of the patients (61.3%) were men. Forty-nine (46.2%) of the patients had high-perceived stress; 51 (48.1%) of the patients had poor sleep quality, 40 (37.7%) of the patients had insomnia, 25 (23.6%) of the patients had anxiety and 47 (44.3%) of the patients had depression. The patients having a history of Covid-19 infection in own or closed relatives (9.09±4.17 vs 6.49±4.16, p:0.014) and the patients who have a rejection episode any of time (8.24±5.16 vs 6.37±3.57, p:0.033) have had significantly higher anxiety scores, when they compared to others. The high PSS were positively correlated with PSQI, ISI, HAD-A and HAD-D. Regression analyses revealed that high-perceived stress is an independent predictor of anxiety and depression. There was not significant difference between kidney function with PSS, PSQI, ISI, HAD-A and HAD-D. Conclusions High PSS is positively correlated with poor sleep quality and insomnia and also an independent predictor of anxiety and depression in kidney transplant recipients during the outbreak of Covid-19.

These technologies are, however, dependent on huge amounts of data, and the consequences of their mismanagement are significant. While the field of artificial intelligence ethics is able to provide a broad framework for those designing and implementing these technologies into the operating room, there is a need to determine and address the ethical and data governance challenges of using digital technology in this unique environment. Objective The objectives of this study are to define the term digital surgery and gain expert consensus on the key ethical and data governance issues, barriers, and future research goals of the use of artificial intelligence in surgery. Methods Experts from the fields of surgery, ethics and law, policy, artificial intelligence, and industry will be invited to participate in a 4-round consensus Delphi exercise. In the first round, participants will supply free-text responses across 4 key domains: ethics, data governance, barriers, and future research goals. They will also be asked to provide their understanding of the term digital surgery. In subsequent rounds, statements will be grouped, and participants will be asked to rate the importance of each issue on a 9-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (critically important).

Inflammation has been demonstrated to play a key role both in PDAC initiation and progression and several inflammation-based prognostic scores have been investigated in a wide range of malignancies. We compared the most analyzed inflammation-based prognostic scores in order to establish their potential impact on prediction of the outcome in advanced PDAC patients. Methods A total of 234 advanced PDAC patients undergoing first-line chemotherapy in our institute were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline clinicopathological and pre-treatment laboratory data were collected. Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and survival differences were evaluated using the log-rank test. Level of statistical significance P was set at 0.05. Only those variables that proved to be associated with statistically significant differences in outcome were compared in multivariate analysis using multiple Cox regression, as to identify their independent role and their relative power against each other. Results In the whole cohort, median overall survival (OS) was 8.7 months (95% CI: 7.8-9.4 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.1-4.2 months). At univariate analysis high systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) was related to shorter OS [hazard ratio (HR) =2.04, 95% CI: 1.59-4.19, P=0.0001] and PFS (HR =1.52, 95% CI: 1.11-2.20, P=0.01). This was maintained at multivariate analysis both for OS (HR =2.11, 95% CI: 1.29-3.46, P=0.003) and PFS (HR =1.64, 95% CI: 1.14-2.37, P=0.008), whereas other inflammation-based scores lost their independent role. Elevated SII (≥1,200) was associated with low albumin levels (P=0.03) and with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P=0.01). Conclusions Elevated SII represents an independent negative prognostic factor above all others for both OS and PFS in advanced PDAC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy, thus confirming a pivotal role of systemic inflammation on PDAC progression and on patient outcome.","['Inflammation', 'Prognosis', 'Pancreatic cancer', 'Systemic Immune-inflammation Index (Sii)']",[],[],NaN

All professions can report critical incidents anonymously, low-threshold, and without sanctions. Reported cases are processed to preventive measures that improve patient and staff safety. Clinical ethics consultations offer support for ethical conflicts but are dependent on the interaction with staff and management to be effective. The aim of this study was to investigate the rationale of integrating an ethical focus into CIRS. Methods A six-step approach combined the analysis of CIRS databases, potential cases, literature on clinical and organizational ethics, cases from ethics consultations, and experts' experience to construct a framework for CIRS cases with ethical relevance and map the categories with principles of biomedical ethics. Results Four main categories of critical incidents with ethical relevance were derived: (1) patient-related communication; (2) consent, autonomy, and patient interest; (3) conflicting economic and medical interests; (4) staff communication and corporate culture. Each category was refined with different subcategories and mapped with case examples and exemplary related ethical principles to demonstrate ethical relevance. Conclusion The developed framework for CIRS cases with its ethical dimensions demonstrates the relevance of integrating ethics into the concept of risk-, quality-, and organizational management. It may also support clinical ethics consultations' presence and effectiveness.

Repair surgery needs an appropriate patch to enlarge the narrowed artery from the right ventricular (RV) to the PA. Methods In this work, we proposed a generative adversarial networks (GANs) based method to optimize the patch size, shape, and location. Firstly, we built the 3D PA of patients by segmentation from cardiac computed tomography angiography. After that, normal and stenotic areas of each PA were detected and labeled into two sub-images groups. Then a GAN was trained based on these sub-images. Finally, an optimal prediction model was utilized to repair the PA with patch augmentation in the new patient. Results The fivefold cross-validation (CV) was performed for optimal patch prediction based on GANs in the repair of TOF and the CV accuracy was 93.33%, followed by the clinical outcome. This showed that the GAN model has a significant advantage in finding the best balance point of patch optimization. Conclusion This approach has the potential to reduce the intraoperative misjudgment rate, thereby providing a detailed surgical plan in patients with TOF.","['Pulmonary artery', 'Tetralogy of Fallot', 'patch', 'Cardiac Ct', 'Generative Adversarial Networks']","['China Hospital', 'Medical Research', 'West China', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'involving human', 'Hospital', 'retrospective study', 'study involving']",[],NaN

For each patient, three sample types were collected including NPS, NMTS, and saliva samples. NPS and NMTS samples were collected using a standard technique, as recommended by the manufacturer (Allplex TM 2019-nCoV Assay insert), and transported to the laboratory in a viral transport medium that was prepared according to the standard operating procedure of the CDC in the United States ( 13). Saliva samples were collected through an assisted self-sampling; it was asked to patients to collect saliva by tilting the head back for 10s and then spit it into a sterile vial. A total of 1–2 mL of saliva per patient was collected and processed."," Background:  Although the nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) is the reference sampling method for the detection of SARS-Cov-2, it is not always possible to collect NPS in some patients. Saliva represents an interesting sampling method because it is less invasive and more convenient in patients with nasal or pharyngeal lesions.  Objective:  To compare the RT-qPCR test performances of saliva samples with nasal mid-turbinate swab (NMTS) and NPS samples in a cohort of ambulatory patients suspected of having COVID-19.  Study Design:  For each of the 112 enrolled patients, NPS, NMTS, and saliva samples were collected and tested for SARS-Cov-2 detection using three different target genes (RdRP, N and E genes) by RT-qPCR.  Results:  Among the positive samples (56/112), saliva samples showed a lower percentage of SARS-Cov-2 detection compared to NPS samples, (85.7  vs . 96.4%), while still a lower percentage was observed for NMTS samples (78.6%). In average, saliva samples showed higher Ct values for all tested target genes, compared to those from NPS and NMTS samples.  Conclusions:  By using the Allplex TM  2019-nCoV Assay Kit, saliva samples showed lower sensitivity for SARS CoV-2 compared to NPS samples; however, the not detected cases had lower viral burden in NPS samples (CT values >33) representing an interesting alternative sampling method in patients in which it is not possible to take a NPS sample.","['Saliva', 'Rt-qpcr', 'Covid-19', 'Sar-cov-2', 'Nasopharangeal Swabs']","['Clínica Dávila', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Dávila', 'Committee', 'Ethics', 'Collection Unit']",[],NaN

Material and methods We enrolled 54 SCH and 41 age-, sex-, and education-matched controls. GMV and fALFF of SCH were compared with controls and between pre- and post-treatment within SCH group. Correlations of GMV and fALFF in SCH with thyroid function status and mood scales were assessed by multiple linear regression analysis. Results Compared to controls, GMV in SCH was significantly decreased in Orbital part of inferior frontal, superior frontal, pre-/postcentral, inferior occipital, and temporal pole gyrus. FALFF values in SCH were significantly increased in right angular, left middle frontal, and left superior frontal gyrus. After treatment, there were no significant changes in GMV and the local brain function compared to pre-treatment, however the GMV and fALFF of the defective brain areas were improved. Additionally, decreased values of fALFF in left middle frontal gyrus were correlated with increased mood scales. Conclusion In this study we found that patients with SCH, the gray matter volume in some brain areas were significantly reduced, and regional brain activity was significantly increased. After treatment, the corresponding structural and functional deficiencies had a tendency for improvement. These changes may reveal the neurological mechanisms of mood disorder in SCH patients.","['Subclinical Hypothyroidism', 'Levothyroxine', 'Low-frequency Fluctuation', 'Resting-state Functional Mri', 'Optimized Voxel-Based Morphometry']","['Sichuan University', 'China Hospital', 'West China', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Hospital', 'Sichuan', 'University']",[],NaN

Although, the efficacy of surgeon-performed thyroid FNA biopsies has been demonstrated in the literature, there are insufficient data regarding how to establish an efficient program with a low insufficiency rate within a group practice. Methods An endocrine surgery thyroid FNA biopsy program was established in 2000 by one surgeon, with training of additional partners during fellowship and upon recruitment. The results within 18 years were analyzed. The FNA biopsies were performed by endocrine surgeons under ultrasound guidance without on-site pathologist review. Results A total of 5,469 FNA biopsies were performed by 7 surgeons. The total number of FNA biopsies performed by each surgeon varied between 291-1,378. FNA biopsies were performed in 2 passes using 22-gauge needles under constant suction. The overall insufficiency rate was 4.3%, with individual surgeon rates ranging between 2.7% and 7.2%. The insufficiency rate for the whole team ranged between 3.3% and 5% when examined in 5-year blocks. Conclusions This study shows that an establishment of a highly efficient thyroid FNA biopsy program within a group practice is possible with a structured endocrine surgical training and adoption of a standard technique.","['Technique', 'thyroid', 'Fine Needle Biopsy', 'Endocrine Surgeon']",[],[],NaN

However, the role of CD276 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been thoroughly examined. A greater understanding of the regulatory mechanism of CD276 may improve the clinical response and efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Methods The expression of CD276 was measured by qRT-PCR, IHC and flow cytometry analysis. T cell infiltration in ESCC was measured by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence analysis. The regulation function of CD276 in glucose metabolism was examined by metabolism assays, western blotting and small molecule inhibitors. Transfection was used for gene editing. The oncogenic function of CD276 was examined in vivo by CAR-T cell therapy model. Results Based on our findings, CD276 regulated the expression of the  PKM2  gene in ESCC. Overexpression of CD276 induced the phosphorylation of PKM2 by the STAT3 signalling pathway to promote glucose metabolism in tumors. The accumulation of lactic acid in the tumor microenvironment has been reported to regulate the immune cells, particularly CD8+ T cells. We further analyzed the effect of CD276 on the function of T cells. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were used as effector cells to detect the effect of CD276 on immunotherapy. The therapeutic effects of CAR-T cells were markedly limited by CD276 overexpression. Conclusions Our results are the first to show that tumor-derived CD276 supports disease progression. Overexpression of CD276 promoted glucose metabolism in tumor and inhibited the function of CD8+ T cells. Therefore, strategies targeting CD276 might improve the response to cancer immunotherapy of ESCC patients.","['Glucose', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (Escc)', 'Pkm2', 'Cd276', 'Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells (Car-t)']",[],[],NaN

Extracts from earthworms have been used as alternative therapies for a variety of diseases but not in NAFLD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of earthworm extract (EE) on diet-induced fatty liver disease in guinea pigs. Methods EE was extracted, and the effect of EE on the lipid levels and liver damage in guinea pigs fed a high-fat diet (HFD) was assessed. Thirty male guinea pigs at 3 weeks of age were allocated equally to five groups, namely, chow diet, HFD, and HFD with different dosages (0.3, 1.4 and 6.8 µg per kg bodyweight per day) of EE for 4 weeks, and their body weight was monitored throughout the experiment. Liver tissues were examined for gross morphology and histology. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were determined using an autoanalyser. Results HFD induced NAFLD in guinea pigs. HFD-fed guinea pigs that received EE treatment showed milder increases in the serum levels of TC, TG and LDL-C, as well as in the body weight growth rate, compared to the HFD group without EE supplementation. EE intervention reduced the number of lipid-containing hepatocytes, hepatocellular ballooning and sinusoidal distortion in the liver in HFD-fed animals. ALT in serum was significantly elevated by HFD. No statistically significant difference in ALT levels was found between the chow diet group and the HFD group with EE treatment. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the administration of EE suppressed the induction of serum TC, TG and LDL-C in response to HFD. EE also reduced liver damage in HFD-fed guinea pigs. These findings suggest that EE has alleviating effects on dyslipidaemia and liver damage associated with NAFLD.","['Hyperlipidaemia', 'lipid metabolism', 'Fatty Liver Disease', 'Earthworm Extract (Ee)']",[],[],NaN

Ethics approval The study was approved under the Ipsos MORI research ethics committee.,"The COVID-19 pandemic put a large burden on many healthcare systems, causing fears about resource scarcity and triage. Several COVID-19 guidelines included age as an explicit factor and practices of both triage and 'anticipatory triage' likely limited access to hospital care for elderly patients, especially those in care homes. To ensure the legitimacy of triage guidelines, which affect the public, it is important to engage the public's moral intuitions. Our study aimed to explore general public views in the UK on the role of age, and related factors like frailty and quality of life, in triage during the COVID-19 pandemic. We held online deliberative workshops with members of the general public (n=22). Participants were guided through a deliberative process to maximise eliciting informed and considered preferences. Participants generally accepted the need for triage but strongly rejected 'fair innings' and 'life projects' principles as justifications for age-based allocation. They were also wary of the 'maximise life-years' principle, preferring to maximise the number of lives rather than life years saved. Although they did not arrive at a unified recommendation of one principle, a concern for three core principles and values eventually emerged: equality, efficiency and vulnerability. While these remain difficult to fully respect at once, they captured a considered, multifaceted consensus: utilitarian considerations of efficiency should be tempered with a concern for equality and vulnerability. This 'triad' of ethical principles may be a useful structure to guide ethical deliberation as societies negotiate the conflicting ethical demands of triage.","['Ethics', 'Resource allocation', 'Covid-19']","['statements Patient', 'Patient consent', 'Ipsos MORI', 'MORI research', 'ethics committee', 'Ethics', 'Ethics approval', 'research ethics', 'Ethics statements', 'Patient']",[],NaN

For this reason, the entire process of research mandates the researcher to protect the participants from any harm that may occur as a result of the research process (McMillan & Schumacher,  2010). To adhere to this custom, necessary ethical issues were taken into consideration. University of the Free State under the Faculty of Education Ethics Review Committee (Ethical clearance number UFS-HSD2019/0093/0205) granted the researchers ethical clearance for the study. Permission was also granted by the Ministry of Education and Training in the Berea district and the school principals in Lesotho. Moreover, consent by the teachers as well as assent from the learner themselves were sought and granted. Both the consent and the assent letters were made to ensure that the participants understand the details of the entire research process before the study commences. In this particular instance, the consent and assent forms were written and explained in the participantsâ€™ first language (in this case Sesotho). Also, a bigger font was used for LVIs to ensure the fairness of the ethics process (Creswell,  2014). The participants were also made aware of their right to participate or withdraw at any stage of the research (Cohen et al.,  2011). During the data generation methods (Focus group and collage discussions), the researchers ensured that the rights of the participants were not violated throughout the research process (Cohen et al.,  2011). Pseudonyms were used throughout the study to ensure anonymity and any potential harm (Bertram & Christian,  2014). Therefore, the researchers drew from a number of universal ethical principles, such as, Articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (UNESCO), the declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association,  2013), and ethical approaches to gathering information from children and adolescents in international settings (Schenk & Williamson,  2005) to ensure that the principles of human dignity, human rights, privacy, and confidentiality were adhered to.

Moreover, the voices of LVIs are often missing about the use of resources to improve their well-being. The study explored an asset-based approach for the improvement of LVIs' well-being in Lesotho. Method : Twenty-eight participants, including six teachers, four learners with and four learners without visual impairments, from two rural primary schools in Lesotho, were purposively chosen. Focus group discussions and collages were employed to generate data. The data were then analyzed thematically. Results : Involving LVIs in the decision-making, building positive relationships within the school, collaboration with parents and school leaders were provided as 'enabling assets' to improve the well-being of learners. Findings also revealed the constraints on LVIs' holistic well-being, such as, lack of management of the existing resources, shortage of qualified teachers,  and inadequate teaching resources. These were consistent with those identified in the literature, highlighting the asset-based complexity approach in rural schools. Conclusions : While the asset-based approach is virtuous, it may not be sufficient if the existing assets are not adequately managed. Therefore, were argue for the critical use of the asset-based approach towards improving the well-being of LVIs.","['Well-being', 'Collage', 'Rurality', 'Arts-based Methods', 'Asset-based Approach', 'Learners With/out Visual Impairments', 'Inclusive Schools']","['Research', 'research process', 'Ethical', 'Research ethics', 'important consideration', 'Resnik', 'Shamoo', 'participants', 'researchers', 'ensure']","['UFS-HSD2019/0093/0205)', 'of']",NaN

Objective:  This study aimed to investigate the resistance profiles, dissemination mechanism, and molecular characteristics of CRKA strains isolated from children in a pediatric hospital, Shanghai.  Method:  Fifty CRKA isolates were collected in 2019. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains was determined by broth microdilution method. The β-lactamases and outer membrane porin genes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conjugation experiments were performed to determine the transferability of the plasmids. The plasmids were typed based on their incompatibility group using the PCR-based replicon typing method. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR) were performed for the genetic relationship.

None of the mortalities identified were directly attributable to the cannulation approach in each case. Conclusions Despite the recent shift away from femoral cannulation, the results of the study show that femoral artery cannulation is safe and produces excellent results for establishing cardiopulmonary bypass. The concerns for malperfusion syndrome related to femoral cannulation were not seen.","['femoral artery', 'Aortic Dissection', 'Malperfusion']",[],[],NaN

Here, we conducted a statistical analysis to explore whether the curative efficacy of 2-cycle platinum-based chemotherapy can predict the survival of patients with SCLC. Methods Fifty-six SCLC patients who had each received 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled. The curative efficacy of the chemotherapy was evaluated, mainly by chest computed tomography, and the treatment response was categorized according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Patients were continuously followed up for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. The 55 patients were separated into 2 groups by the curative efficacy of the 2-cycle first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 17.0; SPSS, Inc.; Chicago, IL, USA). Results Patients who responded to 2-cycle chemotherapy (partial response, PR) had significantly better survival than others who did not (stable disease, SD or progressive disease, PD). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) in the PR group was 6.330 months, which was significantly longer than the 2.870 months seen in SD+PD group (95% CI: 4.631-8.029  vs.  0.000-5.790, P=0.022). The median overall survival (mOS) was 10.870 months in the PR group, which was remarkably longer than the 8.970 months observed in the SD+PD group (95% CI: 9.546-12.194  vs.  6.517-11.423, P=0.028). Curative efficacy had no correlation with clinical features. Conclusions The curative efficacy of 2-cycle first-line platinum-based chemotherapy was significantly correlated with PFS and OS, and showed prognostic value in SCLC patients. Patients who were sensitive to chemotherapy had superior survival to those who were chemotherapy insensitive.","['Survival analysis', 'Chemotherapy', 'Small Cell Lung Cancer (Sclc)']",[],[],NaN

Patients and methods Sixty-four participants diagnosed with severe eosinophilic asthma and who had completed 4 months of benralizumab treatment were included in this analysis. Pre-treatment clinical factors were compared between responders and non-responders according to improvements in ACT or FEV1. Correlations between the sums of increased Type 2-related inflammatory parameters and changes of ACT or FEV1 were also evaluated before and after the 4-month treatment. A two-step cluster analysis was performed to identify distinct phenotypes related to benralizumab responsiveness in terms of FEV1. Results At the 4-month timepoint, all parameters, except for FeNO, were significantly improved after benralizumab treatment. FEV1 responders were associated with higher levels of Type 2-related inflammatory parameters. An improvement in FEV1 but not in ACT was clearly associated with increases in the sums of increased type 2-related inflammation parameters (p = 0.0001).

When PDA persists, interstitial lung water content increases, which could lead to abnormal circulation hemodynamics and pulmonary edema. It is important to perform early and reliable assessment of lung water content in very low-weight preterm neonates with persistent PDA. Aim To evaluate the role of bedside cardiopulmonary ultrasonography in the lung water content assessment in very low-weight preterm neonates with persistent PDA. Methods From January 2018 to March 2020, 69 very low-weight preterm neonates with echocardiography-confirmed PDA were selected as the PDA group. At the same time, 89 very low-weight preterm neonates without PDA were randomly selected as the control group. All neonates underwent echocardiography and 6-segment lung ultrasonography on the fourth day after birth. The clinical characteristics and main ultrasonography results were compared between the two groups. Pearson's analysis was used to analyze the correlation between lung ultrasonography score (LUS) and other related clinical and ultrasonography results in all neonates. In the PDA group, PDA diameters were recorded, and the correlation with LUS and left atrium to aortic (LA/AO) dimension ratio were also analyzed. LA/AO ratio is one of the ultrasonic diagnostic criteria for hemodynamically significant PDA. When the ratio is ≥ 1.5, it suggests the possibility of hemodynamic changes in persistent PDA. A receiver operating characteristic curve was established using the sensitivity of LUS to predict the hemodynamic changes in neonates with PDA as the ordinate and 1-specificity as the abscissa. Results A total of 158 neonates were enrolled in this study, including 69 in the PDA group and 89 in the control group. There were no statistical differences in sex, gestational age, birth weight, ventilator dependence, hospitalization length and left ventricular ejection fraction between the two groups ( P  > 0.05). The LUS and LA/AO ratio in the PDA group were higher than those in the control group ( P   0.05), but there was no difference of LUS in neonates with or without use of the ventilator ( t  = 0.58,  P  = 0.16). In all cases, LUS was negatively correlated with gestational age ( r  = -0.28,  P   0.01) and birth weight ( r  = -0.36,  P   0.01), while positively correlated with the LA/AO ratio ( r  = 0.27,  P   0.01).

Still, we find that certain characteristics of Saudi bioethical practice acutely illustrate the importance of standardizing the practice of CEC, as standardization serves to establish a baseline of knowledge, skills, and reflective attitudes in practitioners. The nascent 6 field of Saudi bioethics has several distinct features. First, its dominant methodology is overwhelmingly legalistic. Saudi bioethics relies heavily on exegeting religious scripture as its underlying moral foundation. 7 Strict reliance on scripture and subsequent judicial rulings- absent moral analysis, intellectual engagement, or relevant context- stripped Saudi bioethics of the practiceâ€™s inherent reflective qualities and rendered it no more than jurisprudence. 8 Second, Saudi bioethics is unmistakably scientific. Its distinctive presentation as yet another clinical discipline is a direct response to its slow, precarious, and scientist-led entry into a well-established medical field [ 3]. This measured introduction ensured bioethics displayed the precise, logical, and quantifiable parameters permitting it a space within the technological norms of medicine. It also resulted in the abandonment of bioethicsâ€™ intrinsic strengths such as contemplation, deliberation, and conversation. Instead, Saudi bioethics took on the traditional characteristics of medicine and science: hierarchy, paternalism, and inflexibility. Third, Saudi bioethics is, regrettably, an exclusive domain. Its central practitioners and leading voices are not necessarily those of the most qualified, but rather those of the loudest and the most influential. 9 Indeed, bioethics remains an elusive discipline to most Saudi healthcare practitioners, a direct result of traditionally cursory bioethics education, an absent intellectual community, and limited scholarship [ 3]. Unsurprisingly, the curtailment and scientization of bioethics resulted in a detached discipline inattentive to the needs of its own community. We turn now to describe three specific problematic examples of practices in Saudi clinical ethics. Examples of problematic practices in Saudi clinical ethics Spousal consent requirements for medically-indicated hysterectomies and tubal ligations In Saudi Arabia, the requirement of the husband’s consent for women seeking elective, medically-indicated procedures resulting in irreversible sterility is a widely accepted measure [ 34]. 10 This prerequisite rests on two ethical claims: protecting the husband’s interest in having children, and upholding men’s legal authority over their women relatives. We find these assertions ethically problematic. Interest in a spouse’s ability to procreate is not always justified; for example, in situations where the couple is legally separated-but not yet divorced- or when women have passed childbearing age. Further, we question the appropriateness of exclusively favoring this interest over a woman’s authority when these procedures represent a viable therapeutic benefit for disabling conditions like chronic pelvic pain, dysfunctional bleeding, or cervical cancer. Additionally, these claims do not invoke a workable plan for when a husband overrides his wife’s consent for a medically indicated procedure. Perhaps most alarmingly, a spouse’s interest in the reproductive abilities of their partner does not appear to extend to women spouses. Few policies requiring women to consent to their husbands’ sterility-producing procedures appear to be in place. Indeed, given this disparity, we find these claims to be supportive of troubling gender discrimination, and needlessly dismissive of a woman’s interest in making independent medical decisions for herself. These requirements echo legal dictates instructing the male guardianship of Saudi women. 11 In 2019, however, these mandates were significantly loosened by royal decree [ 20]. The historic dismantlement of the male guardianship system was noted and celebrated by many. Even so, Saudi bioethicists appear eager to uphold and enact these now obsolete directives through requirements such as spousal consent. ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ guidelines Spousal consent requirements demonstrate how some ethical claims arrived at by Saudi bioethicists can be infused with certain antiquated and patriarchal ideals, furthering a bioethics that protects some persons’ interests over those of others. Unfortunately, Saudi bioethicists’ examination of resuscitation decisions at the end of life appears similarly ill-considered. National Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) guidelines are reflective not of careful, bioethical contemplation, but rather of scientific, procedural, and legal considerations. Released by the Saudi Health Council, recommendations are predominately concerned with two areas- the Islamic permissibility of DNR orders, and legal protections for practitioners [ 35]. For example, recommendations require the consensus of three doctors- a relic of Islamic law in matters of dispute and accountability. By contrast, the document pays little attention to patients’ and/or family members’ involvement in end of life decisions suggesting “communication” with the patient and/or family only when deemed appropriate or necessary by the attending physician, stressing that DNR decisions are ultimately medical decisions that do not require patient and/or family consent [ 35]. These DNR guidelines are faithfully replicated in the policies of medical institutions all over the country, absent expert ethical examination. Supported by these guidelines, Saudi clinicians have grown accustomed to making decisions unilaterally at the end of life, and vehemently oppose including patients or family members in decision-making. This is made evident in several recent studies including one which discovered that 53.8% of DNR orders in an intensive care unit lacked family involvement [ 17]. Similarly, another study found that over half of surveyed pediatricians believed that DNR determinations were at the physician’s discretion alone [ 2]. Alarmingly, DNR guidelines appear inconsistent with recent research on the preferences of Saudi patients. A 2019 study found that almost 70% of interviewed patients wanted to be involved in decisions involving DNR [ 26], as did another which found that two-thirds of hemodialysis patients wanted to make their own decisions at the end of life [ 5]. These figures are well illustrated by Al Mutair et al’s important work documenting the lived experiences of family members in an intensive care unit which found that participants deeply valued communication and involvement at the end of a loved one’s life [ 1]. The focus on legal and Islamic considerations gave the DNR guidelines essential legal and religious validity. The pragmatic approach to ethical issues at the of end of life permitted clinicians a certain comfortable practicality. Still, by allowing bioethics only a nominal presence, fundamental moral claims about life and death were neglected. Informed Consent Guidelines Saudi bioethicists’ endorsement of the aforementioned DNR guidelines effectively authorized the exclusion of patients and their family members from important end of life discussions. In a similar vein, bioethicists’ support of the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) new informed consent guidelines permits the disregard of patients’ realities and impedes their abilities for self-determination. Like the DNR recommendations, the MOHâ€™s informed consent guidelines were reached without the input of formally credentialed bioethicists [ 30]. These guidelines include at least two problematic recommendations. First, the document attempts to identify a formal order of surrogate decision-makers for incapacitated patients. The lexically ordered result favors male relatives over women family members, regardless the degree of closeness [ 30]. Although the document does not explicitly state it, this order mirrors Islamic rules of inheritance- yet another legal consideration removed from context. 12 Second, in addressing refusal of treatment, the document states that adults with decision-making capacity may not refuse life-saving treatment [ 30]. Again, the document provides no ethical support for its determination, although it likely stems from the Islamic, legal maxim on the protection of life. Further, this statement is practically unhelpful; it gives no guidance or moral clarity on just exactly how an adult, capacitated patient might be forced to undergo procedures they have unequivocally declined. It is disheartening to see pioneering, well-meaning efforts by the Saudi Health Council and the MOH undermined by limited bioethical contemplation. Without substantial input and critical examination by credentialed ethical experts, problematic policies will continue to thrive unchallenged. Absent discernable moral parameters, ethics goes awry. Dubious ethical claims are unquestioned, necessary philosophical conceptions are unexplored, and debates on goods and values are overlooked. Indeed, the absence of intellectual reflection and robust moral consideration results in a stunted bioethical practice incapable of addressing the complex needs of an increasingly sophisticated and diverse Saudi society and risks doing harm to the very population it purports to serve. An underdeveloped, unsophisticated bioethics discipline does more than simply flounder, it categorically fails. Conclusions for standardizing CEC in Saudi Arabia The experience of one of this paper’s authors as a clinical ethicist at a central Saudi hospital finds that ethicists have become little more than tools for enforcing hospital policy such as the ones concerning spousal consent, DNR or informed consent. As uncredentialled ethicists sanction such policies without considered reflection, their endorsement enables ethically questionable policy to continue, and hinders thoughtful examination of its limitations. Indeed, Saudi bioethics’ trepidatious and restricted journey has contributed to the development of an incomplete and ill-formed practice, one which is distinctly theological, 13 philosophically modest, worryingly exclusive, and seemingly negligent of the multi-disciplinary nature of bioethics. In Saudi Arabia where bioethical practice is still evolving, credentialing and standardization are vital. We hold that Saudi bioethics could be improved through standardization and that applying the phenomenological approach here, with its decidedly anti-credentialing stance and vague insistence on what is “local and particular” to a case, would only serve to maintain the status quo of a practice that causes great harm not only to individual patients and practitioners but to the practice of bioethics itself. In fact, we contend that Bishop et al’s concerns of an unreflective practice, uninformed process, and unfulfilled potential -as levied against the procedural view- are not far from the current realities of Saudi bioethics. Credentialing, in this context, could be a solution to these problems, not the cause of them. At this juncture, it is perhaps salient to consider the appropriateness of applying ASBH’s credentialing in a context so distinctly different from which it was first envisioned. In truth, the adoption of ASBH’s credentialing process would hardly be a novel occurrence for Saudi healthcare. Since its inception in the 1950s [ 4], the Saudi healthcare system has often looked to and borrowed from the healthcare procedures, designs, and guidelines of other countries, utilizing these experiences to benchmark its own progress towards a well-developed, world class health care system. In doing so, Saudi practitioners have been careful to alter and innovate in accordance with local customs and norms. Through its implementation of international guidelines, and its substantial number of Western trained Saudi medical professionals, Saudi healthcare became a true reflection of global medicine. The inclusion of ASBH’s CEC credentialing guidelines is the next natural step for Saudi healthcare. ASBH’s process offers important educational resources, tested methods, and examined intellectual assumptions that could serve as an important anchor for bioethics in Saudi Arabia. Like its clinical predecessors, ASBH’s credentialing standards must be conscious of the local environment. They must be adapted to engage, challenge, and empower local context and tradition- without giving way to ill-advised, ill-considered ethical claims that do more harm than good. The process of credentialing ensures this happens in two ways. First, through the substantive education of would-be bioethicists in bioethical discourse, methods, and overarching assertions. Second, through the establishment of a designated forum where bioethicists may debate policies and practices. Credentialing imparts substance and contemplation into a potentially unreflective ethical practice while also identifying and excluding untrained and harmful practitioners. Indeed, credentialing makes for a stronger, fairer, and frankly better, Saudi bioethics."," Background The purpose of this study is to make a philosophical argument against the phenomenological critique of standardization in clinical ethics. We used the context of clinical ethics in Saudi Arabia to demonstrate the importance of credentialing clinical ethicists. Methods Philosophical methods of argumentation and conceptual analysis were used. Results We found the phenomenological critique of standardization to be flawed because it relies on a series of false dichotomies. Conclusions We concluded that the phenomenological framing of the credentialing debate relies upon two extreme views to be navigated between, not chosen among, in the credentialing of clinical ethicists.","['Saudi Arabia', 'Credentialing', 'Phenomenology', 'Clinical Ethics Consultation']","['Saudi', 'Saudi bioethics', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Saudi healthcare', 'bioethics', 'DNR', 'DNR guidelines', 'Arabian bioethics', 'ostensibly American', 'Saudi Health']",['of'],NaN

This process is under the regulation of endocrine and testicular paracrine/autocrine factors. In the present study, we demonstrated that colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is produced by mouse testicular macrophages, Leydig, Sertoli, peritubular cells and spermatogonial cells (such as CDH1-positively stained cells; a marker of spermatogonial cells). In addition, we demonstrated the presence of CSF-1 and its receptor (CSF-1R) in testicular macrophages, Leydig, Sertoli, peritubular cells and spermatogonial cells of human testis. We also show that the protein levels of CSF-1 were the highest in testis of 1-week-old mice and significantly decreased with age (2-12-week-old). However, the transcriptome levels of CSF-1 significantly increased in 2-3-week-old compared to 1-week-old, and thereafter significantly decreased with age. On the other hand, the transcriptome levels of CSF-1R was significantly higher in mouse testicular tissue of all examined ages (2-12-week-old) compared to 1-week-old. Our results demonstrate the involvement of CSF-1 in the induction the proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonial cells to meiotic and postmeiotic stages (BOULE- and ACROSIN-positive cells) under in vitro culture conditions, using methylcellulose culture system (MCS). Thus, it is possible to suggest that CSF-1 system, as a testicular paracrine/autocrine system, is involved in the development of different stages of spermatogenesis and may be used in the development of future therapeutic strategies for treatment of male infertility.","['Testis', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Colony Stimulating Factor-1 (Csf-1)', 'In Vitro Culture Of Spermatogonial Cells', 'Testicular Autocrine/paracrine Factors']",[],[],NaN

The osteoclast differentiation mechanism suggests a possible strategy to treat bone diseases. In this regard, we recently examined the in vivo impact of kalkitoxin (KT), a marine product obtained from the marine cyanobacterium  Moorena producens  (previously  Lyngbya majuscula ), on the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and on the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-stimulated in vitro osteoclastogenesis and inflammation-mediated bone loss. We have now examined the molecular mechanism of KT in greater detail. KT decreased RANKL-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-multinucleated cells at a late stage. Likewise, KT suppressed RANKL-induced pit area and actin ring formation in BMM cells. Additionally, KT inhibited several RANKL-induced genes such as cathepsin K, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9), TRAP, and dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP). In line with these results, RANKL stimulated both genes and protein expression of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1), and this was also suppressed by KT. Moreover, KT markedly decreased RANKL-induced p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK pathways at different time points. As a result, KT prevented inflammatory bone loss in mice, such as bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoclast differentiation markers. These experiments demonstrated that KT markedly inhibited osteoclast formation and inflammatory bone loss through NFATc1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Therefore, KT may have potential as a treatment for destructive bone diseases.","['Inflammation', 'Osteoclast', 'Bone loss', 'Marine Natural Product', 'Kalkitoxin']","['South Korea', 'Jeonbuk National', 'National University', 'Bone Marrow', 'Marrow Macrophage', 'CBNU 2020-050', 'Macrophage Cell', 'Cell Culture', 'days', 'Animal Ethics']",[],NaN

Methods:  Over a 4-year period, injuries from England international footballers at training camps or matches were recorded, alongside self-reported information on menstrual cycle characteristics at the point of injury. Injuries in eumenorrheic players were categorized into early follicular, late follicular, or luteal phase. Frequencies were also compared between injuries recorded during the typical cycle and those that occurred after the cycle would be expected to have finished. Injury incidence rates (per 1,000 person days) and injury incidence rate ratios were calculated for each phase for all injuries and injuries stratified by type.  Results:  One hundred fifty-six injuries from 113 players were eligible for analysis. Injury incidence rates per 1,000 person-days were 31.9 in the follicular, 46.8 in the late follicular, and 35.4 in the luteal phase, resulting in injury incidence rate ratios of 1.47 (Late follicular:Follicular), 1.11 (Luteal:Follicular), and 0.76 (Luteal:Late follicular). Injury incident rate ratios showed that muscle and tendon injury rates were 88% greater in the late follicular phase compared to the follicular phase, with muscle rupture/tear/strain/cramps and tendon injuries/ruptures occurring over twice as often during the late follicular phase compared to other phases 20% of injuries were reported as occurring when athletes were ""overdue"" menses.  Conclusion:  Muscle and tendon injuries occurred almost twice as often in the late follicular phase compared to the early follicular or luteal phase.

We analyzed clinical signs, symptoms, histology, and neurological function in the cohort of adult patients with schwannomas without a neurocutaneous syndrome. In 144 patients, 147 surgical interventions were performed. Mean follow-up was 3.1 years. The indication for surgery was pain (66.0%), neurological deficits (23.8%), significant tumor growth (8.8%), and suspected malignancy (1.4%). Complete tumor resection was achieved on 136/147 occasions (92.5%). The most common location of the tumors was intraspinal (49.0%), within the cervical neurovascular bundles (19.7%), and lower extremities (10.9%). Pain and neurological deficits improved significantly ( p  ≤ 0.003) after 131/147 interventions (89.1%). One patient had a persistent decrease in motor function after surgery. Complete resection was possible in 67% of recurrent tumors, compared to 94% of primary tumors. There was a significantly lower chance of complete resection for schwannomas of the cervical neurovascular bundle as compared to other locations.

Methods We matched 22 patients with DON with 22 healthy controls (HCs). All subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.

Patients and methods A retrospective study that included eyes with uncomplicated superior bullous RRD in patients ⩽40 years old. DFCE technique consists of sequential drainage of subretinal fluid, intravitreal fluid injection, cryotherapy, and placement of a scleral explant(s). The primary outcome measure was anatomical reposition of the retina after a single surgery. Secondary outcome measures included improvement in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and any reported complication related to the procedure. Results The study included 51 eyes which met the study eligibility criteria. The mean duration of detachment was 19.7 ± 6.4 days. A single retinal break was found in 31 eyes (60.8%), and more than one break were found in 20 eyes (39.2%). The mean number of breaks per eye was 1.72 ± 1.04. The mean detached area per eye was 7.21 ± 3.19 clock hours, and the macula was detached in 22 eyes (43.1%). Flattening of the retina and closure of all retinal breaks was achieved in all eyes after a single surgery. Late recurrence of retinal detachment occurred in two eyes (3.9%) due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). No complicated cataract or iatrogenic retinal breaks were detected in all eyes. Conclusion DFCE technique could be effectively used for treatment of uncomplicated superior bullous RRD in adults ⩽40 years.

Arg1 has been associated with the suppression of antiviral immune responses. Methods Whole blood was taken from 21 COVID-19 patients and 21 healthy individuals, and after RNA extraction and complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis, gene expression of Arg1 was measured by real-time PCR. Results The qPCR results showed that the expression of  Arg1  was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals ( p   Arg1  expression in the whole blood of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed a considerable diagnostic value for  Arg1  expression in COVID-19 ( p  = 0.0002 and AUC = 0.8401).

Autosomal dominant CFEOM arises from heterozygous missense mutations of  KIF21A  or  TUBB3 . Although spatiotemporal expression studies have shown KIF21A and TUBB3 expression in developing retinal ganglion cells, it is unclear whether dysinnervation extends beyond the oculomotor system. We aimed to investigate whether dysinnervation extends to the visual system by performing high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans characterizing retinal ganglion cells within the optic nerve head and retina. Sixteen patients with CFEOM were screened for mutations in  KIF21A ,  TUBB3 , and  TUBB2B . Six patients had apparent optic nerve hypoplasia. OCT showed neuro-retinal rim loss. Disc diameter, rim width, rim area, and peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness were significantly reduced in CFEOM patients compared to controls ( p  < 0.005). Situs inversus of retinal vessels was seen in five patients. Our study provides evidence of structural optic nerve and retinal changes in CFEOM.

In hospitalized patients, DRPs happen during the whole process of drug use such as during prescription, dispensing, administration, and follow-up of their treatment. Unrecognized and unresolved DRPs lead to significant drug-related morbidity and mortality. Several studies conducted in different hospitals and countries showed a high incidence of DRPs among hospitalized patients. Despite the available gaps, there were scanties of studies conducted on DRPs among patients admitted to medical wards in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study assessed the magnitude of drug-related problems and associated factors among patients admitted to the medical wards of selected Southwestern Ethiopian hospitals. Patients and methods A multicenter prospective observational study was conducted at medical wards of Mettu Karl Hospital, Bedele General Hospital and Darimu General Hospital. Adult patients greater than 18 years who were admitted to the non-intensive care unit (ICU) of medical wards and with more than 48 h of length of stay were included. Identified DRPs were recorded and classified using the pharmaceutical care network Europe foundation classification system and adverse drug reaction was assessed using the Naranjo algorithm of adverse drug reaction probability scale. Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy Scale was used to measure medication adherence. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the associations between the dependent variable and independent variables. Result Of the 313 study participants, 178 (56.9%) were males. The prevalence of actual or potential DRPs among study participants taking at least a single drug was 212 (67.7%). About 125 (36.63%) patients had one or more co-morbid disease and the average duration of hospital stay of 7.14 ± 4.731 days. A total of 331 DRPs were identified with an average 1.06 DRP per patient. The three-leading categories of DRPs were unnecessary prescription of drugs 92 (27.79%), non-adherence (17.22%) and dose too high (16.92%). The most common drugs associated with DRPs were ceftriaxone (28.37%), cimetidine (14.88%), and diclofenac (14.42%). The area of residence (AOR = 2.550, 95CI%: 1.238-5.253, p = 0.011), hospital stay more than 7 days (AOR = 9.785, 95CI%: 4.668-20.511, p≤0.001), poly pharmacy (AOR = 3.229, 95CI%: 1.433-7.278, p = 0.005) were predictors of drug-related problem in multivariable logistic regression analysis.

This study was designed to explore the effect of intraperitoneal administration of melatonin on puberty onset in female mice. The injection of melatonin into postnatal days 10 mice at a dose of 15 mg/kg accelerated the puberty onset in mice. Mechanistically, there was no difference in physical growth and serum Leptin levels after melatonin administration. Meanwhile, the serum levels of reproductive hormones involved in hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, such as FSH and estrogen level in serum were increased. The mRNA levels of  GnRH  and  GnRHr  were not affected by melatonin, while the expressions of  FSHβ  in pituitary and  Cyp19a1  in ovary were significantly up-regulated. In addition, melatonin still promoted FSH synthesis after ovariectomy. Furthermore, the enhanced activity of ERK1/2 signaling verified that the expression of  FSHβ  increased in pituitary. We confirmed that melatonin promoted the FSH synthesis in pituitary, thereby increased serum estrogen levels and ultimately accelerated puberty onset. However, these effects of melatonin may be pharmacological due to the high dose.

We aimed to compare the accuracy of the AJCC staging system and the LN count-based staging system. Patients and methods EC patients were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between 2004 and 2016. Patients' characteristics were collected, including age, race, marital status, histological type, grade, therapeutic measures, the number of metastatic LNs, the number of dissected LNs, vital status, and survival in months. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and the concordance index (C-index) was used to compare the prognostic value of the AJCC staging system and the LN count-based staging system. Results We identified 4,276 EC cases from the SEER database, including 2,693 patients with stage IIIC1 and 1,583 patients with stage IIIC2. Multivariate analyses showed that independent prognostic factors for patients with stage IIIC1 included age, race, marital status, grade, histology, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Independent prognostic factors for patients with stage IIIC2 included age, marital status, grade, histology, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. The C-index of the AJCC staging system and the LN count-based staging system were 0.483 and 0.617, respectively. At least six LNs should be dissected to ensure the accuracy of the LN count-based staging system. Conclusion A modified AJCC staging system based on the count of metastatic LNs might be superior to the current AJCC staging system, which still had room for improvement and further refinements were required. For accurate staging, we recommended that at least six LNs should be examined in the modified AJCC staging system.","['Lymph Node', 'Endometrial Cancer', 'Overall Survival', 'Seer', 'Ajcc']","['Child Health', 'Health Care', 'Ethics Statement', 'Institutional Review', 'Review Board', 'Care Hospital', 'Ethics Office', 'National Institutes', 'SEER database', 'Health']",[],NaN

Herein, we report the efficacy of oral terbinafine and topical minoxidil in treating the associated nail abnormalities of YNS in a 66-year-old woman. The patient presented with yellow, brittle, slow-growing nails, which had developed progressively over the past 8 months; left ankle edema; a chronic, purulent, productive cough; and exertional dyspnea. Based on these symptoms, she was diagnosed with YNS. She failed to respond to treatment with fluconazole and vitamin E; however, she was successfully treated with oral terbinafine and topical minoxidil. The treatment was well tolerated, and we speculate that its mode of action includes promoting lymphatic formation and barrier enhancement, thereby improving the distal lymphedema, in addition to distal vasodilation that accelerates the nail growth. To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful treatment of YNS using these agents.","['Lymphedema', 'Case Report', 'Exertional Dyspnea', 'Productive Cough']","['Statement Institutional', 'Ethics Statement', 'Institutional approval', 'case details', 'Statement', 'Institutional', 'Ethics', 'details', 'approval', 'required']",[],NaN

Visual parameters including distance and near visual acuity (DVA and NVA), contrast sensitivity (CS), reading speed (RS), and different qualitative and quantitative optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters were evaluated pre- and 6 months post-treatment. Thirty-three naïve PCV eyes of 32 patients (mean age of 67.62 years) were evaluated pre- and post-treatment of intravitreal ranibizumab with and without photodynamic therapy. After treatment, sub retinal fluid decreased from 27 eyes (84.35%) at baseline to 7 eyes (21.88%) at 6 months while pigment epithelium detachment decreased from 32 eyes (100%) at base line to 15 eyes (46.87%) at 6 months. Mean pre-treatment quantitative morphological OCT retinal parameters including thickness and volume of central sub field, center thickness, center minimum, and maximum thickness reduced significantly. Similarly, all visual parameters including DVA, NVA, CS, and RS showed statistically significant improvement. While 89% of the eyes showed improvement in CS, 78%, 71%, and 65% of the eyes showed improvement in NVA, RS, and DVA, respectively.

Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between food insecurity status and GDM risk. About 35.6% of women experienced food insecurity, with 25.2% reported household food insecurity, 8.0% individual food insecurity, and 2.4% child hunger. Food insecure women were at significantly higher risk of developing GDM compared to food secure women (AOR = 16.65, 95% CI = 6.17-24.98). The significant association between food insecurity and GDM risk was influenced by pre-pregnancy BMI, parity and rate of GWG at second trimester. Food insecure women with parity ≥ 2 (AOR = 4.21, 95% CI = 1.98-8.92), overweight/obese BMI prior to pregnancy (AOR = 12.11, 95% CI = 6.09-24.10) and excessive rate of GWG in the second trimester (AOR = 9.66, 95% CI = 4.27-21.83) were significantly more likely to develop GDM compared to food secure women. Food insecurity showed strong association with GDM risk in that the association was influenced by maternal biological and physical characteristics. Multipronged interventions may be necessary for food insecure pregnant women who are not only at risk of overweight/obesity prior to pregnancy but also may have excessive gestational weight gain, in order to effectively reduce GDM risk.","['Pregnancy', 'Hemoglobin', 'Gestational Diabetes Mellitus', 'Hemoglobin Change']",[],[],NaN

However, few studies have explored prenatal risk factors assessed at pregnancy registration. This study aimed to identify prenatal risk factors for child maltreatment during the first three years of life using population-level survey data from pregnancy notification forms. This prospective cohort study targeted all mothers and their infants enrolled for a 3- to 4-month-old health check between October 2013 and February 2014 in five municipalities in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, and followed them until the child turned 3 years old. Administrative records of registration with Regional Councils for Children Requiring Care (RCCRC), which is suggestive of child maltreatment cases, were linked with survey data from pregnancy notification forms registered at municipalities ( n  = 893). Exact logistic regression was used for analysis. A total of 11 children (1.2%) were registered with RCCRC by 3 years of age. Unmarried marital status, history of artificial abortion, and smoking during pregnancy were significantly associated with child maltreatment. Prenatal risk scores calculated as the sum of these prenatal risk factors, ranging from 0 to 7, showed high predictive power (area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.805; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.660-0.950) at a cut-off score of 2 (sensitivity = 72.7%, specificity = 83.2%).

Methods Baseline data only were used in this analysis and came from an implementation science study conducted in Kenya from 2015 to 2017. The analytic sample was limited to 1116 women who are living with HIV, between 18 to 44 years old, and have ever experienced a pregnancy.

Unintended pregnancy, categorized as unintended if the last pregnancy was mistimed or unwanted, was the key independent variable. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association between unintended pregnancy and internalized stigma. Associations between internalized stigma and HIV-related discrimination and violence/abuse were also explored. Results About 48% agreed with at least one internalized stigma statement and 19% agreed with at least three. Over half of women reported that their last pregnancy was unintended (59%).

605,C:\Users\shweata\ethics_statement_2000_generic\PMC7968613\eupmc_result.json,PMC7968613,"Ethical Theories Ethical theories are attempts to find an answer to the question: what makes an action ethically better or worse than an alternative action? Prominent examples of ethical theories include consequentialism and deontology. (I shall return to virtue ethics later.) Both of these originated during the Enlightenment period (mainly in the 18th century). They aim to provide clear rules that allow us to determine the ethical quality of an action. Consequentialist theories focus on the  outcomes of the action for this evaluation. The various approaches to utilitarianism going back to Jeremy Bentham ( 1789) and John Stuart Mill ( 1861) are the most prominent examples. They are based on the idea that one can, at least in theory, add up the aggregate utility and disutility resulting from a particular course of action. The option with the highest net utility, i.e. utility minus disutility, is the ethically optimal one.  Deontology, on the other hand, is based on the principle that the basis of the ethical evaluation of an action is the duty of the agent executing it. The most prominent representative of this position is Immanuel Kant ( 1788,  1797), who formulated the so-called categorical imperative. The most often quoted formulation of the categorical imperative says “Act only on that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law” (translation, quoted in Bowie  1999: 14). This categorical imperative stops agents from rationalising exemptions for themselves. The interesting aspect of such a position for our purposes is that this view of ethics pays no immediate attention to the consequences of an action, but exclusively focuses on the motivation for undertaking it. It is important to underline, however, that deontology and utilitarianism are not the only ethical theories that can be applied to AI, and to technology more broadly. In addition to virtue ethics, to which I will return shortly, there are other general ethical approaches such as the feminist ethics of care (Gilligan  1990) and ethics based on various religions. Applying ethical theories to particular application areas has resulted in rich discourses of concepts such as computer ethics (Bynum and Rogerson  2003, Bynum  2008a, van den Hoven  2010), information ethics (Capurro  2006, Floridi  2006) and technology ethics (Brey  2011) that are relevant to AI. Entire libraries have been written about philosophical ethics, and I cannot hope to do justice to the many and rich nuances of ethical thinking. It may nevertheless be helpful to outline how ethics links to the human condition. This can explain some of the characteristics of ethics and it can shed light on whether or to what degree non-human artificial agents can be ethical subjects. A key to understanding ethics, I believe, is that humans recognise that we all, despite many and far-reaching differences, have much in common. We could call this state “the shared features of the human condition”. Human beings are fundamentally social. Without social structures and support we would not only die as infants, but also fail to develop the language and thus the conceptual understanding of the world around us that allow us to live our lives. We are possibly the only species that not only recognises that we exist but also knows that we are fundamentally vulnerable and mortal. We not only know this, but we feel it in profound ways, and we recognise that we share these feelings with other humans. The shared fate of certain death allows us to see the other as someone who, no matter how different from us they are, has some basic commonalities with us. We have empathy with others based on our experiences and the assumptions that they are like us. And just as we share the knowledge of death, we also share the experience of hope, of joy, of the ability to (more or less) freely develop projects and shape our world. This world is not just a physical world, but predominantly a social one, which is constructed using the unique capabilities of human language. Ethics is then a way to shape an important part of this social world in ways that take into account the shared aspects of human nature. This description of human nature and the human condition has direct implications for the concept of ethics and what can count as “being ethical”. Ethics does not exclusively reside in an action or an intention. Ethics is part of  being in the world, to use a Heideggerian term (Heidegger  1993). It is characterised by an agent’s ability not only to perceive different possible states of the world and decide between conceivable options, but to do so with a view to the meaning of such a decision for her own world and also for the world at large. This implies that the agent is consciously situated in this world, and understands it, but also has an emotional relationship to it and the fellow agents who co-constitute this world. Such an agent may very well make use of deontological or utilitarian ethical theories, but she does so in a reflective way as an agent who has a commitment to the world where these principles are applied. This brief introduction to my ethical position points to the idea of human flourishing, which will become vital in later parts of this book: human flourishing linked to  being in the world, understanding the limits of the human condition and the essential socialness of humans, which requires empathy. Of course, I realise that there are people who have no or little empathy, that abilities to interact socially and use language differ greatly, that many of these aspects apply to some degree also to some animals. Yet, to substantiate my position in AI ethics and the main ideas of this book, it is important that I do not draw inordinately on deontology and utilitarianism, but rather take into account a wider range of sources, and in particular virtue ethics. Ethical Principles of AI Framing AI ethics in terms of human flourishing can address both concerns. By offering an overarching ethical ambition it proposes a point of comparison that can help address value conflicts. It also aligns more closely to 21st-century research ethics, which has been moving away from Western principles to global values (Schroeder et al.  2019). And it furthermore offers a perspective that does not take for granted that all research and technology innovation is desirable per se, but clearly posits flourishing as the overarching goal. The main thesis of this book is that flourishing ethics can enlighten AI ethics and provide guidance in the development of practical interventions. The majority of currently existing guidelines were not drafted from one theoretical viewpoint but tend to use a set of ethical principles or values. What are these values? The most comprehensive review of AI ethics guidelines published so far (Jobin et al.  2019) lists the following ethical principles: transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility, privacy, beneficence, freedom and autonomy, trust, sustainability, dignity and solidarity. Each of these is comprised of components. Transparency, for example, refers to related concepts such as explainability, explicability, understandability, interpretability, communication and disclosure. The relationship between these concepts is not normally well defined and they can refer to different ethical positions. Elsewhere we have tried to clarify their normative implications (Ryan and Stahl  2020). Another example, the ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI proposed by the EUâ€™s High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence ( 2019), has a tiered level of principles. The expert group proposes a framework for trustworthy AI that consists of lawful AI (which they do not cover), ethical AI and robust AI. This framework is based on four ethical principles: respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, fairness and explicability. From these principles they deduce seven key requirements for the realisation of trustworthy AI, namely: human agency and oversighttechnical robustness and safety  privacy and data governance transparencydiversity, non-discrimination and fairness social and environmental wellbeingaccountability. From these they then develop assessment methods for trustworthy AI and policy recommendations. It is easy to see the attraction of this principle-based approach. It avoids making strong commitments to typically contested ethical theories. The principles themselves are generally uncontroversial, thereby offering the opportunity of a consensus. Maybe most importantly, the principle-based approach has been the basis of biomedical ethics, the field of ethics with the longest history of high-visibility public debate and need for societal and political intervention. Biomedical ethics in its modern form resulted from the Nazi atrocities committed during research on humans in concentration camps and the Nuremberg Code (Freyhofer  2004) that paved the way for the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association  2008). It was codified and operationalised through the Belmont Report (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research  1979), which established the principles of biomedical ethics that remain dominant in the field (Beauchamp and Childress  2009): autonomy, justice, beneficence and non-maleficence.  Biomedical ethics has been hugely influential and underpins discussion of the human rights of patients (Council of Europe  1997). One crucial aspect of biomedical ethics is that it has been implemented via the well-established process of research ethics, based on ethics review, conducted by institutional review boards or research ethics committees, overseen by regional or national boards and strongly sanctioned by research funders, publishers and others. There can be little doubt that this institutional strength of biomedical (research) ethics is a central factor guiding the AI ethics debate and leading to a principle-based approach that can be observed in most guidelines. This dominant position nevertheless has disadvantages. Biomedical ethics has been criticised from within the biomedical field as being overzealous and detrimental to research (Klitzman  2015). Empirical research on biomedical research ethics has shown inconsistency with regard to the application of principles (Stark  2011). And while largely uncontested in the biomedical domain, though not completely (Clouser and Gert  1990), the applicability of this approach to ethics in other domains, such as the social sciences, has been vehemently disputed (Schrag  2010). There are two aspects from this discussion worth picking up for AI ethics. Firstly, there is the question of the implicit assumptions of biomedical ethics and their applicability to AI. Biomedical ethics was developed primarily to protect the rights of patients and research participants. This is no doubt transferable to AI, where the individuals on the receiving end of AI systems are worthy of protection. But because biomedical research predominantly aims to understand diseases with a view to finding cures, biomedical ethics is much less concerned with the purpose of the research. It is usually taken for granted that biomedical research pursues an ethically commendable goal: that of contributing to human health and thus to human wellbeing. Ethical concerns therefore do not arise from this goal itself but only from ways of achieving it. In the case of technical research, including AI research, it is not at all obvious that this implicit premise of biomedical research is applicable. The assumption that the research itself and its intended consequences are ethically acceptable and desirable is in need of much more questioning and debate, casting doubt on whether the process-oriented and principle-based biomedical research ethics process is a suitable one to base AI ethics on. Secondly, biomedical principlism (Beauchamp and Childress  2009) leaves open the question of how to deal with conflicts between principles. This is a well-established problem for any ethical approach that is based on a set of non-hierarchical principles or values. In most cases it is possible to imagine situations where these come into conflict. Looking at the principles used in AI, it is, for example, easy to imagine a case where the principle of transparency would come into conflict with the principle of privacy. In order to successfully guide action or decision, the approach therefore needs to find ways of dealing with such conflicts. In addition, principlism has been criticised for being overly close to its US origins and not generalisable across the world (Schroeder et al.  2019).","Any discussion of the ethics of AI needs to be based on a sound understanding of the concept of ethics. This chapter therefore provides a brief overview of some of the key approaches to ethics with a particular emphasis on virtue ethics and the idea of human flourishing. The chapter reviews the purposes for which AI can be used, as these have a bearing on an ethical evaluation. Three main purposes are distinguished: AI for efficiency, optimisation and profit maximisation, AI for social control and AI for human flourishing. Given the focus on human flourishing in this book, several theoretical positions are introduced that provide insights into different aspects and ways of promoting human flourishing. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the currently widespread principle-based approach to AI ethics.","['Ethical Theory', 'Human Flourishing', 'Ethical Principles For Ai', 'Purposes Of Ai']","['ethics', 'biomedical ethics', 'Ethical', 'research ethics', 'biomedical', 'human', 'research', 'Ethical Theories', 'biomedical research', 'world']",[],NaN

On the first page of the questionnaire, the purpose of the study was explained, and participating students had to complete a consent form. We guaranteed both confidentiality and anonymity, and the students could contact the research group by email if they wanted."," Background There has been a rapid increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in Latin America, Africa, Asia and many countries that have an insufficient number of physicians and other health care personnel, and the need for the inclusion of medical students on health teams is a very important issue. It has been recommended that medical students work as volunteers, undergo appropriate training, not undertake any activity beyond their level of competence, and receive continuous supervision and adequate personal protective equipment. However, the motivation of medical students must be evaluated to make volunteering a more evidence-based initiative. The aim of our study was to evaluate the motivation of medical students to be part of health teams to aid in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and findings We developed a questionnaire specifically to evaluate medical students' perceptions about participating in the care of patients with suspected infection with coronavirus during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire had two parts: a) one part with questions on individual characteristics, year in medical school and geographic location of the medical school and b) a second part with twenty-eight statements assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (totally agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree and totally disagree). To develop the questionnaire, we performed consensus meetings with a group of faculty and medical students. The questionnaire was sent to student organizations of 257 medical schools in Brazil and answered by 10,433 students. We used multinomial logistic regression models to analyze the data. Statements associated with greater odds ratios for participation of medical students in the COVID-19 pandemic were related to a sense of purpose or duty (""It is the duty of the medical student to put himself or herself at the service of the population in the pandemic""), altruism (""I am willing to take risks by participating in practice in the context of the pandemic""), and perception of good performance and professional identity (""I will be a better health professional for having experienced the pandemic""). Males were more prone than females to believe that only interns should participate in the care of patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 1.36 [coefficient interval 95%:1.24-1.49]) and that all students should participate (OR 1.68 [CI:1.4-1.91]). Conclusions Medical students are more motivated by a sense of purpose or duty, altruism, perception of good performance and values of professionalism than by their interest in learning. These results have implications for the development of volunteering programs and the design of health force policies in the present pandemic and in future health emergencies.",[],"['Comissão Nacional', 'Ethics Committee', 'National Committee', 'São Paulo', 'Ética para', 'para Análise', 'STROBE guidelines', 'cross-sectional studies', 'Ethics', 'Comissão']",[],NaN

The objectives of the study and procedures were explained carefully to all study participants before inclusion into the study. The procedure for sputum sample collection for routine diagnosis of TB in Ghana was followed. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain standard demographic and epidemiologic data of patients. Two hundred and seventy (270) consented newly diagnosed smear-positive pulmonary TB patients agreed to be included in the study. Collected samples were stored at 4Â°C and transported within 4 days to Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) for laboratory analysis."," Context Available molecular epidemiological data from recent studies suggest significant genetic variation between the different lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and the MTBC lineages might have adapted to different human populations. Aim This study sought to determine the population structure of clinical MTBC isolates from the Volta Region of Ghana. Methods The MTBC isolates obtained from collected sputum samples were identified by PCR detecting of IS6110 and genotyped using spoligotyping. Non-tuberculous mycobacterial isolates were characterized by amplification of the heat shock protein 65 (hsp65) gene and sequencing. The drug susceptibility profiles of the MTBCs determined using GenoType MTBDRplus. Results One hundred and seventeen (117, 93.6%) out of 125 mycobacterial positive isolates were characterized as members of the MTBC of which M. tuberculosis sensu stricto (MTBss) and M. africanum (MAF) were respectively 94 (80.3%) and 23 (19.7%). In all, 39 distinct spoligotype patterns were obtained; 26 for MTBss and 13 for MAF lineages. Spoligotyping identified 89 (76%) Lineage 4, 16 (13.6%) Lineage 5, 7 (6.0%) Lineage 6, 3 (2.6%) Lineage 2, 1(0.9%) Lineage 3 and 1 (0.9%) Lineage 1.

612,C:\Users\shweata\ethics_statement_2000_generic\PMC7971352\eupmc_result.json,PMC7971352,"The care ethics theoretical framework More recently the centrality of relationships and the response to the individual and society in professionalism has been explored through the framework of care ethics [ 8]. Care ethics (alternatively ethics of care) is a theory that holds that  moral action centers on interpersonal relationships, specifically the response to the individual [ 9]. Originally developed by Carol Gilligan in the second half of the twentieth century, care ethics has been referenced in medical education but has been inconsistently applied [ 10]. In contrast to traditional bioethical debates, care ethics goes beyond fairness, focusing on the doctor-patient relationship and the desire to be receptive to and responsible for others—to be a caring person [ 8]. Care ethics acknowledges the importance of partiality and bonds between people. It emphasizes taking into account the relational context and reasoning, rather than morals or virtues in isolation. The core values include  universal condemnation of exploitation and the  universal commitment to human flourishing. While the first value resembles non-maleficence and the second beneficence, care ethics extends non-maleficence beyond these principles, calling for active interference when harm is witnessed. Beneficence may not limit the extent of our obligation, therefore care ethics limits the contribution to the promotion of good to prevent self-sacrifice. Others have also drawn attention to attending to the needs of those providing care and a need for “mature care” [ 10,  11]. Mature care resembles Aristotle’s “golden mean”, which is the desirable middle way between extremes [ 12]. It highlights the importance of balancing too little and too much care for self and others and contrasts with altruistic care, which equates care with self-sacrifice, self-denial, unidirectional and unconditional care [ 13]. Care ethics also acknowledges that relationships can engender care but can also be coercive, abusive or violent [ 13]. It alerts us to the potential of “structural violence”, which are injuries caused by the way society is organized [ 14]. In his work Norwegian sociologist Johan Galtung states that structural violence can be insidious, not apparent and often taking place when the dominant powers in place (corporations, institutions, health authorities, the medical profession itself) subject the less empowered to harmful circumstances. For instance, if a government deprives individuals of basic rights such as healthcare, it is guilty of structural violence. Care ethics envisions the moral agents as related, mutually dependent and unequal in power—as opposed to the conventional portrayal of the agent as independent, equal and self-sufficient [ 13]. The epistemology of care ethics includes reflecting on experiences and contextual differences.","In this article the authors review the current-day definition of professionalism through the lens of the two ongoing pandemics: COVID-19 and racism. The pandemics have led to contemporary practice-related questions, such as: does professionalism entail that health care providers (HCP) be compelled to treat patients without PPE or if patients refuse to wear masks? And what role do HCP play in society when confronted with glaring health disparities and police brutality? The authors propose using care ethics as a theory to view professionalism, as it takes into account broadly encompassing relationships between HCP and society, history and context. Professionalism viewed through a care ethics lens would require professionalism definitions to be expanded to allow for interventions, i.e., not just refrain from doing harm but actively interfere or take action if wrong is being witnessed. Principles related to the primacy of patient welfare need to be re-addressed to prevent systematic self-sacrifice which results in harm to HCP and burnout. Mature care should be a characteristic of professionalism ensuring that HCP care for the sick but be practically wise, highlighting the importance of balancing too little and too much care for self and others. Professionalism needs to be viewed as a bi-directional relational exchange, with society demonstrating solidarity with those providing care. Additionally, given the scale of health disparities, simply stating that HCP need to work towards social justice oversimplifies the problem. Professionalism needs to encompass incorporating critical action and critical pedagogy into health care training and the health care profession to demonstrate solidarity with those impacted by racism.","['Social Justice', 'Professionalism', 'Health Professionals', 'Health Care Ethics']","['care ethics', 'care', 'ethics', 'theoretical framework', 'ethics theoretical', 'framework', 'Carol Gilligan', 'mature care', 'relationships', 'response']",[],NaN

Since veteran trees are 'islands' of high biodiversity, they provide a unique system in which to study the relationship between biodiversity and decomposition of wood. We tested this relationship with a balanced experiential design, where we quantified the taxonomic and functional diversity of beetles directly involved in the process of decomposing wood, and measured the decomposition of experimentally added bundles of small diameter wood around 20 veteran trees and 20 nearby young trees in southern Norway. We found that the diversity (both taxonomic and functional) of wood-decomposing beetles was significantly higher around the veteran trees, and beetle communities around veteran trees consisted of species with a greater preference for larger diameter wood. We extracted few beetles from the experimentally added wood bundles, regardless of the tree type that they were placed near, but decomposition rates were significantly lower around veteran trees. We speculate that slower decomposition rates around veteran trees could have been a result of a greater diversity of competing fungi, which has been found to decrease decay rates. Veteran trees provide an ecological legacy within anthropogenic landscapes, enhance biodiversity and influence wood decomposition.

This study examines the individual agency of unmarried adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) who were organized into self-help groups (SHG) as compared to those who were not in groups. The paper uses data from a cross-sectional survey conducted with 872 unmarried AGYW aged 15-21 years from 80 villages across two districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. The dependent variables were AGYW's financial independence, collective action, decisionmaking, mobility, self-expression, generalized perceived self-efficacy, gender norms attitudes, and attitudes toward violence. The primary independent variables were group membership and the duration of the membership. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between group membership and various components of individual agency. More than half of the respondents, with an average age of 18 years were enrolled in school or college and one-third had 12 or more years of education. The group members, compared to non-members, were significantly more likely to be financially independent (odds ratio [OR] = 2.29, p<0.01), to take collective action for entitlements (OR = 3.80, p<0.01), and to have progressive attitudes toward gender roles and norms (OR = 1.43, p<0.05). A longer duration of group membership increases the likelihood of financial independence, collective action, and decisionmaking ability. The study highlights the need for further investment in adolescent girls' programming and highlights the potential of organizing AGYW into SHG and using the 'platform' to bring change in their lives and consequential individual agency.",[],"['Ethics statement', 'trained female', 'informed consent', 'study participants', 'research assistants', 'female research', 'Computer Assisted', 'Assisted Personal', 'Personal Interviewing', 'interview girls']",['is'],NaN

Permission for data access was obtained from measure demographic and health survey through an online request from  http://www.measuredhsprogram.com.," Background According to the 2017 estimate, around 214 million reproductive-age women in developing regions who want to avoid pregnancy do not use a modern contraceptive method. Although there are studies done on factors associated with modern contraceptive utilization in individual East African countries, as to our search of the literature, there is limited evidence on the pooled prevalence and determinants of modern contraceptive utilization in the East African region. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence and determinants of modern contraceptive utilization in the East African region. Methods The pooled prevalence of modern contraceptive utilization and the strength of determinants were estimated using STATA version 14. Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC), Median Odds Ratio (MOR), Proportional Change in Variance (PCV), and deviance were used for model fitness and comparison. The multilevel logistic regression model was fitted to identify determinants of modern contraceptive use in the region. Adjusted Odds Ratio with its 95% Confidence Interval was presented, and variables with a p-value ≤of 0.05 were declared significant determinants of modern contraceptive utilization. Results Overall, about 20.68% (95%CI:-20.46.,20.91)of women used modern contraceptive, ranging from 9.08% in Mozambique to 61.49% in Comoros. In the multilevel logistic regression model; maternal age group 25-34 (AOR: 0.79, 95%CI:0.76,0.82) and 35-49 (AOR:0.49, 95%CI:0.46,0.51). Being married (AOR:0.85, 95%CI:0.82,0.88), mothers with primary education (AOR:1.48, 95%CI:1.43,1.54) and secondary and above education level (AOR:1.60, 95%CI:1.52,1.69), husbands with primary education (AOR:2.43, 95%CI:2.35,2.51) and secondary and above education level (AOR:2.92, 95%CI:2.76,3.05). The mothers who had occupation (AOR:2.11, 95%CI:1.23,1.33), mothers from households with middle wealth index (AOR:1.23, 95%CI:1.19,1.28) and rich wealth index (AOR:1.28, 95%CI:1.23,1.33) were found to be significant determinants of modern contraceptive use. Conclusion We found that modern contraceptive utilization in the 12 East Africa countries was low compared to SDG target 2030(75%). The governmental and non-governmental organizations should scale up their public health programs to the poor and marginalized communities to scale up modern contraceptive utilization uptake in the region. In addition, reforming the health system and reproductive health education through mass media to create awareness of modern contraceptive use benefits are effective strategies to improve modern contraceptive use among East Africa women.",[],"['Ethics consideration', 'information removed', 'secondary analysis', 'identifying information', 'existing survey', 'Ethics', 'removed', 'survey', 'data', 'consideration']",[],NaN

However, there is no consensus on the definition for tumor free resection margin. Therefore, univariate OS as well as multivariate long-term survival using cancer center data was analyzed with regards to two different resection margin definitions. Ninety-five patients met inclusion criteria (pancreatic head PDAC, R0/R1, no 30 days mortality). OS was analyzed in univariate analysis with respect to R-status, CRM (circumferential resection margin; positive: ≤1mm; negative: >1mm), nodal status, and chemotherapy administration. Long-term survival >36 months was modelled using multivariate logistic regression instead of Cox regression because the distribution function of the dependent data violated the requirements for the application of this test. Significant differences in OS were found regarding the R status (Median OS and 95%CI for R0: 29.8 months, 22.3-37.4; R1: 15.9 months, 9.2-22.7; p = 0.005), nodal status (pN0 = 34.7, 10.4-59.0; pN1 = 17.1, 11.5-22.8; p = 0.003), and chemotherapy (with CTx: 26.7, 20.4-33.0; without CTx: 9.7, 5.2-14.1; p  70%). Chemotherapy, nodal status and resection margin according to UICC R status are univariate factors for OS after PDAC.

Design Q-methodology survey. Setting Convenience sample of healthcare providers and the general public were recruited at an acute care community hospital in Ontario, Canada. Participants In the first phase, 63 respondents provided 197 unique viewpoints in response to a topic statement about medical cannabis use in critically ill patients. Twenty-five viewpoints were selected for the q-sample. In the second phase, 99 respondents ranked these viewpoints according to an a priori quasi normal distribution ranging from +4 (most agree) to -4 (least agree). Factor analysis was combined with comments provided by survey respondents to label and describe the extracted factors. Results The factor labels were hoping and caring (factor 1), pragmatic progress (factor 2), and cautious/conservative and protectionist (factor 3). Factor 1 describes a viewpoint of unequivocal support for medical cannabis research in this population with few caveats. Factor 2 describes a viewpoint of cautious support with a need to monitor for unintended adverse effects. Factor 3 describes a viewpoint of ensuring that current analgosedation techniques are optimized before exposing patients to another potentially harmful drug. Conclusions Using a q-methodology design, we were able to sample and describe the viewpoints that exist about medical cannabis research in critically ill patients. Three factors emerged that seemed to adequately describe the relative ranking of q-statements by the majority of respondents. Combining the distinguishing statements along with respondent comments allowed us to determine that the majority support medical cannabis research in critically ill patients.",[],[],[],NaN

A code has value as both an internal guideline and an external statement of corporate values and commitments. A well-written code of conduct  clarifies an organization’s mission, values, and principles, linking them with standards of professional conduct. The code articulates the values that the organization wishes to foster in leaders and employees and, in doing so, defines desired behavior. As a result, written codes of conduct or ethics can become benchmarks against which individual and organizational performance can be measured (Ethics and Compliance Initiative  2020). The International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants is an independent standard-setting body that develops an internationally appropriate International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards). The Code requires professional accountants to comply with the fundamental principles of ethics. The Code also requires them to apply the conceptual framework to identify, evaluate, and address threats to compliance with the fundamental principles. Applying the conceptual framework requires exercising professional judgment, remaining alert for new information and to changes in facts and circumstances, and using the reasonable and informed third-party test (IESBA  2018). The new International Code of Ethics for professional accountants that were unveiled last month has been ‘long in making’ according to Kim Gibson, CPA, a member of the International Ethics Standards Board of Accountants (IESBA) and chair of the board’s Rollout and Implementation Working Group. Gibson has mentioned that new standards are designed to: be easier to use, navigate, and enforce.be more relevant for professional accountants in business.be distinguished more clearly between requirements and application material (Tysiac     2018).    In early April 2018, the IESBA released a completely rewritten and revamped Code of Ethics for professional accountants (PAs). Renamed “International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“the Code” or “the revised and restructured Code”), the Code will become effective in June 2019. It packages all substantive advancements in ethics and independence over the last four years into a single document and includes the new provisions relating to non-compliance with law and regulations (“NOCLAR”), which are already effective since July 2017, and the revised independence provisions relating to long association which comes into effect in December 2018. The fundamental principles within the Code—integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behavior—establish the standard of behavior expected of a professional accountant (PA), and it reflects the profession’s recognition of its public interest responsibility. Those fundamental principles as well as the categories of threats to them, self-review,self-interest,advocacy,familiarity,intimidation threats. are unchanged. Also, unchanged are the overarching requirements to apply the conceptual framework to comply with the fundamental principles and where applicable, be independent. In addition to the structural revisions made to the entire Code, the substantive revisions include: An enhanced conceptual framework, which includes extensive revisions to “safeguards” throughout the Code that are better aligned to threats;Strengthened independence provisions regarding the long association of personnel with audit clients;Strengthened provisions relating to offering and accepting of inducements, including gifts and hospitality that apply to both PAs in business (“PAIBs”) and PAs in public practice (“PAPPs”);Strengthened provisions dedicated to PAIBs, including:    A new section relating to pressure to breach the fundamental principles; andRevised provisions relating to the preparation and presentation of information.Clarifications about the applicability of PAIB provisions to PAPPs;New material to emphasis the importance of understanding facts and circumstances when exercising professional judgment; andNew material to explain how compliance with the fundamental principles supports the exercise of professional skepticism in an audit or other assurance engagements (Fig.     1.9).   ","Changing codes, tightening laws, more disclosures, more control, additional software programs, additional reports….These new legal and initiative requirements against fraud, unfortunately, didn’t stop it in the business world.

Accepted fraud triangle in management and business with the corners; Negative Pressure, Unethical Rationalization, Unsufficient Control-Auditing should be redesign again as Fraud Quadrangle with a new corner named “Moral Erosion”. It’s time to talk about “Behavioral Fraud”, which is new but trending research area in academia. Accountants and auditors usually don’t like to talk about something out numbers, standards, laws like “behavioral”. And it is also completely a different specialization. Accountants, auditors adhere to laws and standards that there are no emotions and initiatives in their world however they have been talking about interdisciplinary issues such as biological risk, climate change, artificial intelligence recently. “Behavioral Fraud” is a new area that needs to be focused on and discussed by researchers in the specialization of accounting, auditing, computer science, auditing law, human resources and statistics. Behavioral Fraud will also lead new discussions on a static and dynamic approaches to leveraging biometrics for fraud detection. New Fraud Quadrangle will help us why some people like and succeed to cheat while others don’t or can’t in the same conditions.","['Business Ethics', 'Behavioral Biometric Technology', 'Behavioral Fraud', 'Fraud Quadrangle']","['code', 'Ethical Codes', 'International Code', 'Professional Accountants', 'ethics', 'professional', 'International Ethics', 'fundamental principles', 'Accountants', 'Ethics Standards']",[],NaN

Sarcopenia has been reported as a risk factor for MetS, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and CVD. To date, the association between sarcopenia and MetS has been investigated. However, there have been few studies on the dose-response relationship between sarcopenia and MetS. We investigated the association between sarcopenia and the prevalence of MetS. We also aimed to analyze the dose-response relationship between skeletal muscle mass and the prevalence of MetS. Methods We enrolled 13,620 participants from October 2014 to December 2019. Skeletal muscle mass was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was divided by body weight (kg) and was expressed as a percentage (ASM x 100/Weight, ASM%). The quartiles of ASM% were calculated for each gender, with Q1 and Q4 being the lowest and highest quartiles of ASM%, respectively. The quartiles of ASM% were calculated for each gender, with Q1 and Q4 being the lowest and highest quartiles of ASM%, respectively. Linear regression and logistic regression analyses were used to compare the clinical parameters according to ASM%, adjusted for age, sex, obesity, hypertension (HT), DM, dyslipidemia (DL), smoking, alcohol intake, and C-reactive protein (CRP).

There were no robust indications of age- or gender-related differences in the prevalence. 11.4% of the children fulfilled criteria for more than one diagnosis. The most common comorbid conditions were ADHD and disruptive disorders. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders was relatively low among Norwegian 10-14-year-olds, compared to published worldwide prevalence estimates.

Many of the clinicians and researchers are not aware of ethical regularity and guidelines, then how to select the problems, what are the rules or framework presented in the ethical guidelines, confidentiality, legality and dignity, and autonomy. In this aspect, the present chapter aims to describe various salient features of ethical guidelines and also describes new advanced and revised framework formulated at international and national standards (Agich  2001; Grisso and Appelbaum  1995; Hippocrates  1780). The present section will benefit the clinicians, research beginners, policymakers, and drug manufacturers for their research work at institutional level. Principles of Ethics in Medical and Clinical Research Hippocrates was the first physician to define the ethical principles of research in human. The following principles still valid today (Fig.  12.1). Autonomy In the human being tradition, the view that individual autonomy is a basic moral, ethics and faith is very much a modern development. Putting moral weight on an individual’s ability to govern themself, independent of their place in a metaphysical order or role in social structures and status of living is very much the product of the modernist humanism of which much contemporary moral and medical philosophy is an offshoot. We should respect the autonomy of the participants or their representatives for drug trails, the research participants should be aware of the nature of research and probable consequences of the clinical experiments and then make an independent choice without the influence of the treating doctors, whether to take part in the research or not. When the research treats any community or group of persons as research participants, these principles of voluntariness and informed consent should apply to the community as a whole and also to each individual member who is the participant of the research or experimental group (novelty). All participants participated in drug trail should need to understand their consents and about treatment induction, duration, harmful effects, and overall legacy of the experimental research. Beneficiency Beneficeny is a concept in research ethics which states that researchers should have the welfare of the research participant as a goal of any clinical trial.In this regard researcher should maximize the economic and health benefits and minimize the harms, the clinical research always focuses on the objectives of human and animal interventions. The health benefits are very important for us to make use of our available resources from the green planet to maintain the overall well-being of individuals. The logic of beneficiency dealt with quality of life (QOL) during the study period. In this pragmatic approach, the research should always maximize the health benefits and reduce the risks, e.g., the people living with cancer, treating with new trial, the atomicity of the research should always focus on the health concern of the subjects and on the other hand minimizes the side effects of drug. It is required that the procedure will be provided with the intent of doing good for the patients involved. When the demands that create research, the heath-care providers will develop and maintain soft skills, knowledge of updating patients on virtual basis (training), etc. Consider individual circumstances of all patients, and strive for net benefits of patients and ended in welfare, many clinical researchers formulate new revised guidelines in accordance with international standards. All health-care providers must strive to improve their patient’s health, to do the most good for patient in every situation, what is good for one patient may not be good for another, so each should be considered individually. Nonmaleficence As per the legal perspective, non-maleficence is a practice in which physicians must refrain from providing ineffective treatments or acting with ill will toward patients. But since many beneficial therapies have serious risks, therefore, this principle, offers a little useful guidance to physicians.Doctors should attempt to avoid any act or research plan that would harm the patient or violate patients’ trust and human values and ethics during experimental trail. In modern health care and research, value conflicts arise where often there appears to be no clear consensus as to the right thing to do. These above cited conflicts makes many problems requiring moral decisions, and necessitate a choice between two or more alternatives, e.g., Should a parent have a right to refuse immunization for his or her child. Does we assess the public safety supersede an individual rights and another example, COVID 19 outbreak vaccination trail solely depends on human values and ethics, researcher should focus the health-care needs and maintain the dignity of individual patients, the patient does not right to refuse the testing of COVID19 because the requisite intervention comes under ethical perspective of the patients on public domain and safety of the human community at globe. The researcher should be concerned about the following points: First do no harms to the patient of COVID 19 from the excising treatment and social mobility. Maintain overall sanctity of life at all time. Be aware of the doctrine of double effect, where treatment or testing intended for good unintentionally causes any harm. Justice and Confidentiality The researcher should maintain the privacy of patient information, research plan, and the outcome of the research, equitable distribution of research risks and benefits. The justice is a complex ethical principle, with meaning that range from the fair treatment of individuals to the equitable allocation of health-care amounts and resources. It is concerned with equitable distribution of benefits to individuals in social institutions, and how the rights of various individuals are realized. Allocating scarce medical resources and also researcher or clinician should be able to justify the actions in every medical situation or follow-up visits of the patient. The general rights of ethics are presented in (Fig.  12.2). Some of the following ethical questions would be aroused from the public interest, the followings questions and intervention are kept in mind, and refer necessary guidelines for further follow-up actions, the decision can be taken place at right time with the consent of judicial law (Fig.  12.3). Should children with serious birth defects be kept alive?Should be allowed an abortion for any reason?Should terrorist be tortured to gain information possible saving hundreds of lives?    Should health-care workers be necessary to HCQ PEP drug for protection of COVID19Organ transplantation and stem cell therapy for COVID19? As per the practical insight, we describe the research ethics in a clinical prospective. The researcher should intervene to address the following key points before induction of research: To understand and anticipate the current health literacy landscape as it pertains to clinical research on broad perspective,To attempt to address the barrier for adoption of available resources and health literacy of the participants in the context of ethical perspective and strengthened the clinical research-related communications,To mitigate the opportunities for sponsors and funders, investigators, and their study teams, and institutional review board can integrate health literacy throughout the clinical trial life cycle from recruitment, and informed consent should be obtained from the participants,To establish electronic virtual-based data collections from the different study sites that are relevant to multiple stakeholder communities, including research intervention or subjects. The clinical and scientific standards for carrying out biomedical research on human subjects have been developed and established in International guidelines, including the following: Declaration of Helsinki,CIOMS: International ethical guidelines for Biomedical research involving human subjects, andWHO and ICH guidelines for good clinical practices. IEC Institutional Ethical Committee It is an independent body constituted for IEC, appointed medical, nonmedical, and nonscientific members whose responsibility is to ensure the protection of rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in the trails by, among other things, reviewing, approving, and providing continuum development of trail protocol and amendment issues on the basis of international standards. The structure of IEC constituted 8â€“12 members, specifically, the chairperson should be preferably outside the institution to maintain the independency of the committee.

The problem is the more advanced we get, the more our ethics are challenged, ethics is a type of a bug and had set of moral principles that pertain to a form of conduct, for example, suppose a person met with some kind of accident and the only way doctor can think to save him or her is some kind of experimental treatment, doctor wait for the patient to get to the hospital to give consent and also he flips a coin to see how they treat the patient and go-ahead and give the treatment they think is the best, as per the medical futility, a patient has the right to refuse to the treatment and the Physician can also refuse to provide treatment they consider medically futile. In this contrary, we think of treating the patients on ethical perspective and upheld the dignity and human values and rights at highest standard.

Robot-assisted training is effective in promoting upper extremity muscle strength and motor impairment recovery after stroke. Additionally, action observation treatment can enhance the effects of physical and occupational therapy by increasing neural activation. The AOT-EXO trial aims to investigate whether action observation treatment coupled with robot-assisted training could enhance motor circuit activation and improve upper extremity motor outcomes. Methods The AOT-EXO trial is a multicentre, prospective, three-group randomized controlled trial (RCT). We will screen and enrol 132 eligible patients in the trial implemented in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine of Tongji Hospital, Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital and Hubei Province Hospital of Integrated Chinese & Western Medicine in Wuhan, China. Prior to study participation, written informed consent will be obtained from eligible patients in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The enrolled stroke patients will be randomized to three groups: the CT group (conventional therapy); EXO group (exoskeleton therapy) and AOT-EXO group (action observation treatment-based exoskeleton therapy). The patients will undergo blinded assessments at baseline, post-intervention (after 4 weeks) and follow-up (after 12 weeks). The primary outcome will be the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE). Secondary outcomes will include the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), modified Barthel Index (MBI), kinematic metrics assessed by inertial measurement unit (IMU), resting motor threshold (rMT), motor evoked potentials (MEP), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and safety outcomes. Discussion This trial will provide evidence regarding the feasibility and efficacy of the action observation treatment-based exoskeleton (AOT-EXO) for post-stroke upper extremity rehabilitation and elucidate the potential underlying kinematic and neurological mechanisms.

Have the foundations of society changed in its technologies, available resources, environmental limitations, accumulated knowledge and experience, in such a way that these changes have led to the institutionalization of new behaviors, new emotions and ideas, and consequently, new forms of ethics and social practice? In this new institutionalization of society (North  2005) which can involve changes in the world concept and in one part of culture and social practices, can these new ideas and management strategies have a relevant weight and encourage change? Can they contribute to the policies which fight against inequality? We do not know to what extent ethical practices in business can help to change society but perhaps these visions of business can have major importance in the evolution of capitalism which are compatible—with major synergies—with the objectives to maximize profits and achieve the common good (Crane et al.  2014; Porter and Kramer  2006,  2011).  Maximize profit, yes, where this does not represent any inconvenience when the search for corporate social responsibility or commitment to society is part of the strategy’s central focus, and the company includes this proposal in the search for the best options. The paper by Crane et al. ( 2014) is comprehensive in relation to the idea which we just explained and in a parallel way in the scope of social entrepreneurship which leads to the same synthesis when the company seeks to earn profits at the same time. The articles by Auvinet and Lloret ( 2015) and Peris-Ortiz ( 2015) shed light on this issue. The purpose of production—the use of resources and human effort—is to meet unsatisfied individual and social needs or to meet new needs; as we move beyond the most basic needs, this issue is more difficult to view clearly; however, it continues to mark the necessary commitment of any economic system to society and the human species itself. When we talk about new forms of morality or behavior in business or new forms of reflection and ethical concepts in the management sector—although they are minorities—, in reality, we are talking about the connection between corporate actions and people’s needs in their most basic and different levels or in terms of greater sophistication. This is what has been clearly shown by Auvinet and Lloret ( Ibíd., 2015), in several of the examples which they provide in which entrepreneurship combines solving social problems and earning profits. The  need to solve the former provides the opportunity to obtain the latter, where both are the joint and indivisible purpose of strategy. The material circumstances, technologies, resources, available know-how in their different fields, and the capacity to understand the world have changed; however, in reference to the great ideas and dominant ideologies in the economy, this has not hindered that discourses have changed very little since the post-Keynesian monetarism (Friedman  1962) or even since the outset of the marginalist economy (Jevons  1871). The changes in the micro-micro dimension of the economy corresponding to the strategic decisions of the corporate managers, in this case, introducing ethics, still has not produced changes in economic thought comparable to those produced by the Berle and Means study in 1932. Perhaps because in the paper by Berle and Means, it was very evident that managers sought their own particular interest when acting beyond the control of shareholders, and this was a basic issue, easy to understand, while it still has not been understood—or it has only been understood in a minority way—that in the current material and cultural context, economic interest and ethics can converge, perhaps with a higher advantage than what is derived from their separation. The tendency toward an economy whose companies—or an increasingly relevant number of them—include strategies among their objectives that are aligned with social responsibility seems to be manifesting in numerous ways. This is confirmed by the Business Roundtable in its recent  Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation (19/08/1919), where it includes the necessary commitment to customers, employees, suppliers, the communities in which the corporation works, and shareholders; this is accordingly shown by the recommendations proposed by other organizations such as the Institute of Business Ethics (IBE) which proposes rules and benchmarking procedures which guarantee the creation of the ethical contents in relation to the stakeholders. Along this line, it is possible to view different academic papers of special interest which have been published in recent decades (Burke and Logsdon  1996; Burton and Mansell  2019; Carroll  1989,  1999; Crane et al.  2014; Donaldson and Dunfee  1994; Freeman et al.  2004; Hart  2005; McWilliams and Siegel  2001; Porter and Kramer  2006; Windsor  2006), all of them feature business ethics as the central focus of their research and they can be divided into two major aspects, both with the same interest (Donaldson and Dunfee  1994, 252â€“253): which investigates based on a legislative focus which is essentially founded on philosophy and which it supports to profoundly explore the matters related to ethics in corporations, in empirical techniques, and in the specific theoretical framework of management and market studies.","The aim of this chapter is to describe the basic theoretical aspects of ethical practices in business and to present the remaining 15 chapters which comprise this book. An essential feature of this chapter is how ethics arises from specific economic facts and on the other hand, how the evolution of society, new resources, new technologies, and economic growth in developed countries lead to a cultural evolution which changes the traditional perspective on the obtainment of profits, as reported by the Business Roundtable in their latest annual statement: not only the obtainment of profits for the shareholders but also the obtainment of economic, social, and ecological benefits for all the stakeholders.

On the one hand, it must be acknowledged that there are many applications currently available that have greatly benefited and had a significant impact on health, commerce, industry, culture, and so forth. On the other hand, the implications associated with a fast and, in many cases, blind adoption of these powerful technologies have not been studied or discussed with sufficient depth and critical analysis (Bossmann  2016; Kamm  2007; Latonero  2018; Nalini  2019). Based on our analysis of techno-social interactions and review of literature, reports and interviews with thought leaders in different areas of human endeavour, we identified a set of implications strongly related and circumscribed to education, regulation, and ethical and moral development. Addressing these three aspects is becoming crucial to accomplish a balanced and beneficial adoption of digitisation and to compensate for and mitigate the undesired effects of the current techno-centric environment. As part of the construction of our framework, we identified a set of implications strongly related to education, regulation, and ethical and moral development. We argue that comprehensive policies and strategies regarding these three fundamental elements may support the development of patterns in adopting digitisation for the benefit and socioeconomic advancement of society, both at local and national levels. We acknowledge that there are other implications that escape the scope of this first stage of our research; however, we suggest that our analysis might provide an initial platform for formal discussions and conversations on the balanced adoption of EDT by society. The implications we integrate into our proposed framework are cybersecurity and privacy, health, economic control of interconnected systems, human behaviour and social interaction, pace of innovation and technology, and work of the future/the future of work. Figure  12.1 shows the interplay of education, regulation, and ethical and moral development and select implications from a connectivity perspective. This list is not exhaustive and other implications could be included in our initial proposal; nevertheless, this list provides the groundwork for a more in-depth analysis. Similarly, the weights assigned to the techno-social interactions depicted in Fig.  12.1 do not describe a concrete case or project; it is just an essential graphical representation to highlight the levels of interaction involved. Figure  12.1 also stresses the importance of privacy and data protection, which is a concern of enormous impact and interest for governments and regulatory entities. The emergence of COVID-19 has led to a myriad of applications to monitor social distancing, which employ EDT to support efforts to control the pandemic. Though these applications provide valuable real-time information to control the spread of potential infections, there is legitimate public concern about privacy. In this respect, ethics and moral development are crucial to designing technologically advanced tools for protection and prevention before, during and after the pandemic (Aldama  2020; Griggs  2020; ITU  2020a,  b,  c,  d,  e; Lund et al.  2020). Ethics and Values in the Corporate Environment Building an independent entity to set up guidelines in the ethics surrounding corporate use of EDT is a long-term strategy, but one that can ultimately provide a much more sustained outcome. A one-sided approach may be contested when issues affect stakeholders that have not participated in setting the guidelines for EDT-related products or services. Since firms have not shown a clear intention of pushing forward with this agenda, it may ultimately fall to a government initiative or an NGO to establish, in the public interest, an agenda to build consensus. Examples in specific technologies like AI have proven that external entities have played a key role in setting up guidelines as an ethics framework. A good example can be found in the document ‘Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence’, developed by the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission. Even though the guidelines are not mandatory, a key outcome can be found in that they summarise this broad subject in three components: lawful, ethical and robust. One example of companies nurturing this kind of entity is the Partnership on AI, a consortium set up by companies in the sector to ‘develop and share best practices, advance the public understanding, provide an open and inclusive platform for discussion and engagement and identify and foster aspirational efforts in AI for socially beneficial purposes’. Still, there remain issues of interpretation in implementing day-to-day operations within those broad guidelines. Even though the products and services are not inherently good or bad, EDT technologies are often used for questionable purposes, including military use, big data that frequently do not respect privacy rights, and government surveillance, to mention but a few contemporary controversial uses. The discretionary use of these technologies then poses a question of regulation that falls outside the remit of such an entity. Nobody questions the necessity and pertinence of setting up these groups to provide guidance regarding the general behaviour expected of stakeholders, but this kind of organisation is not a substitute for a regulatory entity able to enforce specific regulations. Corporate compliance mechanisms must be put in place, both internal (corporate whistle-blowers, ethics committees and board supervision) and external (an ethics agency, government laws and industry regulations), and which in conjunction ensure proper outcomes from EDT (Acemoglu et al.  2007; European Commission  2019; Floridi  2018; Hall and Khan  2003; Parente and Prescott  1994). In recent decades, the corporate orthodoxy has been to maximise shareholder value, which is embedded in the concept of value-based management. In short, the strategies deployed to accomplish this goal pursue increased returns on capital or profitable growth, either by obtaining a larger market share or by cutting costs to a minimum, ideally without compromising the quality of products or services. This goal has shaped how companies run their operations and the intended or unintended consequences of actions taken to deliver higher dividends to shareholders (Lazonick and O’Sullivan  2010; Rappaport  1998; Young and O’Byrne  2001). Recently nearly two hundred of the top companies in America, including Apple, Pepsi, and Walmart, among many other well-known companies, issued a statement that redefined the purpose of a corporation to a more inclusive goal that further integrates customers, employees, suppliers and communities as a commitment to a broader spectrum of stakeholders (Anderson et al.  2004; Business Roundtable  2019; Grewal et al.  2010; Gruca and Rego  2005; Matzler et al.  2005). However, so far, it is uncertain how this declaration translates into specific actions and how each company is going to implement these mechanisms to provide value for their stakeholders. These actions are especially critical when companies develop their business around EDT, and ethical issues and social consequences are not fully discussed or foreseen before they are deployed (Freeman  1991; Sternberg  2000; White  2001). Public trust in EDT is a vital issue since the general public does not understand the technical complexities of associated products and services. Nevertheless, the consequences have a strong impact on users who fear losing control over EDT, with one frequently cited practice being the gathering of personal data without the userâ€™s consent. Providing sufficient information is a sine qua non-condition to ensure fairness of use and secure data privacy; further progress with AI therefore requires that consumers trust the technology and that they and their data will be treated fairly. Transparency facilitates such trust. Another condition is the predictability of the technology; consumers must be familiar with all the uses of the technology they are accessing. They must trust there are no hidden agendas to gather information without user consent (e.g. spyware) or use the hardware capacities of devices for undisclosed purposes. One excellent example of attempts to operationalise the supervision of EDT is the ethics board that Google set up as recently as 2019. The Advanced Technology External Advisory Council (ATEAC) aimed to examine the ethics around AI, machine learning and facial recognition. Unfortunately, disputes over the profiles of its board members shut the committee down only a week after its creation. Even though Google has internal  AI principles that guide its developments, an external entity like the ATEAC would add a second necessary layer to a critical area with consequences that reach far beyond Googleâ€™s facilities (Buchanan and Ess  2009; Zeng  2015). There is a strong record in implementing worldwide standards with external entities like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), to mention a few with broad influence across different sectors. The aforementioned entities are shaped by general business needs but are also nurtured by insights from the public interest, which ultimately reflect the zeitgeist of today (Murphy and Yates  2009; Roht-Arriaza  1995; Wirth  2009). Most successful processes have been nurtured by a variety of stakeholders that ultimately deliver a balanced output in terms of point of view, interests and desired outcomes. If this process is implemented by only one actor – in this case, the business sector – all other inputs are neglected, the process is biased in favour of business interests and, as argued above, maximizing shareholder value will be prioritised over other outcomes (Cragg  2002; Goodpaster  1991; Weiss  2014).","The purpose of this contribution is to develop an exploratory framework to analyse the ethical implications of the adoption of emerging digital technologies (EDT) by society. We posit that the exponential growth and dynamics of change of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data and the Internet of Things, among others, are of such magnitude and depth that many of the phenomena generated in the process of adopting these technologies have not been studied with sufficient breadth, scrutiny and critical analysis, particularly in the contexts of emerging economies. In order to develop the proposed framework, we draw on the principles of complex systems to analyse the interactions of relevant agents of the digital ecosystem under study. Our exploration identified a set of strongly related implications circumscribed to education, ethical and moral development, and regulation. It is suggested that the proposed framework may provide an initial platform for formal discussions and conversations towards understanding and applying EDT in a balanced and ethical manner.","['Technology Adoption', 'Digital Technologies', 'Digital Ethics', 'Policy And Regulatory Frameworks']","['EDT', 'Implications', 'ethics', 'moral development', 'easily discernible', 'technological change', 'Ethical', 'guidelines', 'provide', 'set']",[],NaN

This period belongs to the quarantine and lockdown stages in various countries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As it was mentioned in the introduction, the goal was to learn about the ethical principles that shall guide the relationship of the firm with its stakeholders during a time of crisis, uncertainty, threats, fear and opportunities to make positive changes and implement strategic innovations and transformations. The applied instrument was an online survey and the type of sampling was non-probability snowball. The participants were first students or graduates of the MBA program in the aforementioned countries and then business executives and managers were included to increase the sample in a short period. Given the type of sampling, the findings presented here find their strength in the qualitative and descriptive aspects. Participants The number of participants was 397, distributed as shown in Fig.  2.3. The instrument was answered by 200 persons of the female gender, 194 of the male gender and 3 persons of other genders (Fig.  2.4). In Spain and Colombia, the number of males who answered the survey was higher than the number of females. Figure  2.5 shows that most of the people who answered the survey had postgraduate (210) or university education (164). Fig.  2.6 shows that 47.85% (190) of the participants occupied executive or strategic positions, and 30.22% (120) occupied mid-tier or supervisory positions. Of the sample obtained, there were fewer women in executive or strategic positions, which is consistent with the reality of Ibero-American countries. Specifically, there were 108 men as opposed to 81 women in the top positions, amongst the survey respondents. Perception of the Participants The survey included some questions that were formulated using the Likert scale to capture the perception of the participants by asking them to provide an answer from 1 to 6 according to their degree of agreement (1. Strongly disagree; 2. Moderately disagree; 3. Lightly disagree; 4. Lightly agree; 5. Moderately agree; 6. Strongly agree) with some statements regarding the firm. Statement 1. The firm IS a moral agent because it is an actor that makes conscious, voluntary and free decisions.Statement 2. The firm IS NOT a moral agent because it is an actor that acts compulsorily. In Fig.  2.7, it seemed that the majority of participants (280 or 70.52%) moderately or strongly agreed with statement 1. In the same way, Fig.  2.8 shows that 288 participants moderately or strongly agree with statement 2 (72.54%). Figure  2.9 shows the correlation between the answers for statement 1 and 2, and the colour of the circles represents the gender of the majority of the respondents for said category. For the combination statement 1–6 and statement 2–1, the number of people who identify as female was 65 and 62 males and for the combination statement 1–6 and statement 2–2, the respondents were 20 and 12, respectively. By calculating the Spearman correlation between the answers to statements 1 and 2, the value obtained is −0.474. Although it shows an inverse relationship, the answers do not show evidence of significant correlation. Application of Text Mining For this section, the different perceptions of the executives , the mid-tier personnel and the operative personnel will be compared. The questions analysed are: Explain in your own words, why would you consider, or not, that the firm is a moral agent?What actions from a firm would you consider that could support your previous answer? Figure  2.10 shows the word cloud of the answers of each of the participant groups. We identified that although the frequency was not the same, there were coincidences amongst the most used terms, such as firm (empresa), moral, agent (agente) and people (personas) (Table  2.1). Figure  2.11 shows the 33 values identified as guides of the firm–stakeholder relationship. According to Table  2.2, the words chosen by more than 100 participants were: Trust (Confianza), Truth (Verdad), Common good (Bien común), Coherence (Coherencia), Dialogue (Diálogo), Justice (Justicia) and Loyalty (Lealtad). The most frequent combinations were: Truth, Justice and Common good (21 respondents), Common good, Coherence, and Trust (20 respondents), Truth, Trust and Loyalty (20 respondents), Justice, Common good and Trust (19 respondents), Truth, Common good and Trust (19 respondents), and Truth, Dialogue and Trust (20 respondents). When considering the phrases that get repeated the most by combining the three discourses, we find: ‘economic and social development of’‘he wellbeing of its employees’‘its internal and external customers’‘the wellbeing of people’‘responsible for its own actions’‘the consequences of its actions’ This means that the majority of them are associated with wellbeing, economic and social development and the responsibility for oneâ€™s actions, with special attention to consequences. Regarding the main indicators of readability of the answers given by the participants, two main aspects should be pointed out: in the first place, the language used requires secondary-level education to read properly, but a university-level education to understand it correctly. Secondly, this is a fairly technical topic, as is the language used, especially in terms of the instrument, but the vocabulary used by the participants was of medium complexity. In the face of the question, what would you consider could be the effects of COVID-19 in corporate ethics? The most frequent topics were associated with the commitment of firms with the health of their employees; the need to redefine business dynamics; adapting to change; an increase of equality awareness; analysis of environmental effects.","Progress has been made in the last years concerning the awareness that firms have inescapable ethical obligations with society, especially with their stakeholders. The crisis brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced the need to reconsider the paradigms on which the business world has been built. In this context, the requirements of social responsibility are an acknowledgement, both explicit and implicit, of the belief that firms are a moral agent with not only legal but also ethical responsibilities. This chapter seeks to contribute to an ancient, yet current philosophical debate by answering a fundamental question: What are the reasons that allow us to affirm that firms are moral agents? Moreover, as a result of this ethical awareness, the action principles that shall guide the firm in its relationship with stakeholders are presented. The conceptual reflection is complemented by fieldwork in six Ibero-American countries with the participation of 397 people from executive, mid-tier and operational levels.","['stakeholders', 'Corporate Social Responsibility', 'Text Mining', 'Business Ethics', 'Moral Agent']","['participants', 'Common good', 'firm', 'Ethical Principles', 'respondents', 'Statement', 'Trust', 'Fig.', 'shows', 'fieldwork carried']","['of', 'of', 'of', 'of']",NaN

Reaching herd immunity status likely necessitates that children, as well as their parents, receive a vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2. In this exploratory study, we investigated the demographic, experiential, and psychological factors associated with the anticipated likelihood and speed of having children receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a sample of 455 Canadian families (858 children; parents' mean age = 38.2 ± 6.82 years). Using linear mixed-effects and proportional odds logistic regression models, we demonstrated that older parental age, living in the Prairies (relative to Central Canada), more complete child vaccination history, and a greater tendency to prioritise the risks of the disease relative to the risks of side effects (i.e. lower omission bias) were associated with higher likelihoods of intention to vaccinate participants' children, with trend-level associations with lower perceived danger of the vaccine and higher psychological avoidance of the pandemic. Faster speed of intended vaccination was predicted by a similar constellation of variables with an additional predictor of a child in the family having a COVID-19 related health risk being associated with slower intended speed.

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.," Background Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) results in a tremendous disease burden worldwide. Available research on active surveillance among hospitalized adult patients suffering from SARI in China is limited. This pilot study aimed to identify associated etiologies and describe the demographic, epidemiological and clinical profiles of hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years in Jinshan, Shanghai. Methods Active surveillance was conducted at 1 sentinel hospital in Jinshan district, Shanghai, from April 2017 to March 2018. Hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old were enrolled, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected within 24 hours of admission and tested for multiple respiratory viruses (including 18 common viruses) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical information was obtained from case report forms. Results In total, 397 SARI patients were enrolled; the median age was 68 years, and 194 (48.9%) patients were male. A total of 278 (70.0%) patients had at least one underlying chronic medical condition. The most frequent symptoms were cough (99.2%) and sputum production (88.4%). The median duration of hospitalization was 10 days. A total of 250 infection patients (63.0%) were positive for at least one pathogen, of whom 198 (49.9%) were positive for a single pathogen and 52 (13.1%) were positive for multiple pathogens. The pathogens identified most frequently were M. pneumoniae (23.9%, 95/397), followed by adenovirus (AdV) (11.6%, 46/397), influenza virus A/H3N2 (Flu A/H3N2) (11.1%, 44/397), human rhinovirus (HRhV) (8.1%, 32/397), influenza virus B/Yamagata (Flu B/Yamagata) (6.3%, 25/397), pandemic influenza virus A/H1N1 (Flu A/pH1N1) (4.0%, 16/397), parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1 (2.0%, 8/397), human coronavirus (HCoV) type NL63 (2.0%, 8/397), HCoV 229E (1.5%, 6/397), HCoV HKU1 (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 3 (1.5%, 6/397), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 4 (1.3%, 5/397), HCoV OC43 (1.0%, 4/397), influenza virus B/Victoria (Flu B/Victoria) (0.5%, 2/397), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type B (0.5%, 2/397), and human bocavirus (HBoV) (0.3%, 1/397). The seasonality of pathogen-confirmed SARI patients had a bimodal distribution, with the first peak in the summer and the second peak in the winter. Statistically significant differences were observed with respect to the rates of dyspnea, radiographically diagnosed pneumonia and the presence of at least one comorbidity in patients who were infected with only M. pneumoniae, AdV, HRhV, Flu A/H3N2, Flu A /pH1N1 or Flu B/Yamagata. The differences in the positivity rates of the above 6 pathogens among the different age groups were nonsignificant. Conclusions M. pneumoniae, AdV and Flu A/H3N2 were the main pathogens detected in hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old in Jinshan district, Shanghai.

An optimal evaluation depends on adequate bowel cleansing. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), require frequent endoscopic assessment for both activity and dysplasia assessment. Two commonly used bowel preparations in Australia are Prep Kit-C (Pc) and Moviprep (Mp). Little is known about tolerability, efficacy and safety of split protocols of Mp and Pc in both IBD and non-IBD patients. Aim To primary aim was to compare the tolerability, efficacy and safety of split protocols of Mp and Pc in patients having a colonoscopy. The secondary aim was to compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety of either preparation in patients with or without IBD. Methods Patients were randomized to Pc or Mp bowel preparation. Patients completed a questionnaire to assess tolerability. Efficacy was assessed using the Ottawa Bowel Preparation Score. Serum electrolytes and renal function were collected one week prior to colonoscopy and on the day of colonoscopy. Results Of 338 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of 168 patients randomized to Mp and 170 to Pc. The efficacy of bowel preparation (mean Ottawa Bowel Preparation Score) was similar between Mp (5.4 ± 2.4) and Pc (5.1 ± 2.1) ( P  = 0.3). Mean tolerability scores were similar in Mp (11.84 ± 5.4) and Pc (10.99 ± 5.2;  P  = 0.17). 125 patients had IBD (73 had Crohn's Disease and 52 had Ulcerative colitis). Sixty-four IBD patients were allocated to Mp and 61 to Pc. In non-IBD patients, 104 were allocated to Mp and 109 to Pc. The mean tolerability score in the IBD group was lower than the non-IBD group (mean tolerability scores: IBD: 10.3 ± 5.1 and non-IBD: 12.0 ± 5.3;  P  = 0.01). IBD patients described more abdominal pain with Mp when compared with Pc; (Mp: 5.7 ± 4.4  vs  Pc: 3.6 ± 2.6,  P  = 0.046).

It adopted a prospective study design of following up neonates for the first 24 hours of admission to the MTRH newborn unit. Thermometry, interview of mothers and observation of thermal care practices was done. Descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were adopted. Specifically, Pearson's chi-square test of associations between predictors of neonatal hypothermia and management outcomes was conducted with their corresponding risk estimates at 95% confidence interval. Among the 372 participants, 64.5% (n = 240) were born at MTRH, 47.6% (177) were preterm and 53.2% (198) had birth weights below 2500 grams.

The UK Difficult Airway Society [DAS] has directed all Anaesthetists to be trained with surgical cricothyroidotomy [SCT] as the primary emergency FONA method, sometimes referred to as 'Cric' as a shorthand. We present a longitudinal analysis using a classical approach to Grounded Theory methodology of ten Specialist Trainee Anaesthetists' data during a 6-month training programme delivered jointly by Anaesthetists and Surgeons. We identified with a critical realist ontology and an objectivist epistemology meaning data interpretation was driven by participants' narratives and accepted as true accounts of their experience. Our theory comprises three themes: 'Identity as an Anaesthetist'; 'The Role of a Temporary Surgeon'; and 'Training to Reconcile Identities', whereby training facilitated the psychological transition from a 'bloodless Doctor' (Anaesthetist) to becoming a 'temporary Surgeon'. The training programme enabled Specialist Trainees to move between the role of control and responsibility (Identity as an Anaesthetist), through self-described 'failure' and into a role of uncertainty about one's own confidence and competence (The Role of a Temporary Surgeon), and then return to the Anaesthetist's role once the airway had been established.

Because intramucosal poorly cohesive carcinomas in this setting are typically not grossly visible, many pathologists assess the entire gastrectomy specimen microscopically. With 150 or more slides per case, this is a major time burden for pathologists. This study utilizes deep learning methods to analyze digitized slides and detect regions of carcinoma. Methods Prophylactic gastrectomy specimens from seven patients with germline CDH1 mutations were analyzed (five for training/validation and two for testing, with a total of 133 tumor foci). All hematoxylin and eosin slides containing cancer foci were digitally scanned, and patches of size 256×256 pixels were randomly extracted from regions of cancer as well as from regions of normal background tissue, resulting in 15,851 images for training/validation and 970 images for testing. A model with DenseNet-169 architecture was trained for 150 epochs, then evaluated on images from the test set. External validation was conducted on 814 images scanned at an outside institution. Results On individual patches, the trained model achieved a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9986. This enabled it to maintain a sensitivity of 90% with a false-positive rate of less than 0.1%. On the external validation dataset, the model achieved a similar ROC AUC of 0.9984. On whole slide images, the network detected 100% of tumor foci and correctly eliminated an average of 99.9% of the non-cancer slide area from consideration.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the attitudes of emergency doctors in providing palliative and EOL care in Hong Kong, and to investigate the educational needs of emergency doctors in these areas. Methods A questionnaire was used to study the attitudes of ED doctors of six different hospitals in Hong Kong. The questionnaire recorded the attitudes of the doctors towards the role of palliative and EOL care in EDs, the specific obstacles faced, their comfort level and further educational needs in providing such care. The attitudes of emergency doctors of EDs with EOL care services were compared with those of EDs without such services. Results In total, 145 emergency doctors completed the questionnaire, of which 60 respondents were from EDs with EOL care services. A significant number of participants recognized that the management of the dying process was essential in ED. Providing palliative and EOL care is also accepted as an important competence and responsibility, but the role and priority of palliative and EOL care in ED are uncertain. Lack of time and access to palliative care specialists/ teams were the major barriers. Doctors from EDs with EOL care services are more comfortable in providing such care and discuss it with patients and their relatives. Further educational needs were identified, including the management of physical complaints, communication skills, and EOL care ethics. Conclusions The study identified obstacles in promoting palliative and EOL care in the EDs Hong Kong. With the combination of elements of routine ED practice and a basic palliative medicine skill set, it would promote the development of palliative and EOL care in Emergency Medicine in the future.","['Palliative care', 'End-of-life Care', 'Dying', 'Educational Needs', 'Accident And Emergency Department']",[],[],NaN

This study aimed to clarify the prevalence of FT and its relationship with static postural stability in children. Of the 400 children aged 8 years who participated in our cohort study, 396, who were examined for static postural stability, were included in this study.

Despite heated debates and protests playing out in the public domain, there is scant empirical research to document Australian attitudes to the Melbourne Cup, or horse racing more generally. Specifically, little is known about how support for or against the Melbourne Cup correlate with age, gender, income and level of education. To provide a more nuanced understanding of attitudes towards the cup beyond the rudimentary binaries of those who are 'for' or 'against' gambling and horse racing, the purpose of the study was to identify clusters of people with particular views. An opportunistic survey collected data on respondents' gender, age, place of residence, weekly income, employment status and highest level of education, and sought their level of agreement with six statements about the Melbourne Cup, gambling and animal cruelty. Ordinal logistic regression and Chi-square analysis were used to evaluate the age and gender of respondents in clusters respectively. Agreement with the statements revealed some significant associations. Male respondents were at greater odds for agreement with the statement: I regularly bet on horse races (OR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.78-3.22) as were respondents aged 18-19 years (OR = 2.88; 95% CI = 1.13-7.35) and 20-24 years (OR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.00-3.62) compared with the median 35-40 years age bracket.

The odds of increasing agreement with the statement: I have never been interested in the Melbourne Cup were multiplied by 0.87 (95% CI = 0.82-0.92) with each successive five-year age bracket. The most useful of the predictor variables for agreement was level of education. The odds of increasing with the statement: I have become less interested in the Melbourne Cup over recent years because of my concerns with gambling were multiplied by 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02-1.15) for each increased level of education.

However, commonly used cost estimates are not sensitive to changes in weight across the entire body mass index (BMI) distribution as they are often based on discrete BMI categories. Methods We estimated continuous BMI-related health care expenditures using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 2011-2016 for 175,726 respondents. We adjusted BMI for self-report bias using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2016, and controlled for potential confounding between BMI and medical expenditures using a two-part model. Costs are reported in $US 2019. Results We found a J-shaped curve of medical expenditures by BMI, with higher costs for females and the lowest expenditures occurring at a BMI of 20.5 for adult females and 23.5 for adult males. Over 30 units of BMI, each one-unit BMI increase was associated with an additional cost of $253 (95% CI $167-$347) per person. Among adults, obesity was associated with $1,861 (95% CI $1,656-$2,053) excess annual medical costs per person, accounting for $172.74 billion (95% CI $153.70-$190.61) of annual expenditures. Severe obesity was associated with excess costs of $3,097 (95% CI $2,777-$3,413) per adult.

In attempting to define the correlates associated with natural protection against HIV, extreme heterogeneity in the datasets generated from systems methodologies can be further complicated by the inherent variability encountered at the population, individual, cellular and molecular levels. Furthermore, such studies have been limited by the paucity of well-characterised samples and linked epidemiological data, including duration of infection and clinical outcomes. To address this, we selected 10 volunteers who rapidly and persistently controlled HIV, and 10 volunteers each, from two control groups who failed to control (based on set point viral loads) from an acute and early HIV prospective cohort from East and Southern Africa. A propensity score matching approach was applied to control for the influence of five factors (age, risk group, virus subtype, gender, and country) known to influence disease progression on causal observations. Fifty-two plasma proteins were assessed at two timepoints in the 1st year of infection. We independently confirmed factors known to influence disease progression such as the B * 57 HLA Class I allele, and infecting virus Subtype. We demonstrated associations between circulating levels of MIP-1α and IL-17C, and the ability to control infection. IL-17C has not been described previously within the context of HIV control, making it an interesting target for future studies to understand HIV infection and transmission. An in-depth systems analysis is now underway to fully characterise host, viral and immunological factors contributing to control.","['HIV-1', 'Elite Controllers', 'Viral Control', 'Immunology & Infectious Diseases', 'Infection–immunology']","['Ethics Committee', 'Research Ethics', 'Review Committee', 'ethical review', 'Research Institute', 'Committee', 'Ethics', 'Ethics Statement', 'National Ethics', 'Science Research']",[],NaN

This study examined the readiness of  Annals of Dermatology  to be deposited in PMC again by analyzing the 13 issues published from October 2018 to August 2020. The journal's scientific quality and ethical standards were assessed, and adherence to these standards was documented. In total, 259 articles were analyzed for ethical standards, including institutional review board (IRB) approval, an informed consent statement, and disclosure of conflicts of interest. Scientific quality was also checked for each article. Of the 129 original articles or brief reports presenting research on human subjects or human-derived materials, 111 studies received IRB approval and/or obtained informed consent. The other seven studies were data analyses or studies of purchased cultured cells. One study that used a post-circumcision foreskin sample contained no statement describing permission from the patient's family, but the researchers were found to have obtained informed consent. In all 152 case presentations, the authors obtained informed consent. All seven animal experiments received Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval. One review article did not disclose conflicts of interest, but this was an editorial error. Two systematic reviews adopted the PRISMA guidelines. In conclusion, the present publication policies, scientific quality, and ethical standards of the journal are top-tier internationally.

Similarly, in order to measure prevalence across the entire hospital it is important to include inpatients admitted to the mental health wards. The inclusion of participants with cognitive impairment and mental illness requires particular consideration of the consent procedures and risk of distress for these patients as per the Australian National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007). Patients in the mental health wards of the study hospital are all admitted voluntarily and can provide informed consent. Any refusal to participate will be respected. Where cognitive impairment means a patient is unable to provide informed consent, consent will be sought from the patientâ€™s legal guardian or next-of-kin. If at any point a patient exhibits signs of distress, the assessment will cease, and nursing assistance will be sought. This study has ethical approval from both the Ramsay Health Care Human Research Ethics Committee for Western Australia and South Australia (reference number: 2038) and the Edith Cowan University Human Research Ethics Committee (reference: 2020â€“02008-SAUNDERS). Results of this study will be disseminated at a number of levels. A report of the study findings will be provided to the study hospital and may be used to review its procedures and to guide a larger prevalence study across all hospitals run by the operator in Australia.

Frailty and pain can interact, such that symptoms of frailty can make pain assessment difficult and pain can exacerbate the progression of frailty. The prevalence of frailty and pain and their concurrence in hospital settings are not well understood, and patients with cognitive impairment are often excluded from pain prevalence studies due to difficulties assessing their pain. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of frailty and pain in adult inpatients, including those with cognitive impairment, in an acute care private metropolitan hospital in Western Australia. Methods and analysis A prospective, observational, single-day point prevalence, cross-sectional study of frailty and pain intensity of all inpatients (excluding day surgery and critical care units) will be undertaken. Frailty will be assessed using the modified Reported Edmonton Frail Scale. Current pain intensity will be assessed using the PainChek smart-device application enabling pain assessment in people unable to report pain due to cognitive impairment. Participants will also provide a numerical rating of the intensity of current pain and the worst pain experienced in the previous 24 hours. Demographic and clinical information will be collected from patient files. The overall response rate of the survey will be reported, as well as the percentage prevalence of frailty and of pain in the sample (separately for PainChek scores and numerical ratings). Additional statistical modelling will be conducted comparing frailty scores with pain scores, adjusting for covariates including age, gender, ward type and reason for admission. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by Ramsay Health Care Human Research Ethics Committee WA/SA (reference: 2038) and Edith Cowan University Human Research Ethics Committee (reference: 2020-02008-SAUNDERS).

Methods All patients with double-headed pterygia who underwent pterygia excision with conjunctival autograft from January 2012 to January 2019 in the National University Hospital of Singapore were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on whether fibrin glue or sutures were used to secure the conjunctival autograft in place. All patients had a minimum of 6 months follow-up. Results A total (26 patients) of 22 eyes had fibrin glue, while eight eyes underwent suture closure of their conjunctival autograft. Fibrin glue group had 4.5% recurrence rate, while suture group had 37.5% recurrence rate ( p  = .021). There is statistically significant improvement for overall visual acuity ( p  = .009) and cylinder ( p  = .002).

GPs are in an advantageous position to contribute to preventing obesity by diagnosing patients and initiating treatment. Sporadic studies have shown that attitudes towards obesity management in primary care can have a major influence on treating patients successfully. Objectives The study focuses on attitudes and behavioural patterns towards obesity patients, willingness to provide care, approaches and strategies, and the challenges experienced. Methods After developing the interview guides based on a literature review, 36 GPs in North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland, Germany, were interviewed between November 2019 and March 2020. Using qualitative typing according to Kluge, different prototypes of GPs were formed. The dimensions of the interview guides were used for deriving the prototypes. Results GPs were categorised into four types depending on how they saw themselves and their role in treating patients. The first type (the resigned) was conspicuous through its negative attitude towards obesity management and a lack of willingness to provide care. The second type (the instructors) emphasised the value of active exercise, diet and health promotion, while the third type (the motivators) saw psychosocial support and motivation as a key element in helping patients. In contrast, type four (the educators) focussed primarily on early prevention through patient education. Conclusion Depending on which (proto-)type a patient visits, different focuses and strategies are pursued for obesity management and doctor-patient communication. This results in different perspectives and chances of success about therapeutic measures.","['Obesity', 'Treatment', 'Overweight', 'Primary Care', 'General Practitioner']","['tests performed', 'sensitive patient', 'patient data', 'clinical tests', 'Ethics Commission', 'study', 'Ethics', 'performed', 'expert interviews', 'strictly anonymised']",[],NaN

In the own-flock ranking experiment, a total of 147 households, out of which 46 were Arab and 101 were Oromo goat keepers that live in semi-arid and sub-humid agroecologies respectively, were visited at their homesteads and were asked to choose their first best, second best, third best and the most inferior does from their own flock. The reasons of ranking and life history of the does (age, previous production and reproduction information) were inquired and recorded; live body weight and some linear body measurements were taken. In the group-animal ranking experiment, 12 breeding does and 12 breeding bucks from Arab goats and the same number of animals from Oromo goats were randomly selected. Life history of selected does and bucks (age, birth type, libido and temperament) were inquired from the owners. The selected animals were randomly grouped into four in Arab goats (three animals per group) and the same was applied in Oromo goats. Twelve farmers for Arab goats and the same number of farmers for Oromo goats who have not known the experimental animals were invited to do the ranking.

Given this exemption, informed consent was not required to access patient records used in the study, which were not anonymized before they were accessed (only by approved project personnel)."," Background Health systems are undergoing widespread adoption of the collaborative chronic care model (CCM). Care structured around the CCM may reduce costly psychiatric hospitalizations. Little is known, however, about the time course or heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) for CCM on psychiatric hospitalization. Rationale Assessment of CCM implementation support on psychiatric hospitalization might be more efficient if the timing were informed by an expected time course. Further, understanding HTE could help determine who should be referred for intervention. Objectives (i) Estimate the trajectory of CCM effect on psychiatric hospitalization rates. (ii) Explore HTE for CCM across demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods Data from a stepped wedge CCM implementation trial were reanalyzed using 5 570 patients in CCM treatment and 46 443 patients receiving usual care. Time-to-event data was constructed from routine medical records. Effect trajectory of CCM on psychiatric hospitalization was simulated from an extended Cox model over one year of implementation support. Covariate risk contributions were estimated from subset stratified Cox models without using simulation. Ratios of hazard ratios (RHR) allowed comparison by trial arm for HTE analysis, also without simulation. No standard Cox proportional hazards models were used for either estimating the time-course or heterogeneity of treatment effect. Results The effect of CCM implementation support increased most rapidly immediately after implementation start and grew more gradually throughout the rest of the study. On the final study day, psychiatric hospitalization rates in the treatment arm were 17% to 49% times lower than controls, with adjustment for all model covariates (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.51-0.83). Our analysis of HTE favored usual care for those with a history of prior psychiatric hospitalization (RHR 4.92; 95% CI 3.15-7.7) but favored CCM for those with depression (RHR 0.61; 95% CI: 0.41-0.91). Having a single medical diagnosis, compared to having none, favored CCM (RHR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31-0.86). Conclusion Reduction of psychiatric hospitalization is evident immediately after start of CCM implementation support, but assessments may be better timed once the effect size begins to stabilize, which may be as early as six months.

However, the outcome compared to microfracturing (MFx) for certain defect sizes (2-3 cm 2 ) is still uncertain. Therefore, the present study compared primary isolated AMIC versus MFx in a cohort of patients with borderline sized focal unipolar chondral defects of the knee at midterm follow-up.  Methods:  Patients with chondral defects of the knee who underwent AMIC or MFx were compared. An arthroscopic approach was used for MFx, and a minimally invasive parapatellar arthrotomy for AMIC. For those patients who underwent AMIC, a collagen membrane was used with fibrin glue. The patients answered independently: Visual Analogic Scale (VAS), Tegner Activity Scale, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and the Lysholm scores.  Results:  A total of 83 patients with a mean age of 30.2 and body mass index (BMI) of 26.9 kg/m 2  were recruited. Of them, 33.7% (28 of 83) were women, and 55.4% (46 of 83 patients) had defects in the right knee. The mean length of symptoms before surgery was 43.3 months. The mean size of the defect was 2.7 cm 2 . The mean length of follow-up was 42.1 months. No difference was found in terms of symptoms and follow-up length, mean age and BMI, mean size of defect, sex, and side. The AMIC cohort reported greater IKCD ( p  > 0.0001), Lysholm ( p  = 0.002), VAS ( p  = 0.01), Tegner ( p  = 0.004) scores. The AMIC cohort reported lower rate of failure ( p  = 0.005) and revision surgery ( p  = 0.02). No difference was found in the rate of arthroplasty ( p  = 0.2). No delamination or hypertrophy were detected.  Conclusion:  AMIC demonstrated superiority over MFx for focal unipolar chondral defects of the knee. At approximately 40 months follow-up, the IKDC, Lysholm, and VAS scores were greater in the AMIC group. Patients treated with AMIC also demonstrated a higher level of sport activity, and lower rates of failure and revision surgeries.","['Knee', 'Chondral Defects', 'Autologous Matrix-induced Chondrogenesis (Amic)']",[],[],NaN

Prior research examining factors associated with antibiotic self-medication has focused on an individual's knowledge about antibiotics, antibiotic usage practices, accessibility to antibiotic medication, and demographic characteristics. The role of psychological distress associated with perceived health risks in explaining antibiotic self-medication is less understood. This study was designed to address this knowledge gap in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. An online survey of 2217 participants was conducted at the height of the initial outbreak and revealed that 19.5% of participants took antibiotics to protect themselves from COVID-19. Multivariate logistic analysis examined the predictors of taking antibiotics for protection against COVID-19. An integrative framework developed from the results illustrates potential pathways and facilitating factors that may contribute to prophylactic self-medication with antibiotics. Specifically, COVID-19 pandemic-induced psychological distress was significantly positively related to self-medication. Preventive use of antibiotics was also facilitated by a lack of understanding about antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotics usage practices, the nature of the patient-doctor relationship, and demographic characteristics. The findings highlight that to combat antimicrobial resistance due to self-medication, interventions need to focus on interrupting entrenched behavioural responses and addressing emotional responses to perceived health risks.","['Antimicrobial resistance', 'Psychological Distress', 'Perceived Health Risk', 'Coronavirus Pandemic', 'Knowledge Of Antibiotics', 'Antibiotic Use For Prevention']",[],[],NaN

You have the right to stop completing the questionnaire at any stage and to withdraw from participation.” Those who responded to the questionnaire to completion were considered as having given their informed consents. Official approvals for implementation of the study were obtained from the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine at Alexandria University. Confidentiality of data was ensured throughout all phases of the study. Data were analyzed anonymously, with only members of the study in charge of data analysis having access to collected data. Confidentiality of data continued until the full manuscript was finalized. After publication, the data will be safely stored with continued maintenance of confidentiality."," Objectives Collection and storage of biospecimens and data for biobanking raise many ethical concerns. Stakeholders' opinions about these ethical issues are important since they can help in the development of ethical guidelines to govern biobanking activities. Physicians are among the important stakeholders since they contact potential participants and could be biobank users. The goal of this study is to evaluate the perceptions and attitude of Egyptian physicians towards ethical issues in biobanking. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was designed and distributed with the target group between November 2019 and January 2020. Results The questionnaire was completed by 223 physicians. While 65.5% reported hearing the term ""Biobanking"" before, 45.7% knew that there are biobanks in Egypt. Participants had a general positive attitude towards the value of biobanks in research. About 73% agreed that biobanks can share biospecimens with international research organizations, but only 42.6% supported collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, and 44% agreed to the use of user fees by biobanks. About 48% supported the use of broad consent in biobanks, and 73.1% believed that donors of biospecimens should be informed about results of research performed on their biospecimens. Conclusion Although many Egyptian physicians heard about biobanking, they had limited knowledge about the existence of biobanks in Egypt. They had concerns about commercialization, use of broad consent and user fees. A knowledge gap exists among these stakeholders, which should be covered by different educational activities.

Methods Out of 562 examinations with normal FDG distribution on whole-body PET/MRI, 74 repeated examinations were evaluated to assess the repeatability and regional distribution of physiological skin uptake. Furthermore, 224 examinations were evaluated to compare differences in the uptake due to sex and age. Skin segmentation on PET was performed as body-surface contouring on an MR-based attenuation correction map using an off-line reconstruction software. Bland-Altman plots were created for the repeatability assessment. Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to compare the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) with regional distribution, age, and sex. Results The limits of agreement for the difference in SUVmean and SUVmax of the skin were less than 30%. The highest SUVmax was observed in the face (3.09±1.04), followed by the scalp (2.07±0.53). The SUVmax in the face of boys aged 0-9 years and 10-20 years (1.33±0.64 and 2.05±1.00, respectively) and girls aged 0-9 years (0.98±0.38) was significantly lower than that of men aged ≥20 years and girls aged ≥10 years (p Conclusion PET/MRI enabled the quantitative analysis of skin FDG uptake with repeatability.

Methods In this observational multicenter cohort study we included adults with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that were admitted to one of five hospitals in the Netherlands (March to May 2020). We performed a competing risk survival analysis, presenting cause-specific hazard ratios (HRCS) for the effect of preselected factors on the absolute risk of death and recovery. Results 1,006 patients were included (63.9% male; median age 69 years, IQR: 58-77).

The responses to the statements that questioned such issues (M4, E6, ME4) were found to be homogenous to a large extent. For instance, the statement commercials made for food and agriculture sectors should be evaluated more carefully than for the other sectors (M4), which were supported by most of the participants. This finding is in line with the studies, which revealed that food commercials appearing on TV and the Internet influence childrenâ€™s eating habits (Boyland and Whalen  2015). Also, the World Health Organization reported that commercial promotion of energy dense nutrient-poor foods increase the prevalence of childhood obesity (World Health Organization  2016). In these works, consumption of healthy food was encouraged, and the need for policy measures to reduce the prevalence of obesity and obesity related diseases was emphasized. For the problems, which  involve ethical dilemma, the participants’ responses varied, the rate of “neither agree, nor disagree” increased, and the significant differences arising from participants’ personal characteristics were observed. The participants’ responses to cross-questions, the aim of which was to reveal the attitudes in case of ethical dilemmas, clearly demonstrated this fact as well as the difficulty the participants faced in giving a consistent response. For example, it was seen that the responses given to the statements (R1) “Ethical discussion in food-agriculture system is only possible in the areas that are not regulated via laws and legislations” and (R8) “There won’t be any problem in food and agriculture system if appropriate policies and relevant regulations are developed” were highly inconsistent. Although the participants asserted that legislative regulations would not eliminate ethical problems, they (69%) also argued that the problems would be solved with appropriate legislations (Fig.  1). This discrepancy in their opinions could be explained with their lack of knowledge on ethics. In addition, it can also be deduced that the participants believed that regulations and appropriate legislations would still fall short of eliminating society’s worries. To give an example, in the U.S., FDA is responsible for the approval of food additives and recognizing them as safe. In a study, which discussed the possible conflict of interest between food controllers and manufacturers, it was argued that independent reviews on the determination of food additives would be more appropriate (Neltner et al.  2013). Participants’ views that legislative regulations would not be sufficient in solving ethical problems can be interpreted as though they expect legal regulations to be reflected in practice as well. Other statements that involved ethical dilemmas are “I believe the information pollution and misinformation in food and agriculture fields is ill intentioned” (E5), “There is a value conflict between protecting the producer and protecting the consumer” (E8), and “It is ethically correct to consume agricultural and food products somewhere as close as possible to where they are produced and as soon as possible” (E9). It was seen that the participants could not come to a common agreement on these dilemmatic issues and the rate of “neither agree, nor disagree” increased significantly on these statements (Fig.  2). The rates of “agree” and “disagree” were also found to be significantly close for such kind of statements, which were morally arguable. In addition, the notion that ethics and morals are the same is accepted by a majority of participant professionals (ME1). The difficulty in professionals’ coming to a judgement about situations that involve ethical dilemmas and their lack of knowledge on the basic concepts of ethics suggest that they need to receive education on the issue. In fact, 70% of participants expressed their willingness to take part in educational practices in agricultural and food ethics (E1). Since ethics is a field of knowledge that can be taught, we believe that responding to the participants’ need for education is an ethical responsibility. Ethics education has a deep-rooted past in health practices (Miles et al.  1989). It is known that academic researches and education on agricultural and food ethics have been encouraged, and international public debates on the issue have been held over the past two decades (Eursafe  1999). More recently, agricultural and food ethics have varied from the current ethics education, and development of relevant curricula has been attempted (Costa  2018). The results obtained in this study confirm that such attempts are necessary and significant, for only by acquiring knowledge of ethics can professionals make a sound evaluation of regulations, ethics, and meta-ethics. The significant difference in professions in terms of their perception of ethical problems can be explained with the lack of a common perspective in ethics education. Attitude to Ethical Problem Clusters: Developing Food and Agricultural Policies Most of the participants expressed negative opinion on the sustainability of agricultural policies and effectiveness of controls in ensuring safety in the food and agricultural sector (Fig.  1). For instance, more than half of the participants (53%) did not agree with the statement “I think restricting the GMOs technology is groundless, as long as its adverse effects on human health are not verified,” and argued that the use of GMOs technology should be restricted (M2). Nevertheless, along with the scientific and technological advances in Turkey, “Regulation on Genetically Modified Organisms and Products” was issued in 2010 with the aims of eliminating the risks that arise from genetically modified organisms and products obtained using modern biotechnology, and protect the human, animal and plant health, as well as the environment and biodiversity (Official Gazette  2010). Although such legislative regulations are available to control the production and consumption of GMO products, it was seen that the participants still lacked confidence in the food controls within the sector. It was reported in the literature that participation of local administrations and the society in food assessment and control is significant in eliminating such negative opinions (Maron  2006). In addition, the studies highlighting the importance of developing sustainable policies are centered on how to increase the safety of food production and distribution, to what degree scientific and technological applications should be used, the labeling of GMO products, and the effect of development and assessment of food guidelines on improving health and its protective effect on community health and environment (Jefferson  2006; Wahlqvist and Kuo 2009; Watanabe et al.  2009; Dizon et al.  2016; Alles et al. 2017; Zaganjor et al.  2018). Like many other countries struggling with unhealthy dietary trends, Turkey is also attempting to develop an effective food and agricultural policy to meet the needs of the country under today’s conditions (Recanati et al.  2019). It is stated that these problems can be overcome by trusting the rule of law and adopting ethical principles at the individual and institutional levels (Koç 2020). In this context, it is accepted that the success of food policies is possible with national and international solidarity (Koç 2020). It can be seen in Fig.  1 that the rate of participants who thought that the government should adopt positive discrimination against agricultural producers-provide them agricultural subsidies—was quite low (57%). This can be explained with the participants’ disapproval of the available agricultural subsidies, rather than the premise that they deem agricultural subsidies as an ineffective tool. Therefore, this unexpected finding can be interpreted in a more comprehensive future study. Participants were asked to rank five universal and seven professional ethics in order of importance, and it was found with a significant difference that justice was deemed the most important universal value (Fig.  4) and food safety was deemed the most important professional value (Fig.  5). Parallel with this finding, it was also seen that the participants put forward corruption as the biggest ethical problem in food and agriculture sector, and expressed their common concern toward this problem (Fig.  6). The data were obtained from the present research, and a policy was adopted in the agricultural and food system in Turkey. The research is concerned with the problems caused by this policy. In this context, there is no justice in production, marketing, or consumption processes. The excessive use of fertilizer-feed (fast growing), tag-content fraud, unconscious use of medication (residue), industrial insemination (hybrid-GD0), pollution of the environment (soil, water, air, pasture), informal transactions (corruption) were reported to be among the factors that led to ethical problems (Uysal  2019). Similar to the findings in literature, the results of this study demonstrated that food waste occurring in the whole process, from production to consumption, was deemed as a big ethical problem by our participants (Gediklioğlu 2017). The characterization of hunger as problems in access to food and an adequate, balanced, and nutritional diet, rather than the lack of food was acknowledged (Mishra  2012). In this respect, our findings showed that the participants ranked various ethical problems with close values to each other. There is no other problem that affects peopleâ€™s lives as directly as inequality in access to food. The common good, which is good for and shared by every member of the society, is closely related with eliminating the barriers obstructing the access to food, respect of human rights, and ensuring of social justice (Azetsop and Joy  2013). Hence, the notion that organization of food and agriculture system is actually a significant public concern was supported by the ethics that our participants prioritized. The concept of justice has been handled in a variety of aspects in food and agriculture system. For instance, the issues of fair trade laws and practices, availability and accessibility of affordable food, and sustainability are associated with justice (Tansey  2017). In our study, the issue of justice was addressed in a more comprehensive manner (e.g., the issue of ecosystems was also covered), and most of the participants agreed with the related statement that protection of natural resources and ecosystems is a question of justice for the future generations.","In Turkey, the numbers of studies that deal with agriculture and food as a system and process, and that address the issue with an integrated approach are very limited. Besides, there is no empirical study available in the national literature in which agricultural and food system has been analyzed within the framework of applied ethics. The present study aims to investigate the characteristics of food and agricultural engineers and veterinary physicians in terms of their tendency to carry out ethical evaluations when faced with issues falling under the field of agriculture and food ethics, and detect their capacity to identify ethical problems.A cross-sectional survey was employed in this study. Descriptive statistics like percentages and frequencies based on the scores from the scale were used. Data were collected via survey method from three occupational groups, namely, food and agricultural engineers and veterinary physicians working in 12 regions of Turkey, and analyzed using chi-square and score test. A total of 865 professionals from 55 different cities participated in the study. Data concerning participants' level of ethics awareness regarding the identification and evaluation of ethical problems in the fields of food and agriculture were obtained. While the participating professionals could easily detect the problems in food and agriculture system that carried no ethical dilemma, they had difficulty in identifying issues that involved ethical dilemmas. It was also revealed that there was a significant difference between professionals in terms of their perception of ethical problems, demonstrating the need for a comprehensive ethics education to be imparted during and after under-graduate.","['Bioethics', 'Applied Ethics', 'Agricultural And Food Ethics', 'Agricultural Engineer', 'Food Engineer', 'Veterinary Physician']","['food', 'Ethical', 'ethical problems', 'participants', 'Ethical Dilemmas', 'Ethics', 'food ethics', 'agricultural', 'problems', 'Ethics Education']",[],NaN

Three hundred and one samples of patients with wound infections were analysed for the presence of resistant bacteria in the period August 2017 till March 2018. Carbapenem-resistant  Acinetobacter (A.) baumannii  were further characterized by resistance gene sequencing, PCR-based bacterial strain typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST ""Oxford scheme"").  A. baumanni  was detected in wound infections of 45 patients (15%); 22 isolates were carbapenem-resistant. Carbapenemases NDM-1 and/or OXA-23 were detected in all isolates; two isolates harboured additionally OXA-420. PFGE and MLST analyses confirmed the presence of one  A. baumannii  strain in 17 patients that was assigned to the worldwide spread sequence type ST231 and carried NDM-1 and OXA-23. Furthermore, two new  A. baumannii  STs (ST2145 and ST2146) were detected in two and three patients, respectively. Within three years the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant  A. baumannii  increased dramatically in the hospital. The early detection of multidrug-resistant bacteria and prevention of their further spread are only possible if continuous surveillance and molecular typing will be implemented.","['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Rural', 'Ghana', 'Wound Infections', 'Ndm-1', 'Carbapenem Resistance', 'Oxa-23', 'Oxa-420']","['Ghana Health', 'Health Service', 'Development Division', 'University Medical', 'Medical Center', 'Review Committee', 'Service Ethics', 'Ethics Review', 'Ghana', 'Ethics Committee']",[],NaN

It seeks to reveal the risks and benefits of unique encounters with animals through art and to consider the ethical implications of artwork deploying animals. Australian and international animal protection laws are not explicit when it comes to the sourcing of animals for art nor for the direct inclusion of animals in artworks. This lack leads to a variety of artistic practices, some considered ethical while others are viewed as controversial, bordering on animal cruelty. Artwork selection is determined by a focus on high-profile artists who intentionally use animals in their practice and whose reputation has been fostered by this intention. The study provides insight into how the intentional use of ethically sourced animals within art practice can be a method of addressing hierarchal human-animal imbalances. Further, this study identifies unethical practices that may be best avoided regardless of the pro-animal political statements the artists put forward. Recommendations of how to better determine what is an acceptable use of animals in art with a view to informing legal guidelines and artistic best practice are presented.","['Animals', 'Ethics', 'Visual Art', 'Cruelty', 'Animal Rights', 'Human–Animal Hierarchy']",[],[],NaN

Methods A longitudinal, quasi-experimental and quantitative investigation was designed, working with a total sample of 50 students divided into control and experimental groups. The nutritional quality of daily snacks was recorded during the month before and the month after the cycle of talks given by health experts. Results An increase in the nutritional quality of the snacks was observed in the days after the talk-but, after a week, values returned to normal. Conclusions The giving of educational talks to promote healthy habits may have a positive impact on the nutritional quality of school snacks in the days immediately following the talks. However, some forgetfulness was detected over time, which reduced the nutritional quality of the snacks once more.

Novel applications of artificial intelligence (AI) promise to predict the onset of AD several years in advance without determining biomarker thresholds. Until now, little attention has been paid to the new ethical challenges that AI brings to the early diagnosis in asymptomatic individuals, beyond contributing to research purposes, when we still lack adequate treatment. The aim of this paper is to explore the ethical arguments put forward for AI aided AD prediction in subjectively asymptomatic individuals and their ethical implications. The ethical assessment is based on a systematic literature search. Thematic analysis was conducted inductively of 18 included publications. The ethical framework includes the principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Reasons for offering predictive tests to asymptomatic individuals are the right to know, a positive balance of the risk-benefit assessment, and the opportunity for future planning. Reasons against are the lack of disease modifying treatment, the accuracy and explicability of AI aided prediction, the right not to know, and threats to social rights. We conclude that there are serious ethical concerns in offering early diagnosis to asymptomatic individuals and the issues raised by the application of AI add to the already known issues. Nevertheless, pre-symptomatic testing should only be offered on request to avoid inflicted harm.

Aboriginal people experience inequalities in healthcare treatment and outcomes. This study aimed to investigate barriers and enablers to accessing healthcare services for Aboriginal people living in regional and remote Australia. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare delivery staff and stakeholders recruited through snowball sampling. Three communities were selected for their high proportion of Aboriginal people and diverse regional and remote locations. Thematic analysis identified barriers and enablers. Results Thirty-one interviews were conducted in the three communities ( n  = 5 coastal,  n  = 13 remote, and  n  = 13 border) and six themes identified: (1) Improved coordination of healthcare services; (2) Better communication between services and patients; (3) Trust in services and cultural safety; (4) Importance of prioritizing health services by Aboriginal people; (5) Importance of reliable, affordable and sustainable services; (6) Distance and transport availability. These themes were often present as both barriers and enablers to healthcare access for Aboriginal people. They were also present across the healthcare system and within all three communities.

In a relatively large proportion of the SCDs, the deaths remain unexplained after autopsy. This challenge is likely caused by unknown disease mechanisms. Changes in DNA methylation have been associated with several heart diseases, but the role of DNA methylation in SCD is unknown. In this study, we investigated DNA methylation in two SCD subtypes, sudden unexplained death (SUD) and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). We assessed DNA methylation of more than 850,000 positions in cardiac tissue from nine SUD and 14 SUDEP cases using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. In total, six differently methylated regions (DMRs) between the SUD and SUDEP cases were identified. The DMRs were located in proximity to or overlapping genes encoding proteins that are a part of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed that the DNA methylation alterations were not caused by genetic changes, while whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) showed that DNA methylation was associated with expression levels of the  GSTT1  gene. In conclusion, our results indicate that cardiac DNA methylation is similar in SUD and SUDEP, but with regional differential methylation in proximity to GST genes.","['RNA', 'Genetics', 'DNA methylation', 'Epigenetics', 'Sudden Cardiac Death', 'Sudden Unexpected Death In Epilepsy', 'Sudden Unexplained Death', 'Molecular Autopsy']",[],[],NaN

Hypoxia-induced changes and hemoglobin accumulation within the subarachnoid space are thought to lead to oxidative stress, early brain injury, and delayed vasospasm. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant status and its impact on neurological outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Methods In this prospective observational study, 29 patients with aneurysmal SAH were included (mean age 54.7 ± 12.4). Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected on days (d) 1, 3, and 7. In addition, 29 patients without intracranial hemorrhage served as controls. The antioxidant system was analyzed by glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px; U/L) and total and free glutathione-sulfhydryl (GSH; mg/L) in the plasma. Superoxide dismutase (SOD, U/mL) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC, µmol/L) were measured in the serum and CSF. Clinical data were compiled on admission (Hunt and Hess grade, Fisher grade, and GCS). Neurological and cognitive outcome (modified Rankin scale (mRS), Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) was assessed after 6 weeks (6 w) and 6 months (6 m). Results Plasma levels of SOD increased from day 1 to 7 after SAH (d1: 1.22 ± 0.36 U/L; d3: 1.25 ± 0.33 U/L,  p  = 0.99; d7: 1.52 ± 0.4 U/L,  p  = 0.019) and were significantly higher compared to controls (1.11 ± 0.27 U/L) at day 7 ( p   p  = 0.10; d7: 2.37 ± 1.29 U/L,  p   p  = 0.09). Mean plasma TAC at day 1 (d1: 77.87 ± 49.72 µmol/L) was not statistically different compared to controls (46.74 ± 32.42 µmol/L,  p  = 0.25). TAC remained unchanged from day 1 to 7 (d3: 92.64 ± 68.58 µmol/L,  p  = 0.86; d7: 74.07 ± 54.95 µmol/L,  p  = 0.8) in plasma. TAC in CSF steeply declined from day 1 to 7 in patients with SAH becoming significantly different from controls at days 3 and 7 (d3: 177.3 ± 108.7 µmol/L,  p  = 0.0046; d7: 85.35 ± 103.9 µmol/L,  p   p  = 0.0001; plasma  p  = 0.027/GOSE: CSF  p  = 0.001; plasma  p  = 0.001) and 6 months (mRS: CSF  p  = 0.001; plasma  p  = 0.09/GOSE: CSF  p  = 0.001; plasma  p  = 0.001) after SAH. Increased plasma TAC correlated with a worse neurological outcome 6 weeks (mRS:  p  = 0.001/GOSE  p  = 0.001) and 6 months (mRS  p  = 0.001/GOSE  p  = 0.001) after SAH. Conclusion In our study, a reduction in the antioxidative enzyme SOD and elevated TAC were associated with a poorer neurological outcome reflected by mRS and GOSE at 6 weeks and 6 months after SAH. A lower initial SOD CSF concentration was associated with the late deterioration of cognitive ability. These findings support the mounting evidence of the role of oxidative stress in early brain injury formation and unfavorable outcome after SAH.","['Plasma', 'SOD', 'Oxidative stress', 'ROS', 'Antioxidant capacity', 'Csf', 'Sah']",[],[],NaN

Multimodal analgesia (MMA) can reduce the use of opioids in the postoperative period, but MMA has not been well-studied after major head and neck surgery. Our goal is to explore the association between MMA and postoperative opioid use and pain control in patients undergoing major head and neck surgery. We performed a retrospective study in adult (age ≥ 18 years) patients undergoing primary head and neck cancer resection with free-flap reconstruction. All patients were treated using an established care pathway. The baseline group was treated between January 2015-December 2015 ( n  = 41), prior to the implementation of MMA, and were compared to an MMA-treated cohort treated between December 2017-June 2019 ( n  = 97). The primary outcome was the proportion of opioids prescribed and oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) consumed during the hospitalization. The secondary outcome was pain control. We found that the post-MMA group consumed fewer opioids in the postoperative period compared to the pre-MMA group. Prior to post-operative day (POD) 6, pain control was better in the post-MMA group; however, the pain control lines intersect on POD 6 and the pre-MMA group appeared to have better pain control from PODs 7-10. In conclusion, our data suggest MMA is an effective method of pain control and opioid reduction in patients undergoing surgery for head and neck cancer with free flap reconstruction. MMA use was associated with a significant decrease in the quantity of opioids consumed postoperatively. The MMA protocol was associated with improved pain management early in the postoperative course. Finally, the MMA protocol is a feasible method of pain control and may reduce the adverse side effects associated with opioid use.","['Postoperative pain', 'Head And Neck Cancer', 'Multimodal Analgesia', 'Head And Neck Surgery', 'Perioperative Pain Control']","['ARECCI Ethics', 'Ethics Guidelines', 'ARECCI', 'Community Consensus', 'Screening Tool', 'Ethics Community', 'Ethics Screening', 'Ethics', 'Consensus Initiative', 'Project Ethics']",[],NaN

Obesity is associated with many chronic diseases and health conditions. This study aims to estimate the current prevalence of obesity in Saudi Arabia and described the current national-level status of the association between obesity and various health conditions. This study is a nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted over phone-interviews in June 2020. In this study, a proportional quota-sampling technique was used to obtain equal distributions of participants, stratified by age and gender, across the 13 regions of Saudi Arabia. Weight and height were self-reported, and the obesity was determined as BMI ≥ 30. Logistic regression adjusted for age and gender was used for exploring current associations between obesity and health conditions. Of the 6239 participants contacted, 4709 participants responded and completed the interview with a response rate of 75.48%. Of them, 50.1% were female, the mean age was 36.4 ± 13.5 (Range: 18-90), and the median age was 36. The national weighted prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30) was 24.7%, and the prevalence in the sample (unweighted) was 21.7%.

Therefore, it is critical to identify the link between CKD and cardiovascular risk (CVR) through early and reliable biomarkers. Acknowledging that CKD and CKD progression are associated with increased sympathetic tone, which is implicated in CVR, and that renalase metabolizes catecholamines, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between renalase serum levels (RNLS) and cardiovascular and renal outcomes. The study included 40 pre-dialysis CKD patients (19F:21M) with median age of 61 (IQ 45-66) years. At baseline, we measured RNLS as well as routine biomarkers of renal and cardiovascular risk. A prospective analysis was performed to determine whether RNLS are associated with CKD progression, MACCEs, hospitalizations and all-cause mortality. At baseline, the median level of RNLS and median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were 63.5 (IQ 48.4-82.7) µg/mL and 47 (IQ 13-119) mL/min/1.73 m 2 , respectively. In univariate analysis, RNLS were strongly associated with eGFR, age and Charlson Index. Over the course of a mean follow-up of 65 (47 to 70) months, 3 (7.5%) deaths, 2 (5%) fatal MACCEs, 17 (42.5%) hospital admissions occurred, and 16 (40%) patients experienced CKD progression. In univariate analysis, RNLS were associated with CKD progression ( p  = 0.001), hospitalizations ( p  = 0.001) and all-cause mortality ( p  = 0.022) but not with MACCEs ( p  = 0.094). In adjusted analysis, RNLS predicted CKD progression and hospitalizations regardless of age, Charlson comorbidity index, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. Our results suggest that RNLS, closely related with renal function, might have a potential role as predictor of renal outcomes, hospitalizations, and mortality in pre-dialysis CKD patients.","['Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Cardiovascular Risk', 'Renalase', 'Ckd Progression', 'Macces']","['Hospital Centre', 'Medical Association', 'Local Institutional', 'Institutional Review', 'Review Board', 'São João', 'João University', 'University Hospital', 'World Medical', 'Ethics Committee']",[],NaN

Our institutional bronchoscopy database was accessed to identify main patterns of airway toxicity observed in a seven-year period. A total of 70 patients were identified with central airway toxicity, and the findings of bronchoscopy were used to derive a classification system. Patient characteristics, time from radiotherapy to toxicity, follow-up and survival were retrospectively analyzed.  Results:  The main bronchoscopic patterns of airway toxicity were vascular changes (telangiectasia, loss of vascularity, necrosis) and stenosis of the lumen (moderate, severe). Indications for bronchoscopy were airway symptoms ( n  = 28), assessment post-CRT/surgery ( n  = 12), (suspected) recurrence ( n  = 21) or assessment of radiological findings ( n  = 9). Stenosis was revealed by bronchoscopy at a median time of 10.0 months (IQR: 4-23.5) after radiotherapy and subsequent follow-up after identification was 23 months (IQR: 1.5-55). The corresponding findings for vascular changes were 29 months (IQR: 10.5-48.5), and follow-up after identification was nine months (IQR: 2.5-19.5). There was a statistically significant difference in survival rates between patients with necrosis and telangiectasia ( p  = 0.002) and loss of vascularity ( p  = 0.001). Eight out of 10 deceased patients with telangiectasia died of other causes and 4/8 patients with necrosis died of other causes. We identified two main patterns of central airway toxicity visualized with bronchoscopy after high-dose radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, and propose a bronchoscopic classification system based on these findings. Preliminary analysis suggests that the pattern and severity of radiation damage might be of prognostic value.

Previously, we had reported that these beat stimulation conditions modulated memory performance in opposite directions. Here, we analyzed data from a patient subgroup, in which microwires were implanted in the amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal cortex. We identified neurons responding with firing rate changes to binaural versus monaural 5 Hz beat stimulation. In these neurons, we correlated the differences in firing rates for binaural versus monaural beats to the memory-related differences for remembered versus forgotten items and associations. In the left hemisphere, we detected statistically significant negative correlations between firing rate differences for binaural versus monaural beats and remembered versus forgotten items/associations. Importantly, such negative correlations were also observed between beat stimulation-related firing rate differences in the pre-stimulus window and memory-related firing rate differences in the post-stimulus windows.

Although being considered as one of the major causes, currently there are limited findings regarding differences in dietary patterns of schizophrenic patients with and without MetS. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of MetS among hospitalized patients with schizophrenia, to investigate the differences in socio-demographic, clinical, and lifestyle characteristics between participants with and without MetS, with the special emphasis being put on their dietary habits, and to ascertain the correlation between dietary habits and MetS components.  Materials and Methods : A cross-sectional study included 259 hospitalized patients with schizophrenia aged ≥ 18 years. All participants underwent basic anthropometric measurements, blood sampling and blood pressure assessment, and provided relevant socio-demographic and lifestyle information. The presence of MetS was determined according to the Joint Interim Statement definition and dietary habits were assessed using a non-quantitative food frequency questionnaire.  Results : The overall prevalence of MetS was 47.9%. No socio-demographic or lifestyle differences were found between participants with and without MetS. A large number of participants (42.9%) reported consuming carbonated soft drinks on a daily basis. Daily frequency of fruit (11.6%) and vegetables intake (29.3%) was far below recommended. Dietary habits of participants with and without MetS did not significantly differ, while consumption frequencies of some of the studied food and beverage items and groups significantly correlated with certain MetS components (such as statistically significant positive correlation between cured meat products consumption frequency and waist circumference, as well as between red meat consumption frequency and systolic blood pressure).  Conclusions : The concept of the present study did not allow us to distinguish to what extent the participants' dietary habits were influenced by independent procurement of food products, nor has it allowed us to quantify the portion sizes of consumed food and beverage items and groups. Nevertheless, the findings indicate the need for early identification of individuals with high MetS risk and for the incorporation of nutritional support programs into hospital treatment of patients with schizophrenia.","['Schizophrenia', 'metabolic syndrome', 'Dietary Habits', 'inpatients']","['ethics committee', 'legal guardians', 'informed consent', 'written informed', 'Ethics', 'legal', 'study', 'participants', 'committee', 'Central Ethics']",[],NaN

As patients entering a doctor's practice can potentially infect medical staff and other patients, using digital alternatives wherever possible is a potential solution to avoiding face-to-face encounters. In these conditions, telemedicine is becoming increasingly relevant. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine telemedicine use and gathered experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria. Materials and methods In June 2020, a representative group of Austrian respondents ( n  = 1000) was asked via online survey whether they had contacted a doctor during spring of 2020, and, if so, whether they had used a telemedical method to do so. The survey also reflected gathered experiences and degrees of satisfaction with the use of telemedicine. Results A third (33%) of those who contacted a doctor during the target period did so using telemedical tools. The majority of those with previous telehealth experience were satisfied with the help they received. Patients commonly used a telephone to contact their doctors. The overall assessment of telemedical aids tended to be positive, with more than half (53%) of those surveyed seeing significant advantages, and a 90% satisfaction rate among the respondents who used telehealth services.

With the exception of the control, samples were exposed to different treatments; including chlorhexidine gluconate 2 mg/mL, prepared turmeric solution (TS) mouthwash: TS 0.25 mL (7.375 mg/mL), TS 0.5 mL (14.75 mg/mL), and TS 1 mL (29.50 mg/mL). Growth rate of the bacterial cultures were assessed by monitoring changes in optical density readings at 600 nm at hourly intervals for a six-hour period. The data were plotted and the exponential trend was used to calculate individual rates of growth. Data was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with the significance confirmed using the Tukey-HSD test. Results Growth observed in the bacteria exposed to the turmeric solution, was significantly greater ( p   Conclusion Comparison of growth rates of oral bacteria suggested that turmeric solutions of concentrations between 7.357 and 29.5 mg/mL (0.25-1 mL) were unlikely to exhibit bacteriostatic or bactericidal properties, and, conversely, increased bacterial growth. Considering this result, it is unlikely that turmeric mouthwash made from store-bought turmeric would have any antibacterial effects against oral bacteria, and may even promote bacterial growth.","['Growth', 'Oral Bacteria', 'Turmeric', 'In-vitro']",[],[],NaN

During the five days of Hajj, a total of 185 pilgrims were enrolled in the study. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) of 126/185 patients (68.11%) tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses by PCR. Among the 126 pilgrims whose NPS were PCR positive: (a) there were 93/126 (74%) with a single virus infection, (b) 33/126 (26%) with coinfection with more than one virus (up to four viruses): of these, 25/33 cases had coinfection with two viruses; 6/33 were infected with three viruses, while the remaining 2/33 patients had infection with four viruses. Human rhinovirus (HRV) was the most common detected viruses with 53 cases (42.06%), followed by 27 (21.43%) cases of influenza A (H1N1), and 23 (18.25%) cases of influenza A other than H1N1. Twenty-five cases of CoV-229E (19.84%) were detected more than other coronavirus members (5 CoV-OC43 (3.97%), 4 CoV-HKU1 (3.17%), and 1 CoV-NL63 (0.79%)). PIV-3 was detected in 8 cases (6.35%). A single case (0.79%) of PIV-1 and PIV-4 were found. HMPV represented 5 (3.97%), RSV and influenza B 4 (3.17%) for each, and Parechovirus 1 (0.79%).

Sixty-three CRKP strains were isolated from a tertiary teaching hospital from January 2016 until August 2017. Carbapenemase genes were detected in 55 isolates, with  bla  OXA-48  (63.5%) as the predominant carbapenemase gene, followed by  bla  NDM  (36.5%). At least one porin loss was detected in nine isolates. Overall, 63 isolates were divided into 30 clusters at similarity of 80% with PFGE analysis. Statistical analysis showed that in-hospital mortality was significantly associated with the usage of central venous catheter, infection or colonization by CRKP, particularly NDM-producers. In comparison, survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression identified a higher hazard ratio for patients with a stoma and patients treated with imipenem but a lower hazard ratio for patients with NDM-producing CRKP. OXA-48 carbapenemase gene was the predominant carbapenemase gene in this study. As CRKP infection could lead to a high rate of in-hospital mortality, early detection of the isolates was important to reduce their dissemination.","['Enterobacteriaceae', 'PFGE', 'Carbapenemase', 'Oxa-48', 'Ndm', 'Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae']","['Statement Clinical', 'Malaya Medical', 'Medical Centre', 'Centre Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Clinical data', 'Medical', 'Medical Ethics', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

We report our experience with surgical resection of trigeminal schwannomas by simple and classic skull-base approaches. (2) Methods: We performed a retrospective single-center study including patients who underwent surgery for trigeminal schwannoma tumors between June 2007 and May 2020, concentrating on surgical technique, extent of resection, postoperative outcome and complications. (3) Results: We included 13 patients (median age 57.5 with range of 36-83 years, 53.8% (7/13) female. The most common preoperative clinical presentations were facial pain in six (46.2%), hypoacusis in four (30.8%), trigeminal nerve hypesthesia in 11 (V1 46.2% (6/13), V2 (61.5% (8/13), V3 46.2% (6/13)) and headache in three (23.1%) patients. In three cases, the tumor was resected in a two-stage technique. The intradural subtemporal approach was performed in six cases, the extradural technique in two cases, the retrosigmoid approach in five cases, a Kawase approach in two cases and the transnasal endoscopic approach in one case. The gross total resection rate was 76.9% (10/13) and the median follow-up time 24.0 (0-136) months. Three (23.1%) patients developed postoperative anesthesia in at least one branch of the trigeminal nerve. Trigeminal motor function was preserved in 11 (84.6%) patients. Ten of the 11 patients (76.9%) who reported decreased gustation, cerebellar ataxia, visual impairment, or headache improved postoperatively. Two (15.4%) patients exhibited minimal facial palsy (House and Brackmann II-III), which resolved during the follow-up. The total adverse event rate requiring surgical intervention during follow-up was 7.7%. Surgery-related mortality was 0%.

Airway management should, however, be adapted, since face-mask ventilation can hardly be carried out while continuous compressions are administered. The early insertion of a supraglottic device could therefore improve the chest compression fraction by allowing ventilation while maintaining compressions. This is a protocol for a multicenter, parallel, randomized simulation study. Depending on randomization, each team made up of paramedics and emergency medical technicians will manage the 10-min scenario according either to the standard approach (30 compressions with two face-mask ventilations) or to the experimental approach (continuous manual compressions with early insertion of an i-gel ®  supraglottic device to deliver asynchronous ventilations). The primary outcome will be the chest compression fraction during the first two minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Secondary outcomes will be chest compression fraction (per cycle and overall), compressions and ventilations quality, time to first shock and to first ventilation, user satisfaction, and providers' self-assessed cognitive load.","['airway', 'Cardiac arrest', 'Resuscitation', 'Cpr', 'Paramedics', 'Prehospital', 'Emergency Medical Services', 'Supraglottic Airway Device', 'Chest Compression Fraction', 'I-gel®']","['Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Approval', 'Ethics', 'study', 'Research Ethics', 'Supplementary Files', 'regional Ethics', 'Files', 'Good Clinical', 'Supplementary']",['NCT04736446.'],NaN

Ethics This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tsurumi University School of Dental Medicine (approval number: 1837) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.,"In Japan, there is currently a shortage of dental hygienists. The number of dental hygienists as a workforce at dental clinical practice is not sufficient. Several factors affect career retention and job satisfaction of hygienists and these factors are considered to correlate with each other to construct networks. The aim of this study was to present a structural model of job satisfaction of Japanese dental hygienists and to determine the characteristics of unmotivated hygienists. The Japan Dental Hygienists’ Association has conducted a survey on their working environments every five years since 1981. Questionnaires were sent to all members of the association (16,113) and 8932 answers were returned. The data of 3807 active dental hygienists who worked at clinics were analyzed. Items associated with job satisfaction were derived from two latent variables, namely, the intrinsic psychosocial factors for the value of the work and extrinsic employment advantage. Based on the structural equation modeling, the association of value was higher than that of advantage. Most of the hygienists wished to continue working as dental hygienists. More than 60% felt their work required a high level of expertise. The value of the profession is deeply rooted in job satisfaction, motivation, and job retention of Japanese dental hygienists. Working environments where dental hygienists make great use of their specialized skills can lead to high career retention which prevent them from taking career breaks.","['Job Satisfaction', 'Dental Hygienist', 'Working Environments', 'Daily Tasks', 'Career Retention']","['Dental Medicine', 'Tsurumi University', 'University School', 'Ethics Committee', 'approval number', 'Ethics', 'Medicine', 'Helsinki', 'Committee', 'Tsurumi']",['1837)'],NaN

Recurrent candidosis is under debate as a contributor to preterm birth, and vertical transmission may cause diaper dermatitis and oral thrush in the newborn. Apart from cultural methods, the gold standard for diagnosing candidosis is Gram staining, which is time-consuming and requires laboratory facilities. The objective of this prospective study was to validate a point-of-care vaginal yeast detection assay ( SavvyCheck ™  Vaginal Yeast Test ) and to evaluate it in asymptomatic pregnant women. We enrolled 200 participants, 100 of whom had vulvovaginal candidosis according to Gram stain (study group) and 100 were healthy pregnant controls (control group). Of these, 22 participants (11%) had invalid test results. The point-of-care test of the remaining 85 and 93 study participants in the study and control groups, respectively, showed a sensitivity of 94.1%, specificity of 98.9%, positive predictive value of 90.3%, and negative predictive value of 99.4% when compared with Gram stain. In conclusion, we found a high correlation between the  SavvyCheck ™  Vaginal Yeast Test  and Gram-stained smears during pregnancy.

Very little data exist on the attitudes and views of health professionals on providing nutrition care to this patient cohort delivered by electronic health methods. COVID-19 has fast-tracked the adoption of digital health care provision, so it is more important than ever to understand the needs of health professionals in providing health care via these modes. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of health professionals on providing nutrition care to upper gastrointestinal cancer patients by electronic methods to allow the future scaling-up of acceptable delivery methods. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and recorded, de-identified and transcribed. Thematic analysis was facilitated by NVivo Pro 12. Results Interviews were conducted on 13 health professionals from a range of disciplines across several public and private health institutions. Thematic analysis revealed three main themes: (1) the ideal model, (2) barriers to the ideal model and (3) how to implement and translate the ideal model. Health professionals viewed the provision of nutrition interventions as an essential part of an upper gastrointestinal cancer patient's treatment with synchronous, telephone-based internal health service models of nutrition care overwhelmingly seen as the most acceptable model of delivery. Mobile application-based delivery methods were deemed too challenging for the current population serviced by these clinicians. Conclusion The use of novel technology for delivering nutrition care to people receiving treatment for upper gastrointestinal cancers was not widely accepted as the preferred method of delivery by health professionals.

Materials and Methods : Parallel surveys were undertaken in Italy, Latvia, and the UK. There were 88 completed responses from Italy, 75 from Latvia, and 448 from the UK. To facilitate comparisons, 95% confidence intervals were calculated in respect of responses to questions from all three countries. To explore to what extent general practitioners (GPs) manage ME/CFS disease, a separate questionnaire for GPs, with questions about the criteria for granting a diagnosis, laboratory examinations, the involvement of specialists, and methods of treatment, was undertaken in Latvia, and there were 91 completed responses from GPs.

Most of the 302 respondents (school-leavers  n  = 147, university students  n  = 155) did not use analgesics frequently. School-leavers deferred to parents for analgesic information, while university students preferred the internet. The majority of respondents appeared safety conscious and did not take outside indicated use or instructions. However, a small proportion reported taking analgesics for an inappropriate indication. The difference in preferred source of analgesic information may reflect experience with analgesic use, increasing autonomy or decreased parental influence. Whilst it is encouraging that the majority of young adults appeared safety conscious, greater insight is needed into factors influencing decision making on OTC use, e.g., medicines knowledge, and changes with increasing age.","['Safety', 'Analgesics', 'risk', 'Young Adults', 'Attitudes', 'Non-prescription', 'Over The Counter']",[],[],NaN

Disease exacerbation is thought to be regulated via double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated signaling of proinflammatory and host defense responses in airway epithelial cells. Despite the central role of dsRNA in regulating host cell responses, no method for the quantitative assessment of dsRNA levels during HRV infections has been developed. Conventional RT-PCR for the negative strand template is not effective as self-priming results in apparent signals, even in the absence of primer during reverse transcription. To avoid these issues, we developed a selective assay for the negative strand template that uses a chimeric primer containing a 5' non-viral sequence for reverse transcription and a primer using the non-viral sequence during subsequent PCR. We established that this assay avoided issues of self-priming and is strand specific, as it is unaffected even in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of positive strand. Assays in primary human airway epithelial cells showed that negative strand was detectable within 6 h of virus exposure and peaked at 18 h after virus exposure. The temporal pattern of negative strand induction mirrored that of genomic RNA but was always 1000-fold lower than positive strand, indicating that the negative strand levels regulate levels of dsRNA formation. This assay will permit relative quantification of dsRNA during studies of HRV regulation of epithelial cell function.","['viral replication', 'Rhinovirus', 'airway epithelium', 'Negative Strand']",[],[],NaN

This study presents the results from a psychiatric helpline for older adults in Mannheim, Germany, during the lockdown, set up to provide information and psychosocial support. We aim to elucidate the needs of older adults, their reported changes, and the psychological impact during the initial stages of the health crisis. Methods A total of 55 older adults called the psychiatric helpline between April and June 2020. Information on demographics, medical and psychiatric history. as well as changes in daily life due to the pandemic was collected anonymously. Mental health status was assessed using the 7-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-7) and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). Results Most callers were women, older adults ( M  = 74.69 years), single, and retired. In total, 69% of callers reported new or an increase in psychiatric symptoms, with anxiety and depressive symptoms being the most common ones. Age was significantly negatively correlated to higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of a psychiatric disease reported significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those without a diagnosis. Conclusion In older adults, the perceived psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis appears to ameliorate with age. Individuals with a history of psychiatric disease are most vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes. Rapid response in the form of a geriatric helpline is a useful initiative to support the psychosocial needs of older adults during a health crisis.","['Quarantine', 'Depression', 'Elderly', 'Anxiety', 'Psychological Impact', 'Hotline', 'Covid-19']","['Participate Informed', 'Informed consent', 'Anxiety Scale', 'Consent', 'Hamilton Depression', 'Cultural studies', 'Heidelberg', 'faculty Mannheim', 'University', 'Participate']",[],NaN

Participants completed several questionnaires regarding their job performance, achievement motivations, coping styles, and transformational leadership. Multilevel mediation effects were tested using cross-level path analysis. The result of this study indicated that transformational leadership was applied well in Chinese medical settings with a score of 101.56 ± 6.42. The hierarchical linear model showed that transformational leadership had a cross-level direct positive effect on physicians' performance (β = 1.524,  p  < 0.05). Furthermore, results of cross-level path analyses revealed that transformational leadership contributed to physicians' performance by sequentially influencing achievement motivations first and then coping styles. In addition, the path ""transformational leadership → positive coping (PC) style → physicians' performance"" showed the strongest cross-level indirect effect. In summary, public health leaders should enhance physicians' performance by promoting individual development, especially achievement motivation and PC style.","['Health care', 'Coping Styles', 'Transformational Leadership', 'Physicians’ Performance', 'Achievement Motivations']","['Medical University', 'Harbin Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'University', 'human participants', 'Ethics']",[],NaN
829,C:\Users\shweata\ethics_statement_2000_generic\PMC8006508\eupmc_result.json,PMC8006508,"Evaluating Ethical Risks: Probability and Severity But there is also a second problem here—cryptographers have cast doubt on the claim that decentralised systems are in fact inherently safe, as it is not central storage of data alone that entails risks of breaches (Ahmed et al.,  2020; Vaudenay,  2020). Rather, they argue that different systems entail risks of  different kinds of breaches. While a chief concern raised against centralised systems is that a malicious authority might access information on the government-administered, central server and identify users and their contacts, thus revealing the social graph, a problem with decentralised systems is that, because users’ ephemeral identifiers are stored on their phones, access to an individual’s phone would reveal more information than in a centralised system. Vaudenay suggests, for example, that in a decentralised system, “after a burglary during which a Bluetooth sensor captured an ephemeral identifier, suspects could have their phones inspected for two weeks to find evidence” (2020, p.6). Vaudenay notes, in addition, that an individual’s smartphone is much easier to hack than a central server. Furthermore, decentralised systems are more vulnerable to breaches that would identify infected users. This is because all of a user’s ephemeral identifiers are uploaded to a central server when they report as infected. Because these identifiers are accessible to any user of the app, it is possible for any user to identify infected users, by recording a user’s identifiers and later comparing them to the identifiers stored on the server (Tang,  2020). If neither centralised nor decentralised systems are inherently safe, but rather entail risks for different kinds of breaches, how should these risks be traded off against each other? It might at first glance seem that preventing the risk of a major fire—that is, revealing the social graph—is more important than preventing the risk of small fires—identifying single infected users, and thus that concerning the risks of privacy breaches, decentralised systems are clearly preferable to centralised systems. However, it is not clear whether this is true. According to standard usage in professional risk analysis, “risk” refers to the expectation value of an unwanted event, that is, the product of the probability of that event happening and a measure of its severity, or “disvalue” (Hansson,  2004, p. 10). Adopting this notion for the comparison of the risks of different kinds of breaches, there are two dimensions that must be compared here, namely the probability of the breaches happening, and their severity, respectively. As to their  severity, it might appear from outside that the disvalue from revealing the social graph is more severe than that of single infected persons being identified. However, users who are concerned about being identified in this way if infected may come to the opposite conclusion. This is backed up by empirical evidence; a survey conducted by Li et al. ( 2020) suggests that users are more concerned by the privacy vulnerabilities of a decentralised system, and would be more likely to use a centralised app, based largely on concerns about privacy. In this study (in which, notably, they assumed that users would be directly identifiable by central authorities in a centralised system, rather than being issued a pseudonymous identifier), some of those surveyed considered government authorities trustworthy and were willing to provide their information to them, while expressing concerns about the vulnerabilities of the decentralised system to leak information to tech-savvy individuals. Others expressed concerns about privacy violations in both systems, but regarded the vulnerabilities of decentralised systems as “a more severe threat” (2020, p.20). How, then, do the  probabilities of the different kinds of breaches happening compare? In decentralised systems, the probabilities of breaches appear to be high, because any user could in principle identify infected users in the manner described above; in contrast, breaches in centralised systems would be very difficult to achieve, and would probably require a malicious government authority to store additional information as an app user registers, which would make identification possible (Vaudenay,  2020). Thus, concerning the likelihood of breaches, centralised systems may have an advantage over decentralised ones. Thus, when we compare the risks of the different kinds of breaches, it is not clear whether decentralised systems display an advantage on the severity dimension, while centralised systems exhibit a clear advantage on the likelihood dimension. Equipped with these results, we can now turn to the overall ethical evaluation of the two kinds of digital contact tracing options. There are two substantive kinds of ethical risks involved here: risks for privacy, and risks for public health if the contact tracing effort turns out to be ineffective. Some have argued that the risks for privacy may be acceptable if an app is an effective means of achieving public health benefits (Ranisch et al.,  2020; Schaefer & Ballantyne,  2020). These two kinds of ethical risks are, however, difficult to trade off against each other, or might even appear incommensurable, and any particular claim about how they might compare will likely be subject to criticism. Rather than directly comparing the benefits and risks for public health and privacy, we merely draw on the principle that other things being equal, the higher the likelihood of a system being effective in bringing about public health benefits, the higher the level of risks for privacy that should be regarded as acceptable. Thus, because the likelihood of centralised systems being effective is higher, other things being equal, a higher level of risks for privacy may be acceptable. In other words, to possibly outweigh the risks for public health, the privacy risks in decentralised systems would have to be clearly much lower than those inherent in centralised systems, as might be the case if decentralised systems were to fare much better on both risk dimensionsâ€”that is, if the severity of possible breaches were clearly lower and their likelihood were lower, too. But we have argued that this is not the case. Because the overall ethical risks from centralised systems are thus lower, they should be regarded as an ethically preferable alternative to decentralised systems.","At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, high hopes were placed on digital contact tracing. Digital contact tracing apps can now be downloaded in many countries, but as further waves of COVID-19 tear through much of the northern hemisphere, these apps are playing a less important role in interrupting chains of infection than anticipated. We argue that one of the reasons for this is that most countries have opted for decentralised apps, which cannot provide a means of rapidly informing users of likely infections while avoiding too many false positive reports. Centralised apps, in contrast, have the potential to do this. But policy making was influenced by public debates about the right app configuration, which have tended to focus heavily on privacy, and are driven by the assumption that decentralised apps are ""privacy preserving by design"". We show that both types of apps are in fact vulnerable to privacy breaches, and, drawing on principles from safety engineering and risk analysis, compare the risks of centralised and decentralised systems along two dimensions, namely the probability of possible breaches and their severity. We conclude that a centralised app may in fact minimise overall ethical risk, and contend that we must reassess our approach to digital contact tracing, and should, more generally, be cautious about a myopic focus on privacy when conducting ethical assessments of data technologies.","['efficacy', 'risk', 'Privacy', 'Data Ethics', 'Covid-19', 'Digital Contact Tracing']","['decentralised systems', 'systems', 'Risks', 'decentralised', 'breaches', 'centralised', 'Ethical Risks', 'users', 'privacy', 'system']",[],NaN

To this end, the Oral C-peptide Minimal Model (OCMM) can be used. This usually requires fixing C-peptide (CP) kinetics to the ones derived from the Van Cauter population model (VCPM), which has never been validated in PHH individuals. The objective of this work was to test the validity of the OCMM coupled with the VCPM in PHH subjects and propose a method to overcome the observed limitations. Two cohorts of adults with PHH after gastric bypass (GB) underwent either a 75 g oral glucose (9F/3M; age=42±9 y; BMI=28.3±6.9 kg/m 2 ) or a 60 g mixed-meal (7F/3M; age = 43 ± 11 y; BMI=27.5±4.2 kg/m 2 ) tolerance test. The OCMM was identified on CP concentration data with CP kinetics fixed to VCPM (VC approach). In both groups, the VC approach underestimated CP-peak and overestimated CP-tail suggesting CP kinetics predicted by VCPM to be inaccurate in this population. Thus, the OCMM was identified using CP kinetics estimated from the data (DB approach) using a Bayesian Maximum a Posteriori estimator. CP data were well predicted in all the subjects using the DB approach, highlighting a significantly faster CP kinetics in patients with PHH compared to the one predicted by VCPM. Finally, a simulation study was used to validate the proposed approach. The present findings question the applicability of the VCPM in patients with PHH after GB and call for CP bolus experiments to develop a reliable CP kinetic model in this population.","['Obesity', 'Parameter estimation', 'insulin secretion', 'Ogtt', 'Oral Minimal Model', 'Model Identification', 'Mixed Meal']","['Ethikommission Bern', 'Kantonale Ethikommission', 'Ethikkommission Nordwest', 'und Zentralschweiz', 'Switzerland', 'Ethics Statement', 'Local ethics', 'Bern', 'studies involving', 'involving human']",[],NaN

Unlike adolescent motherhood, limited public health programs are working on adolescent fatherhood. Currently, in developed countries, there is an increased work to acknowledge teen fathers in clinical practice and in the research forum, but still, there are more issues that need to be addressed in developing countries including Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of adolescent fatherhood in Ethiopia based on the nationally representative survey. Methods This study used the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. A total weighted sample of 4455 adolescent men was included for the final analysis. For the associated factors, multilevel logistic regression analysis was conducted to consider the hierarchical nature of the EDHS data. Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and deviance (-2LLR) were used for model comparison and for assessing model fitness.

This study was conducted to assess the concerns faced by the medical students about their professional life due to the disrupted educational activities and related psychological effects.  Methods:  This is a cross-sectional survey study, conducted with self-administered questionnaires on Bezmialem Vakif University medical students, during the pandemic. The questionnaire consists of queries about demographics, environmental factors, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scales.  Results:  A total of 178 students participated in the study, with a female-to-male ratio of 5:2. Of the total respondents, 19.7% were experiencing severe anxiety, 17.4% moderate anxiety, and 37.1% mild anxiety, according to the GAD-7; and 13.5% of the respondents were experiencing severe depression, 21.9% moderate-severe depression, and 23% mild depression according to the PHQ-9. There was no statistically significant difference between the grades in terms of GAD-7 or PHQ-9 scores. Male participants were more likely to have suicidal thoughts ( p  = 0.013). According to our study, the factors with the highest influence on students were as follows: ""Major changes in personal life,"" ""Disruption in educational activities,"" and ""Covid-19 related anxiety of loss of relatives and contamination or infection."" On average, women voted higher points for ""Covid-19 related anxiety of loss of relatives and contamination.""  Conclusions:  We found that a significant portion of students regardless of their year in medical school were profoundly affected by the pandemic process as is shown by their anxiety and depression scores. The disruption in educational activities is one of the main factors of these effects, and we believe that these should not be ignored, as they could in the future lead to a series of problems for medical education and students alike.","['Depression', 'Anxiety', 'Education', 'Medical Students', 'Covid-19']","['Bezmialem Vakif', 'Vakif University', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'University Non-Interventional', 'Non-Interventional Research', 'ethics approval', 'Ethics', 'Committee']",[],NaN

The major bacterial cause of COPD exacerbations is non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). 25 to over 80% of cases are associated with NTHi. This susceptibility to infection involves a defective production of interleukin (IL)-22 which plays an important role in mucosal defense. Prophylactic administration of flagellin, a Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist, protects healthy mice against respiratory pathogenic bacteria. We hypothesized that TLR5-mediated stimulation of lung immunity might prevent COPD exacerbations. Mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke (CS), which presented COPD symptoms, were infected with NTHi and intraperitoneally treated with recombinant flagellin following a prophylactic or therapeutic protocol. Compared with control, cigarette smoke-exposed mice treated with flagellin showed a lower bacterial load in the airways, the lungs and the blood. This protection was associated with an early neutrophilia, a lower production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increased IL-22 production. Flagellin treatment decreased the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the lung damages related to exacerbation. Morover, the protective effect of flagellin against NTHi was altered by treatment with anti-IL-22 blocking antibodies in cigarette smoke-exposed mice and in Il22-/- mice. The effect of flagellin treatment did not implicated the anti-bacterial peptides calgranulins and defensin-β2.

Later, SARS-CoV-2 infections in mink were reported in many European and North American countries. Material and methods Samples from 590 mink from a total of 28 farms were tested by real-time RT-PCR. Whole genome sequences from one positive farm were generated and genetic relatedness was established. Results SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on a breeder farm with stock of 5,850 mink. Active viraemia was confirmed in individually tested samples with Ct values respectively between 19.4 and 29.6 for E and N gene fragments. Further testing of samples from culled animals revealed 70% positivity in throat swabs and 30% seropositivity in blood samples. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length nucleotide sequences of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates revealed that they belong to the 20B Nextstrain clade. Several nucleotide mutations were found in analysed samples compared to the reference Wuhan HU-1 strain and some of them were nonsynonymous.

A novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage (B.1.177) reportedly arose in Spain in the summer of 2020, with subsequent spread across Europe linked to travel by infected individuals. Surveillance and monitoring through the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers insights into the global and local movement of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and can detect introductions of novel variants.  Methods  We analysed the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 sequenced for surveillance purposes from specimens received by Public Health Ontario (Sept 6 – Oct 10, 2020), collected from individuals in eastern Ontario, which comprised the study sample. Taxonomic lineages were identified using pangolin (v2.08) and phylogenetic analysis incorporated publicly available genomes covering the same time period as the study sample. Epidemiological data collected from laboratory requisitions and standard reportable disease case investigation was integrated into the analysis.  Results  Genomic surveillance identified a COVID-19 case with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.177 from an individual in eastern Ontario in late September, 2020. The individual had recently returned from Europe. Genomic analysis with publicly available data indicate the most closely related genomes to this specimen were from Southern Europe. Genomic surveillance did not identify further cases with this lineage.  Conclusions  Genomic surveillance allowed for early detection of a novel SARS-CoV-2 lineage in Ontario which was deemed to be travel related. This type of genomic-based surveillance is a key tool to measure the effectiveness of public health measures such as mandatory self-isolation for returned travellers, aimed at preventing onward transmission of newly introduced lineages of SARS-CoV-2.","['Canada', 'Ontario', 'Whole-genome Sequencing', 'Covid-19', 'Sars-cov-2']","['PHO Laboratory', 'Review Board', 'statement PHO', 'health practice', 'PHO Ethics', 'committee review', 'describes analyses', 'routine clinical', 'clinical respiratory', 'respiratory testing']",[],NaN

Methods:  First-year medical students were randomized either to an AED with audio only or audio with additional video instructions during CPR. Each student performed 4 min of single-rescuer chest compression only BLS on a manikin (Ambu Man C, Ballerup, Denmark) using the AED. The primary outcome was the effective compression ratio during this scenario. This combined parameter was used to evaluate the quality of chest compressions by multiplying compressions with correct depth, correct hand position, and complete decompression by flow time. Secondary outcomes were percentages of incomplete decompression and hand position, mean compression rate, time-related parameters, and subjective assessments.  Results:  Effective compression ratio did not differ between study groups in the overall sample ( p  = 0.337) or in students with ( p  = 0.953) or without AED experience ( p  = 0.278). Additional video instruction led to a higher percentage of incorrect decompressions ( p  = 0.014). No significant differences could be detected in time-related resuscitation parameters. An additional video was subjectively rated as more supporting ( p  = 0.001).  Conclusions:  Audio-video instructions did not significantly improve resuscitation quality in these laypersons despite that it was felt more supportive. An additional video to the verbal AED prompts might lead to cognitive overload. Therefore, future studies might target the influence of the video content and the potential benefits of video instructions in specific populations.","['Quality', 'Resuscitation', 'Basic Life Support', 'Video Instructions', 'Automated External Defbrillator']","['Medical University', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Vienna', 'Medical', 'University', 'Austria', 'December', 'Statement', 'October']",[],NaN

Treatment stop was defined as a clinician recorded DMT end for any reason and included treatment interruptions, switching to alternate DMTs and long-term or permanent discontinuations.  Results:  The incidence of DMT stopping cross the full observation period was lowest in FTY (19.7 per 100 person-years (PY) of treatment; 95% CI 19.2-20.1), followed by NAT (22.6/100 PY; 95% CI 22.2-23.0), IFNβ (23.3/100 PY; 95% CI 23.2-23.5).

The proportion of patients continuing on most DMTs were similarly stable until 2014 and 2015 when drop from 83 to 75% was noted.  Conclusions:  DMT stopping reasons and rates were mostly stable over time with a slight increase in recent years, with the availability of more DMTs.

They are justified on the basis of the equality principle with respect to human dignity and the human rights framework [ 22,  24,  28,  30,  32,  35]. Most of the guidelines place specific attention on age, which cannot be assumed as the only criterion [ 26,  29,  33], and disability [ 24,  28,  30,  39]; these groups are considered vulnerable people, and specific attention and particular effort should be made to ensure them equal rights and treatments [ 11]. Despite this, it is important to point out that there is controversy on the age issue. For example, the Swiss ethical guideline, while declaring to avoid any discrimination based on age, uses the age limit as an exclusion criteria in certain situation [ 33]. The Belgian document states that age in isolation cannot be used for triage decisions, but should be integrated with other clinical parameters: frailty and reduced cognition. They are specifically described as ‘independent predictors of outcome when elderly patients are admitted to the ICU’, but, as mentioned above, they would be effective only in combination with age [ 29]. Ethical aspects of communication and triage management Transparency, reasonableness, inclusiveness, openness and the uniform application of triage criteria at the different levels of care are important reference principles to ensure the non-arbitrariness of the final decision [ 11,  22,  25,  26,  37]. Procedures for decision making should respect human dignity [ 11], and clinicians should act with honesty and integrity [ 38]. The involvement of health care professionals not directly involved in the provision of intensive care is also underlined to mitigate the negative effects of pressure on doctors and teams [ 25], and a collective decision made by an ad hoc medical committee is often required [ 34,  36,  39]. An on-going revision of the guidelines, triage criteria and decisions is also a reiterated aspect to ensure that the best possible treatments are always guaranteed to each patient [ 36,  37]. Need of ethical support Since these are very difficult decisions, the presence of local ethics committees, ethicists, or any other form of support, including psychological, aimed at managing and reducing the moral distress of health care professionals [ 21,  25,  28â€“ 30,  32,  34,  36,  37], is considered as an important aid for distributing and strengthening their sense of responsibility, applying ethical guidelines in their daily practice and, finally, making difficult decisions and facing direct dilemmas, especially in those extremely complex situations where suspension of already initiated treatments is required. Ethical guidelines have also noted that the application of a structured decision-making process and the identification of the persons responsible for the decision are fundamental to guarantee the patient, his family members and the community itself the trust pact and alliance on which the relationship of care is based and that the current emergency could dramatically corrupt [ 21]."," Background Under COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations developed guidelines to deal with the ethical aspects of resources allocation. This study describes the results of an argument-based review of ethical guidelines developed at the European level. It aims to increase knowledge and awareness about the moral relevance of the outbreak, especially as regards the balance of equity and dignity in clinical practice and patient's care. Method According to the argument-based review framework, we started our research from the following two questions: what are the ethical principles adopted by the ethical guidelines produced at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak related to resource allocation? And what are the practical consequences in terms of 'priority' of access, access criteria, management of the decision-making process and patient care? Results Twenty-two ethical guidelines met our inclusion criteria and the results of our analysis are organized into 4 ethical concepts and related arguments: the equity principle and emerging ethical theories; triage criteria; respecting patient's dignity, and decision making and quality of care. Conclusion Further studies can investigate the practical consequences of the application of the guidelines described, in terms of quality of care and health care professionals' moral distress.","['Ethics', 'Human Dignity', 'Allocation Of Health Care Resources', 'Covid-19 Pandemic']","['Ethically unacceptable', 'unacceptable criteria', 'sexual orientation', 'political vision', 'age', 'unacceptable', 'Ethically', 'guidelines report', 'guidelines', 'criteria']",[],NaN

Here, we report the results. Methods Between July 2015 and August 2017, diaphragm reconstruction using 2-mm GORE DUALMESH was performed in 7 patients undergoing surgical resection for thoracic malignancies. After resection of the diaphragm, the mesh was trimmed to the size of defect and placed with the smooth surface facing the chest cavity and the rough surface facing the abdomen. It was fixed with interrupted sutures consisting of synthetic monofilament nonabsorbable 1-0 to 2 threads. Results Indications for resection were malignant pleural mesothelioma and primary lung cancer in 5 and 2 patients, respectively. Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma underwent pleurectomy with decortication; patients with primary lung cancer underwent lung lobectomy. Right and left diaphragm reconstruction was performed for 4 and 3 patients, respectively. Neither complications related to diaphragm reconstruction nor displacement of mesh occurred during a follow-up period ranging from 11 days to 37 months. Conclusions GORE DUALMESH is a good synthetic material for diaphragm reconstruction, because its smooth surface prevents adhesions to the lung and its rough surface allows adherence to abdominal tissue.","['Diaphragm', 'Lung cancer', 'Reconstruction', 'Prosthesis', 'Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma']",[],[],NaN

Usually such circulation is associated with low systemic vascular resistance or arteriovenous malformation (AVM), resulting in depressurized circulation and a high-output cardiac state. Treating physicians should be cognizant of such pathology when investigating patients with heart failure. As an example, renal arteriovenous malformations are a rare vascular phenomena that are typically the result of iatrogenic, traumatic or congenital etiology. Generally, non-salient, most are detected as an incidental finding.

Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional study of 509 adults aged more than 18 years. From all the four subdistricts, two grampanchayats (administrative cluster of 5-8 villages) were randomly selected followed by one village through convenience. The participants were invited for the study to the community-based study kiosk set up in all the eight villages through village health committees. We collected socio-demographic characteristics and symptoms using a mobile application-based questionnaire, and we tested samples for the presence of IgG antibodies for SARS CoV-2 using an electro chemiluminescent immunoassay. We calculated age-gender adjusted and test performance adjusted seroprevalence. Results The age-and gender-adjusted seroprevalence was 8.5% (95% CI 6.9%- 10.8%). The unadjusted seroprevalence among participants with hypertension and diabetes was 16.3% (95% CI:9.2-25.8) and 10.7% (95% CI: 5.5-18.3) respectively. When we adjusted for the test performance, the seroprevalence was 6.1% (95% CI 4.02-8.17). The study estimated 7 (95% CI 1:4.5-1:9) undetected infected individuals for every RT-PCR confirmed case.

Community participation is assumed to contribute to quality improvement and goal attainment but remains elusive. We examined the implementation of community participation, through collaborative governance in primary health care facilities in Uasin Gishu County, Western Kenya, under the policy of devolved governance of 2013. Methods Utilizing a multiple case study methodology, five primary health care facilities were purposively selected. Study participants were individuals involved in the collaborative governance of primary health care facilities (from health service providers and community members), including in decision-making, management, oversight, service provision and problem solving. Data were collected through document review, key informant interviews and observations undertaken from 2017 to 2018. Audio recording, notetaking and a reflective journal aided data collection. Data were transcribed, cleaned, coded and analysed iteratively into emerging themes using a governance attributes framework. Findings A total of 60 participants representing individual service providers and community members participated in interviews and observations. The minutes of all meetings of five primary health care facilities were reviewed for three years (2014-2016) and eight health facility committee meetings were observed. Findings indicate that in some cases, structures for collaborative community engagement exist but functioning is ineffective for a number of reasons. Health facility committee meetings were most frequent when there were project funds, with discussions focusing mainly on construction projects as opposed to the day-to-day functioning of the facility. Committee members with the strongest influence and power had political connections or were retired government workers. There were no formal mechanisms for stakeholder forums and how these worked were unclear. Drug stock outs, funding delays and unclear operational guidelines affected collaborative governance performance. Conclusion Implementing collaborative governance effectively requires that the scope of focus for collaboration include both specific projects and the routine functioning of the primary health care facility by the health facility committee. In the study area, structures are required to manage effective stakeholder engagement.",[],"['Ethics Committee', 'Moi University', 'Ethics Ethics', 'Moi Teaching', 'Research Ethics', 'Referral Hospital', 'Hospital Institutional', 'Institutional Review', 'Human Research', 'Ethics approval']",[],NaN

Many approaches combine the established benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonism with one or more additional molecules with the aim of improving metabolic outcomes. Recent attention has been drawn to the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) system due to compelling pre-clinical evidence describing the metabolic benefits of antagonising the GIP receptor (GIPR). We rationalised that benefit might be accrued from combining GIPR antagonism with GLP-1 agonism. Two GIPR peptide antagonists, GIPA-1 (mouse GIP(3-30)NH2) and GIPA-2 (NαAc-K10[γEγE-C16]-Arg18-hGIP(5-42)), were pharmacologically characterised and both exhibited potent antagonist properties. Acute in vivo administration of GIPA-1 during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) had negligible effects on glucose tolerance and insulin in lean mice. In contrast, GIPA-2 impaired glucose tolerance and attenuated circulating insulin levels. A mouse model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) was used to investigate the potential metabolic benefits of chronic dosing of each antagonist, alone or in combination with liraglutide. Chronic administration studies showed expected effects of liraglutide, lowering food intake, body weight, fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations while improving glucose sensitivity, whereas delivery of either GIPR antagonist alone had negligible effects on these parameters. Interestingly, chronic dual therapy augmented insulin sensitizing effects and lowered plasma triglycerides and free-fatty acids, with more notable effects observed with GIPA-1 compared to GIPA-2. Thus, the co-administration of both a GIPR antagonist with a GLP1 agonist uncovers interesting beneficial effects on measures of insulin sensitivity, circulating lipids and certain adipose stores that seem influenced by the degree or nature of GIP receptor antagonism.",[],[],[],NaN

Almost all operations will go through the anesthesia process, but it is not clear whether the intervention of anesthesia alone will affect the change in the intestinal microbiome. The purpose of this study was to verify the effect of sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia on the intestinal microbiome. The animal in the experimental group was used to provide sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia for 4 hours. The control group was not intervened. The feces of the experimental group and the control group were collected on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th days after anesthesia. Sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia will cause changes in the intestinal microbiome of mice. It appears on the 1st day after anesthesia and is most obvious on the 7th day. The specific manifestation is that the abundance of microbiome and the diversity of the microbiome is reduced. At the same time, Untargeted metabonomics showed that compared with the control group, the experimental group had more increased metabolites related to the different microbiome, among which 5-methylthioadenosine was related to the central nervous system. Subsequently, the intestinal microbiome diversity of mice showed a trend of recovery on the 14th day. At the genus level, the fecal samples obtained on the 14th day after anesthesia exhibited significantly increased abundances of Bacteroides, Alloprevotella, and Akkermansia and significantly decreased abundances of Lactobacillus compared with the samples obtained on the 1st day after anesthesia. However, the abundance of differential bacteria did not recover with the changing trend of diversity. Therefore, we believe that sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia is associated with changes in the internal microbiome and metabolites, and this change may be completed through the brain-gut axis, while sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia may change the intestinal microbiome for as long as 14 days or longer.","['16S rRNA', 'Sevoflurane', 'Gene sequencing', 'Inhalation Anesthesia', 'Intestinal Microbiome']","['Harbin Medical', 'Medical University', 'University Cancer', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Chinese Guidelines', 'Changhong Zhao', 'Statement Experiments', 'regional ethics', 'ethics board', 'project license']",['KY2018-02)'],NaN

Results : This study revealed significant elevation of the serum HO-1 concentration, iron deposition within bilateral substantial nigra (SN), red nucleus (RN), and putamen (PUT) and decrease of HGB level in PD patients. There was a significantly positive correlation between the serum HO-1 concentration and iron deposition within SN, an inverse correlation between the serum HO-1 concentration and HGB level in PD patients. A significant increase in HO-1 expression of serum and iron deposition in SN was also observed in the PD mouse model, and the SnPP could significantly reduce iron deposition in the SN.  Conclusions : The high level of HO-1 may be the common mechanism of iron deposition and low HGB in PD.

Results:  In the Markov model, compared with RTX, rhTPO+RTX yielded an additional 0.04 QALYs, with an incremental cost of 2,802 USD. The ICER was 69,097 USD/QALY. According to the results from the one-way sensitivity analysis, complete response of rhTPO+RTX, utility of complete response and response of RTX were the main drivers in the model. The results from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that there was a 100% probability that rhTPO+RTX was not cost-effective vs. RTX alone at a threshold of $10,805/QALY and an 84% probability at a threshold of $32,415/QALY.  Conclusion:  RTX+rhTPO was not more cost-effective than RTX alone as second-line treatment for adult patients with immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura in China.","['Markov model', 'Rituximab', 'Cost-effectiveness (Ce)', 'Rhtpo', 'Immunologic Thrombocytopenic Purpura']","['Ethics Statement', 'Clinical Inputs', 'Engauge Digitizer', 'published trial', 'Digitizer software', 'previously published', 'reconstructed data', 'medical records', 'Section Clinical', 'published literatures']",[],NaN

Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying its initiation and progression is critical for establishing the most appropriate treatment strategies. We found that urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU1) was upregulated and associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC. Silencing of PLAU1 inhibited the proliferation, colony-formation, migration, and invasion abilities of HNSCC cells  in vitro  and reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), whereas PLAU1 overexpression significantly enhanced the growth, the colony-formation, migration, and invasion abilities, and the xenograft tumor growth of HNSCC cells  in vivo  and increased the expression of MMP1. The Co-IP assay verified that PLAU1 interacted with MMP1. A positive correlation between PLAU1 and MMP1 expression was observed in HNSCC samples. si-RNAs against MMP1 reversed the aggressive effects of PLAU1 overexpression in HNSCC. Taken together, our data revealed that PLAU1 facilitated HNSCC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis  via  interaction with MMP1.","['Invasion', 'Metastasis', 'Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Mmp1', 'Plau1']","['Xiangya Hospital', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Hospital', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Committee']",[],NaN

Compared to other biomedical technologies, xenotransplantation stands out in terms of its involvement of animals as graft sources, as well as the possible transmission of infectious diseases. As these aspects are especially relevant for potential xenotransplantation recipients, it is important to assess their opinion regarding this technology, in particular in terms of the requirements that should be met in the informed consent process for xenotransplantation. Methods We conducted qualitative interviews with seven T1DM patients to assess their information needs prior to xenotransplantation. Before the interview, the participants received a model informed consent form for a clinical trial with porcine islet cells transplantation. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results In the interviews, we identified several requirements that are crucial for patients with T1DM in order to consider xenotransplantation as a potential treatment option: therapy-related requirements, professional care and supervision, successful behaviour and attitude management, improving quality of life, and managing control/self-determination challenges. Regarding the informed consent form, several of the participants' questions remained open and should be addressed in more detail. The interviewees stressed the importance of personal consultations. Conclusions To become a sustainable therapeutic option, patients especially expected an improved diabetes control and a reduction of diabetes-related burdens. Health-related aspects prove to be pivotal for diabetic patients when considering porcine islet cell transplantation.

We aimed to explore the seroprevalence of hospital staff in the area with zero confirmed COVID-19 case to shed light on the situation of COVID-19 infection in zero or low infection rate countries where mass screening was not readily available. Methods A locally developed rapid immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin G (IgG) test kit was used for hospital staff screening of Ranong hospital which is located in a province with zero COVID-19 prevalence in Thailand from 17th April to 17th May 2020. All staff was tested, 100 of which were randomly invited to have a repeating antibody test in one month. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002). Results Of 844 hospital staff, 82 were tested twice one month apart (response rate for repeating antibody test 82%). Overall, 0.8% of the participants (7 of 844) had positive IgM, none had positive IgG. Female staff had 1.0% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.5-2.1%) while male had 0.5% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.1-2.6%). No participants with a history of travel to the high-risk area or close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among 844 staff, 811 had no symptoms and six of them developed IgM seropositive (0.7%) while 33 had minor symptoms and only one of them developed IgM seropositive (3.0%). No association between SARS-CoV-2 IgM status and gender, history of travel to a high-risk area, close contact with PCR-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case, presence of symptoms within 14 days, or previous PCR status was found.

To evaluate the analgesic effects of AC, 4 different pain models including hot plate assay, acetic acid writhing assay, formalin and CFA induced pain models were adopted in this study. In hot plate experiment, AC treatment at concentration of 0.3 mg/kg and 0.9 mg/kg improved the pain thresholds of mice similar to the positive drug aspirin at the concentration of 200 mg/kg (17.12% and 20.27% VS 19.21%). In acetic acid writhing experiment, AC significantly reduced the number of mice writhing events caused by acetic acid, and the inhibition rates were 68% and 76%. These results demonstrated that AC treatment revealed significant analgesic effects in both acute thermal stimulus pain model and chemically-induced visceral pain model.

Evidence has shown differences in the functions and fates of MDSCs in the tumor tissue and the periphery. However, the exact mechanism that regulates MDSC function has not been completely clarified. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing of MDSCs derived from the spleen and tumor. Based on the results of our RNA-seq analysis, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) were significantly increased in tumor polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) and monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs). Subsequently, 3 major MAPK pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK), p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK), were studied to analyze the role of MAPKs in MDSCs. The ERK 1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly increased the apoptosis of both PMN-MDSCs and M-MDSCs  in vitro . In addition, SCH772984 exerted a strong effect on inhibiting tumor growth. The flow cytometry analysis showed significant increases in the ratio of M1:M2 tumor-associated macrophages, meanwhile the number of CD4 + , CD8 + , CD4 + CD69 +  and CD8 + CD69 +  lymphocytes were increased after SCH772984 treatment.

This increased risk of psychopathology is not only because of genetic vulnerability, but environmental factors may play an important role as well. The often long and debilitating mood episodes of mothers with bipolar disorder might hamper their qualities as a caregiver and may impact the child. We examined early mother-to-infant bonding 1 year postpartum in mothers with bipolar spectrum disorder as compared to mothers of the general population. The association between mother-to-infant bonding and the type of bipolar spectrum diagnosis (bipolar I, bipolar II, bipolar Not Otherwise Specified) as well as relapse within 12 months postpartum was also assessed.  Methods:  In total, 75 pregnant women with a bipolar spectrum disorder participated in the current study. The participants were included in a longitudinal cohort study of women with bipolar spectrum disorder and were prospectively followed from pregnancy until 1 year postpartum. Mother-to-infant bonding was assessed using the Pre- and Postnatal Bonding Scale. A longitudinal population-based cohort of 1,419 pregnant women served as the control group. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the association between bipolar spectrum disorder and mother-to-infant bonding scores, controlling for several confounders.  Results:  Women with bipolar spectrum disorder perceived the bonding with their child as less positive compared to the control group. The type of bipolar spectrum disorder was not associated with poorer bonding scores. Relapse during the 1st year after delivery also did not affect bonding scores in women with bipolar spectrum disorder.  Conclusions:  Our findings could imply that women with bipolar spectrum disorder are more vulnerable to impairments in bonding due to the nature of their psychopathology, regardless of the occurrence of postpartum relapse. Careful follow-up including monitoring of mother-to-infant bonding of pregnant women with a history of bipolar spectrum disorder should be a standard to this vulnerable group of women. In addition, regardless of severity and mood episode relapse, an intervention to improve bonding could be beneficial for all mothers with bipolar spectrum disorder and their newborns.","['Relapse', 'Perinatal', 'Bonding', 'Bipolar Spectrum Disorder', 'Postpartum Mania']","['Ethics Committee', 'Medical Center', 'Erasmus University', 'Tilburg University', 'Ethics Statement', 'University Medical', 'Medical Ethics', 'Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human']",[],NaN

Some cases show familial inheritance.  Case report:  A female patient (from a gravida 1, para 1 mother) of 3.5 years of age was admitted to the Pediatric Hematology Department of Xianyang Caihong Hospital in June 2019. The patient had severe anemia, acupoint-size bleeding spots, and a few ecchymoses all over her body, as well as astigmatism and hyperopia. Hearing was normal. The patient had diabetes. Bone marrow biopsy suggested a myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient had a c.515G>A (p.G172D) homozygous mutation of  SLC19A2  (NM_006996), indicating TRMA. Genetic testing revealed that the two alleles were inherited from her mother alone due to maternal uniparental isodisomy (UPD).

The aim of the study was to investigate whether TMAO levels are different in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic cerebrovascular atherosclerosis.  Methods:  This was a prospective, case-control study, conducted at a tertiary care university hospital. Patients were included if they had large-artery atherosclerosis (TOAST criteria). Symptomatic patients with ischemic stroke were compared with asymptomatic patients. As primary endpoint, TMAO levels on admission were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Univariable analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney  U  test and multivariable analysis using binary logistic regression. TMAO values were adjusted for glomerular filtration rate (GFR), age, and smoking.  Results:  Between 2018 and 2020, 82 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were recruited. Median age was 70 years; 65% were male. Comparing symptomatic ( n  = 42) and asymptomatic ( n  = 40) patients, no significant differences were found in univariable analysis in TMAO [3.96 (IQR 2.30-6.73) vs. 5.36 (3.59-8.68) μmol/L;  p  = 0.055], GFR [87 (72-97) vs. 82 (71-90) ml/min * 1.73 m 2 ;  p  = 0.189] and age [71 (60-79) vs. 69 (67-75) years;  p  = 0.756]. In multivariable analysis, TMAO was not a predictor of symptomatic cerebrovascular disease after adjusting for age and GFR [OR 1.003 (95% CI: 0.941-1.070);  p  = 0.920]. In a sensitivity analysis, we only analyzed patients with symptomatic stenosis and excluded patients with occlusion of brain-supplying arteries. Again, TMAO was not a significant predictor of symptomatic stenosis [OR 1.039 (0.965-1.120),  p  = 0.311].

Results A total of 52 participants were included, with 48, 45 and 37 of them completing the first, second and third round of the survey respectively. Consensus was reached for 115 of the 125 statements on HDP definition, screening, management and long-term follow-up. Agreement scores for the statements ranged from 70.8-100.0%, and potential implementation barriers of the pathways were identified. Drafts of HDP management pathways were also agreed upon and received suggestions from the participants. Conclusions Most evidence-based management recommendations achieved consensus and were included in the developed HDP management pathways, which can potentially be implemented in Indonesian settings. Further investigations are needed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the developed HDP pathways in primary care practice.","['Management', 'Indonesia', 'Pathways', 'Preeclampsia', 'Primary Care', 'Delphi Survey', 'Hypertensive Disorders Of Pregnancy']",[],[],NaN

Two H3Africa documents suggested that ethics committees in various African countries may be inadequately equipped to review GGR, and experts may need to be consulted by ethics committees to support review processes [ 13,  14]. This was connected back to the need for capacity strengthening, but in this case with a focus on the training needs of research ethics committees [ 13]. Additionally, five documents, including three national documents, indicated that there must be ethics review and approval in order to conduct secondary analyses of samples [ 13,  27,  28,  32,  37]."," Background Genetics and genomics research (GGR) is increasingly being conducted around the world; yet, researchers and research oversight entities in many countries have struggled with ethical challenges. A range of ethics and regulatory issues need to be addressed through comprehensive policy frameworks that integrate with local environments. While important efforts have been made to enhance understanding and awareness of ethical dimensions of GGR in Africa, including through the H3Africa initiative, there remains a need for in-depth policy review, at a country-level, to inform and stimulate local policy development and revision on the continent. Methods To identify and characterize existing ethics-related guidelines and laws applicable to GGR across much of Africa, we conducted a scoping review of English language policy documents identified through databases, repositories, and web searches. Thirty-six documents were included and coded using a framework that contained a range of themes across five analytical categories: (1) respect, (2) beneficence, (3) justice, (4) independent oversight, and (5) bans and prohibitions. Data analysis software (NVivo 12) was used to organize, code, and tabulate information according to document characteristics and topics. Illustrative examples of policy requirements were selected for inclusion. Results Documents that met inclusion criteria spanned 20 years; published between 1996 and 2018, with the majority (58%) published after 2009. About two-thirds were denoted as ""guidelines,"" and slightly more than half were non-exclusive to GGR. Very few (six) country-level documents identified were specific to GGR. Requirements related to the principle of ""respect"" appeared most often across all documents, relative to other principles and processes. The most commonly stated ban was on reproductive cloning. Other prohibitions applied to germline editing, undue inducements in research, sample use for commercial purposes, employee mandatory DNA testing, fetal sex selection, stem cell use, eugenics, and research without public health benefits. Conclusions Enforceable policies that are indispensable to the ethical conduct and review of GGR are either deficient or missing in many African countries. Existing international, GGR-specific ethics guidelines can be used to inform GGR policy development at a country-level, in conjunction with insight from country specific ethics committees and other local stakeholders.","['Africa', 'Ethics', 'Policies', 'Laws', 'Genetics And Genomics Research']","['frequently discussed', 'important safeguard', 'Ethics review', 'ethics committees', 'Ethics', 'review', 'review GGR', 'international documents', 'documents', 'African countries']",[],NaN

This paper aims to validate a search strategy to identify randomized clinical trials related to periodontitis. A gold standard reference set was developed to validate the identified clinical trials using the relative recall method. The choice of periodontitis is due to the fact that this disease has a high prevalence among chronic non-communicable diseases, is considered the second most common oral disease in the world, is associated with several health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and, principally, has not been investigated sufficiently to prevent possible damages resulting from it. Methods A validation study was developed in MEDLINE/PubMed. In Stage 1, a methodological filter recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration to identify randomized clinical trials was applied. Stage 2 identified articles related only to periodontitis (gold standard reference set) from among the articles retrieved using the eligibility criteria. In Stage 3, a search statement for the retrieval of periodontitis-related articles was elaborated by experts. Stage 4 defined the proposed search strategy comprising of the combination of the search statement developed with the aforementioned methodological filter and subsequent application in MEDLINE/PubMed. The obtained data were analyzed using the set of articles identified in Stage 2, as the gold standard reference set. The following performance values were calculated - sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and number needed to read - with their respective 95% confidence interval (95%CI).

Primary and secondary brain tumors are often accompanied by peritumoral edema. Due to the limited intracranial space, peritumoral edema will further increase the intracranial pressure and aggravate clinical symptoms. Radiotherapy, as a basic component of the treatment of intracranial tumors, induces blood vessel damage and aggravates brain edema. The combination of edema caused by the tumor itself and radiotherapy is collectively referred to as intractable brain edema. Edema can increase intracranial pressure and cause associated neurologic symptoms, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients. Steroids, specifically dexamethasone, have become the gold standard for the management of tumor-associated edema. However, steroids can lead to variety of adverse effects, including moon face, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, increased risk of infection, bone thinning (osteoporosis), and fractures, especially with prolonged use.

Staphylococcus aureus  is a common long-term colonizer and cause of recurrent airway infections in CF. The pathogen is also associated with respiratory allergy; especially the staphylococcal serine protease-like proteins (Spls) can induce type 2 immune responses in humans and mice. We measured the serum IgE levels specific to 7 proteases of  S. aureus  by ELISA, targeting 5 Spls (76 CF patients and 46 controls) and the staphopains A and B (16 CF patients and 46 controls). Then we compared cytokine release and phenotype of T cells that had been stimulated with Spls between 5 CF patients and 5 controls. CF patients had strongly increased serum IgE binding to all Spls but not to the staphopains. Compared to healthy controls, their Spl-stimulated T cells released more type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and more IL-6 with no difference in the secretion of type 1- or type 3 cytokines (IFNγ, IL-17A, IL-17F). IL-10 production was low in CF T cells. The phenotype of the Spl-exposed T cells shifted towards a Th2 or Th17 profile in CF but to a Th1 profile in controls. Sensitization to  S. aureus  Spls is common in CF. This discovery could explain episodes of allergic inflammation of hitherto unknown causation in CF and extend the diagnostic and therapeutic portfolio.","['Allergy', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'IgE', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Th2 Cells', 'Type 2 Immune Response']","['Ethics Committees', 'Ethics Statement', 'responsible Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Greifswald', 'IIIUV', 'human participants', 'Committees', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

Antecedent clinical insult could rarely unmask latent neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we report an autopsy-proven case of corticobasal degeneration which was preceded by a lacunar infarction. Case presentation A 58-year-old man presented with acute ataxia associated with a lacunar infarction in the right paramedian pons. His ataxia persisted with additional progressive gait difficulty and left arm clumsiness. Six months later, a follow-up neurological examination showed asymmetrical bradykinesia, apraxia, dystonic posturing, postural instability, and mild ataxia of the left limbs. Cognitive examination revealed frontal executive dysfunction and visuospatial difficulties. Dopamine transporter imaging scan demonstrated bilateral reduced uptakes in mid-to-posterior putamen, more prominent on the right side. Levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism, asymmetric limb dystonia, and ideomotor apraxia became more conspicuous, while limb ataxia gradually vanished. The patient became unable to walk without assistance after 1 year, and died 4 years after the symptom onset. Autopsy findings showed frontoparietal cortical atrophy, ballooned neurons, and phosphorylated tau-positive astrocytic plaques and neuropil threads with gliosis and neuronal loss, confirming the corticobasal degeneration.

The analysis aimed to determine the prevalence and factors which influence early antenatal booking among women of reproductive age in Tanzania. Method The study used data from the 2015-16 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicators Survey (2015-16 TDHS-MIS). A total of 6924 women of active reproductive age from 15 to 49 were included in the analysis. Both univariate and multiple regression analyses were used to determine predictors of early antenatal booking. Results Only 1586 (22.9%) of pregnant women had early antenatal booking. After adjusted for the confounders, factors which influenced early antenatal booking were age of a woman [20 to 34 years, Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.554 at 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.213-1.993, and more than 34 years, AOR = 1.758 at 95% CI = 1.306-2.368]; wealth status [rich, AOR = 1.520 at 95% CI = 1.282-1.802]; education level [higher education, AOR = 2.355 at 95% CI = 1.36-4.079]; parity [Para 2 to 3, AOR = 0.85 at 95% CI = 0.727-0.994 and Para 5+, AOR = 0.577 at 95%CI = 0.465-0.715]; zones [Unguja, AOR = 0.433 at 95% CI = 0.284-0.658 and Pemba, AOR = 0.392 at 95% CI = 0.236-0.649]. Conclusion Early antenatal booking in Tanzania is extremely low. Women who were more likely to initiate antenatal visits within the first 12 weeks are those from well-off families, those with higher education, primiparity women, and those from Tanzania mainland urban.

Methods We retrospectively collected data from 145 patients with MPE and 117 cases of benign pleural effusions (BPE). The diagnostic performance of CR and a typical biomarker of MPE, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), were analysed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) as a measure of accuracy. The overall diagnostic accuracy of CR was summarised by a standard diagnostic meta-analysis. Results Significantly higher CR and pleural CEA values were observed in the MPE patients than in the BPE patients. At a cut-off value of 14.97, CR showed high sensitivity (0.91), low specificity (0.67), and high AUC (0.85). The combination of CEA and CR increased the AUC to 0.98. The meta-analysis included seven studies involving 2,078 patients. The pooled values for sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of CR were 0.96, 0.88, 7.70, 0.05, and 169, respectively. The AUC of the summary ROC of CR was 0.98.

Methods:  This retrospective, observational study included 30 female patients (age 22-35 years) receiving intralesional corticosteroid injection after complaining about the unsatisfactory double eyelid post-transcutaneous upper eyelid blepharoplasty. The postoperative double eyelid anomalies included multiple folds, sunken eyelids, and severe postoperative eyelid edema. The evaluation of the clinical effect was based on the bilateral symmetry of the eyelid, the placement of the lid fold, the radian of the double eyelid, and the extent of the swelling and depression.  Results:  Multiple folds were observed in 11 (36.67%) patients, sunken eyelids in 9 (30.00%) patients, and severe postoperative eyelid edema in 10 (33.33%) patients. Among them, 17 (56.67%) patients received one intralesional injection and experienced significant improvement in the eyelid, while 8 (26.67%) accepted another injection at 1 month after the first injection and achieved marked improvement. The remaining 5 (16.67%) patients were dissatisfied with the results and might need further repair surgery: 2 patients had multiple folds, 2 showed postoperative edema, and 1 presented sunken eyelids. None of the patients reported any adverse reactions.  Conclusion:  Intralesional corticosteroid injection for the correction of the postoperative unsatisfactory double eyelid is safe and convenient, and provides a novel method for early intervention.","['Management', 'Intralesional Injection', 'Double Eyelid', 'Corticosteroid Injection', 'Unsatisfactory Outcomes']","['People Hospital', 'Shanghai Ninth', 'Ninth People', 'Ethics Statement', 'ethics committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Written informed', 'informed consent']",[],NaN

Forgetting could result in inadequate knowledge about ones' health, non-adherence with treatments, and poorer health outcomes. Hearing the health care provider plays a crucial role in consolidating information for recall. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has meant a rapid transition to videoconference-based medicine, here described as telehealth. When using telehealth speech must be filtered and compressed, and research has shown that degraded speech is more challenging to remember. Here we present preliminary results from a study that compared memory for health information provided in-person to telehealth. The data collection for this study was stopped due to the pandemic, but the preliminary results are interesting because the pandemic forced a rapid transition to telehealth. To examine a potential memory deficit for health information provided through telehealth, we presented older and younger adults with instructions on how to use two medical devices. One set of instructions was presented in-person, and the other through telehealth. Participants were asked to recall the instructions immediately after the session, and again after a 1-week delay. Overall, the number of details recalled was significantly lower when instructions were provided by telehealth, both immediately after the session and after a 1-week delay. It is likely that a mix of technological and communication strategies by the healthcare provider could reduce this telehealth memory deficit. Given the rapid transition to telehealth due to COVID-19, highlighting this deficit and providing potential solutions are timely and of utmost importance.","['Aging', 'Memory', 'hearing', 'Telehealth', 'Healthcare Delivery']","['Health Research', 'Ethics Board', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Board', 'Newfoundland', 'Labrador', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

On completion of the original LY.12 randomized clinical trial in lymphoma (NCT00078949), participants were invited to enrol in the Long-term Innovative Follow-up Extension (LIFE) component. Those consenting to do so provided comprehensive identifying information to facilitate linkage with their administrative data. We prospectively designed a global assessment of this innovative approach to clinical trial follow-up including rates of REB approval and patient consent. The pre-specified benchmark for patient acceptability was 80%. Of 16 REBs who reviewed the research protocol, 14 (89%) provided approval; two in Quebec declined due to small patient numbers.

Previous work from our laboratory and others suggests that LAM is associated with host serum lipoproteins, which may in turn have implications for diagnostic assays. Our team has developed two serum assays for amphiphile detection: lipoprotein capture and membrane insertion. The lipoprotein capture assay relies on capture of the host lipoproteins, exploiting the biological association of host lipoprotein with microbial amphiphilic biomarkers to ""concentrate"" LAM. In contrast, the membrane insertion assay is independent of the association between pathogen amphiphiles and host lipoprotein association, and directly captures LAM based on its thermodynamic propensity for association with a supported lipid membrane, which forms the functional surface of an optical biosensor. In this manuscript, we explored the use of these assays for the detection of LAM in sera from adults whose tuberculosis status had been well-characterized using conventional microbiological tests, and endemic controls. Using the lipoprotein capture assay, LAM signal/noise ratios were >1.0 in 29/35 (83%) individuals with culture-confirmed active tuberculosis, 8/13 (62%) individuals with tuberculosis symptoms, but no positive culture for M. tuberculosis, and 0/6 (0%) symptom-free endemic controls. To evaluate serum LAM levels without bias associated with potential differences in circulating host lipoprotein concentrations between individuals, we subsequently processed available samples to liberate LAM from associated host lipoprotein assemblies followed by direct detection of the pathogen biomarker using the membrane insertion approach. Using the membrane insertion assay, signal/noise for detection of serum LAM was greater than that observed using the lipoprotein capture method for culture-confirmed TB patients (6/6), yet remained negative for controls (2/2). Taken together, these results suggest that detection of serum LAM is a promising TB diagnostic approach, but that further work is required to optimize assay performance and to decipher the implications of LAM/host lipoprotein associations for diagnostic assay performance and TB pathogenesis.",[],"['Research Centre', 'National Laboratory', 'Johns Hopkins', 'Hopkins University', 'University School', 'Joint Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Los Alamos', 'Alamos National', 'Kampala']",[],NaN

The law establishes that absence of explicit refusal automatically makes the patient a potential donor, but requires that a patient’s possible refusal to donate should be sought by checking their belongings and consulting proxy decision makers. Since most patients have not registered as donors and do not carry donor cards, Spanish transplant coordinators usually have to establish the patient’s wishes through discussion with the family. In practice, organ procurement is not undertaken if the family refuses the donation. Therefore, even though we have a presumed consent policy, we do not apply it in practice. We always approach the relatives, explaining to them the patient’s health conditions and we try to find out whether the individual wanted to be an organ donor or not. If the relatives oppose to deceased organ donation, we do not go on with it. The Spanish Real Decreto 2070â€“1999 forbids any person from obtaining any kind of financial compensation for human organs and frames organ donation as a voluntary and altruistic act. Therefore, obtaining reimbursements or financial compensations for organ donation in Spain is illegal [ 10]."," Objective To determine whether problems arising in the native lung may influence the short-term outcomes and survival after single lung transplantation (SLT), and therefore should be taken into consideration when selecting the transplant procedure. Patients and methods Retrospective review of 258 lung transplants performed between June 2012 and June 2019. Among them, 161 SLT were selected for the analysis. Complications in the native lung were recorded and distributed into two groups: early and late complications (within 30 days or after 30 days post-transplant). Donor and recipient preoperative factors, 30-day mortality and survival were analysed and compared between groups by univariable and multivariable analyses, and adjusting for transplant indication. Results There were 161 patients (126M/35F; 57±7 years) transplanted for emphysema (COPD) (n = 72), pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (n = 77), or other indications (n = 12). Forty-nine patients (30%) presented complications in the native lung. Thirty-day mortality did not differ between patients with or without early complications (6% vs. 12% respectively; p = 0.56). Twelve patients died due to a native lung complication (7.4% of patients; 24% of all deaths). Survival (1,3,5 years) without vs. with late complications: COPD (89%, 86%, 80% vs. 86%, 71%, 51%; p = 0.04); IPF (83%, 77%, 72% vs. 93%, 68%, 58%; p = 0.65). Among 30-day survivors: COPD (94%, 91%, 84% vs. 86%, 71%, 51%; p = 0.01); IPF (93%, 86%, 81% vs. 93%, 68%, 58%; p = 0.19). Native lung complications were associated to longer ICU stay (10±17 vs. 33±96 days; p Conclusion The native lung is a source of morbidity in the short-term and mortality in the long-term after lung transplantation.

Macrophages accumulate in the synoviums of RA, and the proportion of M1 type pro-inflammatory macrophages is higher than that of M2 type anti-inflammatory macrophages, leading to the secretion of inflammatory molecules and the aggravation of inflammatory reaction, which has made macrophages a potential target of RA drugs. Iguratimod is a kind of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor that affects macrophage polarity. It is speculated that its anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic effects may be related to the regulation of macrophage M1/M2 ratio. Aim To investigate the effects of Iguratimod on the polarity of mononuclear macrophages in elderly patients with RA. Methods Elderly patients with RA and joint effusion were selected, including 10 men and 25 women, with an average age of 66.37 ± 4.42 years. Patients were treated with oral administration of 25 mg Iguratimod (Iremod, State Food and Drug Administration Approval No. H20110084) twice daily for 12 wk. Disease Activity Score 28 and Health Assessment Questionnaire score were collected according to the disease severity before and after treatment. Venous blood and joint effusion fluid were collected, mononuclear macrophages were extracted and expression of cell surface markers CD86, CD64, CD163, and CD206 was analyzed by flow cytometry. The concentration of inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, transforming growth factor-β, and IL-4 in the joint effusion fluid was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of mononuclear cells inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (IκB) and phosphorylated IκB in peripheral blood was analyzed by western blotting. Results Disease Activity Score 28 score and Health Assessment Questionnaire score of patients treated with Iguratimod decreased significantly. The percentage of cell surface markers CD86 and CD64 decreased significantly, and the percentage of CD163 and CD206 increased significantly ( P   P   Conclusion Iguratimod can promote the transformation of mononuclear macrophages from M1 to M2 in elderly patients with RA by inhibiting the nuclear factor-κB pathway, thus improving symptoms of RA.","['Macrophage', 'Rheumatoid arthritis', 'Polarity', 'Nuclear factor-κB', 'Iguratimod']",[],[],NaN

However, how emotional distractors impact motor performance remains unclear. This study aimed to characterize how movement quality was impacted during emotional distractors. We used a modified oddball paradigm and documented the performance of pure movement. Participants were designated to draw a triangle or a polygon, while an emotional stimulus was presented. Speed was assessed using reaction time and movement time. The quality and precision of movement were assessed by calculating the accuracy and root-mean-square error (RMSE). Compared to drawings of triangles, polygons had higher accuracy under negative stimuli, but lower RMSE under positive stimuli. The results indicate that distracting emotional stimuli impact different aspects of movement quality, with movement complexity influencing accuracy under negative distractors and precision under positive distractors. This study provides further evidence that movement precision is an important feature of emotional embodiment that should be incorporated in future studies.","['Accuracy', 'emotion', 'Rmse', 'Continuous Movement', 'Discrete Movement']","['Shanghai University', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'ethics committee', 'human participants', 'Sport', 'Statement', 'Shanghai', 'University']",[],NaN

We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to comprehensively evaluate the benefit of EGFR-TKI compared with chemotherapy for early-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients after resection from the perspective of the Chinese health care system. Method A Markov model was established. Clinical data were based on the phase 3, ADJUVANT trial, where stage II-IIIA, EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients were randomized into gefitinib group or chemotherapy group after resection. Cost parameters mainly included costs of drugs, examinations, and adverse events (AEs). Effect parameters were evaluated by quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Outcomes contained incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER), average cost-effective ratio (ACER), and net benefit. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set as 3 times per capita gross domestic product ($30,828/QALY). Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to verify the stability of the model. Results Patients who received gefitinib had both a higher cost ($12,057.98 vs. $11,883.73) and a higher QALY (1.55 vs. 1.42) than patients who received chemotherapy. With an ICER of $1,345.62/QALY, adjuvant gefitinib was of economic benefit compared with chemotherapy. The ACER and net benefit were also consistent (gefitinib vs. chemotherapy, ACER: $7,802.30/QALY vs. $8,392.77/QALY; net benefit: $35,584.85 vs. $31,767.17). Sensitivity analyses indicated the stability of the model and the impact of utility. Conclusion Adjuvant EGFR-TKI application for early-stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients was cost-effective compared with chemotherapy, which might provide a reference for clinical decision-making and medical insurance policy formulation in China.","['Chemotherapy', 'non-small-cell lung cancer', 'Cost-effectiveness Analysis', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor']","['ADJUVANT trial', 'Statement Clinical', 'clinical trial', 'Ethics Statement', 'Clinical data', 'published clinical', 'current manuscript', 'specific consent', 'consent procedures', 'ethics approval']",[],NaN

However, the functional role of AIM2 in BRAF-mutant CRC remains unclear. In this study, we first investigated AIM2 expression level in BRAF-mutant CRC tumor tissues. Overexpression of AIM2 in CRC cells was performed to investigate the effect of AIM2 on CRC cell viability, and cell death detection and caspase activity assay were performed to explore the mechanism that AIM2 impacts the growth of BRAF-mutant CRC cells. Moreover, we confirmed the antitumor effect of AIM2 in BRAF-mutant CRC cell-derived tumor xenograft (CDX) models as well as patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Herein, we reported that AIM2 expression was lower in BRAF-mutant than that in BRAF wild-type CRC tumor tissues. Restoring the expression of AIM2 in BRAF-mutant CRC cells greatly inhibits the tumor cell growth by inducing necrotic cell death. Mechanism studies revealed that AIM2-induced cell death is in a caspase-1-dependent manner. Additionally, overexpression of AIM2 significantly inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in BRAF-mutant CRC  in vivo , which was further confirmed in BRAF-mutant CRC PDOs. Taken together, our data suggested that AIM2 inhibits BRAF-mutant colon cancer growth in a caspase-1-dependent manner, which may provide evidence to understand the pathogenesis of CRC with BRAF-mutant, as well as new strategies for manipulation of CRC.","['Colorectal Cancer', 'caspase-1', 'Absent In Melanoma 2', 'Braf-mutant', 'Patient-derived Organoids']","['Renji Hospital', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Hospital', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Research']",[],NaN

Most of these tumors form unilateral disease and can rapidly increase in size. The occurrence of axillary lymph node metastasis is rare. Tumor-associated hypoglycemia can be divided into non-islet cell tumor and insulinoma. In non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH), a considerable high molecular weight form of insulin like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) is formed, which abnormally binds to insulin receptors in the tissues and causes hypoglycemia. Breast phyllodes tumors with NICTH are rare and first reported in 1983. Surgical resection is the main treatment and hypoglycemia symptoms usually resolve after surgery. Nevertheless, prior to surgery, intravenous glucose infusion is used to maintain blood glucose levels. A female patient presented with a rapidly growing breast mass and was diagnosed with a phyllodes tumor with NICTH at our hospital in August 2020; she was successfully treated through surgical resection. We reviewed the relevant literature to investigate and analyze the relationship between NICTH and phyllodes tumors, as well as optimize its diagnosis and treatment.","['Breast', 'Non-islet Cell Tumor Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin-like Growth Factor-ii', 'Skin Ulceration', 'Giant Borderline Phyllodes Tumors']","['Medical University', 'Fourth Affiliated', 'Affiliated Hospital', 'Harbin Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

The DLN has been well studied in laryngeal cancer, although its significance in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) remains unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 936 patients with PTC who underwent thyroidectomy by a single surgeon in Tianjin Cancer Hospital from 2017 to 2019. Moreover, 250 PTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy by another surgeon in Tianjin Cancer Hospital from January 2019 to April 2019 were used as a validation cohort. Among the 936 patients with PTC, 581 patients (62.1%) had DLNs, of which 177 samples with metastasis (177/581, 30.5%) were verified. DLN metastasis was significantly correlated with sex, age, tumor size, bilateral cancer, multifocality, extrathyroidal extension, lymphovascular invasion and central and lateral neck lymph node metastasis. Multivariate analysis revealed that independent risk factors for DLN metastasis included age, gender, tumor size, extrathyroid extension, lymphovascular invasion and central lymph node metastasis, which determined the nomogram. In particular, tumor size was proven to be one of the most predominant single predictors. The diagnostic model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.829 (95% confidence interval, 0.804-0.854). The internal and external validations of the nomogram were 0.819 and 0.745, respectively.

Although different countries have proposed different guidelines to manage this emergency, these proposed criteria do not sufficiently consider people living with disabilities. People living with disabilities are therefore at a higher risk of exclusion from medical treatments as physicians tend to assume they have poor quality of life, whereas access to medical treatment should be based on several parameters, including clinical data and prognosis.

Method Healthcare professionals requesting ethics consultation between March 2020 and May 2020 at a tertiary academic medical centre were eligible to participate. We asked participants to comment on the consults they called and thematically analysed responses to identify features associated with optimal quality consultations. Results Of 14 healthcare providers, 8 (57%) were women and professions were as follows: 11 (79%) medical doctors, 1 (7%) social worker, 1 (7%) physician assistant and 1 (7%) nurse practitioner. Two aspects of quality emerged: satisfaction and value. Themes within the domain of satisfaction included: responsiveness of the ethics consultant, willingness to consult, institutional role of the ethics service and identifying areas for improvement. When describing value, respondents spoke of the intrapersonal and interpersonal worth of consultation. Conclusion Participants were generally satisfied with ethics consultation services, similar to opinions of those found in pre-COVID-19 survey studies. Our qualitative approach allowed for a richer exploration of the value of ethics consultation during the pandemic and has implications for ethics consultation services more broadly.

In humans, the MDB passes through both the posterior atlanto-occipital and the posterior atlanto-axial interspaces. The existence of the MDB in various mammals, including flying birds (Rock pigeons and Gallus domesticus) has been previously validated. Gentoo penguins are marine birds, able to make 450 dives per day, reaching depths of up to 660 feet. While foraging, this penguin is able to reach speeds of up to 22 miles per hour. Gentoo penguins are also the world's fastest diving birds. The present study was therefore carried out to investigate the existence and characteristics of the MDB in Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), a non-flying, marine bird that can dive. For this study, six Gentoo penguin specimens were dissected to observe the existence and composition of their MDB. Histological staining was also performed to analyze the anatomic relationships and characteristic of the MDB in the Gentoo penguin. In this study, it was found that the suboccipital musculature in the Gentoo penguin consists of the rectus capitis dorsalis minor (RCDmi) muscle and rectus capitis dorsalis major (RCDma) muscle. Dense connective tissue fibers were observed connecting these two suboccipital muscles to the spinal dura mater (SDM). This dense connective tissue bridge consists of primarily type I collagen fibers. Thus, this penguin's MDB appears to be analogous to the MDB previously observed in humans. The present study evidences that the MDB not only exists in penguins but it also has unique features that distinguishes it from that of flying birds. Thus, this study advances the understanding of the morphological characteristics of the MDB in flightless, marine birds.",[],[],[],NaN

Little research has investigated the mechanism of occupational burnout among the frontline health professionals located in the center of the epidemic in Wuhan, China.  Methods:  A total of 199 frontline health professionals from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital completed the cross-sectional survey. Mechanisms of occupational burnout (according to the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey, MBI-GS) among the health professionals in Jinyintan Hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak were examined using a structural equation model (SEM).  Results:  The levels of the three burnout dimensions (emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy) were high at 34.2, 50.8, and 35.2%, respectively. Frontline health professionals in this stressful period reported significantly greater emotional exhaustion ( p   p   p  = 0.449), when compared to employees in a large multinational company. The SEM results revealed that both acute stress symptoms and psychosomatic symptoms significantly predicted the emotional exhaustion and occupation cynicism dimensions of burnout.  Conclusion:  The study reveals the occupational burnout mechanism of frontline health professionals during the COVID-19 peak at the time of the outbreak.

Ethics and Design We report data from the Activity and Health during the SArs-CoV2 Pandemic (ASAP) survey ( 11), which was performed in April and May 2020. Ethics approval was obtained in each of the involved 14 countries (Australia, Austria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, South Africa, Singapore, Switzerland, Spain, and the United States). Participants were 18 and older from countries with ( 1) official cases of SARS-CoV2 and ( 2) confinement measures limiting movement in public spaces. Recruitment strategies included social media promotion, mailing lists, and health-related organizations.","Most countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic have repeatedly restricted public life to control the contagion. However, the health impact of confinement measures is hitherto unclear. We performed a multinational survey investigating changes in mental and physical well-being (MWB/PWB) during the first wave of the pandemic. A total of 14,975 individuals from 14 countries provided valid responses. Compared to pre-restrictions, MWB, as measured by the WHO-5 questionnaire, decreased considerably during restrictions (68.1 ± 16.9 to 51.9 ± 21.0 points). Whereas 14.2% of the participants met the cutoff for depression screening pre-restrictions, this share tripled to 45.2% during restrictions. Factors associated with clinically relevant decreases in MWB were female sex (odds ratio/OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.11-1.29), high physical activity levels pre-restrictions (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.16-1.42), decreased vigorous physical activity during restrictions (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05-1.23), and working (partially) outside the home vs. working remotely (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16-1.44/OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.23-1.47). Reductions, although smaller, were also seen for PWB. Scores in the SF-36 bodily pain subscale decreased from 85.8 ± 18.7% pre-restrictions to 81.3 ± 21.9% during restrictions. Clinically relevant decrements of PWB were associated with female sex (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.50-1.75), high levels of public life restrictions (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.18-1.36), and young age (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.19). Study findings suggest lockdowns instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic may have had substantial adverse public health effects. The development of interventions mitigating losses in MWB and PWB is, thus, paramount when preparing for forthcoming waves of COVID-19 or future public life restrictions.","['Pain', 'Coronavirus', 'Psychological Health', 'Sf-36', 'Who-5', 'Lockdowns']","['Goethe University', 'Sports Sciences', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics committee', 'Sciences', 'Goethe', 'University', 'Statement', 'Faculty', 'Psychology']",[],NaN

Methods Twenty-seven treatment-naive patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were enrolled and scanned with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging. Clinical symptoms were assessed pre- and post-rTMS. Functional and structural connectivity between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral insula were measured, and the connectivity strength in each modality was then correlated to the clinical efficacy of rTMS. Results When the coordinates of left DLPFC were located as a node in the central executive network, the clinical efficacy of rTMS was significantly correlated with the functional connectivity strength between left DLPFC and bilateral insula (left insula:  r  = 0.66; right insula:  r  = 0.65). The structural connectivity strength between the left DLPFC and left insular cortex also had a significantly positive correlation with symptom improvement ( r    s   = 0.458). Conclusion This study provides implications that rTMS might act more effectively when the pretreatment functional and structural connectivity between the insula and left DLPFC is stronger.","['Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Insula', 'Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex', 'Diffusion Tensor Imaging', 'Resting-state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging']","['Medical University', 'Affiliated Hospital', 'Local Medical', 'Chongqing Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Medical Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Medical']",[],NaN

However, there is still an ongoing debate, whether predominantly psychotic manifestations of autoimmune encephalitides exist that may remain undetected and, thus, untreated. Furthermore, it is discussed if such conditions can be diagnosed based on serum antibody results or if a reliable diagnosis requires additional cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) results. In this study, we screened pairs of serum and CSF samples from antipsychotic-naïve individuals with first-episode schizophrenic psychosis (FEP,  n  = 103), clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR,  n  = 47), and healthy volunteers (HV,  n  = 40) for eight different antibodies against various antigens that have been shown to be associated with autoimmune encephalitides: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR, NR1 subunits only), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein 1 (LGI1), contactin-associated protein-like 2 protein (CASPR2), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunit 1, AMPAR subunit 2, γ-aminobutyric acid-B receptors (GABA B R), and glycine receptors. All patients were within the norm with regards to a careful neurological examination, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, an electroencephalogram (EEG), and routine blood pathology. All CSF samples were autoantibody-negative. In three serum samples of individuals with FEP, we detected low-titer CASPR2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies (≤1:160,  n  = 2) and non-IgG antibodies against NMDAR ( n  = 1) (overall serum-autoantibody prevalence in FEP: 2.91%). However, the IgG titers were below the laboratory cut-off defined for positivity, and non-IgG antibodies are of no clinical relevance. This suggests that there were no cases of autoimmune encephalitis in our cohort. Our results highlight the importance and the high specificity of CSF analysis to reliably detect autoantibodies. They confirm the hypothesis that pure psychotic manifestations of antibody-associated autoimmune encephalitides without any additional neuropsychiatric findings are very rare. However, special attention must be paid to those presenting with atypical mental illnesses with additional neurological symptoms, evidence of clinically-significant cognitive involvement, profound sleep-wake perturbations, seizures, electroencephalographic, or magnetic resonance imaging pathologies to be able to identify cases with autoimmune-mediated psychiatric syndromes.","['Schizophrenia', 'Autoimmune Encephalitis', 'Ultra-high Risk For Psychosis', 'Healthy Control', 'At-risk Mental State', 'Autoimmune-Mediated Psychosis', 'Clinical High At-Risk Mental State', 'Anti-Neural Autoantibodies']","['Ethics Committee', 'Faculty Mannheim', 'Heidelberg University', 'Medical Faculty', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Ethics', 'Committee', 'University']",[],NaN

Yet, given the choice, most patients would prefer to live without experiencing any dyskinesia. However, the concept of evaluating time spent ON  without  any dyskinesia as an outcome has never been tested. We conducted analyses of pooled Gocovri pivotal trial data in order to evaluate the extent to which Gocovri increased the time PD patients spent ON  without  dyskinesia (troublesome or non-troublesome), beyond its already identified improvement in reducing troublesome dyskinesia.  Methods:  Patients enrolled in phase 3 trials (EASE LID [NCT02136914] or EASE LID 3 [NCT02274766]) recorded time spent in the following PD diary states at baseline and Week 12 (endpoint): asleep, OFF, ON with troublesome dyskinesia, ON with non-troublesome dyskinesia, and ON  without  dyskinesia. Mixed model repeated measures analyses with estimated Cohen D effect sizes were performed on the modified intent to treat population to evaluate changes in time spent in these states.  Results:  Patients randomized to receive Gocovri showed an increase in ON time  without  dyskinesia and corresponding decreases in ON time with dyskinesia and OFF time vs. placebo. Treatment effects were statistically significant for Gocovri vs. placebo starting at Week 2 and were sustained until Week 12. On MMRM analysis at Week 12, patients in the Gocovri group showed an adjusted mean ± SE increase over placebo of 2.9 ± 0.6 h in ON time  without  dyskinesia (Cohen D effect size 0.79) and an adjusted mean ± SE decrease of -1.9 ± 0.6 h in ON time with dyskinesia (troublesome + non-troublesome) (Cohen D effect size 0.49), that included a -1.5 ± 0.4 h placebo-adjusted reduction in ON time with troublesome dyskinesia and a -0.6 ± 0.4 h reduction in ON time with non-troublesome dyskinesia. OFF time was reduced by -1.0 ± 0.3 h compared to placebo.  Conclusions:  Gocovri treatment more than doubled the daily time patients spent ON  without  dyskinesia. These results suggest that the Gocovri treatment effect was driven by a reduction in overall motor complications including ON time with both troublesome and non-troublesome dyskinesia as well as time spent OFF.","['Treatment', ""Parkinson's Disease"", 'Dyskinesia', 'Amantadine', 'Motor Complications', 'Off', 'Gocovri', 'Home Diary']","['Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'ethics committee', 'Statement', 'IRB', 'REB', 'Ethics', 'human participants', 'IEC']",[],NaN

It can be continuously administered locally and be used to repeatedly flush the intracranial cavity to achieve the purpose of treatment. Accurate, fast, and minimally invasive placement of the drainage tube is essential during the Ommaya reservoir implantation technique, which can be achieved with the assistance of robots.  Methods:  We retrospectively analyzed a total of 100 patients undergoing Ommaya reservoir implantation, of which 50 were implanted using a robot, and the remaining 50 were implanted using conventional surgical methods. We then compared the data related to surgery between the two groups and calculated the accuracy of the drainage tube of the robot-assisted group.  Results:  The average operation time of robot-assisted surgery groups was 41.17 ± 11.09 min, the bone hole diameter was 4.1 ± 0.5 mm, the intraoperative blood loss was 11.1 ± 3.08 ml, and the average hospitalization time was 3.9 ± 1.2 days. All of the Ommaya reservoirs were successful in one pass, and there were no complications such as infection or incorrect placement of the tube. In the conventional Ommaya reservoir implantation group, the average operation time was 65 ± 14.32 min, the bone hole diameter was 11.3 ± 0.3 mm, the intraoperative blood loss was 19.9 ± 3.98 ml, and the average hospitalization time was 4.1 ± 0.5 days. In the robot-assisted surgery group, the radial error was 2.14 ± 0.99 mm and the axial error was 1.69 ± 1.24 mm.

To distinguish between chemotaxis and chemokinesis we used the classic ""under-agarose assay"" in combination with video-microscopy to monitor migration of CCR7+ human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and T cells in response to a concentration gradient of CCL19. Formation of the gradients was visualized with a fluorescent marker and lasted several hours. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells migrated chemotactically towards the CCL19 gradient. In contrast, T cells exhibited a biased random walk that was largely driven by increased exploratory chemokinesis towards CCL19.

Results:  The average age of the whole cohort was 65 (63-68) years, with 152 males (60.8%). There was no difference between two groups in baseline features, such as age, sex, medical history, Child-Pugh hepatic function, American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status, operative type, hepatectomy type, and hepatic pathology ( P  > 0.05 for all). There was no occurrence of death in the two groups. Patients in the ERAS group had significantly less occurrence of post-operative complications and a shorter length of hospital stay ( P   P   P  > 0.05).  Conclusions:  ERAS strategy significantly decreased the occurrence of operative complications and shortened the length of hospital stay without any increase in mortality or readmission in Chinese patients receiving hepatectomy.","['Hepatectomy', 'Clinical outcome', 'Hepatic function', 'Chinese Patients', 'Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Strategy']","['People Hospital', ""Mongolia Xing'an"", ""Xing'an Meng"", 'Meng People', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Hospital', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

This study aimed to investigate the association between age and findings in initial CT scans.  Methods  We searched for low-dose CT screening cohorts from electronic databases. Single-arm syntheses weighted by sample size were performed to calculate the detection rates of pulmonary nodules, lung cancers (all stages and stage I), and the proportion of stage I diseases in lung cancers. In addition, we included patients who underwent chest CT in our center as a supplementary cohort. The correlation between the detection rates and age was evaluated by the Pearson Correlation Coefficient.  Results  A total of 37 studies involving 163,442 participants were included. We found the detection rates of pulmonary nodules and lung cancers increased with age. However, the proportion of stage I diseases in lung cancers declined with increased starting age and was significantly higher in the 40-year group than in other groups (40 vs. 45, 50, 55, P Conclusions  Starting lung cancer screening at an earlier age is associated with a higher probability of identifying a curable disease, urging future research to determine the optimal starting age.","['Age', 'Lung cancer', 'Screening', 'Early stage', 'cure']",[],[],NaN

A common practice is to fix the first knot with a clamp and then tie a reverse locking knot; however, this practice has certain disadvantages. The aim of this study was to introduce a novel and efficient surgical knotting technique with various advantages.  Methods  The two knotting methods used in this study were the absorbable braided suture where the first suture was fixed with a clamp (with assistance) and the SH-9Hospital knotting technique (without assistance) applied on the smooth surface of a cylinder. Mechanical testing was performed using a universal material testing machine. The load-elongation curve and ultimate tensile load (UTL) were recorded.  Results  The mean knotting time was 36.40±1.50 s (range, 32–41 s) and 24.80±1.16 s (range, 21–28 s) in the clamp and SH-9Hosptial groups, respectively. The mean UTL was 120.8±10.14 N (range, 81.11–136.55 N)and 126.5±6.29 N (range, 104.88–139.56 N) in the clamp and SH-9Hospital groups, respectively. The knot strength of the SH-9Hospital technique was not inferior to traditional clinical practice.

Among individuals with diabetic neuropathy, it remains a challenge to identify those individuals who develop CIDP. Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) has been shown to detect corneal nerve fiber loss and cellular infiltrates in the sub-basal layer of the cornea. The objective of the study was to determine whether CCM can distinguish diabetic neuropathy from CIDP and whether CCM can detect CIDP in persons with coexisting diabetes. Methods In this multicenter, case-control study, participants with CIDP (n = 55) with (n = 10) and without (n = 45) diabetes; participants with diabetes (n = 58) with (n = 28) and without (n = 30) diabetic neuropathy, and healthy controls (n = 58) underwent CCM. Corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), and dendritic and non-dendritic cell density, with or without nerve fiber contact were quantified. Results Dendritic cell density in proximity to corneal nerve fibers was significantly higher in participants with CIDP with and without diabetes compared to participants with diabetic neuropathy and controls. CNFD, CNFL, and CNBD were equally reduced in participants with CIDP, diabetic neuropathy, and CIDP with diabetes. Conclusions An increase in dendritic cell density identifies persons with CIDP. CCM may, therefore, be useful to differentiate inflammatory from non-inflammatory diabetic neuropathy.","['Diabetes mellitus', 'Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Neuropathy', 'Corneal Confocal Microscopy']",[],[],NaN

Health care workers, as those on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic, are more susceptible to infection. Inadequate related knowledge and preventive behaviors among health care workers might lead to delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection. Therefore, this study evaluated the knowledge of health care workers with regard to COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was conducted from June 10-18, 2020. Participants were general practitioners, specialists, and nurses working at the forefront of the pandemic. Their knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perceptions concerning COVID-19 were evaluated using an online questionnaire created by our medical specialists. The questionnaire consisted of 29, 5, and 4 items about COVID-19 knowledge, preventive behaviors, and risk perceptions, respectively. A total of 251 health care workers completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 33.88±8.72 years old, and the sample consisted of 68 males (27.08%) and 183 females (72.91%). While there was no difference between the percentage of correct answers given by female and male participants to knowledge-based questions (p>0.05), the percentage of correct answers to the questions on preventive behaviors was significantly higher in female participants than in males (p<0.001). The overall average percentages of correct responses were 91.66% for knowledge-based questions and 85.96% for preventive behavior questions. The scores for knowledge-based questions were higher for medical specialists, whereas nurses scored higher on preventive behavior questions. Government hospital staff showed a significant difference in preventive behaviors compared to that of university hospitals (p<0.05). In addition, there was a positive correlation between knowledge scores and preventive behaviors. Although all the participants (100%) knew that contracting COVID-19 can lead to death, only 66.93% of them were willing to get vaccinated themselves. The knowledge level of health care workers concerning COVID-19 was above 90%, but the level of competence in terms of preventive behaviors was found to be low, especially in males.",[],"['Ethics Committee', 'Research Platform', 'Abdurrahman Yurtaslan', 'Yurtaslan Ankara', 'Ankara Oncology', 'Oncology Educational', 'Health Scientific', 'Research Hospital', 'Clinical Research', 'Research Ethics']",[],NaN

A total of 60 COPD patients with varying severity according to GOLD guidelines were enrolled in this study. DNA was extracted from patients' stool and 16S rRNA data analysis conducted using high-throughput sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis. The richness of the gut microbiota was not associated with COPD severity. The gut microbiome is more similar in stage 1 and 2 COPD than stage 3+4 COPD. Fusobacterium and Aerococcus were more abundant in stage 3+4 COPD. Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group and Lachnoclostridium were less abundant in stage 2-4, and Tyzzerella 4 and Dialister were less abundant in stage 1.

Evidence indicates a rising prevalence of the use of these products worldwide especially among the age group 18-23 years. Aim The study investigates the tendencies and attitudes of Bangladeshi undergraduate female students towards dietary supplements (DS). Methods A three-month (March 2018-May 2018) cross-sectional face-to-face survey was conducted in undergraduate female students in Chittagong, Bangladesh using a pre-validated dietary supplement questionnaire. The study was carried among the four private and three public university students of different disciplines in Chittagong to record their prevalent opinions and attitudes toward using DS. The results were documented and analyzed by SPSS version 22.0. Results Ninety two percent (N = 925, 92.0%) of the respondents answered the survey questions. The prevalence of DS use was high in undergraduate female students. The respondents cited general health and well-being (n = 102, 11.0%) and physician recommendation (n = 101, 10.9%) as a reason for DS use. Majority of the students (n = 817, 88.3%) used DS cost monthly between USD 0.12 and USD 5.90. Most of the students (n = 749, 81.0%) agreed on the beneficial effect of DS and a significant portion (n = 493, 53.3%) recommended for a regular use of DS. Highly prevalent use of dietary supplements appeared in Chittagonian undergraduate female students. They were tremendously positive in using DS.

Main outcome measures were level of agreement with given statements regarding genital surgery, including clitoris reduction, vaginoplasty, and hypospadias repair. A total of 66% of individuals with CAH and 60% of those with XY DSD-A thought that infancy or childhood were the appropriate age for genital surgery. Females with XY DSD were divided on this issue and tended to prefer vaginoplasty at a later age (XY DSD-A 39%, XY DSD-nA 32%). A total of 47% of males preferred early hypospadias surgery. Only 12% (CAH), 11% (XY DSD-A), and 21% (XY DSD-nA) thought they would have been better off without any surgery in childhood or adolescence. Individuals who had early genital surgery were more likely to approve of it. Outcome data failed to support a general moratorium on early elective genital surgery.

Fortunately, most of the respondents were well-informed and used a particular contraceptive drug based on a healthcare professional's recommendation. Another aspect that emphasizes the choice of contraceptive method is the religious affiliation, which could influence the decision to use OCP. For the students with medical knowledge, the advice of a healthcare professional seems to be quite important, because they are aware of the risks of improper use of OCP.

We aimed to establish demographics and health profiles for the South African pilgrims performing the 2017 Hajj.  Methods:  This is a longitudinal survey-based study conducted on 1138 adult South African pilgrims in two phases (during and post-Hajj). Data on demographics, vaccination status, underlying health conditions, pre-Hajj training, health promotion, travel history, and health issues during and post-Hajj were collected using pre-designed questionnaires.  Results:  Participants had a mean age of 49.2 years (SD = 13.3; range 18-81), with a male: female ratio of 1.2:1. The majority of pilgrims were married (88.2%), of Indian/Asian background (73%), and literate (>99%). Nearly all pilgrims were vaccinated against meningococcal disease and yellow fever, but only 23.7% were vaccinated against Influenza. Hypertension, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol levels were the most common underlying health conditions reported by 22.6%, 13.2%, and 11.5% of pilgrims, respectively. One month after return to South Africa, nearly 65% of pilgrims reported illness during Hajj, while 40% reported falling ill post event upon return to South Africa. Nevertheless, only a few were admitted to hospitals (12 during Hajj and 15 post-Hajj). Among ill pilgrims, respiratory symptoms were the most commonly experienced symptoms during (70.2%) and post-Hajj (82.2%). Other symptoms such as walking-related symptoms include symptoms directly related or mainly caused by walking (e.g., leg pain, sore feet, blisters on the feet), dehydration, and gastrointestinal tract symptoms reported during Hajj. Medication to treat respiratory symptoms and antibiotics were the most commonly used medications during and post-Hajj. Having an underlying health condition was an independent predictor of falling ill during or post Hajj.

The survey was disseminated in 11 countries: UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, India, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Sweden. We acquired 9543 unique responses. Our findings show significant differences across countries in perceived effectiveness, restrictiveness, and compliance. Governments that suffer low levels of trust should put more effort into persuading citizens, especially men, in the effectiveness of the proposed measures. They should provide financial compensation to citizens who have lost their job or income due to the containment measures to improve measure compliance. Policymakers should implement the least restrictive and most effective public health measures first during pandemic emergencies instead of implementing a combination of many restrictive measures, which has the opposite effect on citizens' adherence and undermines human rights.","['Compliance', 'Coronavirus', 'Effectiveness', 'Pandemic', 'Human Rights', 'Restrictiveness', 'Public Health Measures', 'Covid-19', 'Proportionality Principle', 'Containment Measures']",[],[],NaN

(2) Methods: Policy compliance was assessed through comparing nutritional information on drink (e.g., sports drinks) and snack (e.g., chocolate bars) products in vending machines to Policy and Program Memorandum (P/PM) 150 in Ontario (required policy) and the Alberta Nutrition Guidelines for Children and Youth (recommended policy). Longitudinal results and descriptive statistics were calculated. (3) Results: Longitudinal results indicate that between Y 4  (2015/2016) and Y 7  (2018/2019), snack and drink vending machines remained mostly non-compliant in Ontario and Alberta, with a small proportion of Ontario drink machines changing from non-compliant to compliant. At the school level, descriptive results indicate the proportion of Ontario schools with policy-compliant snack and drink machines decreased between Y 4  and Y 7 . Alberta schools were non-compliant for drink and snack machines. (4) Conclusions: Secondary schools continue to be non-compliant with provincial policies.

Risk and protective factors for depression and generalized anxiety in healthcare workers need to be identified to protect their health and ability to work. Social support and optimism are known protective psychosocial resources, but have not been adequately studied in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers in Germany. Methods Within the first wave of the VOICE study ( n  = 7765), a longitudinal web-based survey study among healthcare workers in Germany, we assessed symptoms of depression (PHQ-2) and generalized anxiety (GAD-2), social support (ENRICHD Social Support Inventory; ESSI), and generalized optimism as well as sociodemographic, occupational, and COVID-19 related variables. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between the constructs. Results The analyses revealed that higher levels of social support and optimism were associated with lower levels of depression and generalized anxiety. They showed a higher association with depression and generalized anxiety than demographic or occupational risk factors such as female gender and direct contact with infected individuals. Conclusion Psychosocial resources such as social support and optimism appear to contribute to successful coping with the COVID-19 pandemic and should be considered in future studies.","['Resources', 'Depression', 'Anxiety', 'Mental health', 'Social Support', 'Optimism', 'Healthcare', 'Covid-19']",[],[],NaN

However, there is a significant number of patients without positive familial anamnesis. Therefore, the molecular reasons for ACM in these patients are frequently unknown and a genetic contribution might be underestimated. Here, we used a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach and in addition single nucleotide polymor-phism (SNP) arrays for the genetic analysis of two independent index patients without familial medical history. Of note, this genetic strategy revealed a homozygous splice site mutation (DSG2-c.378+1G>T) in the first patient and a nonsense mutation (DSG2-p.L772X) in combination with a large deletion in DSG2 in the second one. In conclusion, a recessive inheritance pattern is likely for both cases, which might contribute to the hidden medical history in both families. This is the first report about these novel loss-of-function mutations in DSG2 that have not been previously identi-fied. Therefore, we suggest performing deep genetic analyses using NGS in combination with SNP arrays also for ACM index patients without obvious familial medical history.

Written informed consent to participate in this study was provided by the participants' legal guardian/next of kin.," Background:  There has been an extensive debate about a potential association between intelligence and social cognition. In this study, we aimed to assess the association between social cognition as measured with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RMET) and intelligence as measured with the fourth edition of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) in children and adolescents diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome (AS).  Methods:  We conducted a cross-sectional study among 84 children diagnosed with AS aged 6-16 years (mean = 11.64; standard deviation = 2.75; 92.9% males). We analyzed the association between RMET performance and WISC-IV total score as well as the association between RMET performance and each of the four WISC-IV indexes (processing speed index, PSI; working memory index, WMI; perceptual reasoning index, PRI, and verbal comprehension index, VCI).  Results:  We found a positive correlation between RMET performance and full-scale intelligence quotient ( r  = 0.340;  p   r  = 0.310;  p   r  = 0.401;  p   r  = 0.292;  p   p   p  = 0.019).  Conclusion:  Our results suggest that intelligence quotient positively influences RMET performance, indicating that intelligence increases social cognition in individuals diagnosed with AS. However, weak-to-moderate size effects were found.

The protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethics Review Committee (MERC) of the Amsterdam University Medical Centres, location Academic Medical Centre (AMC). Findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences, whether they are positive, negative or inconclusive. Recruitment and consent The informed consent procedure should be performed by the treating physician or a representative that is aware of the details and complications of both treatments included in the trial. Therefore, it is the trial’s preference that the consent is taken by the treating physician. The information offered to the patient or representative contains:—a statement that the trial involves research—a full and fair explanation of the procedures to be followed—a full explanation of the nature, expected duration and purpose of the study—a description of any reasonable foreseeable risks or discomfort to the patient—a description of any benefits which may reasonably be expected—a statement that patient data will be handled with care and confidentiality and the period of time the data is saved (15 years)—a statement that participation is voluntary, that refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the patient is otherwise entitled, and that the patient may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits, in which case the patient will receive standard treatment with the same degree of care. Patients are given ample time to decide whether or not to participate in the study. Minors and legally incompetent adults are excluded from the trial. Compensation for injury The sponsor/investigator has a liability insurance which is in accordance with article 7 of the WMO. The sponsor has an insurance which is in accordance with the legal requirements in the Netherlands (Article 7 WMO). This insurance provides cover for damage to research subjects through injury or death caused by the study. The insurance applies to the damage that becomes apparent during the study or within 4 years after the end of the study. Methods of dissemination of results Before starting recruitment the trial protocol will be presented at a meeting of the Dutch Society of Surgery. Initiation of the trial is also made knowledgeable at the website of this same society, as to reach the majority of surgeons/proctologists. When the trial has been completed results will be discussed first during a meeting of the Dutch Society Coloproctology/Surgery. In this session experiences from other surgeons treating haemorrhoids will be heard, plans following the trial outcome will be outlined and practical aspects of implementation will be discussed. This will be followed by presentation of results at the annual meeting of the Dutch Society of Surgeons (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Heelkunde). There will then be enough support to adjust the Dutch proctology guideline. We expect several manuscripts prepared from this research to be published in high impact peer-reviewed journals, including publication of this protocol itself. We will publish the results and a lay summary on the study website on study completion. The techniques under investigation are techniques that are long-existing and wide spread so no extra training is expected to be required. The actual behavioural change of the healthcare providers may be, however, hindered by lacking to acknowledge the reason of change/adjustment of treatment. It is not unusual to encounter reluctance on changing long standing habits. Education as proposed is one way to tackle this. Recommendations and education will be implemented in the curriculum of general surgery and proctology trainees. Another way is to use focus groups of patients sharing their experiences. These experiences will be shared with the patient federation. Monitoring and safety Monitoring will be performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practice and other rules and regulations in order to achieve high quality research and secure patient safety. Qualified and independent monitors from the Leading the Change trial agency will have access to the data and source documents of the trial. Based on the Site-Specific Monitoring programme of the Leading the Change trial agency, site evaluation visits will be performed to review the quality of the participating sites. All (serious) adverse events, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions and any other significant problems are reported to the MERC using an online submission system. A Data Safety Monitoring Board is not necessary for this study as it compares two already well established treatment modalities for haemorrhoidal disease which will not pose additional risk to the subjects in the study. Annual progress report and amendments The sponsor/investigator will submit a summary of the progress of the trial to the accredited MERC once a year. Information will be provided on the date of inclusion of the first subject, numbers of subjects included and numbers of subjects that have completed the trial, serious adverse events/serious adverse reactions, other problems and amendments. All substantial amendments will be notified to the MERC and to the competent authority. Public disclosure and publication policy Main presentations and main publications will be in the name of the study group. This will apply when the work underpinning a publication has been carried out by a group and no one person can be identified as having substantially greater responsibility for its contents than others. In such cases, authorship will be presented by the collective title and there will be a footnote of the names of the people and institutions represented. Other manuscripts, such as describing satellite studies, will have individual authorship. Publication or presentation of data can only be possible when the authors state that the corresponding patients were included in the trial. If a centre violates these rules, exclusion from the trial and exclusion from authorship will be the consequence. Decisions on authorship should be justified to, and require agreement from the project management group. The sponsor will have no influence on implementation of the research and content of publications. Publication of data will not take place until accrual of patients has been completed. Data sharing statement Data will be available on reasonable request. This will include deidentified participant data and statistical codes. After an embargo period, the data will be accessible for further research and verification. The request should be made to the corresponding author and will be considered by the HollAND trial project group."," Introduction  Haemorrhoidal disease is one of the most common anorectal disorders, which affects nearly half of the general population. Treatment of grade III haemorrhoids consists initially of conservative measures, followed by rubber band ligation and haemorrhoidectomy when unsuccessful. Given the current guidelines and numerous modalities the obvious question which needs to be answered is which treatment is the best for grade III haemorrhoids. There is a need for evaluating treatment from the patient’s point of view and transparency in surgical and non-surgical treatment outcome.  Methods and analysis  This multicentre, randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial with cost–utility analysis compares haemorrhoidectomy with rubber band ligation. Patients aged 18 years and older with symptomatic haemorrhoids grade III are recruited. Primary outcome measure is quality of life at 24 months measured with the EQ-5D-5L and in-hospital (in)direct costs and out-of-hospital postoperative costs. A key secondary outcome is recurrence at 1-year postprocedure. Secondary outcomes are complaint reduction with proctology-specific patient-reported outcome measurements (Haemorrhoid Severity Score, ProctoPROM, PROM-HISS, vaizey score), resumption of work, pain and complication rates. Data are collected at seven different time points. Standard postprocedural care is followed. A sample size has been calculated using a one sided alpha of 0.025 and a power of 80% with an SD of 0.15 and a non-inferiority limit of 0.05. With stratification by centre and to adjust for 10% lost to follow-up the total sample size will be 360 patients in total (180 per group). Data will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat and the per-protocol principle.  Ethics and dissemination  The protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethics Review Committee of the Amsterdam University Medical Centres, location AMC. Findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences, whether they are positive, negative or inconclusive.

All clinical investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the duration of blood pressure drops during general anesthesia and the outcomes in large vessel occlusion (LVO) patients treated with MT.  Methods:  We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively collected data for LVO patients treated with MT between January 2018 and July 2020. Intraprocedural mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded every 5 min throughout the procedure. Baseline MAP minus each MAP value recorded during general anesthesia was defined ΔMAP. Cumulated time (in min) and longest continuous episode (in min) with ΔMAP more than 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mmHg were calculated, respectively. Poor outcome was defined as 90-day modified Rankin score (mRS) 3-6. Associations between cumulated time of different ΔMAP thresholds and poor outcome were determined using binary logistic regression models.  Results:  A total of 131 patients were finally included in the study. After controlling for age, atrial fibrillation, baseline NIHSS, baseline ASPECTS, procedure duration of MT, and times of retrieval attempts, the results indicated that cumulated time of MAP drop more than 10 mmHg (OR 1.013; 95% CI 1.004-1.023;  P  = 0.007) and 15 mmHg (OR 1.011; 95% CI 1.002-1.020;  P  = 0.017) were independently associated with poor outcomes.  Conclusion:  Prolonged episodes of intraprocedural MAP lowering were more likely to have poor outcomes in LVO patients following MT with general anesthesia, which might be helpful in guiding intraprocedural hemodynamic management of patients under general anesthesia.","['Blood pressure', 'general anesthesia', 'Outcome', 'Mechanical Thrombectomy', 'Large Artery Occlusion']","['Zhejiang Provincial', 'Provincial People', 'People Hospital', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Human Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Ethics', 'Hospital approved']",[],NaN

Patients were grouped by ICS use. Primary outcomes were allogeneic transfusion rates, and biochemical recurrence (prostate specific antigen >0.2 mg/mL). Secondary outcomes were use of adjuvant therapies, Clavien-Dindo complications and transfusion-related cost (allogeneic transfusion + ICS setup + ICS reinfusion). Results In total, 168 men were enrolled. Patients were grouped based on whether they received no blood conservation technique (126 men) or ICS (42 men). Groups were similar in median age, pre- and post-operative haemoglobin and length of stay. They also had similar post-operative tumour Gleason score, TNM-stage and positive surgical margin rates.

MMR deficiency is of high clinical importance as MMR deficient cancers tend to react favorably to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Strong lymphocytic infiltration is a morphological hallmark of seminomas. We thus asked whether seminomas may exhibit MMR deficiency at relevant frequency. Methods To screen for tumors with MMR deficiency, protein expression of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 574 seminomas. Results In total, 536 cases were evaluable resulting in 481 seminomas with unequivocally intact MMR protein expression. In 55 cancers, one or several IHC stains were equivocal and lacked detectable MMR protein in both tumor and stromal cells. Large section IHC analysis of all 55 equivocal cases demonstrated substantial staining issues due to improper fixation in 54 cases and identified one tumor with clear-cut MLH1 and PMS2 protein loss. This seminoma showed homogeneous loss of MLH1 and PMS2 in the entire tumor mass whereas minor adjacent foci of associated germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) were MMR intact. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using the 5 microsatellite loci of the ""Bethesda Panel"" revealed instability in 1 of 4 interpretable loci (""MSI-low"") and additional instability of the complex tetra-penta repeat locus MYCL1 in this tumor. Conclusions In summary, one single seminoma with MMR deficiency, characterized by protein loss of MLH1 and PMS2, was identified among 536 interpretable seminomas (0.19%).

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of imrecoxib compared with celecoxib for patients with moderate or severe acute pain following oral surgery. Methods Patients with moderate or severe pain within 6 hours following surgery were enrolled in this randomized, active-control trial. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either imrecoxib or celecoxib. Pain assessments on the visual analog scale, verbal rating scale, and pain relief were conducted at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours after the first dose. Adverse events were also recorded. Results Eighty-seven patients were approached from November 2018 to August 2019. Of these, 60 were eligible for randomization. Ultimately, 56 patients (imrecoxib group, n=27; celecoxib group, n=29) were included in the analysis. The difference in total pain relief (TOTPAR) between the imrecoxib and celecoxib groups was 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): -1.31-3.77], with the lower bound of the CI above the specified non-inferiority boundary. No perioperative complications were observed in the imrecoxib group during the 24-hour period after the first dose. Conclusions Imrecoxib could significantly relieve pain and has a non-inferior analgesic efficacy compared to celecoxib with good tolerance following oral surgery.","['Postoperative pain', 'Oral Surgery', 'Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (Nsaids)']",[],[],NaN

We speculated that the change in BMI distribution among Chinese children is different from that in developed countries. Therefore, we investigated the changes in the BMI distribution among urban children in Changsha, China. Methods A secondary data analysis of the 2002 and 2018 Annual Survey on Students' Constitution and Health from Yuhua District, Changsha City, China was performed. The BMI distribution of children aged 6-15 years (n=72,061) was examined by calculating the BMI value at 5th, 50th, 85th, and 95th percentiles. Differences in the BMI value at the 5th, 50th, 85th, and 95th percentiles between 2002 and 2018 according to age and sex were calculated. Results From 2002 to 2018, the standardized rate of underweight decreased from 6.9% to 3.4%, whereas that of obesity increased from 6.1% to 13.8%. The BMI of the population increased over the 16-year period. The greatest change between the years was seen in the 85th percentile, and moderate changes were seen in the 5th and 50th BMI percentiles. Also, the greatest changes in the BMI percentiles were evident at age 12-14 years. Conclusions The whole spectrum of BMI distribution among school-aged children shifted over the 16-year study period, although the increases were more marked in the upper than lower percentiles.

The secondary objectives of the presented study are to evaluate different outcomes of the rehabilitation program in comparison to standard of care regarding: functional performance at 4-week and 12-week post- discharge mark; health-related quality of life, the impact on the health services (namely days of hospitalization), the cost-effectiveness of the intervention proposed. Trial design This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, double-arm clinical trial of treatment, with an allocation ratio 1:1 and framework of superiority. Participants The study will be conducted at Centro Hospitalar Entre Douro e Vouga, Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal. Potential participants will be adult patients (≥18 years old) hospitalized in ICU with respiratory insufficiency due to COVID-19, who are referred to respiratory and functional rehabilitation. Only patients approved by physical rehabilitation doctors to perform respiratory and functional rehabilitation will be considered potential participants. To be eligible for inclusion participants must have been independent in their activities of daily living before the onset of critical illness (verbal statement by their proxy) and have to meet the safety criteria defined by the Portuguese Society of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine. Intervention and comparator Both groups will receive usual medical and nursing care in the ICU, which involves assessment and treatment of the respiratory system and may include positioning, hyperinflation techniques and suctioning. The physical function of the patient is assessed, and active bed exercises and mobility are encouraged as soon as possible and may include sitting out of bed. The intervention group will receive a functional and respiratory multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocol (that includes medical, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy interventions) during their entire hospital stay. After reassurance that the patients fulfil the safety criteria, they will initiate the rehabilitation protocol, individualized to each patient based on the clinical status. The rehabilitation interventions and exercises implemented will be consistent with recommendations from the Portuguese Society of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine. The intervention will occur 6 days per week (Monday to Saturday), fifteen minutes, twice per day for each participant. Throughout all activities, progression will be increased successively, depending on the individual's tolerance and stability. After discharge, the intervention group will continue with rehabilitation exercises, prescribed by physical rehabilitation doctors. These exercises are designed for the patient to do at home, and then report their execution to rehabilitation nurses through teleconsultation, until 12 weeks after ICU discharge. Main outcomes Baseline descriptive data collection will include age, sex, comorbidities and date of admission to ICU. The need of mechanical ventilation and length of use, as well as the need for oxygen therapy, length of ICU stay (days/hours), incidence of ICU readmission, discharge destination and survival will also be recorded. Prior to intervention, every two days and at discharge, participants will be evaluated using the following scales: Glasgow Coma Scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment, 5 standardized questions for cooperation, Medical Research Council Sum-Score, Handgrip strength test and Medical Research Council dyspnea scale. At discharge, Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion will be evaluated. The primary outcome measure will be functional capacity using the 6-Minute Walk Test, and it will be measured at discharge and at the 4-week and 12-week mark. Medical Research Council Sum-Score, Handgrip strength test, Medical Research Council dyspnea scale and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion will also be re-evaluated at the 4-week and 12-week mark. The health related quality of life will also be used as an outcome measure, using the 12-Item Short Form Survey, at 12 weeks of follow-up. Randomisation Participants will be divided into two groups, standard care and intervention, by means of balanced randomization at a 1:1 ratio using blocks of 10 participants.

Written informed consent for participation was not required for this study in accordance with the national legislation and the institutional requirements.," Background Endometriosis and restless leg syndrome (RLS) are both chronic conditions that can negatively affect a woman's quality of life. A higher prevalence of RLS is seen in women and particularly in those who are pregnant, suggesting a possible ovarian hormonal influence. Endometriosis is a common (affecting 1 in 10 women) estrogen driven gynecological condition, and the prevalence of RLS in women with symptoms or a diagnosis of endometriosis is unknown. Methods A prospective, cross-sectional, observational self-completed questionnaire study was distributed to 650 pre-menopausal women attending the gynecological department at Liverpool Women`s Hospital over a period of 4 months. 584 questionnaires were returned and 465 completed questionnaires were included in the final dataset. Data on RLS-associated (The International Restless Leg Syndrome Study Group rating scale) and endometriosis-associated (modified-British Society of Gynaecological Endoscopists pelvic pain questionnaire) symptoms were collected. Results Women who reported a prior surgical diagnosis of endometriosis had a greater risk of having a prior formal diagnosis of RLS (OR 4.82, 95% CI 1.66,14.02) and suffering RLS symptoms (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.34-3.39) compared with those without a diagnosis. When women with either a formal surgical diagnosis or symptoms associated with endometriosis were grouped together, they also have a significantly increased risk of having either a formal diagnosis or symptoms suggestive of RLS (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.30, 3.64). In women suffering with endometriosis-associated symptoms, the cumulative endometriosis-associated symptom scores demonstrated a modest positive correlation with RLS severity scores (r=0.42 95% CI 0.25 to 0.57). Conclusions This is the first study highlighting an association between the symptoms relevant to the two chronic conditions RLS and endometriosis, showing that women with a reported prior surgical diagnosis or symptoms suggestive of endometriosis have a significantly higher prevalence of a prior formal diagnosis or symptoms suggestive of RLS. This data will help in facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets relevant to both conditions. The simultaneous treatment of these conditions could potentially lead to improvement in the overall quality of life for these women.","['Depression', 'Chronic disease', 'Endometriosis', 'steroid hormones', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Restless Leg Syndrome', 'Multimorbidity']","['Scotland Research', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'LREC', 'Committee', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

Such a scenario is commonplace in collaborative research settings in many disciplines and may occur for a number of reasons, such as excluding research in order to provide the paper with a clearer focus, tell a particular story, or exclude negative results that do not fit the hypothesis. Our concern in this paper is less about the reasons for including or excluding data from a paper and more about distributing credit in this type of scenario. In particular, we argue that the notion 'substantial contribution', which is part of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) authorship criteria, is ambiguous and that we should ask whether it concerns what ends up in the paper or what is a substantial contribution to the research process leading up to the paper. We then argue, based on the principles of fairness, due credit, and ensuring transparency and accountability in research, that the latter interpretation is more plausible from a research ethics point of view.

As first line antihypertensive drug therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have many beneficial effects. However, the use of ACEIs/ARBs in the perioperative period remains controversial. This study aims to determine the effects of withholding vs. continuing ACEIs/ARBs before non-cardiac surgery on perioperative hypotension and postoperative outcomes in older patients.  Methods:  In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, a total of 2036 patients aged 60-80 years undergoing non-cardiac surgical procedures will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive oral ACEIs/ARBs (the ACEIs/ARBs continued group) or inactive placebos (the ACEIs/ARBs withheld group) on the morning of surgery. For both groups, the ACEIs/ARBs will be continued from the first postoperative day.

The recall accuracy of read or voiced material differs depending on whether the recall is given verbally or in writing. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical for both attentional allocation and short-term memory, suggesting that different short-term memory recall modalities are associated with distinct mPFC processes and activation patterns.  Methods:  Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to monitor mPFC oxygenation parameters of 30 healthy subjects during acquisition and recall tasks as a measure of neural activity. Oxygenation parameters and recall accuracy were compared between oral and written answers and the potential correlations were analyzed.  Results:  Written responses were more accurate than verbal responses to the same questions and evoked greater changes in mPFC oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) and total Hb (total-Hb). Furthermore, there were significant positive correlations between recall accuracy and both Δ[oxyHb] and Δ[total-Hb] in the mPFC.  Conclusion:  Memory accuracy of written material is greater when responses are also written rather than verbal. In both cases, recall accuracy was correlated with the degree of mPFC activity.

We examined whole sections of normal and dysplastic gastric mucosa, as well as a tissue microarray of adenocarcinomas. Results Dysplastic gastric epithelium was marked by frequent nuclear p62 and aberrant LAMP2A expression compared to normal. Examining the pattern of LC3B/cytoplasmic p62 immuno-reactivity in gastric adenocarcinoma demonstrated a predominant pattern of LC3B High /p62 High  staining (56/86, 65.1%), which has been previously associated with active, but impaired macroautophagy. There were no statistically significant associations seen between LC3B/cytoplasmic p62 staining patterns with tumor grade, histotype, or approximated TCGA molecular subtype. LAMP2A and nuclear p62 and staining patterns were also heterogeneous across the cohort, but with no statistically significant associations seen. The prognostic significance of the three proteins was limited, however high nuclear p62 levels were associated with worse overall survival (log-rank  p -value = 0.0396). Conclusion Our data demonstrate the dynamic nature of autophagic proteins in the gastric epithelium, and we expand the biological heterogeneity observed in gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma to include autophagy.","['Biomarker', 'Autophagy', 'Chaperone-mediated Autophagy', 'Autophagy (Macroautophagy)', 'Gastric/gej Adenocarcinoma']","['Hospital research', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Ethics Statement', 'ethics board', 'Michaelâ', 'research ethics', 'Statement', 'Hospital']",[],NaN

The fate and regenerative potential of stem cells are dependent, to a great extent, on their microenvironment, which is composed of various tissue components, cell populations, and soluble factors. N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interaction has been implicated as an important factor in controlling the cell-fate commitment of mesenchymal stem cells. In this study, the effect of N-cadherin on odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs and the potential underlying mechanisms, both  in vitro  and  in vivo , was investigated using a cell culture model and a subcutaneous transplantation mouse model. It was found that the expression of N-cadherin was reversely related to the expression of odontogenic markers (dentin sialophosphoprotein, DSPP, and runt-related transcription factor 2, Runx2) during the differentiation process of DPSCs. Specific shRNA-mediated knockdown of N-cadherin expression in DPSCs significantly increased the expression of DSPP and Runx2, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and the formation of mineralized nodules. Notably, N-cadherin silencing promoted nucleus translocation and accumulation of β-catenin. Inhibition of β-catenin by a specific inhibitor XAV939, reversed the facilitating effects of N-cadherin downregulation on odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs. In addition, knockdown of N-cadherin promoted the formation of odontoblast-like cells and collagenous matrix in β-tricalcium phosphate/DPSCs composites transplanted into mice. In conclusion, N-cadherin acted as a negative regulator via regulating β-catenin activity during odontogenic differentiation of DPSCs. These data may help to guide DPSC behavior by tuning the N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interactions, with implications for pulp regeneration.","['N-cadherin', 'Β-catenin', 'Pulp Regeneration', 'Dental Pulp Stem Cells', 'Odontogenic Differentiation']","['Nanfang Hospital', 'Southern Medical', 'Medical University', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Guangzhou', 'China', 'human participants']",[],NaN

The purpose of the study was to identify maternal HLA class Ib genetic factors associated with anti-HLA allo-immunization in pregnancy and the degree of tolerance estimated by IgG4 expression. In total, 86 primiparous women with singleton pregnancies were included in the study. Maternal blood samples and umbilical cord samples were collected at delivery. Clinical data were obtained. Maternal blood serum was screened for HLA class I and II antibodies, identification of Donor Specific Antibody (DSA), activation of complement measured by C1q and IgG4 concentrations. Mothers were genotyped for HLA class Ib ( HLA-E, -F  and  -G ). Anti-HLA class I and II antibodies were identified in 24% of the women. The maternal  HLA-E*01:06  allele was significantly associated with a higher fraction of anti-HLA I immunization (20.0%  vs.  4.8%, p = 0.048). The maternal HLA-G 3'-untranslated region  UTR4-HLA-G*01:01:01:05  haplotype and the  HLA-F*01:03:01  allele were significantly associated with a low anti-HLA I C1q activation (16.7%  vs . 57.1%, p = 0.028; 16.7%  vs.  50.0%, p = 0.046; respectively).

The clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with endometriosis-related PE remain unknown.  Objectives:  We present a case of endometriosis-related PE diagnosed on pleural fluid cytology. A systematic review of all endometriosis-related PE cases in literature was conducted to elucidate the clinical characteristics, explore the diagnostic yield of pathological examinations, and to summarize the outcomes of therapeutic approaches in this disease.  Methods:  A case of endometriosis-related PE diagnosed in study hospital was reported. PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched for publications pertaining to cases of endometriosis-related PE using predefined search terms. This case and those identified from PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE were analyzed.  Results:  A total of 67 patients were included. Catamential symptoms were presented in 30 (44.8%) patients. Dyspnea was presented in 50 patients (74.6%), followed by right chest/shoulder pain in 34 (50.7%) and cough in 18 (26.9%). 82.8% of the patients had concomitant pelvic endometriosis and 76.7% was infertile or nulliparous. The diagnostic yield of pleural fluid cytological examination, percutaneous pleural biopsy, and surgical biopsy was 9.0, 45.5, and 78.7%, respectively. The patients who received surgery-based therapy had a significantly longer time to relapse than those who received progestational agents or GnRH analogs alone ( P  = 0.025) or hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy (HBSO) ( P  = 0.040).  Conclusions:  High clinical awareness of pleural endometriosis is essential in all female with hemorrhagic PE, especially in young females who have infertility and/or pelvic endometriosis. Plerual fluid cytology might be a simple minimally invasive and cost-effective modality in the diagnosis of endometriosis-related PE. Treatment is challenging due to high recurrence and the optimal management of endometriosis-related PE needs further evaluation. The combined approach by surgery and hormonal therapy may achieve the best relapse-free survival.","['Diagnosis', 'Treatment', 'Clinical features', 'Hemorrhagic Pleural Effusion', 'Thoracic Endometriosis Syndrome', 'Endometriosis-related Pleural Effusion']","['College Hospital', 'Peking Union', 'Union Medical', 'Medical College', 'Ethics Statement', 'Statement Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics approval', 'systematic review', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

This study examined the short- and longer-term effects of a wearable activity tracker combined with digital behaviour change resources on the physical activity of adolescents attending schools in socio-economically disadvantaged areas. Methods The Raising Awareness of Physical Activity (RAW-PA) Study was a 12-week, multicomponent intervention that combined a Fitbit Flex (and accompanying app), and online digital behaviour change resources and weekly challenges delivered via Facebook. RAW-PA was evaluated using a cluster-randomised controlled trial with 275 adolescents (50.2% female; 13.7 ± 0.4 years) from 18 Melbourne secondary schools (intervention n = 9; wait-list control group n = 9). The primary outcome was moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), measured using hip-worn ActiGraph accelerometers. The secondary outcome was self-reported physical activity. Data were collected at baseline, 12-weeks (immediately post-intervention), and 6-months post-intervention (follow-up). Multilevel models were used to determine the effects of the intervention on daily MVPA over time, adjusting for covariates. Results No significant differences were observed between intervention and wait-list control adolescents' device-assessed MVPA immediately post-intervention. At 6-months post-intervention, adolescents in the intervention group engaged in 5 min (95% CI: - 9.1 to - 1.0) less MVPA per day than those in the wait-list control group. Males in the intervention group engaged in 11 min (95% CI: - 17.6 to - 4.5) less MVPA than males in the wait-list control group at 6-months post-intervention. No significant differences were observed for females at either time point. For self-reported physical activity, no significant effects were found at 12-weeks and 6-months post-intervention. Conclusions Combining a wearable activity tracker with digital behaviour change resources and weekly challenges did not increase inactive adolescents' accelerometer-derived and self-reported physical activity levels immediately post-intervention. This contrasts previous research that has suggested wearable activity tracker may increase youth physical activity levels in the short-term. Lower engagement in MVPA 6-months post-intervention was observed for males but not for females, though it is unclear why this finding was observed. The results suggest wearable activity trackers, in combination with supporting materials, may not be effective for increasing physical activity levels in adolescents.

Platelets are recognized as mediators of inflammation, releasing proinflammatory and prothrombotic factors, and are hyperactivated in COVID-19 infected patients. Activated platelets have also been reported in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, putting these patients at higher risk for thromboembolic complications of COVID-19 infection. Methods A case-control study of T2D (n=33) and control subjects (n=30) who underwent a hyperinsulinemic clamp to induce normoglycemia in T2D subjects: T2D: baseline glucose 7.5 ± 0.3mmol/l (135.1 ± 5.4mg/dl), reduced to 4.5 ± 0.07mmol/l (81 ± 1.2mg/dl) with 1-hour clamp; Controls: maintained at 5.1 ± 0.1mmol/l (91.9 ± 1.8mg/dl). Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement was used to determine a panel of platelet proteins. Results Prothrombotic platelet proteins were elevated in T2D versus controls: platelet factor 4 (PF4, p Conclusion T2D patients have platelet hyperactivation, placing them at higher risk for thromboembolic events. When infected with COVID-19, this risk may be compounded, and their propensity for a more severe COVID-19 disease course increased.

Lung function decline is associated with pulmonary infections, neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. In CF, neutrophils have an altered phenotype. In this pilot study, we aimed to determine if signals of dysfunctional neutrophil responses were evident early in life and whether these signals may be associated with lung damage in later childhood. We examined the pulmonary protein profiles of 14 clinical stable infants and pre-school children with CF employing the aptamer-based affinity platform, SOMAscan®. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed on all children after age 6 years and Brody score calculated. A Spearman's rank order correlation analysis and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was used to correlate protein concentrations in early life to Brody scores in later childhood. Early life concentrations of azurocidin and myeloperoxidase, were positively correlated with Brody score after age 6 ( p  = 0.0041 and  p  = 0.0182, respectively). Four other neutrophil associated proteins; Complement C3 ( p  = 0.0026), X-ray repair CCP 6 ( p  = 0.0059), C3a anaphylatoxin des Arginine ( p  = 0.0129) and cytokine receptor common subunit gamma ( p  = 0.0214) were all negatively correlated with Brody scores. Interestingly, patients with more severe lung damage after age 6 had significantly lower levels of IL-22 in early years of life ( p  = 0.0243). IL-22 has scarcely been reported to have implications in CF. Identification of early biomarkers that may predict more severe disease progression is particularly important for the future development of early therapeutic interventions in CF disease.

The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between mentalizing and personality functioning in patients with subthreshold or diagnosed borderline personality disorder. A total of 116 eligible participants were included. Mentalizing was assessed using the Mentalization Questionnaire (MZQ), personality functioning (self- and interpersonal functioning) was assessed using the Level of Personality Functioning Scale-Brief Form 2.0 (LPFS-BF), and borderline severity was assessed using the Zanarini Rating Scale (ZAN-BPD).

We found a significant relationship between borderline severity and both subscales of the LPFS-BF. Mentalizing fully and significantly mediated the relationship between borderline severity and interpersonal functioning. However, mentalizing only partly mediated the relationship between borderline severity and self-functioning. Controlling for the covariates gender and age did not impact the results. Mentalizing is likely to be involved in the ICD-11 model of personality functioning, especially interpersonal functioning.

Ethics Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee at the Medical Faculty of the University of Tuebingen (909/2020BO2).," Objective:  To evaluate the clinical value of early post-operative computed tomographic angiography (CTA) after direct extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery in moyamoya patients.  Methods:  A retrospective analysis of all adult moyamoya patients treated at our center from 2013 to 2019 with a direct EC-IC bypass was performed. Early post-operative CTA (within 24 h after surgery) was compared with conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) 6-12 months after surgery. If available, magnetic resonance time-of-flight angiography (MR-TOF) was evaluated 3 months and 6-12 months post-operatively as well. Imaging results were analyzed and compared with CTA, MR-TOF and DSA, whereat DSA was used as the final and definite modality to decide on bypass patency.  Results:  A total of 103 direct EC-IC bypasses in 63 moyamoya patients were analyzed. All inclusion criteria were met in 32 patients (53 direct bypasses). In 84.9% the bypass appeared definitively, in 5.7% uncertainly and in 9.4% not patent according to early post-operative CTA. MR-TOF suggested definitive bypass patency in 86.8% 3 months after surgery and in 93.5% 6-12 months after surgery. DSA 6-12 months post-operatively showed a patency in 98.1% of all bypasses. The positive predictive value (to correctly detect an occluded bypass) on post-operative CTA was 12.5%, the negative predictive value (to correctly detect a patent bypass) was 100% with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 86.5%.  Conclusion:  Early post-operative CTA has a high predictive value to confirm the patency of a bypass. On the other hand, a high false positive rate of (according to CTA) occluded bypasses after direct EC-IC bypass surgery can be seen. This must be considered critically when initiating possible therapeutic measures.","['Revascularization', 'CTA', 'Neurosurgery', 'Computed Tomographic Angiography', 'Moyamoya', 'Ec-ic Bypass', 'Mr-tof', 'Magnetic Resonance Time-of-flight Angiography']","['Medical Faculty', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'Ethics Ethical', 'Tuebingen', 'Statement']",[],NaN

The aim of this study was to investigate whether itch intensity and mindfulness are related to itch catastrophizing in AD patients. Participants receiving treatment for AD ( n  = 155; 58 male; mean age: 46.5 ± 12 years) completed measures of itch-related catastrophizing (Itch Cognitions Questionnaire; ICQ) and mindfulness (Comprehensive Inventory of Mindfulness; CHIME) during their stay at a rehabilitation center in Borkum, Germany.

A positive relationship between itch intensity and itch catastrophizing was found ( r  = 0.409;  p   R   2  = 0.274;  p  < 0.001) of the variance of itch catastrophizing. Thus, itch intensity and certain facets of mindfulness were associated with itch catastrophizing in AD patients. Psychological interventions aiming to increase acting with awareness might have a buffering effect on itch catastrophizing, which in turn could lead to lower itch intensity in patients with AD. Future RCTs should test this hypothesis.","['Rehabilitation', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Mindfulness', 'Itch', 'Itch Catastrophizing']","['Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Statement', 'Committee', 'Department', 'Medicine', 'Ethics Ethical']",[],NaN

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between childhood trauma and the age of first-time drug use among methamphetamine-dependent patients. Moreover, we analyzed the characteristics of adverse family environment associated with severe childhood trauma and the risk factors for starting drugs in minors. A baseline interview was conducted with 110 participants who were in detoxification, including demographic information, past substance use, and age of first-time drug use. The participants' childhood trauma experience before 18 years of age was evaluated using the simplified version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF). The Chinese version of the Family Environment Scale (FES-CV) was used to assess the family environment of methamphetamine-dependent patients. Among 110 non-injecting methamphetamine-dependent patients, nearly half ( n  = 48, 43.6%) had moderate and severe childhood trauma. Correlation analysis showed that the age of first-time drug use negatively correlated with emotional abuse ( r  = -0.32,  p   r  = -0.27,  p   r  = -0.20,  p   r  = -0.22,  p   r  = 0.28,  p   r  = -0.45,  p   r  = 0.49,  p   r  = 0.33,  p  < 0.01). Additionally, the regression model showed that when emotional abuse increased by one point, the age of first-time drug use was 0.69 years earlier. These findings suggest that a detrimental family environment can aggravate childhood trauma, and the experience of childhood emotional or physical abuse may be an effective predictor of early drug use among methamphetamine-dependent patients.","['methamphetamine', 'Family Environment', 'Childhood Trauma', 'Minor', 'Age Of First-time Drug Use']","['Medical University', 'Chaohu Hospital', 'Anhui Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Ethics', 'human participants', 'University']",[],NaN

A health education program to the caregivers is one of the important elements in increasing the knowledge and skills in managing patients at home. The specific objectives of this study were to determine caregiver's stress level in managing post total knee replacement (TKR) patients pre and post of a health education program.  Materials and Methods:  A clinical intervention trial design was conducted in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia (HUSM) with a sample size of 32 caregivers. A validated Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) questionnaire was used to measure the stress level pre and post of the health education program on the management of patients post-TKR surgery which was adopted from Fresno Surgical Hospital in California.  Results:  The findings showed that there was a significant difference between pre and post level of stress ( p  ≤ 0.001).  Conclusion:  This study revealed the positive outcome of the health education program. It reduced the stress level among the caregivers in caring for their relatives with post-TKR surgery.,"['Mental health', 'Total Knee Replacement', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Stress Level', 'Health Education Programme']","['Ethics Committee', 'Medical Center', 'Universiti Sains', 'Sains Malaysia', 'Universiti Kebangsaan', 'Kebangsaan Malaysia', 'Malaysia Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'Malaysia Human']",[],NaN

Our aim was to identify the barriers and perceptions of the Ethics consult service for physicians, advance practice providers (APPs), and nurses at our urban academic medical center which might contribute to underutilization. Methods This was a cross-sectional single-health system, anonymous written online survey, which was developed by the UCSD Health Clinical Ethics Committee and distributed by Survey Monkey. We compare responses between physicians, APPs, and nurses using standard parametric and non-parametric statistical methods. Satisfaction with ethics consult and likelihood of calling Ethics service again were assessed using a 0-100 scale using a 5-likert response structured (0 being ""not helpful at all"" to 100 being ""extremely helpful"") and results presented using box plots and interquartile ranges (IQR). Results From January to July 2019, approximately 3800 surveys were sent to all physicians, APPs and nurses with a return rate of 5.5-10%. Although the majority of respondents had encountered an ethical dilemma (85-92.1%) only approximately half had ever requested an Ethics consult. The primary reason for physicians never having requested a consult was that they never felt the need for help (41%). For APPs the primary reasons were not knowing an Ethics consult service was available (33.3%) or not knowing how to contact Ethics (27.8%). For nurses, it was not knowing how to contact the Ethics consult service (30.8%) or not feeling the need for help (26.2%). The median satisfaction score (IQR) for Ethics consult services rated on a 0-100 scale, from physicians was 76 (29), for AAPs 89 (49), and nurses 70 (40) (p = 0.62). The median (IQR) of likelihood of consulting Ethics in the future also on a 0-100 scale was 71 (47) for physicians, 69 (45) for APPs, and 61 (45) for nurses (p = 0.79). APP's and nurses were significantly more likely than physicians to believe that the team did not act on the Ethics consult's recommendations. Conclusions Based on the results presented, we were able to identify actionable steps to better engage healthcare providers-and in particular APPs and nurses-and scale up institutional educational efforts to increase awareness of the role of the Ethics consult service at our institution. Actionable steps included implementing a system of ongoing feedback that is critical for the sustainability of the Ethics service role. We hope this project can serve as a blueprint for other hospital-based Ethics consult services to improve the quality of their programs.","['Barriers', 'Ethics Consultation', 'Staff Survey']",[],[],NaN

The present study employs a simple paradigm in which event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to a single auditory stimulus that was presented rapidly or very slowly while the participant was engaged in a visual task. A multi-channel EEG was recorded in 20 healthy older adults and 20 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In two different conditions, a single 80 dB sound pressure level (SPL) auditory stimulus was presented every 1.5 s (fast condition) or every 12.0 s (slow condition). Participants were instructed to watch a silent video and ignore the auditory stimuli. Auditory processing thus occurred passively. When the auditory stimuli were presented rapidly (every 1.5 s), N1 and P2 amplitudes did not differ between the two groups. When the stimuli were presented very slowly, the amplitude of N1 and P2 increased in both groups and their latencies were prolonged. The amplitude of N1 did not significantly differ between the two groups. However, the subsequent positivity was reduced in people with MCI compared to healthy older adults. This late positivity in the slow condition may reflect a delayed P2 or a summation of a composite P2 + P3a. In people with MCI, the priority of processing may not be switched from the visual task to the potentially much more relevant auditory input. ERPs offer promise as a means to identify the pathology underlying cognitive impairment associated with MCI.","['Event-related potentials', 'Biomarker', 'Mci', 'Mild Cognitive Impairment', 'Erps']","['Research Institute', 'Ethics Boards', 'Ethics Statement', 'Institute Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Boards', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'Statement']",[],NaN

Design:  A voluntary and uncompensated cross-sectional online survey.  Setting:  Online population (≥18 years).  Respondents:  Two hundred and eighty-six respondents (66% women) who had used codeine containing medicines in the last 3 months and were living in the UK.  Results:  Of the respondents (mean age = 35.4 years, SD = 12.5), more than half were employed. Only 3.5% respondents reported no income. The majority of respondents (45.1%) primarily obtained prescription-only codeine from a consultation with a health professional, whilst 40.9% mainly purchased ""over-the-counter"" codeine containing medicines in a pharmacy without a medical prescription. Principal component analysis indicated a single factor solution accounting for 75% of the variance. Factor loadings ranged from 0.83 to 0.89. Cronbach's Alpha was high (α = 0.92). Several behaviors relating to codeine use were found to significantly predict probable codeine dependence. These included: daily codeine use in the last 3 months (OR = 66.89, 95% CI = 15.8-283.18); tolerance to codeine (OR = 32.14, 95% CI = 13.82-74.75); problems with role responsibility due to intoxication (OR = 9.89, 95% CI = 4.95-19.78); having sought advice on the internet to manage codeine use (OR = 9.56, 95% CI = 4.5-20.31); history of alcohol or drug treatment (OR = 3.73, 95% CI = 1.88-7.43).  Conclusions:  The SDS was acceptable and feasible to use to assess probable psychological codeine dependence in an online sample of people using codeine containing medicines. SDS scores were associated with behaviors known to be indicators of codeine dependence.

Despite the absence of common risk factors in this patient, he developed external compression of the bilateral internal jugular veins by a lateral mass of the C1 vertebra and expansion of the carotid artery. Because of his elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen concentrations, which are associated with ongoing activation of the coagulation system, the patient underwent treatment with batroxobin combined with anticoagulation.

However, the biological function and mechanism of 7SK in cancer are largely unclear. Here, we show that 7SK is down-regulated in human tongue squamous carcinoma (TSCC) and acts as a TSCC suppressor through multiple cell-based assays including a migration assay and a xenograft mouse model. The expression level of 7SK was negatively correlated with the size of tumors in the 73 in-house collected TSCC patients. Through combined analysis of 7SK knockdown of RNA-Seq and available published 7SK ChIRP-seq data, we identified 27 of 7SK-regulated genes that were involved in tumor regulation and whose upstream regulatory regions were bound by 7SK. Motif analysis showed that the regulatory sequences of these genes were enriched for transcription factors  FOXJ3  and  THRA , suggesting a potential involvement of  FOXJ3  and  THRA  in 7SK-regulated genes. Interestingly, the augmented level of  FOXJ3  in TSCC patients and previous reports on  THRA  in other cancers have suggested that these two factors may promote TSCC progression. In support of this idea, we found that 21 out of 27 aforementioned 7SK-associated genes were regulated by  FOXJ3  and  THRA , and 12 of them were oppositely regulated by 7SK and  FOXJ3/THRA . We also found that  FOXJ3  and  THRA  dramatically promoted migration in SCC15 cells.

Two readers (R1 and R2) independently applied the BAC-SS to medio-lateral oblique views, obtaining a BAC score by summing: (I) number of calcified vessels (from 0 to n); (II) vessel opacification, i.e., the degree of artery coverage by calcium bright pixels (0 or 1); and (III) length class of calcified vessels (from 0 to 4). R1 repeated the assessment 2 weeks later. Scoring time was recorded. Cohen's κ statistics and Bland-Altman analysis were used. Results Among 408 women, 57 (14%) had BAC; 114 medio-lateral oblique views were assessed. Median BAC score was 4 [interquartile range (IQR): 3-6] for R1 and 4 (IQR: 2-6) for R2 (P=0.417) while median scoring time was 156 s (IQR: 99-314 s) for R1 and 191 s (IQR: 137-292 s) for R2 (P=0.743). Bland-Altman analysis showed a 77% intra-reader reproducibility [bias: 0.193, coefficient of repeatability (CoR): 0.955] and a 64% inter-reader reproducibility (bias: 0.211, CoR: 1.516). Cohen's κ for BAC presence was 0.968 for intra-reader agreement and 0.937 for inter-reader agreement. Conclusions Our BAC-SS has a good intra- and inter-reader reproducibility, within acceptable scoring times. A large-scale study is warranted to test its ability to stratify cardiovascular risk in women.","['Cardiovascular diseases', 'Biomarkers', 'Reproducibility of results', 'mammography', 'Mönckeberg Medial Calcific Sclerosis']",[],[],NaN

Statins have anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering effects, which suggest that statins may play an important role in the prevention and treatment of AAD. Some retrospective studies show that statins can protect patients with aortic dissection. However, the effect of statins on the survival of AAD patients has been scarcely investigated, especially in randomized trials. In this study, we will perform a randomized clinical trial to understand whether statins can reduce in-hospital mortality of AAD patients. Methods A total of 384 subjects diagnosed with AAD in the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College will be recruited. Participants will be randomly divided into an atorvastatin-treated or control group. The primary outcome will be the in-hospital mortality at 30 days. Discussion This study is designed to verify the efficacy of atorvastatin on reducing in-hospital mortality of patients with AAD. The aim is to provide a new means of improving survival as a complement to conventional drug therapy. Trial registration Chinese Clinical Trials Registry ChiCTR1900023515 .

Herein we evaluated the interest in measuring the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), a biomarker of intestinal injury, in COVID-19 patients. Methods Serum I-FABP was analyzed in 28 consecutive patients hospitalized for a PCR-confirmed COVID-19, in 24 hospitalized patients with non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases, and 79 patients admitted to the emergency room for abdominal pain. Results I-FABP serum concentrations were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19, as compared to patients with non-COVID-19 pulmonary diseases [70.3 pg/mL (47-167.9) vs. 161.1 pg/mL (88.98-305.2), respectively, p = 0.008]. I-FABP concentrations in these two populations were significantly lower than in patients with abdominal pain without COVID-19 [344.8 pg/mL (268.9-579.6)]. I-FABP was neither associated with severity nor the duration of symptoms. I-FABP was correlated with polymorphonuclear cell counts. Conclusions In this pilot study, we observed a low I-FABP concentration in COVID-19 patients either with or without gastrointestinal symptoms, of which the pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical impact remain to be established.

The study also attempted to assess tobacco use initiation age, tobacco dependency, and to identify factors associated with current tobacco use. This 2019 cross-sectional study was conducted among governmental employees and University students in Qatar using cluster sampling methodology. Study participants completed a self-administered, country-adapted summarized version of the Global Adult Tobacco Survey. 25.2% (n = 1741; N = 6904) of the surveyed sample reported current tobacco use. 21.5% (n = 1481) smoked tobacco (cigarettes, waterpipe, medwakh and cigar) concomitant with other forms of tobacco and only 1.0% (n = 69) were using other forms of tobacco (electronic cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and heat-not-burn tobacco products) and 2.7% (n = 191) did not mention the type of tobacco products used by them. Of the 1550 tobacco users, 42.8% were cigarette smokers, 20.9% waterpipe, 3.2% medwakh (Arabic traditional pipe) and 0.7% cigar. Moreover, 1.9% reported smokeless tobacco use (sweika), 2.0% electronic cigarette use, and 0.3% heat-not-burn tobacco use. The mean age for smoking initiation was 19.7±5.3 (Qataris 18.6±4.8 and non-Qataris 20.3±5.6). Using multivariable logistic regression, significant association was observed between tobacco use and gender, nationality, age, monthly income, living with a smoker, and self-rated health.

Static stretching intervention was performed using a stretching board for 1,800 s at 2 days per week for 5 weeks. DF ROM was assessed, and muscle stiffness was calculated from passive torque and muscle elongation during passive dorsiflexion test. The results showed significant changes in DF ROM and muscle stiffness after the stretching intervention program, but the values returned to baseline after the detraining period.

There is no data available on the correlation between responses to different vaccines. In this study, we investigated the correlation of antibody responses between routine vaccine antigens in infants. Methods One and seven months after the 6-month vaccinations and one month after the 12-month vaccinations, antibody concentrations to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio (serotypes 1-3),  Haemophilus influenzae  type b (Hib), pneumococcus (13 serotypes), meningococcus C, measles, mumps and rubella were measured using fluorescent bead-based multiplex immune-assays. For the correlation of antibody responses, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (ρ) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated between responses to each vaccine antigen. Results The correlation between concentrations of antibodies to the vaccinations ending at 6 months of age was higher one month compared to seven months after vaccination. The strongest correlations at both time points were observed between antibody responses to different polio serotypes, certain pneumococcal serotypes and between responses to diphtheria and pneumococcal (conjugated to a diphtheria toxoid) vaccine antigens. Correlation between responses to tetanus, Hib, pertussis, polio and other vaccine antigens were weak. The correlation between antibody responses to the 12-month vaccine antigens was weaker than to the 6-month vaccine antigens and there was a negative correlation between responses to measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and non-live vaccine antigens (meningococcus C, tetanus and Hib). There was only weak correlation between antibody responses to vaccines of the same type (e.g. conjugated polysaccharide or toxoid vaccines). Conclusion Correlation between antibody responses to similar antigens in the same vaccine (such as different serotypes of a bacteria or virus), as well as responses to antigens conjugated to similar carrier proteins, are strong. In contrast, correlation between responses to other vaccines are weak.

In order to tackle the devastating condition of the virus, countries need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics. Thus, to strengthen the COVID-19 mitigation measures and to give rapid response, there is an urgent need to understand the public's knowledge and attitude about of the pandemic at this critical moment. Objective This study was aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of communities about COVID-19 and associated factors among Gondar City residents. Methods A community based cross-sectional study was done among 623 respondents in Gondar city from April 20-27/2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire adapted from different literatures. The data were entered using Epi data version 3.1 and then exported into STATA version 14 for analysis. Bi-variable and multivariable binary logistic regression were performed. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to declare statistically significant variables on the basis of p value less than 0.05 in the multivariable binary logistic regression model.

We explored the effect of county-level SFO strength with smoking prevalence and lung cancer incidence in Indiana. Methods We obtained county-level lung cancer incidence from the Indiana State Cancer Registry and county-level characteristics from the Indiana Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Commission's policy database between 1995 and 2016. Using generalized estimating equations, we performed multivariable analyses of smoking prevalence and age-adjusted lung cancer rates with respect to the strength of smoke-free ordinances at the county level over time. Results Of Indiana's 92 counties, 24 had a SFO by 2011. In 2012, Indiana enacted a state-wide SFO enforcing at least moderate level SFO protection. Mean age-adjusted lung cancer incidence per year was 76.8 per 100,000 population and mean smoking prevalence per year was 25% during the study period. Counties with comprehensive or moderate SFO had a smoking prevalence 1.2% (95% CI [-1.88, -0.52]) lower compared with counties with weak or no SFO. Counties that had comprehensive or moderate SFO also had an 8.4 (95% CI [-11.5, -5.3]) decrease in new lung cancer diagnosis per 100,000 population per year compared with counties that had weak or no SFO.

LATITUDE studies have confirmed that the combination of abiraterone and prednisone (5 mg/d) can be used for the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer, and have achieved satisfactory results. However, it has not been reported that abiraterone combined with prednisone (5 mg/d) in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patient concerns Here, we present a case of high-risk advanced prostate cancer with old pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The patient developed a relapse of old tuberculosis in both lungs that were discovered following 14 months of continuous application of prednisone (10 mg/d). Diagnosis The histopathological findings showed prostate adenocarcinoma carcinoma with a Gleason score of 10 (5+5). Further laboratory investigations were suggestive of positive mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA in pleural effusion and sputum. Interventions The patient underwent endocrine therapy, chemotherapy of docetaxel plus prednisone, radiotherapy, and abiraterone combined with prednisone treatment, but he eventually developed into the mCRPC stage. Then, prednisone was reduced to 5 mg/d plus abiraterone, and combined with anti-tuberculosis treatment according to multi-disciplinary diagnosis and treatment. Outcome Two months later, pleural effusion and atelectasis were relieved, and PSA was remained stable at a low level. The patient achieved complete remission. Conclusion We cannot, with complete certainty, say that this patient, or any patient, developed old PTB recurrence due to the use of prednisone. Based on the current evidence, endocrine therapy is the foundation, radiotherapy can reduce the tumor load, and early application of abiraterone is beneficial to survival for the high-risk mCRPC. The long-term use of prednisone can be appropriately reduced in mCRPC with old PTB, and a satisfactory curative effect can be achieved. More prospective trials are warranted before a definite recommendation could be drawn.",[],"['Henan University', 'Technology Affiliated', 'Ethics statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'statement Ethics', 'accompanying images', 'informed consent', 'case reports', 'Ethics', 'Hospital']",[],NaN

A comparison of their obtainment procedures was also considered. The aim was to determine the diagnostic accuracy for detection of malignancy in oral brush biopsies. PICO-Statement: In this consecutive and retrospective study we had as population of interests, patients with oral lesions, the intervention was the brush biopsy with two different cell collectors and the control was healthy oral mucosa. The outcome of the study was to compare both cell collectors. Methods From 2009 to 2018, 2018 patients with oral lesions were studied using the nylon brush (666 cases) and rigid brush (1352 cases). In the first cohort five smears per patient were taken with the nylon brush, while each patient received one smear with the rigid brush in the second cohort. These were further processed in a liquid-based procedure. Cytological evaluations were categorised into 'negative', which were considered as negative, whereas 'doubtful', 'suspicious' and 'positive' cytological results were overall considered as positive for malignancy in comparison to the final histological diagnoses. Additionally, the clinical expenditure for each collector was estimated. Results 2018 clinically and histologically proven diagnoses were established, including 181 cases of squamous cell carcinomas, 524 lichen, 454 leukoplakias, 34 erythroplakias and 825 other benign lesions. The sensitivity and specificity of the nylon brush was 93.8% (95% CI 91.6-95.5%) and 94.2% (95% CI 91.8-95.5%) respectively, whereas it was 95.6% (95% CI 94.4-96.6%) and 84.9% (95% CI 83.8-87.5%) for the rigid brush. The temporal advantage using the plastic brushes was 4×  higher in comparison to the nylon brush. The risk suffering from a malignant oral lesion when the result of the brushes was positive, suspicious, or doubtful was significantly high for both tests (nylon brush OR: 246.3; rigid brush OR: 121.5). Conclusions Both systems have a similar sensitivity, although only the rigid brush achieved a satisfactory specificity. Additional methods, such as DNA image cytometry, should also be considered to improve the specificity. Furthermore, the rigid brush proved to be more effective at taking a sufficient number of cells, whilst also being quicker and presenting less stress for the patient.","['Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Oral Cancer', 'Liquid-based Cytology', 'Brush Biopsy']",[],[],NaN

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the most common pathogen causing UTI, is a highly heterogeneous group of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) which may carry a variety of virulence factors and belonging to different phylogenetic backgrounds. The current study aimed to investigate the frequency and association between various virulence factors (VFs) and phylogenetic groups of UPEC and commensal isolates. Methods UPEC and commensal E. coli strains isolated from UTI and feces of healthy humans were compared for the presence of VFs and phylogenetic groups. Association between virulence genes was investigated and cluster analysis was employed. Results According to the results, among a 30 virulence markers tested, the pathogenicity-associated island (PAI), papAH, papEF, fimH, fyuA, and traT genes prevalence were statistically significant in UPEC isolates. A strong association was found between the B2 and D phylogenetic groups and clinical isolates of UPEC; while, commensal isolates were mostly associated with phylogenetic group A. The aggregated VFs scores were more than twice higher in the UPEC isolates in comparison with the commensal isolates. Interestingly, the B2 group in both UPEC and commensal isolates had the highest VF scores. A strong positive association was found between several virulence genes. The clustering results demonstrated that UPEC or commensal E. coli isolates were highly heterogeneous due to different composition of their virulence gene pool and pathogenicity islands. Conclusion Genetic structure and VFs of UPEC strains vary from region to region; therefore, to control the UTI, the epidemiological aspects and characterization of the UPEC isolates need to be investigated in different regions. Since UPEC isolates are generally originate from the commensal strains, it may be feasible to reduce the UTI burden by interfering the intestinal colonization, particularly in the highly pathogenic clonal lineages such as B2.","['Urinary tract infection', 'Phylogenetic group', 'Virulence factor', 'Uropathogenic Escherichia Coli', 'Extraintestinal Pathogenic E.

Methods We investigated the characteristics of the ST11 subclones using core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST). Ninety-three carbapenemase-producing  K. pneumoniae  isolates were collected at Shenzhen People's Hospital. Then, whole-genome sequencing and cgMLST were used to discriminate apparent subclones within the ST11 group. Results We analyzed the prevalence and genetic relationships of these subclones. ST11 and  K. pneumoniae  carbapenemase (KPC-2) were the predominant genotype and carbapenemase, respectively, in the clinical carbapenemase-producing  K. pneumoniae  strains. cgMLST scheme genotyping divided the ST11 group into two clades across seven complex types (CTs). CT1313 was the most prevalent subclone. The deletion of  galF  and a high frequency of SNPs in genes associated with the stress- and SOS-responses were found in CT1291 and CT2405 over time, respectively.

However, data availability remains a challenge due to complex privacy requirements. This challenge can potentially be addressed using synthetic data. Setting Replication of a published stage III colon cancer trial secondary analysis using synthetic data generated by a machine learning method. Participants There were 1543 patients in the control arm that were included in our analysis. Primary and secondary outcome measures Analyses from a study published on the real dataset were replicated on synthetic data to investigate the relationship between bowel obstruction and event-free survival. Information theoretic metrics were used to compare the univariate distributions between real and synthetic data. Percentage CI overlap was used to assess the similarity in the size of the bivariate relationships, and similarly for the multivariate Cox models derived from the two datasets. Results Analysis results were similar between the real and synthetic datasets. The univariate distributions were within 1% of difference on an information theoretic metric. All of the bivariate relationships had CI overlap on the tau statistic above 50%. The main conclusion from the published study, that lack of bowel obstruction has a strong impact on survival, was replicated directionally and the HR CI overlap between the real and synthetic data was 61% for overall survival (real data: HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.2; synthetic data: HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.87) and 86% for disease-free survival (real data: HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.95; synthetic data: HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.1).

The new ACOs will receive $1.8 billion dollars in state and federal funding over 5 years through the Delivery System Reform Incentive Program (DSRIP). The multi-faceted study described in this protocol aims to address gaps in knowledge about Medicaid ACOs' impact on healthcare value by identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation and sustainment of the DSRIP-funded programs.  Methods and analysis:  The study's four components are: (1) Document Review to characterize the ACOs and CPs; (2) Semi-structured Key Informant Interviews (KII) with ACO and CP leadership, state-level Medicaid administrators, and patients; (3) Site visits with selected ACOs and CPs; and (4) Surveys of ACO clinical teams and CP staff. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research's (CFIR) serves as the study's conceptual framework; its versatile menu of constructs, arranged across five domains (Intervention Characteristics, Inner Setting, Outer Setting, Characteristics of Individuals, and Processes) guides identification of barriers and facilitators across multiple organizational contexts. For example, KII interview guides focus on understanding how Inner and Outer Setting factors may impact implementation. Document Review analysis includes extraction and synthesis of ACO-specific DSRIP-funded programs (i.e., Intervention Characteristics); KIIs and site visit data will be qualitatively analyzed using thematic analytic techniques; surveys will be analyzed using descriptive statistics (e.g., counts, frequencies, means, and standard deviations).  Discussion:  Understanding barriers and facilitators to implementing and sustaining Medicaid ACOs with varied organizational structures will provide critical context for understanding the overall impact of the Medicaid ACO experiment in Massachusetts. It will also provide important insights for other states considering the ACO model for their Medicaid programs.  Ethics and dissemination:  IRB determinations were that the overall study did not constitute human subjects research and that each phase of primary data collection should be submitted for IRB review and approval. Study results will be disseminated through traditional channels such as peer reviewed journals, through publicly available reports on the mass.gov website; and directly to key stakeholders in ACO and CP leadership.","['Implementation', 'Medicaid', 'Disparities', 'Value-based Care', 'Accountable Care Organization']","['IRB review', 'Review Board', 'Institutional Review', 'IRB', 'Review', 'study', 'Ethics', 'data', 'investigation', 'ensure']",[],NaN

Written informed consent to participate in this study was provided by the participants' legal guardian/next of kin.,"In this study, we tested a possible mechanism of the association between math anxiety and math achievement: the mediating role of math-specific grit (i.e., sustaining effort in the face of adversity when learning math). In Study 1, a sample of 10th grade students (N = 222) completed a battery of personality and attitude questionnaires, and math achievement was indexed by curriculum-based examination scores. Mediation analyses indicated that math-specific grit, but not domain-general grit, mediated the relationship between math anxiety and math achievement. In Study 2, we replicated and extended the above findings with another sample of 11th grade students (N = 465). Mediation analyses indicated that math-specific grit and math-specific procrastination played sequential mediating roles in the relationship between math anxiety and math achievement. That is, individuals with higher math anxiety were less gritty in math learning, possibly further leading them to be more procrastinated in performing math work, which may finally result in worse math achievement. In summary, the current study provides the first evidence that math-specific grit may mediate the relationship between math anxiety and math achievement. Furthermore, it also demonstrated the value of math-specific grit over domain-general grit in predicting math success, which invites a broader investigation on subject-specific grit.","['Procrastination', 'Math Anxiety', 'Math Achievement', 'Chinese Adolescent', 'Grit']","['Dali University', 'Ethics Statement', 'Medical Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'University', 'Ethics', 'Statement']",[],NaN

However, the underlying mechanism and the interaction between APEX1 and LINC00470 in melanoma are not clear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of LINC00470 in the development of melanoma in this work. We discovered that LINC00470 was overexpressed in melanoma tissues and cells compared with the adjacent normal tissues and cells by qPCR. The overexpression of LINC00470 promoted the proliferation and migration of melanoma cells. The functional investigation demonstrated that LINC00470 activated the transcription factor, ZNF131, to regulate the APEX1 expression, which finally promoted cell proliferation and migration. In contrast, knockdown of LINC00470 could significantly inhibit the melanoma cell proliferation and migration, and suppress the growth of tumor in vivo. Overexpression of APEX1 could reverse the impact of the silence of LINC00470 in melanoma cells. In summary, our studies revealed that LINC00470 promoted melanoma proliferation and migration by enhancing the expression of APEX1, which indicated that LINC00470 might be a therapeutic target for the treatment of melanoma.",[],[],[],NaN

Methods:  Twenty patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy had cardiac magnetic resonance assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and  31 P MRS to determine myocardial Phosphocreatine/Adenosine Triphosphate Ratio (PCr/ATP) at three time points: pre-, mid-, and end-chemotherapy. Plasma high sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I) tests and electrocardiograms were also performed at these same time points.  Results:  Phosphocreatine/Adenosine Triphosphate did not change significantly between pre- and mid-chemo (2.16 ± 0.46 vs. 2.00 ± 0.56,  p  = 0.80) and pre- and end-chemo (2.16 ± 0.46 vs. 2.17 ± 0.86,  p  = 0.99). Mean LVEF reduced significantly by 5.1% between pre- and end-chemo (61.4 ± 4.4 vs. 56.3 ± 8.1 %,  p  = 0.02). Change in PCr/ATP ratios from pre- to end-chemo correlated inversely with changes in LVEF over the same period ( r  = -0.65,  p  = 0.006). Plasma cTn-I increased progressively during chemotherapy from pre- to mid-chemo (1.35 ± 0.81 to 4.40 ± 2.64 ng/L;  p  = 0.01) and from mid- to end-chemo (4.40 ± 2.64 to 18.33 ± 13.23 ng/L;  p  = 0.001).  Conclusions:  In this small cohort pilot study, we did not observe a clear change in mean PCr/ATP values during chemotherapy despite evidence of increased plasma cardiac biomarkers and reduced LVEF. Future similar studies should be adequately powered to take account of patient drop-out and variable changes in PCr/ATP and could include T1 and T2 mapping.","['Troponin', 'Breast cancer', 'Chemotherapy', 'Ejection fraction', 'Cardiac Energetics']","['Ethics Committee', 'Lothian Research', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Ethics', 'Committee', 'Scotland Research', 'Lothian']",[],NaN

However, predicting the clinical response to immunotherapy remains a dilemma for clinicians. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the associations between  EVA1B  expression and prognosis and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in glioma. Methods Firstly, we detected the  EVA1B  expression in glioma tissues through biological databases. The chi-squared test, Kaplan-Meier, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to analyze the clinical significance of  EVA1B  expression. The correlation between  EVA1B  expression and levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in glioma tissues was investigated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare the predictive power between  EVA1B  and other commonly immune-related markers. Results In the CGGA cohort of 325 glioma patients, we found that  EVA1B  was upregulated in glioma, and increased with tumor grade. High  EVA1B  expression was prominently associated with unfavorable clinicopathological features, and poorer survival of patients, which were further confirmed by TCGA (n=609) and GEO (n=74) cohorts. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that  EVA1B  is an independent prognostic biomarker for glioma. Importantly,  EVA1B  overexpression was associated with a higher infiltration level of CD4 +  T cells, CD8 +  T cells, B cells, macrophages, and neutrophils in glioma. ROC curves showed that, compared with  PD-L1 ,  CTLA-4 , and  Siglec15 ,  EVA1B  presented a higher area under the curve (AUC) value (AUC=0.824) for predicting high immune infiltration levels in glioma. Conclusions We found that  EVA1B  was upregulated and could act as a poor prognostic biomarker in glioma. Importantly,  EVA1B  overexpression was associated with the immune infiltration levels of immune cells including B cells, CD4 +  T cells, CD8 +  T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, and strongly with the overall immune infiltration levels of glioma. These findings suggested that  EVA1B  might be a potential biomarker for evaluating prognosis and immune infiltration in glioma.","['Glioma', 'Prognosis', 'Biomarker', 'Microenvironment', 'Eva1b']","['Lishui Peopleâ', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Peopleâ', 'Statement', 'Lishui', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

In July 2019, a new midwifery caseload model of care was implemented in rural South Australia to provide midwifery continuity of care and promote a sustainable workforce in the area. The model is unique as it brings together five birthing sites connecting midwives, doctors, nurses and community teams. A critical precursor to successful implementation requires those working in the model be ready to adopt to the change. We surveyed clinicians at the five sites transitioning to the new model of care in order to assess their organizational readiness to implement change. Methods A descriptive study assessing readiness for change was measured using the Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change scale (ORIC). The 12 item Likert scale measures a participant's commitment to change and change efficacy. All clinicians working within the model of care (midwives, nurses and doctors) were invited to complete an e-survey. Results Overall, 55% (56/102) of clinicians participating in the model responded. The mean ORIC score was 41.5 (range 12-60) suggesting collectively, midwives, nurses and doctors began the new model of care with a sense of readiness for change. Participants were most likely to agree on the change efficacy statements, ""People who work here feel confident that the organization can get people invested in implementing this change and the change commitment statements ""People who work here are determined to implement this change"", ""People who work here want to implement this change"", and ""People who work here are committed to implementing this change. Conclusion Results of the ORIC survey indicate that clinicians transitioning to the new model of care were willing to embrace change and commit to the new model. The process of organizational change in health care settings is challenging and a continuous process. If readiness for change is high, organizational members invest more in the change effort and exhibit greater persistence to overcome barriers and setbacks. This is the first reported use of the instrument amongst midwives and nurses in Australia and should be considered for use in other national and international clinical implementation studies.","['Australia', 'Midwifery', 'Workforce', 'Continuity Of Care', 'Rural And Remote', 'Oric', 'Organizational Readiness']",[],[],NaN

Methods A survey was designed by Lupus Europe's patient advisory network and distributed through its social media, newsflash and members' network. People with lupus were asked about their last HCQ purchases and their level of anxiety (on a 0-10 scale) with regard to not being able to have access to HCQ, once in April 2020 (first wave) and after 11 August (second wave). The results were compared. Results 2075 patients responded during the first wave; 1001 (48.2%) could get HCQ from the first place they asked, 230 (11.1%) could get the drug by going to more than one pharmacy, 498 (24.0%) obtained HCQ later from their usual pharmacy and 126 (6.1%) from other sources. 188 (9.1%) could not get any; 32 (1.5%) did not respond to this question. All countries showed significant improvement in HCQ availability during the second wave. 562 (27.4%) patients reported an extremely high level of anxiety in wave 1 and 162 (10.3%) patients in wave 2; 589 (28.7%) and 268 (17.1%) patients reported a high level of anxiety in wave 1 and wave 2, respectively. Conclusions The HCQ shortage had a significant impact on patients with SLE and has been responsible for psychological consequences including anxiety.

Here, the hematological characteristics of patients with severe and critical 2019-nCoV pneumonia in intensive care unit (ICU) were investigated, which may provide the necessary basis for its diagnosis and treatment. Methods We collected data on patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV pneumonia in the ICU of Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan from February 25 to April 2, 2020. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the presence of 2019-nCoV, and various hematological characteristics were analyzed. Results All patients tested positive for 2019-nCoV using nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum after admission, and interstitial pneumonia findings were noted on chest computed tomography. Sex, age and comorbidities were not significantly different between the severe and critical groups. In terms of prognosis, the survival rate of patients in the severe group reached 100%, whereas that of patients in the critical group was only 13.33% after positive treatment. Furthermore, lymphocyte percentage, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, D-dimer, myohemoglobin, procalcitonin, and IL-6 levels were high-risk factors for disease progression in critical patients. Finally, lymphocyte percentage and blood urea nitrogen, calcium, myohemoglobin, and IL-6 levels were closely associated with patient prognosis. Conclusions 2019-nCoV pneumonia should be considered a systemic disease. Patients with more complications were more likely to develop critical disease.

Elevated serum creatinine level (odds ratio [OR] = 7.22, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.6-32.62,  P  = 0.01), blood urea nitrogen (OR = 6.33, 95% CI = 1.81-22.19,  P  = 0.004), serum uric acid level (OR = 3.66, 95% CI = 1.20-11.22,  P  = 0.023), and albuminuria (OR = 3.72, 95% CI = 1.50-9.26,  P  = 0.005) were independently associated with secondary hypertension. Elevated serum uric acid and blood urea nitrogen levels were associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (OR = 6.638, 95% CI = 1.349-32.657,  P  = 0.02) and hypertensive encephalopathy (OR = 4.384, 95% CI = 1.148-16.746,  P  = 0.031), respectively. Triglyceride level correlated with hypertensive retinopathy ( P  = 0.001).  Conclusion:  Pediatric hypertension was most often secondary, with renal disease as the leading cause. Elevated levels of serum uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and albuminuria may indicate secondary hypertension in childhood. Elevated serum uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, and triglyceride levels were associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertensive encephalopathy, and hypertensive retinopathy, respectively.","['Children', 'Primary hypertension', 'Associated Factors', 'Secondary Hypertension', 'Target Organ Damage']","['Medical University', 'Affiliated Hospital', 'Guangxi Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Nanning', 'China', 'ethics committee', 'University', 'Statement', 'Affiliated']",[],NaN

The ethics committee waived the requirement of written informed consent for participation.," Aim:  In the absence of an effective treatment, informed participation in dementia research can hardly be underestimated. However, although informed consent is key in biomedical research, it may become a barrier to participation. Whether informed consent may cause confusion and contribute to unfair participant selection in dementia research is not known. In preparation of a future epidemiological study on the prevalence and impact of dementia in Switzerland, we aimed to conduct a qualitative study to explore participants' comprehension of the purpose of informed consent form and process shortly after participation in the pilot and validation study that preceded the large scale survey.  Methods:  We conducted a qualitative study with 22 participants of the validation phase of an epidemiological study on the prevalence and impact of dementia in Switzerland to capture their understanding of both the nature and the content of the informed consent form and process. Participants were older adults (65 years or more) eligible for a dementia epidemiological study and their informant (a person who could provide information on their health and cognition). None of the participants reported to be suffering from dementia at the time of the interview.  Results:  We found that participants held inaccurate and potentially trust-threatening beliefs regarding the scope of the informed consent. Participants identified contradictory contextual, formal and content needs that are difficult to be fulfilled, and misperceived the clinical and research settings in terms of informed consent procedures.  Conclusions:  Participants and their proxies should be informed about both the scope of the informed consent process, and the content of the informed consent document in a focused, age-appropriate manner, while dispelling confusion about the purpose of research.","['Informed consent', 'Ethics', 'Dementia', 'Switzerland', 'Autonomy', 'Qualitative Study', 'Epidemiolagy']","['Canton Ticino', 'Comitato Etico', 'Etico del', 'del Canton', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ticino', 'Statement', 'Comitato', 'Etico', 'Canton']",['The'],NaN

The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.," Background:  Migraine has been postulated to lead to structural and functional changes of different cortical and subcortical areas, including the frontal lobe, the brainstem, and cerebellum. The (sub-)clinical impact of these changes is a matter of debate. The spectrum of possible clinical differences include domains such as cognition but also coordination. The present study investigated the oculomotor performance of patients with migraine with and without aura compared to control subjects without migraine in reflexive saccades, but also in intentional saccades, which involve cerebellar as well as cortical networks.  Methods:  In 18 patients with migraine with aura and 21 patients with migraine without aura saccadic eye movements were recorded in two reflexive (gap, overlap) and two intentional (anti, memory) paradigms and compared to 25 controls without migraine.  Results:  The main finding of the study was an increase of saccade latency in patients with and without aura compared to the control group solely in the anti-task. No deficits were found in the execution of reflexive saccades.  Conclusions:  Our results suggest a specific deficit in the generation of correct anti-saccades, such as vector inversion. Such processes are considered to need cortical networks to be executed correctly. The parietal cortex has been suggested to be involved in vector inversion processes but is not commonly described to be altered in migraine patients. It could be discussed that the cerebellum, which is recently thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of migraine, might be involved in distinct processes such as spatial re-mapping through known interconnections with parietal and frontal cortical areas.","['Migraine', 'Oculomotor Deficits', 'Intentional Saccades', 'Reflexive Saccades', 'Spatial Remapping']","['Medical Faculty', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Munich', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Committee']",[],NaN

It is a lethal disease that develops rapidly and causes the patient to deteriorate rapidly, and it can easily lead to systemic infections and even sepsis. The incidence is extremely low, and it is prevalent in patients with diabetes. We here report a case of EPN in a non-diabetic patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We share the diagnosis and treatment procedure for this extremely rare condition to make this disease easier to identify and address early. Case summary A 47-year-old woman presented to the emergency department of our hospital with a high fever and left back pain lasting 4 d. She had a history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney and polycystic liver. She was diagnosed with left type I EPN and her vital signs deteriorated so quickly that she underwent an emergency operation in which a D-J tube was inserted into her left ureter on the second day after admission. Two months later, she underwent a second-stage flexible ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. Despite postoperative sepsis, she finally recovered after active symptomatic support treatment and effective anti-infective treatment. Conclusion Although EPN is more likely to occur in diabetic patients, for non-diabetic patients with ADPKD and upper urinary tract obstruction, the disease also causes rapid deterioration. Early and accurate diagnosis and timely removal of the obstruction by invasive means may be able to save the damaged kidney and the patient's life.","['Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease', 'Lithotripsy', 'Case Report', 'Endoscopic Surgery', 'Emphysematous Pyelonephritis', 'Necrotizing Infection', 'Flexible Ureteroscopy Lithotripsy']",[],[],NaN

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), which was defined by the World Health Organization as pandemic, has rapidly emerged as a global health threat. Outbreak evolution and prevention of international implications require substantial flexibility of frontline health care facilities in their response. Aim To explore the effect of the implementation and management strategy of pre-screening triage in children during COVID-19. Methods The standardized triage screening procedures included a standardized triage screening questionnaire, setup of pre-screening triage station, multi-point temperature monitoring, extensive screenings, and two-way protection. In order to ensure the implementation of the pre-screening triage, the prevention and control management strategies included training, emergency exercise, and staff protection. Statistical analysis was performed on the data from all the children hospitalized from January 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020 at solstice during the pandemic period. Data were obtained from questionnaires and electronic medical record systems. Results A total of 17561 children, including 2652 who met the criteria for screening, 192 suspected cases, and two confirmed cases without omission, were screened from January 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020 at solstice during the pandemic period.

We undertook an epidemiologic investigation to describe the outbreak and guide public health action. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified from reports of SARS-CoV-2-positive laboratory test results to South Central Public Health District. Information on symptoms, hospitalization, recent travel, healthcare worker status, and close contacts was obtained by medical record review and patient interviews. Viral sequence analysis was conducted on a subset of available specimens. During March 13-April 10, 2020, a total of 451 COVID-19 cases among Blaine County residents (1,959 cases per 100,000 population) were reported, with earliest illness onset March 1. The median patient age was 51 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 37-63), 52 (11.5%) were hospitalized, and 5 (1.1%) died. The median duration between specimen collection and a positive laboratory result was 9 days (IQR: 4-10). Forty-four (9.8%) patients reported recent travel and an additional 37 cases occurred in out-of-state residents. Healthcare workers comprised 56 (12.4%) cases; 33 of whom worked at the only hospital in the county, leading to a 15-day disruption of hospital services. Among 562 close contacts monitored by public health authorities, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or compatible symptoms were identified in 51 (9.1%). Sequencing results from 34 specimens supported epidemiologic findings indicating travel as a source of SARS-CoV-2, and identified multiple lineages among hospital workers. Community mitigation strategies included school and resort closure, stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on incoming travelers. COVID-19 outbreaks in rural communities can disrupt health services. Lack of local laboratory capacity led to long turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. Rural communities frequented by tourists face unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1125,C:\Users\shweata\ethics_statement_2000_generic\PMC8060600\eupmc_result.json,PMC8060600,"2.1 Ethical leadership and CSR Ethics refers to a set of rules and principles that guide humans' conduct ( Johnstone and Crock, 2012). Ethical behavior could be simply defined as a strong connection between the concepts of right, proper, and fair ( Hosmer, 1987). On the other hand, a community's ethical behavior is generally shaped by each country's legal and regulatory systems ( Harrison, 1988). The connection between ethics and leadership is naturally created because it is often considered a significant component of gaining happiness and blessing ( Levine and Boaks, 2014). Accordingly, associated with ethics, ethical leadership refers to an individual who models behaviors that significantly influence groups or group members to encourage and guide them toward achieving a common goal ( Mendonca and Kanungo, 2006). They are conscientious persons who follow on beliefs and ideologies and include the capabilities to contribute to society's growth ( Maak and Pless, 2006). According to  Bowie (2000), ethical leaders should never evaluate their people only by their contributions and personality. Ethical leadership is characterized as modeling definitionally appropriate behavior through individual acts and interpersonal relations and encouraging team members' behavior through two-way dialogue, support and guidance, and decision-making ( Brown et al., 2005). Definitionally appropriate behavior represents the moral aspect of ethical leaders who embody admirable qualities such as integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness by taking responsibility for their decisions, including using a sufficient incentive and penalty system to encourage ethical behaviors and eliminate unethical behaviors; and also to discipline employees responsible for their actions ( Piccolo et al., 2010;  Brown et al., 2005). Even though ethics has not always been considered an essential characteristic of leadership, this perception gradually changes. Ethic leadership is becoming a distinct leadership style, different from other leadership styles, such as spiritual leadership, authentic leadership, and transformational leadership. Ethical leadership can also be used as an analytical tool to explain certain behaviors' effectiveness and predict what behaviors will be effective in certain contexts ( Brown et al., 2005). Based on conceptual explanations of ethical leadership, it is proven that a connection between ethical leadership and CSR exists in terms of business ethics and corporate growth. According to  Ciulla (2005) commented on ethical leadership; it is ethical by being effective. If change is required and necessary, the achievement of the appropriate outcome is ethical at that time. According to  Prout (2006), social responsibility is defined by the capacity to grow stakeholder's wealth, increase workers performance productivity, enhance living standards as well as share the earned values with local society. Similarly, CSR is defined as a philosophy that integrates company activities, activities and relationships between stakeholders ( EC, 2011). According to Freeman's stakeholder theory (1988), if an organization devotes its energy to stakeholders' issues, all individuals who are influenced by the organization's decisions, then the profit will be made. CSR could be simply explained as the companies' critical conduct and responsibility for local performing business's relative consequences. Beyond the profit, a CSR-engaged company will consider both the favorable and unfavorable implications of three key elements, including society, environment, and economy ( Marsden, 2001). These definitions indeed illustrate the close relationship between CSR and corporate management. In the stakeholder theory, leadership's role in serving its stakeholders' interests supports the connection between leadership and CSR. According to  Hind et al. (2009), CSR initiatives are regularly approached in the wrong way or driven into PR and window dressing. There are no effective CSR implementations without leadership support at all levels ( Knippenberg and de Jong, 2010). Simultaneously, ethical leaders will seek to strengthen their environmental, social, and ethical efficiency to fulfill stakeholders' needs. The response of business leaders to CSR initiatives may be influenced by stakeholders' evolution regarding CSR ( Morsing and Schultz, 2006). In practice, numerous criminal cases involving corporations show that, even when CSR is working well, they may still commit criminal acts that violate the business's ethics. In such cases, the cause was not always misconceptions about CSR but was the negligence of unethical leaders. In contrast, ethical leadership helps followers care about stakeholders' interests beyond their own, and fosters a sense of corporate social responsibility ( Choi et al., 2015). Ethical leadership also emphasizes transparency, accountability and dignity, as well as a desire to do what is right and beneficial to CSR activities ( Angus-Leppan et al., 2010). In light of the above reasonings, we propose the following hypothesis. Hypothesis 1 (H1)Ethical leadership has a positive effect on CSR.","Due to globalization expansion, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is no longer an unfamiliar concept in emerging markets. In the case of Vietnam, its implementation will be influenced by several factors, including ethical leadership. Drawing upon the stakeholder theory, this study develops and tests a serial mediation model to explain how CSR and firm reputation can connect ethical leadership to enhanced firm performance. The PLS-SEM results from survey data collected from 653 mid- and top-level managers from large companies in Vietnam indicate that ethical leadership positively influences CSR, which, in turn, results in enhanced firm reputation and firm performance. This study contributes to research on the intersection between CSR and leadership in the context of emerging markets. This study also provides some managerial implications for Vietnamese firms striving to promote ethical leadership to achieve CSR outcomes.","['Vietnam', 'Corporate Social Responsibility', 'Ethical Leadership', 'Firm Reputation', 'Firm Performance']","['Ethical leadership', 'Ethical', 'leadership', 'CSR', 'Ethical behavior', 'ethical leaders', 'Ethics', 'behavior', 'Johnstone', 'Crock']",[],NaN

The study also unpacked the issues of internal stigma and how young people living with perinatally acquired HIV are informed of their HIV status. Participants reported that FB had a critical role in helping them accept their HIV status. Grandmothers' empathic attitude was key during counselling on adherence to ART, to demystify the disease and treatment, normalize the reality of living with HIV, encourage young people to socialize with peers and free them of guilt. Interviewees unanimously reported improved ART adherence following FB counselling, and many described enhanced health and wellbeing. Conclusion Participants saw FB as a strong contributor to their general well-being, evident in decreased symptoms of depression and improved adherence to ART. FB problem-solving therapy should be rolled out to further support young people after post-test counselling or HIV serostatus disclosure for perinatally acquired HIV, for acceptance of HIV status and adherence to ART.",[],"['London School', 'Tropical Medicine', 'ref MRCZ', 'Ethics Committee', 'gave ethical', 'Medical Research', 'Research Council', 'Medicine Research', 'Ethical considerations', 'ethical approval']",[],NaN

For over 20 years, recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells have been used as a host in monoclonal antibody production due to robustness, high productivity and ability to produce proteins with ideal glycans. Chemical compounds, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, lithium chloride, and butyric acid, have been shown to improve monoclonal antibody production in mammalian cell cultures. In this study, we aimed to discover new chemical compounds that can improve cell-specific antibody production in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells. Out of the 23,227 chemicals screened in this study, 4-(2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-N-(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl) benzamide was found to increase monoclonal antibody production. The compound suppressed cell growth and increased both cell-specific glucose uptake rate and the amount of intracellular adenosine triphosphate during monoclonal antibody production. In addition, the compound also suppressed the galactosylation on a monoclonal antibody, which is a critical quality attribute of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, the compound might also be used to control the level of the galactosylation for the N-linked glycans. Further, the structure-activity relationship study revealed that 2,5-dimethylpyrrole was the most effective partial structure of 4-(2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-N-(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl) benzamide on monoclonal antibody production. Further structural optimization of 2,5-dimethylpyrrole derivatives could lead to improved production and quality control of monoclonal antibodies.",[],[],[],NaN

All participating farmers provided written consent.,"Antimicrobials are included in commercial animal feed rations in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We measured antimicrobial use (AMU) in commercial feed products consumed by 338 small-scale chicken flocks in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, before a gradual nationwide ban on prophylactic use of antimicrobials (including in commercial feeds) to be introduced in the country over the coming five years. We inspected the labels of commercial feeds and calculated amounts of antimicrobial active ingredients (AAIs) given to flocks. We framed these results in the context of overall AMU in chicken production, and highlighted those products that did not comply with Government regulations. Thirty-five of 99 (35.3%) different antimicrobial-containing feed products included at least one AAI. Eight different AAIs (avilamycin, bacitracin, chlortetracycline, colistin, enramycin, flavomycin, oxytetracycline, virginamycin) belonging to five classes were identified. Brooding feeds contained antimicrobials the most (60.0%), followed by grower (40.9%) and finisher feeds (20.0%). Quantitatively, chlortetracycline was consumed most (42.2 mg/kg SEM ±0.34; 50.0% of total use), followed by enramycin (18.4 mg/kg SEM ±0.03, 21.8%), bacitracin (16.4 mg/kg SEM ±0.20, 19.4%) and colistin (6.40 mg/kg SEM ± 4.21;7.6%). Other antimicrobials consumed were virgianamycin, avilamycin, flavomycin and oxytetracycline (each ≤0.50 mg/kg). Antimicrobials in commercial feeds were more commonly given to flocks in the earlier part of the production cycle. A total of 10 (9.3%) products were not compliant with existing Vietnamese regulation (06/2016/TT-BNNPTNT) either because they included a non-authorised AAI (4), had AAIs over the permitted limits (4), or both (2). A number of commercial feed formulations examined included colistin (polymyxin E), a critically important antimicrobial of highest priority for human medicine. These results illustrate the challenges for effective implementation and enforcement of restrictions of antimicrobials in commercial feeds in LMICs.

Diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection requires both HCV antibody screening and confirmatory nucleic acid testing (NAT). Hepatitis C virus core antigen (HCVcAg) is a reliable direct viral marker to identify active HCV infection. Aim To assess the clinical utility of HCV core antigen to identify active HCV infection in hemodialysis and renal transplant patients. Methods A representative total of 231 plasma samples with a predominance of low viral load were included for HCVcAg testing and its performance characteristics were compared with the gold standard HCV RNA. Results Comparison of HCVcAg with HCV RNA showed an excellent specificity of 99% (95% CI: 94.7 to 100%) and sensitivity of 80.62% (95% CI: 73.59 to 87.7%). Likewise, the PPV and NPV of HCVcAg were 99.1% (95% CI: 93.7% to 99.9%) and 80.2% (95% CI: 74% to 85.2%) respectively. The correlation between HCVcAg and HCV RNA was found to be good (R2 = 0.86, p Conclusions It is the first Indian study to show that HCVcAg is a reliable, cost-effective direct marker to identify active HCV infection in hemodialysis and renal transplant patients. Implementation of HCVcAg testing could improve the accessibility to efficacious and affordable disease management in hemodialysis and renal transplant patients. In HCVcAg negative cases, sequential testing with anti-HCV antibody followed by HCV RNA could be a reliable and cost-effective approach.",[],[],[],NaN

This study aimed to explore palliative care needs and preferences of patients, their caregivers, and the perspective of stakeholders on service provision in palliative programs for women, mostly affected by cervical cancer and breast cancer. Methods A rapid program evaluation using a qualitative study approach was conducted in three home-based palliative care programs in Addis Ababa and Yirgalem town, Ethiopia. Female patients enrolled in the programs, and their primary caregivers were interviewed on palliative care needs, preferences and service provision. We explored the views of purposely selected stakeholders on the organization of palliative care and its challenges. Audio-taped data was transcribed verbatim and translated into English and an inductive thematic analysis was applied. Descriptive analyses were used to label physical signs and symptoms using palliative outcome scale score. Results A total of 77 interviews (34 patients, 12 primary caregivers, 15 voluntary caregivers, 16 stakeholders) were conducted. The main physical complaints were moderate to severe pain (70.6%), followed by anorexia (50.0%), insomnia, nausea and vomiting (41.2%). Social interaction and daily activities were hampered by the patients' condition. Both patients and caregivers reported that programs focus most on treatment of symptoms, with limited psychosocial, emotional, spiritual and economic support. Lack of organizational structures and policy directions limit the collaboration between stakeholders and the availability of holistic home-based palliative care services. Conclusions Although female patients and caregivers appreciated the palliative care and support provided, the existing services did not cover all needs. Pain management and all other needed supports were lacking. Multi-sectorial collaboration with active involvement of community-based structures is needed to improve quality of care and access to holistic palliative care services.",[],"['Public Health', 'Ethics statement', 'Ethics committee', 'Addis Ababa', 'number prv', 'Ababa University', 'Ethics', 'study', 'Research', 'School']",['prv/154/10.'],NaN

Methods:  Three families with fetal LHH were recruited. Genomic DNA from amniotic fluid or peripheral blood, and trio whole exome sequencing (trio-WES) and copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq) were performed.  Results:  All the three couples had no family history, and mid-gestation ultrasound revealed LHH and other variable cardiovascular defects in the fetuses.

Objective:  To compare the risks of adverse neonatal outcomes in younger pregnant adolescents who are properly followed through group prenatal care (GPC) delivered by specialized public services.  Methods:  This retrospective cohort study followed pregnant adolescents (aged 10-17 years) who received GPC from specialized public services in Brazil from 2009 to 2014. Data were obtained from medical records and through interviews with a multidisciplinary team that treated the patients. The neonatal outcomes (low birth weight, prematurity, Apgar scores with 1 and 5 min, and neonatal death) of newborns of adolescents aged 10-13 years were compared to those of adolescents aged 14-15 years and 16-17 years. Incidence was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and compared over time using a chi-squared test to observe trends.

In the population-based Beijing Eye Study 2011, we took fundus photographs and measured SFCT by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and axial length by optical low-coherence reflectometry. Using 6394 color fundus images taken from 3468 participants, we trained and evaluated a deep-learning-based algorithm for estimation of axial length and SFCT.

Methods The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument was chosen as the framework-based approach to appraise LactaMap guideline quality. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase appraised all 103 original LactaMap guidelines. The second phase appraised a subset of 15 updated LactaMap guidelines using improved methodology guided by phase 1, as well as 15 corresponding original (un-updated) guidelines. Results Mean Domain scores for 103 LactaMap original guidelines were above 75% in 3 of the 6 AGREE II quality Domains and no mean Domain score rated poorly. Update of guideline methodology was guided by phase 1 appraisals. Improved documentation of methods relating to questions in the Rigour of Development Domain resulted in improvement in mean Domain score from 39 to 72%. Conclusions This study showed that a theory-based approach to guideline development methodology can be readily integrated with a common-sense approach. Factors identified by AGREE II theory-based framework provided practical guidance for changes in methodology that were integrated prior to LactaMap website publication. Demonstration of high quality in LactaMap clinical practice guideline methodology ensures clinicians and the public can have trust that the content founded on them is robust, scientific and of highest possible quality.","['Lactation', 'Breastfeeding', 'Agree Ii', 'Clinical Practice Guidelines (Cpgs)']",[],[],NaN

Within last decades, this syndrome has been studied across medical professionals, concluding that stress levels that physicians suffer is high enough to make them develop burnout syndrome. In the case of medical students, there are some recent studies, although with small samples. For this reason, given that this phenomenon may produce a huge impact in medical students' development, the aim of this study is to analyze the influential factors that may contribute to its occurrence. Methods The necessary information was gathered through a web-based questionnaire, divided in two parts. The first part of the survey included questions related to personal aspects of the students. Burnout related questions (second part) were divided in three subscales to evaluate exhaustion, cynicism, and academic efficacy levels. Results Family support for studying medicine is associated with lower burnout levels in all three scales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The number of years spent in the degree show the opposite trend: the more years in the degree, the higher score in all burnout scales. Conclusions Burnout syndrome is a problem among medical students in Spain that increases with the number of years studying medicine. It should be also noticed that family support and vocational studies are independent factors related to lower levels of burnout.","['Burnout', 'Medical Student', 'Family Support', 'Maslach Burnout Inventory']","['Ethics Committee', 'Cantabria Ethics', 'European Union', 'Spanish laws', 'Union regulations', 'personal data', 'natural persons', 'medical research', 'Ethical issues', 'European Parliament']",[],NaN

Gaining the perspective of adolescents and how they perceive and use food environments is needed. The aim of this study was to explore adolescent's perception and use of the food environment surrounding their schools. Purposive sampling was used to recruit schools. Mapping exercises and discussion groups were facilitated with 95 adolescents from six schools. Thematic analysis showed that adolescents are not loyal to particular shops but are attracted to outlets with price discounts, those with 'deli' counters and sweets. Cost, convenience and choice are key factors influencing preference for food outlets and foods. Quality, variety and health were important factors for adolescents but these features, especially affordable healthy food, were hard to find. Social factors such as spending time with friends is also an important feature of food environments that deserves further attention.

[Participant 07] To create trust, a transparent and secure way of data storage and protection would have to be provided. [Participant 05] Of course, security and data protection are a crucial issue in the field of AI especially when it comes to sensitive information like mental health. [Participant 08] Data security is probably the most important concern, where we really do lack the infrastructure for safe data collection and processing. [Participant 23]  In respect of this, several students also identified the possibility of patient data exploitation as a problem; for example: Who will have access to the personal information of patients? [Participant 24] Who will misuse them for commercial reasons… or will health insurance be able to track the patients' digital footprints – data protection? [Participant 24] Potential leakages of patient information on the internet to unwanted recipients or hackers.

Methods:  In April-June 2020, we conducted a mixed-methods online survey using a convenience sample of 120 clinical psychology students enrolled in a two-year Masters' program at a Swiss University.  Results:  In total 37 students responded (response rate: 37/120, 31%). Among respondents, 73% ( n  = 27) intended to enter a mental health profession, and 97% reported that they had heard of the term ""machine learning."" Students estimated 0.52% of their program would be spent on AI/ML education. Around half (46%) reported that they intended to learn about AI/ML as it pertained to mental health care. On 5-point Likert scale, students ""moderately agreed"" (median = 4) that AI/M should be part of clinical psychology/psychotherapy education. Qualitative analysis of students' comments resulted in four major themes on the impact of AI/ML on mental healthcare: (1) Changes in the quality and understanding of psychotherapy care; (2) Impact on patient-therapist interactions; (3) Impact on the psychotherapy profession; (4) Data management and ethical issues.  Conclusions:  This pilot study found that postgraduate clinical psychology students held a wide range of opinions but had limited formal education on how AI/ML-enabled tools might impact psychotherapy.

Subjects A total of 555,528 patient visits from 28 Irish primary care optometry practices between the years 1980 and 2019 and 141,547,436 spectacle lens sales records from an international European lens manufacturer between the years 1998 and 2016. Methods Anonymized EMR data included demographic, refractive and visual acuity values. Anonymized spectacle lens data included refractive data. Spectacle lens data was separated into lenses containing an addition (ADD) and those without an addition (SV). The proportions of refractive errors from the EMR data and ADD lenses were compared to published results from the European Eye Epidemiology (E3) Consortium and the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS). Results Age and gender matched proportions of refractive error were comparable in the E3 data and the EMR data, with no significant difference in the overall refractive error distribution (χ2 = 527, p = 0.29, DoF = 510). EMR data provided a closer match to the E3 refractive error distribution by age than the ADD lens data. The ADD lens data, however, provided a closer approximation to the E3 data for total myopia prevalence than the GHS data, up to age 64. Conclusions The prevalence of refractive error within a population can be estimated using EMR data in the absence of population surveys. Industry derived sales data can also provide insights on the epidemiology of refractive errors in a population over certain age ranges. EMR and industrial data may therefore provide a fast and cost-effective surrogate measure of refractive error distribution that can be used for future health service planning purposes.",[],[],[],NaN

There is a paucity of data on the effect of FGM practice in two generations in Africa.

We used Demographic and Health Surveys data collected between 2010 and 2018 from 14 African countries. We analyzed information on 93,063 women-daughter pair (Level 1) from 8,396 communities (Level 2) from the 14 countries (Level 3). We fitted hierarchical multivariable binomial logistic regression models using the MLWin 3.03 module in Stata version 16 at p<0.05. The overall prevalence of FGM among mothers and their daughters was 60.0% and 21.7%, respectively, corresponding to 63.8% reduction in the mother-daughter ratio of FGM. The prevalence of FGM among daughters in Togo and Tanzania were less than one per cent, 48.6% in Guinea, with the highest prevalence of 78.3% found in Mali. The percentage reduction in mother-daughter FGM ratio was highest in Tanzania (96.7%) and Togo (94.2%), compared with 10.0% in Niger, 15.0% in Nigeria and 15.9% in Mali. Prevalence of daughters' FGM among women with and without FGM was 34.0% and 3.1% respectively. The risk of mothers having FGM for their daughters was significantly associated with maternal age, educational status, religion, household wealth quintiles, place of residence, community unemployment and community poverty. The country and community where the women lived explained about 57% and 42% of the total variation in FGM procurement for daughters. Procurement of FGM for the daughters of the present generation of mothers in Africa is common, mainly, among those from low social, poorer, rural and less educated women.

Materials and methods We adapted and piloted the WHO standard protocol for conducting a prevalence survey of STIs among pregnant women visiting antenatal care center of Dhulikhel Hospital, Nepal. Patient recruitment, data collection, and specimen testing took place between November 2019-March 2020. First catch urine sample was collected from each eligible woman. GeneXpert platform was used for CT and NG testing. Wet-mount microscopy of urine sample was used for detection of trichomoniasis. Serological test for HIV was done by rapid and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. Serological test for syphilis was done using ""nonspecific non-treponemal"" and ""specific treponemal"" antibody tests. Tests for CT, NG and trichomoniasis were done as part of the prevalence study while tests for syphilis and HIV were done as part of the routine antenatal testing. Results 672 women were approached to participate in the study, out of which 591 (87.9%) met the eligibility criteria and consented to participate. The overall prevalence of any STIs was 8.6% (51/591, 95% CI: 6.3-10.8); 1.5% (95% CI: 0.5-2.5) for CT and 7.1% (95% CI: 5.0-9.2) for trichomoniasis infection.

Appropriate indications, execution and outcomes still remain unclear and controversial. The present investigation analyzed the midterm result of isolated and arthroscopic LRR for LPCS in a cohort of patients who underwent such procedure at our institution. Material and methods Patients undergoing isolated arthroscopic LRR for LPCS were identified retrospectively from our electronic database. All procedures were performed by two experienced surgeons. Patients with bony and/or soft tissues abnormalities, patellofemoral instability, moderate to severe chondral damage were not included. Patients with previous surgeries were not included, as were those who underwent combined interventions. Clinical scores and complications were recorded. Results 31 patients were recruited in the present investigation. The mean follow-up was 86.0 ± 22.8 months. The mean age of the patients at the index operation was 34.2 ± 13.1 years. A total 55% (17 of 31) were women, and 58% (18 of 31) had involved the right knee. The mean hospitalization length was 3.5 ± 1.4 days. At a mean follow-up of 86.0 ± 22.8 months, the numeric rating scale (NRS) was 1.2 ± 0.8, the Kujala score was 91.3 ± 11.3, the Lysholm score was 93.1 ± 15.0, and the Tegner score was 5.0 ± 1.8. At the latest follow-up, 9 of 31 (29.0%) of patients experienced compilations. One patient (3.2%) had a post-operative hemarthrosis which was managed conservatively. Six patients (19.4%) reported a persistent sensation of instability, without signs of patellar dislocation or subluxation. One patient underwent an arthroscopic meniscectomy, and another patient an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Conclusion isolated arthroscopic lateral retinacular release for lateral patellar compression syndrome is feasible and effective, achieving satisfying results at more than seven years following the procedure.","['Knee', 'Patellofemoral', 'Lateral Retinacular Release', 'Lateral Patellar Compression Syndrome']",[],[],NaN

In forensic medicine, the postmortem determination of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) helps identify undiagnosed cases of diabetes or cases with uncontrolled glycemic status. In order to contribute to the solidification of thanatochemistry, both globally and especially nationally, we aimed to determine this biomarker postmortem, for the first time in our institution, in order to identify undiagnosed pre-mortem diabetics, as well as those with inadequate glycemic control.  Materials and Methods.  Our research consisted of analyzing a total number of 180 HbA1c values, 90 determinations from the peripheral blood and 90 from the central blood. The determination of HbA1c was performed by means of a fully automatic analyzer (HemoCue HbA1c 501), certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)/Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and calibrated according to the standards developed by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC). According to ADA criteria, HbA1c values can provide us with the following information about the diagnosis of diabetes: normal 4.8-5.6%; prediabetes 5.7-6.4%; diabetes ≥ 6.5%.  Results.  A considerable number of cases with an altered glycemic status (cases that had HbA1c values equal to or greater than 5.7%) were identified-51% demonstrable by peripheral blood determinations and 41% by central blood determinations. Notably, 23 people with diabetes (25%) were identified by analyzing the peripheral blood; 18 other people with diabetes (20%) were identified by analyzing the central blood.  Conclusions.  Our study managed to confirm the antemortem diagnosis of DM using a simple point-of-care analyzer and applying standardized and certified criteria on HbA1c levels measured postmortem. We also identified a considerable number of cases with DM in patients with no antemortem history of glucose imbalance-at least 20% more cases. Although the two different sites used for blood collection showed a strong statistical correlation, it seems that the peripheral site could have a higher sensibility in detecting postmortem altered glycemic status.","['Diabetes', 'Diagnostic', 'glucose metabolism', 'Glycated Hemoglobin', 'Thanatochemistry']",[],[],NaN

Recently, a crucial role of the X-Linked Forkhead Box P3 (FoxP3) for the development and the stability of Tregs has emerged, and FOXP3 gene polymorphisms have been associated with the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. The expression of Foxp3 in Tregs is regulated by the transcription factor GATA binding-protein 3 (GATA3) and vitamin D 3 . The aim of this retrospective case-control study was to investigate the potential association between FOXP3 and GATA3 genetic variants, Vitamin D 3 , and MS risk. Methods We analyzed two polymorphisms in the FOXP3 gene (rs3761547 and rs3761548) and a polymorphism in the GATA3 gene (rs3824662) in 106 MS patients and 113 healthy controls.

This cross-sectional study evaluated factors that influenced symptoms of injection site infection among 238 Japanese patients who self-injected insulin for diabetes between October 2015 and January 2016. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data regarding skin disinfection practices, infection symptoms at the injection site, frequency of injections, environment at the time of injection, and hygiene habits. The majority of patients (83.2%) performed skin disinfection before the self-injection. Logistic regression analysis revealed that infection at the injection site was positively associated with skin disinfection before injection, age, and performing injections outside home. It was speculated that omitting skin disinfection before administering subcutaneous insulin injection was not the factor that affected the symptoms of injection site infection. The greatest contributor to infection symptoms was injections performed outside the home. Future studies focusing on the environment, in which patients administer insulin injections, to assess its influence on symptoms of injection site infections are warranted.","['Diabetes mellitus', 'Disinfection', 'Infections', 'SKin', 'Subcutaneous Injections']","['Helsinki Declaration', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Review', 'Hokkaido University', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics', 'University Hospital', 'Health Sciences', 'Medical University', 'November']",[],NaN

In total, 37 adult drinkers who reported regularly engaging in heavy episodic drinking and experiencing a hangover at least once in the previous month took part in this within-subjects, ""naturalistic"" crossover study. Participants completed Go/No-Go (assessing response inhibition) and Visual Dot Probe (attentional bias) tasks in a hangover condition (morning following alcohol consumption) and a no-hangover condition (no alcohol consumption for at least 24 h).

These had been performed between November 2019 through August 2020 to manage pain of lumbosacral origin. Under ultrasound guidance, after advancing the introducer needle through the sacrococcygeal ligament and then slowly withdrawing it, the outer catheter was continuously advanced into the sacral hiatus. We confirmed proper needle placement under fluoroscopic imaging, using 5 mL of contrast media. We assessed the contrast spread pattern with fluoroscopic imaging and checked it for the presence of intravascular injection.  Results:  In all recruited cases, the catheter-over-needle was guided successfully to the sacral hiatus and into the caudal epidural space. There was 100% accuracy under ultrasound guidance, without intravascular uptake, as confirmed by contrast media fluoroscopy. The incidence of ventral spread was 84.2% above the S1 with 5 mL of contrast.

Methods First, is the development of a reflectance type optical vein finder using three (3) light emitting diode (LED) lights with 960 nm wavelength, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-infrared (CMOS-IR) sensor camera with 1920 × 1080 UXGA (1080P), IR filter set for the given wavelength, and an open-source image processing software. Second, is the actual in-vitro human testing in two sites: the arm and dorsal hand of 242 subjects. The following parameters were included, such as gender, age, mass index (BMI), and skin tone. In order to maximize the assessment process towards the device, the researchers included the arm circumference. This augmented subcutaneous vein imaging study using the develop vein finder device compared the difference in the captured vein images through visual and digital imaging approaches. The human testing was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Trinity University of Asia-Institutional Ethics Review Committee (TUA-IERC). Results The NIR imaging system of the developed vein finder in this study showed its capability as an efficient guiding device through real-time vein pattern recognition, for both sites. Improved captured vein images were observed, having 100% visibility of vein patterns on the dorsal hand site. Fourteen (5.79%) out of 242 subjects reported non-visible peripheral subcutaneous veins in the arm sites. Conclusions The developed vein finder device with the NIR technology and reflected light principle with low-energy consumption was efficient for real-time peripheral subcutaneous vein imaging without the application of a tourniquet. This might be utilized as a guiding device in locating the vein for the purpose of cannulation, at a very low cost as compared to the commercially available vein finders. Moreover, it may be used as an instructional device for student training in performing cannulation.","['Image processing', 'Cannulation', 'Venipuncture', 'Deoxyhemoglobin', 'Vein Finder', '(Nir) Near-infrared', '(Led) Light Emitting Diode']",[],[],NaN

Decreased alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (αKGDHc) activity was identified in some patients with AD. The αKGDHc is a key enzyme in the Krebs cycle. This enzyme is very sensitive to the harmful effect of reactive oxygen species, which gives them a critical role in the Alzheimer and mitochondrial disease research area. Previously, several genetic risk factors were described in association with AD. Our aim was to analyze the associations of rare damaging variants in the genes encoding αKGDHc subunits and AD. The three genes ( OGDH ,  DLST ,  DLD ) encoding αKGDHc subunits were sequenced from different brain regions of 11 patients with histologically confirmed AD and the blood of further 35 AD patients. As a control group, we screened 134 persons with whole-exome sequencing. In all subunits, a one-one rare variant was identified with unknown significance based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) classification. Based on the literature research and our experience, R263H mutation in the  DLD  gene seems likely to be pathogenic. In the different cerebral areas, the αKGDHc mutational profile was the same, indicating the presence of germline variants.

The aim of this study was to investigate metabolic parameters in patients admitted to the hospital with suspected RH. Methods The study group (SG) included non-diabetic individuals with symptoms consistent with RH. The control group (CG) included individuals without hypoglycemic symptoms and any documented medical history of metabolic disorders. In both groups the following investigations were performed: fasting glucose and insulin levels, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), 75 g five-hour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with an assessment of glucose and insulin and lipid profile evaluation. Additionally, Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) was performed in SG. Results from OGTT and MMTT were analyzed in line with the non-standardized RH diagnostic criteria. Results Forty subjects have been enrolled into SG. Twelve (30%) of those patients had hypoglycemic symptoms and glucose level ≤55 mg/dL during five-hour OGTT and have been diagnosed with RH. Ten (25%) subjects manifested hypoglycemic like symptoms without significant glucose decline. Patients with diagnosed RH had statistically significantly lower mean glucose at first (92.1 ± 37.9 mg/dL vs. 126.4 ± 32.5 mg/dL; LSD test:  p   p   p   p  = 0.024) in SG in comparison with CG but did not exceed standard reference range. Conclusions No metabolic disturbances have been observed in patients with diagnosed reactive hypoglycemia. Hyperinsulinemia has not been associated with glycemic declines in patients with this condition. Occurrence of pseudohypoglicemic symptoms and lower glucose value was more common after ingestion of glucose itself rather than after ingestion of a balanced meal.

Osteoarthritis is one of the most disabling conditions worldwide and several studies showed a lack of knowledge of and adherence to osteoarthritis CPGs in physiotherapists' clinical practice. However, those studies are not conclusive, as they examine the knowledge of and adherence to CPGs only in isolation, or only by focussing on a single treatment. Thus, analysis of the knowledge of and adherence to CPGs in the same sample would allow for a better understanding of the evidence-to-practice gap, which, if unaddressed, can lead to suboptimal care for these patients. This study aims at assessing Italian physiotherapists' evidence-to-practice gap in osteoarthritis CPGs. Methods An online survey divided into two sections investigating knowledge of and adherence to CPGs was developed based on three high-quality, recent and relevant CPGs. In the first section, participants had to express their agreement with 24 CPG statements through a 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree) scale. We defined a ≥ 70% agreement with a statement as consensus. In the second section, participants were shown a clinical case, with different interventions to choose from. Participants were classified as 'Delivering' (all recommended interventions selected), 'Partially Delivering' (some recommended interventions missing) and 'Non-Delivering' (at least one non-recommended interventions selected) the recommended intervention, depending on chosen interventions. Results 822 physiotherapists (mean age (SD): 35.8 (13.3); female 47%) completed the survey between June and July 2020. In the first section, consensus was achieved for 13/24 statements. In the second section, 25% of the participants were classified as 'Delivering', 22% as 'Partially Delivering' and 53% as 'Non-Delivering'. Conclusions Our findings revealed an adequate level of knowledge of osteoarthritis CPGs regarding the importance of exercise and education. However, an adequate level of adherence has yet to be reached, since many physiotherapists did not advise weight reduction, but rest from physical activity, and often included secondary treatments (e.g. manual therapy) supported by low-level evidence. These results identify an evidence-to-practice gap, which may lead to non-evidence based practice behaviours for the management of patients with osteoarthritis.","['Osteoarthritis', 'Clinical Governance', 'Osteoarthritis, Knee', 'Practice Guidelines As Topic', 'Osteoarthritis, Hip', 'Physical Therapists', 'Physical Therapy Specialty', 'Education, Public Health Professional']",[],[],NaN

It is a comprehensive and time-consuming process that aims to discriminate between healthy individuals and aphasic patients, determine the type of aphasia syndrome, and determine the patients' impairment severity levels (these are referred to here as aphasia assessment tasks). Hence, the automation of aphasia assessment tasks is essential. In this study, the performance of three automatic speech assessment models based on the speech  dataset-type  was investigated. Three types of datasets were used: healthy subjects' dataset, aphasic patients' dataset, and a combination of healthy and aphasic datasets. Two machine learning (ML)-based frameworks, classical machine learning (CML) and deep neural network (DNN), were considered in the design of the proposed speech assessment models. In this paper, the DNN-based framework was based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Direct or indirect transformation of these models to achieve the aphasia assessment tasks was investigated. Comparative performance results for each of the speech assessment models showed that quadrature-based high-resolution time-frequency images with a CNN framework outperformed all the CML frameworks over the three dataset-types. The CNN-based framework reported an accuracy of 99.23 ± 0.003% with the healthy individuals' dataset and 67.78 ± 0.047% with the aphasic patients' dataset. Moreover, direct or transformed relationships between the proposed speech assessment models and the aphasia assessment tasks are attainable, given a suitable dataset-type, a reasonably sized dataset, and appropriate decision logic in the ML framework.","['Mandarin', 'Speech Impairment', 'Deep Neural Network', 'Aphasia Assessment', 'Machine Learning Framework']",[],[],NaN

Regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES, also known as C-C chemokine ligand) is a chemokine involved in the migration of T cells and other lymphoid cells. Changes in RANTES levels and its expression in blood or in cerebrospinal fluid have been reported in some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, but also in metabolic diseases in which inflammation plays a role. The aim of this observational study was to assess RANTES levels in peripheral blood as clinical indicators of AD. Plasma levels of RANTES were investigated in 85 AD patients in a relatively early phase of AD (median 8.5 months after diagnosis; 39 men and 46 women; average age 75.7 years), and in 78 control subjects (24 men and 54 women; average age 66 years). We found much higher plasma levels of RANTES in AD patients compared to controls. A negative correlation of RANTES levels with age, disease duration, Fazekas scale score, and the medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) score (Scheltens's scale) was found in AD patients, i.e., the higher levels corresponded to earlier stages of the disease. Plasma RANTES levels were not correlated with cognitive scores. In AD patients, RANTES levels were positively correlated with the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, which is consistent with the well-known fact that AD is associated with inflammatory processes. RANTES levels were also positively correlated with insulin levels in AD patients, with insulin resistance (HOMA-R) and pancreatic beta cell function (HOMA-F). This study evaluated several clinical and metabolic factors that may affect plasma levels of RANTES, but these factors could not explain the increases in RANTES levels observed in AD patients. Plasma levels of RANTES appear to be an interesting peripheral marker for early stages of AD.

Despite these advantages and benefiting from highly reproducible fabrication methods on both silicon and polymer substrates, they have not been widely available. This paper presents the development, fabrication, characterization, and in vivo electrophysiological assessment of a hybrid multisite multishank silicon probe with a monolithically integrated polyimide flexible interconnect cable. The fabrication process was optimized at wafer level, and several neural probes with 64 gold electrode sites equally distributed along 8 shanks with an integrated 8 µm thick highly flexible polyimide interconnect cable were produced. The monolithic integration of the polyimide cable in the same fabrication process removed the necessity of the postfabrication bonding of the cable to the probe. This is the highest electrode site density and thinnest flexible cable ever reported for a hybrid silicon/polymer probe. Additionally, to avoid the time-consuming bonding of the probe to definitive packaging, the flexible cable was designed to terminate in a connector pad that can mate with commercial zero-insertion force (ZIF) connectors for electronics interfacing. This allows great experimental flexibility because interchangeable packaging can be used according to experimental demands. High-density distributed in vivo electrophysiological recordings were obtained from the hybrid neural probes with low intrinsic noise and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","['Sensorimotor Cortex', 'In Vivo Electrophysiology', 'Neuromems', 'Neural Probe', 'Flexible Interconnect Cable', 'Interchangeable Packaging', 'Silicon And Polyimide Microfabrication']",[],[],NaN

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was undertaken to explore EPLIN association with patient survival. Reduced EPLIN expression was associated with significant or near significant reductions of overall, disease-free, first progression or post-progression survival in the larger host cohort and Kaplan Meier plotter datasets. In the larger cohort EPLIN expression was significantly higher in the combined T1 + T2 gastric cancer group compared to the T3 + T4 group and identified to be an independent prognostic factor of disease-free survival and overall survival by multivariate analysis. In the smaller, NAC cohort, EPLIN expression was found to be significantly lower in tumour tissues than in paratumour tissues. EPLIN expression was significantly associated with responsiveness to chemotherapy which contributes to overall survival. Together, EPLIN appears to be a prognostic factor and may be associated with patient sensitivity to NAC.","['Gastric cancer', 'Prognosis', 'Clinicopathology', 'Chemoresistance', 'Eplin']",[],[],NaN

Several irrigants have been proposed without a proper comparison. The aim of the study is to compare the antibacterial capacity of different activated irrigants using passive ultrasonic activation (PUI) or XP-Endo finisher (XPF). Methods A total of 100 instrumented teeth were incubated in an Eppendorf tube containing 0.5 McFarland of  Enterococcus faecalis  and incubated for 2 weeks at 37 °C. Roots were divided into 5 groups ( n  = 20) according to the irrigant type: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (17%), ethydronic acid (HEDP) (9%) mixed with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), EDTA (17%) mixed with 5.25% NaOCl, PBS, and a control group. Each group was divided into two subgroups ( n  = 10): PUI and XPF. Results As compared to the untreated control group, the irrigators included in the study had a significant effect in bacteria reduction. The obtained results show HEDP to be the most effective irrigant, since no bacteria were recovered after treatment of this group, followed by EDTA mixed with NaOCl and, finally, the EDTA-irrigated group.

Methods:  Our dataset contained 5008 panoramic radiographs with a mean number of 25.2 teeth per image. Teeth were segmented bounding-box-wise and classified by one expert; this was validated by another expert. Tooth segments were cropped allowing for different context; the baseline size was 100% of each box and was scaled up to capture 150%, 200%, 250% and 300% to increase context. On each of the five generated datasets, ResNet-34 classification models were trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 over 25 epochs with a batch size of 16. A total of 20% of the data was used for testing; in subgroup analyses, models were tested only on specific tooth types. Feature visualization using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to visualize salient areas.  Results:  F1-scores increased monotonically from 0.77 in the base-case (100%) to 0.93 on the largest segments (300%;  p  = 0.0083; Mann-Kendall-test). Gains in accuracy were limited between 200% and 300%. This behavior was found for all tooth types except canines, where accuracy was much higher even for smaller segments and increasing context yielded only minimal gains. With increasing context salient areas were more widely distributed over each segment; at maximum segment size, the models assessed minimum 3-4 teeth as well as the interdental or inter-arch space to come to a classification.

Therefore, a reliable method for continuous, noninvasive monitoring of [K+] is crucial. The morphology of the T-wave in the electrocardiogram (ECG) reflects Δ[K+] and two time-warping-based T-wave morphological parameters, dw and its heart-rate corrected version dw,c, have been shown to reliably track Δ[K+] from the ECG. The aim of this study is to derive polynomial models relating dw and dw,c with Δ[K+], and to test their ability to reliably sense and quantify Δ[K+] values. Methods 48-hour Holter ECGs and [K+] values from six blood samples were collected from 29 ESRD-HD patients. For every patient, dw and dw,c were computed, and linear, quadratic, and cubic fitting models were derived from them. Then, Spearman's (ρ) and Pearson's ( r ) correlation coefficients, and the estimation error (ed) between Δ[K+] and the corresponding model-estimated values (Δ^[K+]) were calculated. Results and discussions Nonlinear models were the most suitable for Δ[K+] estimation, rendering higher Pearson's correlation (median 0.77 ≤r≤ 0.92) and smaller estimation error (median 0.20 ≤ed≤ 0.43) than the linear model (median 0.76 ≤r≤ 0.86 and 0.30 ≤ed≤ 0.40), even if similar Spearman's ρ were found across models (median 0.77 ≤ρ≤ 0.83).

We designed a new scale for the rapid detection of frailty.  Methods:  We developed a frailty screening tool for use in primary care, referred to as the Zulfiqar Frailty Scale (ZFS). This scale was tested in a general practitioner's office for six months in Plancoët, France. Only patients over 75 years of age with Activities of Daily Living (ADL) ≥4 were included. The objective of this research was to validate the scale, evaluate its performance, and compare this screening tool with other scales such as the Fried Scale, the Gerontopole Frailty Screening Tool (GFST), the modified Short Emergency Geriatric Assessment (mSEGA) Grid A, and the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA).  Results:  A total of 102 patients were included, with a mean age of 82.65 ± 4.79; 55 were women and 47 were men. The percentage of frail subjects was 63.7% in our scale, 67.7% in the mSEGA grid A, 75.5% in the GFST, and 60.8% for the Fried criteria. After a comprehensive geriatric assessment, frailty syndrome was found in 57 patients (55.9%). In general, both scales showed solid performance, and differences between them in the sample were minimal. As the CGA showed a prevalence of frailty of 55.9%, a similar prevalence threshold for the ZFS (i.e., 64% at the threshold ≥3 could be assessed). The completion time for our scale was less than two minutes, and staff required no training beforehand. Its sensitivity was 83.9%, and its specificity was 67.5%. Its positive predictive value was 80%, and its negative predictive value was 73%. The Pearson correlations between the geriatric scores were all strong and roughly equivalent to each other.

All subjects were familiarized with the aim of the study prior to data collection. Participants took part in the research voluntarily and could discontinue their participation at any time. They provided written consent for the use of information collected during the examination.,"The main aim of this manuscript was to present a preliminary verification of the relations between the Dark Triad of personality traits and health-oriented behaviors in university students. The study involved 143 healthy students (94 female and 49 male) from the Silesian Voivodeship (Poland). The diagnosis of the elements of the Dark Triad of personality was carried out using a psychological examination based on the following tests: TriPM-41, Mach IV, NPI. The intensity of the health behaviors was examined using the Health Behavior Inventory developed by Z. Juczyński. The Health Behavior Inventory is positively correlated with narcissism and its self-sufficiency component and negatively with psychopathic disinhibition. For the Health Behavior Inventory's subscales, a positive relationship was observed between Positive Mental Attitude and narcissism, most of its components, and psychopathic boldness. The analysis of correlations with the division of the subjects into the Dark Triad traits ≤Me and >Me revealed that a significant positive correlation between the general intensity of the health behaviors and the intensity of narcissism mainly concerns university students with a lower level of this trait and its components. Therefore, it can be presumed that narcissism, although considered as a socially aversive trait, is associated with pro-health behaviors.","['Narcissism', 'Psychopathy', 'Healthy Lifestyle', 'Machiavellianism', 'Health Behavior Inventory', 'Socially Aversive Personality Traits']","['Helsinki Declaration', 'Medical University', 'Ethics Committee', 'Research Ethics', 'study procedures', 'Ethics', 'Research', 'research voluntarily', 'study prior', 'study']",[],NaN

Using cross-sectional data from late adolescent and young women (15-23 years) at enrolment in the Matiari emPowerment and Preconception Supplementation (MaPPS) Trial, we aimed to describe the prevalence of key micronutrient deficiencies of public health concern, and generate hierarchical models to examine associations with proxies for social determinants of health (SDoH). The prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies was high: 53.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 53.0-54.3%) had anemia; 38.0% (95% CI: 36.4-39.6%) iron deficiency anemia; 31.8% (95% CI: 30.2-33.3%) vitamin A deficiency; and 81.1% (95% CI: 79.8-82.4%) vitamin D deficiency. At least one deficiency was experienced by 91.0% (95% CI: 90.1-92.0%). Few SDoH were maintained in the final hierarchical models, although those maintained were often related to socioeconomic status (e.g., education, occupation).

Subjects admitted to the Can Misses Hospital's psychiatry ward in Ibiza were recruited during summer openings of local nightclubs for four consecutive years starting in 2015.

Suicidality was present in 39% of the study cohort. Suicide Ideation Intensity overall and in the previous month was higher in users of opioids and in general of psychodepressors compared to psychostimulants or psychodysleptics. Suicidality was not correlated with alterations in any of the major psychopathological scales employed to assess the psychiatric background of the study subjects. The presence of high levels of suicidality did not specifically correlate with any major symptom indicative of previous or ongoing psychopathological alterations.

Methods Two-hundred and twenty college students (115 females,  Mean age   = 20.29 years, SD = 2.37) were recruited from a south-central Chinese university. Participants' SB (daily % time spent in SB), SE (number of minutes of sleep duration/number of minutes in bed), and SD were assessed via wrist-worn ActiGraph GT9X Link accelerometers for one week. Body weight was measured using a digital weight scale, height was measured using a stadiometer, and BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m 2 ). Results Participants' average time spent in SB was 76.52% (SD = 10.03), SE was 84.12% (SD = 4.79), and BMI was 20.67 kg/m 2  (SD = 3.12), respectively.

A major source of variability in MSC-sEV preparations is EV producer cells. To circumvent variability in producer cells, clonal immortalized MSC lines as EV producer lines are increasingly being used for sEV production.

A principal component analysis was performed to group preselected variables related to active and healthy ageing into the dimensions of health, social participation, and lifelong learning. A linear regression model was built using the change in CASP-12 scores over the 4-year follow-up as the dependent variable, including the interactions between country and each independent variable in the model. After four years, the average QoL increased in Portugal (difference = 0.8,  p   p   p  = 0.408). A significant country-participation component interaction ( p  = 0.039) was found.

For this reason, the present study aimed at assessing potential correlations between salivary oxytocin and maternal behavior in 25 lactating Labrador Retriever dogs. Salivary concentrations of OXT (sOXT) were unrelated to the amount of maternal care except for a weak negative correlation with sniffing/poking behavior. Moreover, sOXT was positively correlated with the percentage of male puppies. Sniffing/poking behavior, in turn, was positively correlated with the duration of time the mothers spent out of the whelping box, while the number of male puppies showed a positive correlation with lateral nursing, a position known to provide puppies the easiest access to the milk.

Objective To determine the effects of two types of physical training on the functional features associated with the cognitive state and the effect on a physiological mediator of growth hormone (IGF-1) in older women. Material and methods Quasi-experimental study that included 12 weeks of training in two groups divided into resistance and aerobic training. The study included a population of 113 women aged 69.39 ± 6.48 years from Talcahuano, Chile. All participants were randomly assigned to either group. The MINIMENTAL test was used to examine the executive functions of cognitive state and blood concentration of IGF-1, which was also used to examine neurotrophic factors. For the assessment of physical condition, an indirect test was used for the maximum mass displaced in one repetition (1RM) by the limbs and the TM6 test to estimate maximal oxygen consumption. Results Significant differences between the groups with respect to the total score obtained in the MINIMENTAL test (EG1 = 28.13 ± 2.26; EG2 = 28.57 ± 1.83 and CG = 23.47 ± 2.80; ANOVA;  p  = 0.000) were observed. A post hoc analysis revealed no significant differences when examining executive functions individually between groups (Bonferroni;  p  > 0.05). An increase in the neurotrophic factor IGF-1 was also recorded in the training groups (EG1  p  = 0.014 and EG2  p  = 0.005). The pre- and post-test showed large differences in magnitude in the resistance training group (ES = 0.9; 20.41% change). Conclusion Both workouts produce an overall improvement in the functions associated with cognitive status and increase blood concentrations of IGF-1 in older adults.","['Older Adult', 'Aerobic Capacity', 'Muscular Strength', 'Cognitive State']",[],[],NaN

The series consists of 131 patients with 166 UIAs and 2854 person-years of follow-up between diagnosis of UIA and its rupture, death or the last follow-up contact. These were diagnosed before 1979, when UIAs were not treated in our country. Those patients with a moderate or severe disability after SAH, according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale, had lower rupture rates of UIA than those with a good recovery or minimal disability (4/37 or 11%, annual UIA rupture rate of 0.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-1.3%) during 769 follow-up years vs. 27/94 or 29%, 1.3% (95% CI 0.9-1.9%) during 2085 years). Those with a moderate or severe disability differed from others by their older age. Those with a moderate or severe disability tended to have a decreased cumulative rate of aneurysm rupture (log rank test,  p  = 0.066) and lower relative risk of UIA rupture (hazard ratio 0.39, 95% CI 0.14-1.11,  p  = 0.077). Multivariable hazard ratios showed at least similar results, suggesting that confounding factors did not have a significant effect on the results. The results of this study without treatment selection of UIAs suggest that patients with a moderate or severe disability after SAH have a relatively low risk of rupture of UIAs.

Conclusion:  In addition to limbic encephalitis, extralimbic encephalitis is also an important phenotype in patients who are positive for anti-GAD65 antibodies. Early diagnosis and immunotherapy can improve the symptoms. However, patients with limbic encephalitis often have refractory epilepsy in the chronic phase and have a poor long-term outcome.","['Pediatric', 'Limbic Encephalitis', 'Autoimmune Encephalitis', 'Anti-Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase 65', 'Extralimbic Encephalitis']","['Autoimmune Encephalitis', 'Registration Project', 'Pediatric Autoimmune', 'Ethics Statement', 'approval number', 'medical ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'committee approval']",['2019-K-300).'],NaN

A correct clinical treatment of myofascial pain has the potential to modify the functional activation of cerebral networks associated with pain and unconscious teeth clenching, specifically the pain network (PN) and default mode network (DMN). In this study, research is presented as a case series of five patients with myofascial pain: three were diagnosed with intra- and extra-articular disorders, and two were diagnosed with only extra-articular disorders. All five patients received gnathological therapy consisting of passive splints and biofeedback exercises for tongue-palatal vault coordination. Before and after treatment, patients underwent pain assessments (through measures of visual analog scales and muscular palpation tests), nuclear magnetic resonance of the temporomandibular joint, and functional nuclear magnetic resonance of the brain. In each patient, temporomandibular joint nuclear magnetic resonance results were similar before and after the gnathological treatment. However, the treatment resulted in a considerable reduction in pain for all patients, according to the visual analog scales and the palpation test. Furthermore, functional nuclear magnetic resonance of the brain clearly showed a homogeneous modification in cerebral networks associated with pain (i.e., PN and DMN), in all patients. In conclusion, gnathological therapy consisting of passive aligners and biofeedback exercises improved myofascial pain in all five patients. Most importantly, this study showed that all five patients had a homogeneous functional modification of pain and default mode networks. Using passive splints in combination with jaw exercises may be an effective treatment option for patients with TMD. This research could be a starting point for future investigations and for clinicians who want to approach similar situations.","['fMRI', 'Headache', 'Myofascial Pain', 'Trigger Points', 'Tmj', 'Tmd', 'Teeth Clenching', 'Facial Pain Management']","['Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'Chieti Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Committee', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'University', 'Chieti']",[],NaN

Autonomic instability is frequent in anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis (anti-NMDARE). However, PSH in anti-NMDARE has gained little attention. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 24 patients diagnosed with severe anti-NMDARE in the neuro-intensive care unit (NICU) between 2014 and 2019. Patients were assessed with the PSH assessment measure (PSH-AM) scale, and categorized into ""PSH+"" group and ""PSH-"" group. The clinical characteristics, hospital mortality, and functional outcome by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at six months after discharge were compared between the two groups. Among patients with PSH+, the clinical features and pharmacotherapy of PSH were summarized and compared. Results Twenty-four patients were included in the study. Twelve of them (50%) were categorized as PSH+ based on PSH-AM scores. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristic, GCS scores upon admission, incidence of status epilepticus, teratoma occurrence, hospital mortality, and 6-month mRS between PSH+ and PSH- groups. Patients with PSH+ had increased length of NICU stay, hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation. The most prominent clinical features of PSH in severe anti-NMDARE were tachycardia and hyperthermia, while posturing was the relatively mildest clinical feature. Propranolol and clonazepam were more commonly used than gabapentin in pharmacotherapy of PSH in severe anti-NMDARE. Conclusions The incidence of PSH in severe anti-NMDARE patients was as high as 50%. Patients with PSH demonstrated prolonged NICU stay, hospital stay and increased duration of mechanical ventilation, while no effect on hospital mortality and functional outcome. Clinicians should be aware of the distinctive characteristics and treatment options of PSH in severe anti-NMDARE.","['Treatment', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Anti-nmda Receptor Encephalitis', 'Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity', 'Neuro-intensive Care Unit']","['Nanfang Hospital', 'Southern Medical', 'Medical University', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Hospital', 'Southern', 'University', 'Ethics', 'Statement']",[],NaN

Therefore, adrenal venous sampling (AVS) is often performed, even in primary aldosteronism (PA) patients who have no apparent adrenal tumors (ATs) on imaging. In most of these cases, however, the PA is bilateral. Objective To clarify the clinical need for AVS in PA patients without apparent ATs, taking into consideration the rates of adrenalectomy. Methods This is a retrospective cross-sectional study assessing 1586 PA patients without apparent ATs in the multicenter Japan PA study (JPAS). We analyzed which parameters could be used to distinguish unilateral PA patients without apparent ATs from bilateral patients. We also analyzed the prevalences of adrenalectomy in unilateral PA patients. Results The unilateral subtype without an apparent AT was diagnosed in 200 (12.6%) of 1586 PA patients. Being young and female with a short hypertension duration, normokalemia, low creatinine level, low plasma aldosterone concentration, and low aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) was significantly more common in bilateral than unilateral PA patients. If PA patients without apparent ATs were female and normokalemic with a low ARR ( Conclusion The low prevalence of the unilateral subtype in PA patients without apparent ATs suggests AVS is not indicated for all of these patients. AVS could be skipped in female normokalemic PA patients without apparent ATs if their ARRs are not high. However, AVS should be considered for male hypokalemic PA patients with high ARRs because the rates of the unilateral subtype are high in these patients.","['Cardiovascular disease', 'Hyperaldosteronism', 'Adrenalectomy', 'Primary Aldosteronism', 'Adrenal Venous Sampling']","['National Hospital', 'Hospital Organization', 'Organization Kyoto', 'Kyoto Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Medical Center', 'ethics committee', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

Tumor hypoxia, which is highly prevalent in cancers of the head and neck region, has been hypothesized to inhibit the infiltration of tumors by CTL. In situ data validating this concept have so far been based solely upon the visual assessment of the distribution of CTL. Here, we have established a set of spatial statistical tools to address this problem mathematically and tested their performance. (2) Patients and Methods: We have analyzed regions of interest (ROI) of 22 specimens of cancers of the head and neck region after 4-plex immunofluorescence staining and whole-slide scanning. Single cell-based segmentation was carried out in QuPath. Specimens were analyzed with the endpoints clustering and interactions between CTL, normoxic, and hypoxic tumor areas, both visually and using spatial statistical tools implemented in the R package Spatstat. (3) Results: Visual assessment suggested clustering of CTL in all instances. The visual analysis also suggested an inhibitory effect between hypoxic tumor areas and CTL in a minority of the whole-slide scans (9 of 22, 41%). Conversely, the objective mathematical analysis in Spatstat demonstrated statistically significant inhibitory interactions between hypoxia and CTL accumulation in a substantially higher number of specimens (16 of 22, 73%). It showed a similar trend in all but one of the remaining samples. (4) Conclusion: Our findings provide non-obvious but statistically rigorous evidence of inhibition of CTL infiltration into hypoxic tumor subregions of cancers of the head and neck. Importantly, these shielded sites may be the origin of tumor recurrences. We provide the methodology for the transfer of our statistical approach to similar questions. We discuss why versions of the Kcross and pcf.cross functions may be the methods of choice among the repertoire of statistical tests in Spatstat for this type of analysis.","['Hypoxia', 'Spatial analysis', 'Head And Neck Cancer', 'R', 'Open-source', 'Cancer Immune Evasion', 'Multichannel Immunofluorescence']",[],[],NaN

Adults born preterm had smaller LV dimensions, but these differences did not remain after adjustment for body surface area (BSA), which was smaller in the preterm group. Stroke volume and cardiac output were reduced even after adjustment for BSA. We found a smaller e' wave in the preterm group, but other markers of systolic and diastolic function did not differ. Use of antenatal steroids may be associated with a further reduced cardiac output in those born preterm. Adults born preterm show alterations in markers of LV dimensions and function.

Voice impairment after TT can occur not only in patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) transient paralysis, but also in cases of normal vocal cord mobility.  Aim:  To compare voice limits using a speech range profile (SRP) in patients before and 14 days after TT and to investigate the influence of the early results of voice quality after TT on the personal lives of patients. We focused on the perception of voice change before and shortly after TT.  Materials and methods:  A retrospective study, in the period 2018-2020, included 65 patients aged 22-75 years. We compared two groups of patients: group I ( n  = 45) (without RLN paresis) and group II ( n  = 20) (with early transient postoperative RLN paresis). Patients underwent video flexible laryngocopy, SRP, and Voice Handicap Index-30 (VHI-30).  Results:  In group I, the mean values of F max  (maximum frequency) and I max  (maximum intensity) decreased in women (both  p  = 0.001), and VHI-30 increased ( p  = 0.001). In group II after TT in women, the mean F max  and I max  values decreased ( p  = 0.005 and  p  = 0.034), and the frequency range of the voice was reduced from 5 to 2 semitones. The dynamic range of the voice was reduced by 3.4 dB in women and 5.1 dB in men.VHI-30 increased ( p  = 0.001).  Conclusion:  The study documented a worsening of the mean values of SRP, VHI-30, and voice parameters of patients in group II. Voice disorders also occurred in group I without RLN paresis. Non-paretic causes can also contribute to voice damage after TT. SRP and VHI-30 are suitable tools for comparing voice status in two groups of patients, including those with dysphonia.

A total of 799 T2DM patients from eight communities of Shanghai, China, were randomized into one control arm and three intervention arms receiving 1-year interventions of health literacy, exercise, or both. PA was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months and quantified as metabolic equivalents (Mets). A multiple level mixed regression model was applied to evaluate the associations between PA and HbA1c level. After adjusting for potential confounders including interaction of PA level with initial PA or HbA1c, a significant improved HbA1c was observed for the patients in the medium versus the lowest tertile groups of overall PA at 12 months (β: -3.47, 95%CI: -5.33, -1.60) and for those in the highest versus the lowest tertile group at 24 months (β: -0.50, 95%CI: -1.00, -0.01), resulting in a β (95%CI) of -3.49 (95%CI: -5.87, -1.11) during the whole two-year period of follow-up. The negative association was also observed when the subjects were classified according to their exercise levels using the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation as a cut-off point. The beneficial effect of higher PA level was only observed among patients having a lower level of baseline HbA1c or PA or both (all  p  values for interaction <0.05). Our results provide evidence for the beneficial effect of PA and suggest that the exercise intervention should be addressed to the physically inactive patients to improve their PA level to a physiological threshold.","['Type 2 diabetes', 'Glycemic control', 'Physical Activity', 'Randomized Control Trial']",[],[],NaN

Studies in mice suggest that anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) can trigger osteoclast activation and bone resorption in the bone marrow. However, data on the presence and role of ACPAs in human bone marrow are scarce. We investigated whether ACPAs can contribute to osteoclast activation and bone erosion in RA bone marrow. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP Abs), osteoclast activation indicators-the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b) and cathepsin K, and bone degradation marker-C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) were measured in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of RA patients using ELISAs. We found that ACPAs present in RA bone marrow was associated with increased amounts of TRAP5b, cathepsin K and CTX-I in this location. Levels of IL-8, the key mediator of anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-induced bone resorption, were also elevated in bone marrow containing anti-CCP Abs and positively correlated with TRAP5b and cathepsin K concentrations. Higher levels of TRAP5b, cathepsin K, CTX-I and IL-8 in bone marrow compared to peripheral blood indicate local generation of these molecules.

IB 2251/14 PI) and by the Ethics Committee of the University of Navarra (ref. 054/2015mod2). All participants were informed of the purpose and the implications of the study and all provided the written consent to participate. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with registry number NCT04442620 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04442620, accessed on 22 June 2020). 4.1. Anthropometric Measurements Trained dietitians measured height to the nearest millimeter, with the participantâ€™s head maintained in the Frankfurt Horizontal Plane, using a mobile stadiometer (Seca 213, SECA Deutschland, Hamburg, Germany). Weight and body fat were measured, with participants wearing light clothes and no shoes (0.6 kg of weight was subtracted for their clothing), using a Segmental Body Composition Analyzer for impedance testing (Tanita MC780P-MA, Tanita, Tokyo, Japan). BMI was calculated following the standard formula weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Three circumferences i.e., waist (WC), hip (HC), and neck (NC) were measured in duplicate with an anthropometric tape with the subjects standing upright. The average value of each measurement was used in the analysis. WC was measured halfway between the last rib and the iliac crest, HC was measured around the largest part of the hips, and NC was measured between the mid-cervical spine and the mid anterior neck. Blood pressure (BP) was measured in triplicate, in the non-dominant arm with a validated semi-automatic oscillometer (Omron HEM-705CP, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands) after 5 min of rest in a seated position. The average of three measurements, 2 min apart, was recorded. 4.2. General Data During an initial interview with the study dietitian and study nurse, information on socioeconomic, medical history, current use of medication, and smoking status was collected. Information on alcohol consumption was collected by asking participants how many alcoholic beverages they consumed in a week on average, and responding either none, <7/week, or ≥7/week. Patients consuming ≥7 alcoholic beverages on average a week were excluded if presenting a drinking problem and/or a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder [ 23]. Physical activity habits over the previous 12 months were obtained using the validated Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (Spanish version), which estimates total weekly energy expenditure in leisure time physical activity as metabolic equivalents of tasks (METs) using the following formula: METs·min·wk [ 24, 25]. 4.3. Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet At the baseline interview, dietitians administered a 17-item Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) questionnaire used in the PREDIMED trial [ 26], which assesses adherence to the MedDiet. Each item related to a specific dietary habit contemplated by the MedDiet and could be scored as 1 (compliance) or 0 (non-compliance). The total score ranged between 0 and 17 such as a score of 0 indicated no compliance and a score of 17 indicated maximum adherence. 4.4. Blood Collection and Analysis Venous blood and single spot urine samples were collected in the morning after a 12-h overnight fast. Blood was collected through a venous catheter from the antecubital vein in suitable vacutainers containing ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), citrate, or serum before immediate centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Routine laboratory parameters such as fasting glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), uric acid, urea, creatinine, albumin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), were measured in serum on the Abbott ARCHITECT c16000 (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) employing specific commercial kits. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated according to the Friedewald formula [ 27]. Serum fasting insulin was assayed on the Cobas e411 platform (Roche, Switzerland), using either an enzyme-based electrochemiluminescence assay or an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Serum ferritin was determined on the Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA) automated analyzer ARCHITECT i2000 (CMIA, Abbott Core laboratory Systems, Lake Forest, IL, USA). Hematological parameters were analyzed in whole blood in an automatic flow cytometer analyzer (Cell-Dyn Sapphire platform, Abbott Core laboratory Systems, Lake Forest, IL, USA). Urinary albumin excretion was measured from an early-morning urine sample as UACR. The urinary albumin concentration was determined by immunoturbidimetric assay and urinary creatinine concentration was measured by a modified Jaffe method on an Abbott ARCHITECT c16000. Insulin resistance was estimated using the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) formula by Matthews et al. [ 28], as well as the TGs and glucose (TyG) index, calculated as the natural logarithm of the product of fasting plasma glucose and TG [ 29]. 4.5. Estimated GFR Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated using the new Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, developed in 2009 [ 30]. The estimated renal function using the CKD-EPI equation is normalized for body surface area (BSA) and expressed as GFR mL/min/1.73 m 2. Although the equation has been validated in populations with normal as well as low GFR, and is generally well-accepted [ 31], it has been argued that indexing eGFR for BSA in patients with increased weight can result in an underestimation of GFR, and masking a genuine association between renal function and body fat, such that it has been suggested that absolute estimates of GFR should be used instead [ 32, 33, 34]. Accordingly, eGFR was converted to absolute values (mL/min) by using the following formula [ 32]: (eGFR mL/min/1.73 m 2 * BSA)/1.73 m 2. BSA was calculated using the DuBois and DuBois equation [ 35]. Glomerular hyperfiltration was defined as Egfr â‰¥ 120 mL/min [ 36]. 4.6. Imaging Presence of hepatic steatosis was further assessed by abdominal MRI (Signa Explorer 1.5T, General Electric Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) by experienced radiologists. The protocol for the assessment of liver fat included the iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation quantitation (IDEAL IQ) sequence. The chemical shift at particular echo times can be observed in gradient-echo imaging. The detection of fatty liver results from the degree of signal loss, which is proportional to the degree of lipid accumulation [ 37]. NAFLD was staged as absent (<6.4%) or present (â‰¥6.4%), according to Tang et al. [ 38]. The gold standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD is by liver biopsy, nevertheless, MRI has been found to be a sensitive, highly accurate, and reliable non-invasive alternative [ 38]."," Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is early marked by kidney glomerular hyperfiltration. However, the association of NAFLD with kidney glomerular hyperfiltration has not been tested so far in adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Aims To assess the relationship between NAFLD and kidney glomerular hyperfiltration in adults with MetS. Methods The study included 154 participants aged 40-60 years with MetS and NAFLD diagnosed by ultrasound. NAFLD was confirmed by MRI in 109 subjects. Participants underwent anthropometric measurements, and biochemistry testing. Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated using the CKD-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula; hyperfiltration was defined as eGFR ≥ 120 mL/min. Results Participants with MRI-proven NAFLD showed a worse metabolic profile and higher levels of eGFR than those with no NAFLD.

Material and methods RNA expression of the nine key DDRG ( BCL2 ,  BRCA1 ,  BRCA2 ,  ERCC2 ,  ERCC6 ,  FOXM1 ,  RAD50 ,  RAD51 , and  RAD52 ) was assessed by qRT-PCR in a cohort of 61 MICB patients (median age 66 y, 48 males, 13 females) who underwent radical cystectomy in a tertiary care center. The results were validated in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort of MIBC ( n  = 383). Gene expression was correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Subgroup analyses were performed in patients who received adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (ACBC) (Mannheim  n  = 20 and TCGA  n  = 75).

Employees working in correctional services, researchers find, experience high rates of life-time suicidal ideation in comparison to other public safety professionals and the general population. Suicide behaviours (i.e., ideation, planning, attempts, death) are a multifactorial phenomenon, explained in part by the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide that suggests attempted suicide is facilitated by perceived burdensomeness, a lost sense of belonging, a feeling of hopelessness, and a progressively reduced fear of death, as well as capacity and planning to engage a lethal attempt. In the current study, we unpack the factors that can influence suicide behaviours as reported by correctional workers. Our intent is to make explicit the experiences of a small sample ( n  = 25) of correctional workers in relation to suicidal behaviours, highlighting stories of recovery and acknowledging the importance of facilitating psychologically safe workplaces. Analysis entailed an inductive semi-grounded emergent theme approach. Participants identified certain risk factors as being able to induce suicidal ideation, such as marital or family problems as well as difficulties at work (i.e., bullying or difficult working conditions). Having children and a partner may act as factors preventing suicide for those with ideation. Participants sought help from professionals, such as their family doctor, a psychologist, or the Employee Assistance Program (EAP); however, the lack of perceived organisational supports and recognition of the issue of suicide by the employer are two elements that can hinder the search for help.","['Qualitative Research', 'Suicide Prevention', 'Occupational Mental Health', 'Public Safety Personnel', 'Correctional Workers']",[],[],NaN

Sixteen patients (18 prostheses) underwent clinical and radiological follow-up. The average follow-up time was 8.5 years (1 to 16). Poor results of the MPW prosthesis are caused by the issues of balancing with luxation and increased PE wear. Salvage procedures included revision of the TWA or fusion. In successful cases, the flexion and extension movement averaged 40 degrees. The grip force was around 2.5 kg.

Methods This study used Q methodology to identify different perspectives of Dutch citizens (N = 30) on the use of CRISPR-Cas9. The Q-sort method aims at segmenting audiences based on the structural characteristics of their perspectives. Participants individually ranked 32 statements about CRISPR-Cas9 and discussed their rankings in small groups. By-person factor analysis was performed using PQMethod. Participants' contributions to the discussions were used to further make sense of the audience segments identified. Results Five perspectives on CRISPR-Cas9 were identified: (1) pragmatic optimism (2) concerned scepticism; (3) normative optimism; (4) enthusiastic support; and (5) benevolent generalism. Each perspective represents a unique position motivated by different ranking rationales. Sorting rationales included improving health, preventing negative impacts on society, and fear of a slippery slope. Overall, there is broad, but not universal support for medical uses of CRISPR-Cas9.

However, many studies have suggested an association between occupational exposure in civil construction and lung cancer risk. Thus, this study aims to assess lung cancer risk in civil construction workers occupationally exposed to physical and chemical agents through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods/design Studies will be identified by searching PUBMED, Embase, SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE and the reference list of included articles. Eligible study designs will be cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies that report occupational exposure to physical or chemical agents and lung cancer risk through mortality or incidence outcomes. A meta-analysis will be used to combine odds ratios (ORs) from case-control studies and relative risks (RR) from cohort studies. Two reviewers will independently screen articles, extract data, and assess scientific quality using standardized forms and ROBINS-E tool if available. Otherwise, the New-Castle Ottawa rating scale will be used. Any of those will also be used in combination with the GRADE approach for quality of evidence. Overall risk estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be obtained using the random-effects model meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Results will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Discussion This review will identify and synthesize studies investigating the association between occupational exposure in the construction industry and lung cancer. The findings will help governmental entities and researchers with evidence-based decision-making because they will integrate and validate the evidence on construction workers' health effects due to occupational exposure.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of continuous negative pressure drainage combined with intermittent irrigation (CNPDCII) in the presacral space on the perineal SSI following laparoscopic ELAPE for low rectal cancer. Patients and methods The clinical data of 99 patients with low rectal cancer who underwent laparoscopic ELAPE surgery were retrospectively analyzed. Among the 99 patients, 46 patients received CNPDCII and 53 patients received conventional drainage in the presacral space after ELAPE. Self-made irrigation drainage tube: took a silicone drainage tube, cut 3 side holes at every 2cm intervals at the front end, and fixed a flexible tube of an intravenous needle at the front end of the silicone drainage tube. The conventional drainage tube or self-made irrigation drainage tube was placed in the presacral space and poked out from the inside of the ischial tuberosity. The incidence of SSI and other perioperative indicators between the two groups was compared within 30 days after surgery. Results There was no statistical difference in clinicopathological features between the two groups of patients (p>0.05). A statistically lower rate of SSI was found in CNPDCII group (17.4%, 8/46) than the conventional drainage group (35.8%, 19/53). The drainage tube retention time (7.8±1.2 d VS 9.4±1.6 d) and the postoperative hospital stay (9.7±1.4 d VS 11.9±2.3 d) in CNPDCII group were significantly shortened than the conventional drainage group. There was no statistical difference in operating theatre time and intraoperative blood loss between the two groups. Multivariate analysis confirmed that CNPDCII was an independent protective factor for SSI after ELAPE. Conclusion CNPDCII can effectively reduce the incidence of SSI following laparoscopic ELAPE, which is simple, safe and effective.","['Surgical Site Infection', 'Low Rectal Cancer', 'Extralevator Abdominoperineal Excision', 'Negative Pressure Drainage']","['Shandong University', 'Central Hospital', 'Zibo Central', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'study complied', 'Hospital', 'Shandong', 'University', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

Moreover, these VTA projections are hypothesized to be part of a functional loop, in which dopamine regulates memory storage. It is hypothesized that when a novel stimulus is encountered and recognized as novel, increased dopamine activity in the hippocampus induces long-term potentiation and long-term storage of memories. We here demonstrate the importance of increased release of dopamine and norepinephrinein the rat ventral hippocampus on recognition memory, using microdialysis combined to a modified novel object recognition test. We found that presenting rats to a novel object significantly increased dopamine and norepinephrine output in the ventral hippocampus. Two hours after introducing the first object, a second object (either novel or familiar) was placed in the same position as the first object. Presenting the animals to a second novel object significantly increased dopamine and norepinephrine release in the ventral hippocampus, compared to a familiar object. In conclusion, this study suggests that dopamine and norepinephrine output in the ventral hippocampus has a crucial role in recognition memory and signals novelty.","['Dopamine', 'Hippocampus', 'Norepinephrine', 'Microdialysis', 'Novelty', 'Recognition Memory', 'Ventral Hippocampus', 'Novel Object Recognition (Nor)']","['Stockholm North', 'Karolinska Institutet', 'Ethics Statement', 'ethics committee', 'animal study', 'local animal', 'animal research', 'research ethics', 'Stockholm', 'North']",[],NaN

Predictors of parenting goals and parenting practices were also investigated. Mothers of 4-6 years old children from the western United States ( N  = 78) and Shanghai/China ( N  = 96) participated in this study. The results suggested that mothers from Shanghai/China were both more collectivistic and individualistic than mothers from the western United States. Chinese mothers more strongly endorsed training and collectivistic parenting goals, while European American mothers more strongly endorsed individualistic parenting goals for their children. However, no significant difference was found in parenting practices for both groups of mothers. For both ethnic groups, in general, mothers' cultural values have small but significant impact on their parenting processes. The prediction of cultural values and parenting goals on parenting practices were also different for both ethnicity groups. Although Chinese mothers were higher on both individualism and collectivism, their collectivistic values were more important in predicting parental social cognitions.","['Cultural Values', 'Parenting Practices', 'Social Cognitions', 'European American', 'Shanghai/China']","['State University', 'Ethics Committee', 'Washington State', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethical Statement', 'Ethics', 'Committee', 'Washington', 'committee approved', 'United States']",[],NaN

Patients with prostate cancer (PCa) under androgen deprivation therapies (ADTs) present increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Since thromboxane A 2  (TXA 2 ) is one of the most studied prostanoids and its involvement in different cardiovascular diseases has been described, the aim of this study was to investigate: (i) the effect of ADT on the serum levels of TXA 2  in PCa patients and its possible link to the redox status and (ii) the effect of the non-hydrolyzable TXA 2  analog U-46619 on the function of the aorta of male rats.  Methods:  The levels of TXA 2  and total antioxidant status in 50 healthy subjects, 54 PCa patients, and 57 PCa under ADT were evaluated. These determinations were accompanied by levels of testosterone and C-reactive protein as an inflammation marker. In aortic segments from male rats, the U46619-induced effects on: (i) the vasomotor responses to acetylcholine (ACh), to the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), to the carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-3 (CORM-3), and to noradrenaline (NA) and (ii) the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were analyzed.  Results:  The serum level of TXA 2  in patients with PCa was increased with respect to healthy subjects, which was further increased by ADT. There was no modification in the total antioxidant status among the three experimental groups. In aortic segments from male rats, the TXA 2  analog decreased the endothelium-dependent relaxation and the sensitivity of smooth muscle cells to NO, while it increased the vasoconstriction induced by NA; the expression of COX-2, HO-1, and pERK1/2 was also increased.  Conclusions:  ADT increased, along with other inflammatory/oxidative markers, the serum levels of TXA 2 . The fact that TXA 2  negatively impacts the vascular function of the aorta of healthy male rats suggests that inhibition of TXA 2 -mediated events could be considered a potential strategy to protect the cardiovascular system.","['Endothelium', 'prostate cancer', 'Vascular Function', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapy (Adt)', 'Thromboxane A2 (Txa2)']","['Ref.

Previous studies suggested that the stress-alleviating effect was different when individuals were touched by different persons. Specifically, the stress was reduced significantly when the individual was touched by the close partner compared with the acquaintance and the stranger. However, whether the stress-alleviating effect of touch was modulated by the close relationship quality is unknown. To examine this question, the participants ( n  = 61) performed a 3 (i.e., alone, partner no-touch, and partner touch) × 2 (i.e., safety and threat) within-subjects experiment. The results revealed that the stress of the participants alleviated significantly while close partners present with touch compared with without touch during facing a threat. We also found that the relationship quality of couple-members (i.e., participants perceiving the quality of alternatives and the partners' commitment level) modulated touch-induced stress alleviation. Participants perceiving the low quality of alternatives and the high partners' commitment level showed stronger touch-induced stress-alleviating effect than participants perceiving the high quality of alternatives and the low partners' commitment level. The explained variance was around 16.8% jointly for actor and partner effects. These findings provide evidence for explaining the reasons for touch-induced alleviating stress and have important implications for predicting the future effect of interactive behaviors.","['Stress', 'Touch', 'Relationship Quality', 'Well-being', 'Actor And Partner Effects']","['Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Date', 'China', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Committee']",['2020KY78).'],NaN

The SIRT1 activator, resveratrol, acts as a crucial regulator of aging and may have a potential therapeutic effect on OA. Rabbit OA models were established through destabilized medial meniscus surgery. A total of 40 healthy male New Zealand rabbits were divided into five groups: control group (sham operation), OA group, as well as low dose (LD), middle dose (MD), and high dose (HD) resveratrol-treated OA groups. 6 weeks after operation, 0.8 ml of normal saline was injected into the knee joints every other day in the control and OA groups, and 0.8 ml of 5, 10, and 15 μmol/L resveratrol was injected into the knee joints every other day in the LD, MD, and HD group, respectively. The rabbits were sacrificed 2 weeks after medication, and the articular cartilage of the knee joint was collected for Micro-CT, histology and Western blot analysis. Obvious articular cartilage lesion and joint space narrowing were detected in the OA group. Compared with the OA group, less osteoarthritic changes were observed in the MD and HD groups. The MD and HD groups had significantly lower bone volume fraction, trabecular number and Mankin scores than the LD and OA groups ( p   p  > 0.05). The expressions of SIRT1 and p53 detected by western blot were consistent with the aforementioned findings. Therefore, resveratrol can activate the SIRT1 gene to play a protective role in the OA process by inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis, trabecular bone number increasing of the subchondral bone, as well as elevation of bone density. It demonstrated the importance of SIRT1 in maintaining articular cartilage health and provided a promising therapeutic intervention in the treatment of OA.","['Cartilage', 'p53', 'Resveratrol', 'Osteoarthritis', 'SIRT1', 'Micro-ct']","['Shenzhen University', 'Affiliated Hospital', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Medical Ethics', 'Hospital', 'Shenzhen', 'Ethics', 'University', 'Peopleâ']",[],NaN

However, data on celiac disease (CeD) nutritional and gastroenterological remote monitoring are scanty. The aims of our study were to verify patients' trust in telemedicine and to evaluate the feasibility of telemedicine in nutritional monitoring.  Material and Methods:  We used telemedicine in place of the scheduled but not provided follow-up visits during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients received a phone call, and televisits were conducted for CeD patients with mild or moderate symptoms and/or with blood alterations. The patient's adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) was evaluated according to the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT). When gluten contamination was suspected, a point-of-care gluten detection test was prescribed. The patient's trust in telemedicine was assessed, through an adapted version of the Patient Trust Assessment Tool (PATAT) questionnaire, as the percentage of patients giving a score of at least 4 out of 5 on a Likert scale for three selected key statements: ""I can trust televisit,"" ""I can trust that possible problems with the telemedicine service will be solved properly,"" and ""I feel at ease when working with this website.""  Results:  One hundred and twelve CeD patients were phone called; among symptomatic patients, 39 out of the 42 scheduled (92.9%) televisits were performed. Among the 39 visits, 34 (87.2%) questionnaires were compiled. The patients included in the study obtained a CDAT score from 7 to 13 (11 ± 2). Gluten detection tests were prescribed to 11 patients, resulting positive in 2. Trust in the telemedicine service was achieved in 94.1, 88.2, and 97.1% for the three selected key statements of the PATAT questionnaire.  Conclusion:  During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine showed to be feasible and the majority of patients trusted the combined gastroenterological and nutritional televisits.

The treatment of experimental visceral leishmaniasis was effective in reducing the parasite load on the main affected organs (spleen and liver) via high doses of spironolactone. The association between spironolactone and meglumine antimoniate promoted better control of the parasite load in the spleen and liver compared to the group treated with meglumine antimoniate alone. These results reveal a possible benefit of the concomitant use of spironolactone and meglumine antimoniate that should be studied more in depth for the future possibility of repositioning for leishmaniasis co-therapy.","['Leishmania', 'Visceral leishmaniasis', 'Spironolactone', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Pentavalent Antimonial']","['Cruz Foundation', 'Oswaldo Cruz', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Animal Ethics', 'Cruz Institute', 'Ethics Statement', 'animal facilities', 'animal', 'Brazilian National']",[],NaN

Conventional bone splitting techniques require flap arising. This technical note demonstrates a method for flapless guided bone splitting. For this purpose, a newly developed surgical guide with internal irrigation channels was used. Using CAD-CAM additive technology, a narrow slot along the field of interest and a pin of a cooling pipe was designed and implemented in a surgical guide template. The bone split was performed flapless through the surgical guide while the cooling pipe was connected to it. During surgery, the piezo-driven instrument was moved within that slot, and the irrigation solution was directly rinsing it at point of entry through the irrigation channel. This procedure was performed on a 3.3 mm wide alveolar ridge achieving over 3 mm of bone gain. The described method combines several positive aspects. The micro-invasive flapless surgical procedure might improve postoperative healing. Additionally, sufficient cooling of the bone might lead to less thermal affection of bone cells and less resorption of the cortical bone.

However, the consequences of mTBI on fine motor and visuo-motor coordination are still not well understood. We aimed to evaluate whether mTBI had a concomitant effect on fine motor ability and visuo-motor integration and whether this is related to visual perception and visuo-spatial attention impairments, including patients at different symptoms stage. Eleven mTBI patients (mean age 22.8 years) and ten healthy controls participated in the study. Visuo-motor integration of fine motor abilities and form recognition were measured with the Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration test, motion perception was evaluated with motion coherence test, critical flicker fusion was measured with Pocket CFF tester. Visuo-spatial was assessed with the Ruff 2 & 7 Selection Attention Test. mTBI patients showed reduced visuo-motor integration, form recognition, and motor deficits as well as visuo-spatial attention impairment, while motion perception and critical flicker fusion were not impaired. These preliminary findings suggest that the temporary brain insults deriving from mTBI compromise fine motor skills, visuomotor integration, form recognition, and visuo-spatial attention. The impairment in visuo-motor coordination was associated with speed in visuo-attention and correlated with symptoms severity while motor ability was correlated with time since concussion. Given the strong correlation between visuomotor coordination and symptom severity, further investigation with a larger sample seems warranted.

Design and methods This study used data from the sixth National Health Service Survey conducted in 2018, with a focus on job outcomes among medical professionals in Shanghai. The reliability and validity of the tools for measuring PE and job outcomes were calculated. A structural equation model was used to examine the relationship among person-job (PJ) fit and person-group (PG) fit, job satisfaction, turnover intention, and professional efficacy. Finally, a hierarchical regression model was used to analyze the association between demographic variables and the PJ and PG fit. Results PG fit was directly and positively associated with job satisfaction and professional efficacy. PJ fit had a direct and positive association with job satisfaction but had a direct and negative association with turnover intention. The indirect association of PJ fit with turnover intention was statistically significant. The results from the hierarchical regression analysis showed that younger physicians generally had a lower level of PJ fit and older physicians with higher education tended to have a lower level of PG fit. Conclusions Medical professionals with higher PJ or PG fit have higher job satisfaction, and those with higher PG fit have higher professional efficacy. The impact of PJ fit on turnover intention was mediated by job satisfaction.

Snoring, a common clinical manifestation of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, is of clinical value in assessing sleeping disorder severity. However, investigations of the connection between snoring and CKD are limited, especially in normal-weight populations. This study assessed the relationship between snoring frequency and CKD in obese and normal-weight people in China. Methods A community-based retrospective cross-sectional study of 3250 participants was performed. Study participants were divided into three groups - the regularly snoring group, occasionally snoring group, and never snoring group - based on their self-reported snoring frequency. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relevance between snoring frequency and CKD prevalence. Results The CKD prevalence in obese participants was higher than that in normal-weight participants. Frequent snorers had a higher prevalence of CKD than those who were not frequent snorers in the obese group. Snoring frequency was correlated with CKD prevalence in obese participants independent of age, sex, smoking and drinking status, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride level, high-density lipoprotein, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (odds ratio: 2.66; 95% CI: 1.36-5.19;  p =.004), while the same relationships did not exist in normal-weight participants (odds ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.32-1.98;  p =.614). Conclusions Snoring appears to be independently associated with CKD in obese but not in normal-weight Chinese adults.","['Obesity', 'Snoring', 'Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Normal Weight']","['Chinese mainland', 'REACTION study', 'Ethics statement', 'Hospital Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ruijin Hospital', 'Shanghai Jiao', 'Jiao Tong', 'Tong University', 'University School']",['RUIJIN-2011-14).'],NaN

It does not report research. Ethics approval and consent to participate were not required to create this writing.,"Learning Health Systems (LHSs) seek continuous improvement through the translation and integration of internally and externally generated knowledge across stakeholders within and external to the organization, yet current approaches are primarily described from the healthcare delivery perspective, leaving teaching and research responsibilities underexposed. Academic medical centers offer a unique perspective on LHSs because their mission includes teaching, research, and healthcare. This introduces an opportunity to enact, educate, and study processes and outcomes of LHSs within a single system. Little information is available to describe these processes and outcomes, resulting in a knowledge gap regarding the role of education and research in the quality improvement cycles and learning of LHSs. To close this knowledge gap, The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences initiated the Health Research and Education Collaboratory (GW Collaboratory) in 2017. The GW Collaboratory was established to study mechanisms supporting continuous quality improvement and learning in health systems within an academic medical center. We envision the GW Collaboratory as interconnected knowledge nodes facilitating collaboration among clinicians, patients, researchers, and educators to study the knowledge generation, dissemination, application, and evaluation required for continuous quality improvement and learning. We employ a project-based approach to foster communities of learning focused on exploring specific health problems of interest. We propose the GW Collaboratory as one model by which academic medical centers can contribute to the science of LHS.","['Research', 'Education', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Collaboratory', 'Learning Health System']","['Health Systems', 'Learning Health', 'Ethics Approval', 'paper presents', 'academic approach', 'Systems', 'Learning', 'Health', 'Approval', 'Consent']",[],NaN

The screening methods of CRE have been extensively developed but still need improving [e.g., tests with accurate and simple minimum inhibitory (MICs)]. In this study, the performance of the BD Phoenix NMIC-413 AST panel was evaluated against clinical CRE and carbapenem-susceptible  Enterobacterales  (CSE) in China. The panel was first evaluated in the Chinese clinical lab.  Methods:  Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 303 clinical  Enterobacterales  isolates were conducted by broth microdilution (BMD), Phoenix NMIC-413 AST panel, and disk diffusion method for imipenem, ertapenem, and meropenem.

The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.,"Cycling in traffic requires a combination of motor and perceptual skills while interacting with a dynamic and fast-changing environment. The inferior perceptual-motor skills in individuals with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) may put them at a higher risk for accidents. A key skill to navigate in traffic is to quickly detect hazardous situations. This perceptual-cognitive skill was investigated in young adults with DCD using simulated traffic situations in a hazard perception test in cycling. Nine individuals with DCD (age: 23.0 ± 3.8) and nine typically developing (TD) individuals (age: 24.6 ± 3.5) participated in the study and completed the test while their gaze was tracked using a remote eye tracking device. A questionnaire was used to determine cycling experience and the perception of cycling and anticipation skill in traffic. Despite a longer period to master the motor skill of cycling, individuals with DCD reported to be able to safely cycle in traffic around the same age as TD young adults. In the hazard perception test, individuals with DCD fixated the hazards later, less frequently and for a shorter duration than the TD participants, however, the participants with DCD did not wait longer to react to the hazard than the TD participants. Interestingly, individuals with DCD rated the traffic situations in the test as significantly more dangerous than the TD participants. In conclusion, the differences exposed in the hazard perception test may imply an increased risk of accidents in individuals with DCD. In further research and practice it is recommended that both the motor and the perceptual aspects of cycling are addressed.","['Cycling', 'Young Adults', 'Traffic Safety', 'Developmental Coordination Disorder', 'Gaze Behavior', 'Hazard Perception']","['University Hospital', 'Ghent University', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Hospital', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'Statement']",[],NaN

Methods and Patients:  In a prospective trinational (Germany, Italy, and Belgium) randomized trial, patients with pcBPPVcan were randomly assigned to SM or SM+; SM+ means overextension of the head by 60+° below earth horizontal line during the movement of the patient toward the affected side. The first maneuver was done by the physician, and the subsequent maneuvers by the patients 9 times/day on their own. Each morning the patient documented whether vertigo could be induced. The primary endpoints were: ""How long (in days) does it take until no attacks can be induced?"" and ""What is the efficacy of a single SM/SM+?""  Results:  In the 194 patients analyzed (96 SM, 98 SM+), it took 2 days (median, range 1-21 days, mean 3.6 days) for recovery with SM and 1 day (median, range 1-8 days, mean 1.8 days) with SM+ ( p  = 0.001, Mann-Whitney  U -test). There was no difference in the second primary endpoint (chi 2 -test,  p  = 0.39).  Interpretation:  This prospective trial shows that SM+ is more effective than SM when repeated therapeutic maneuvers are performed but not when a single maneuver is performed. It also supports the hypothesis of the biophysical model: overextension of the head during step 2 brings the clot of otoconia beyond the vertex of the canal, which increases the effectivity.  Classification of Evidence:  This study provides Class I evidence that SM+ is superior to SM for multiple treatment maneuvers of pcBPPVcan.","['Bppv [2,182]', 'Dizziness [35,838]', 'Epley Maneuver [477]', 'Sémont Maneuver [143]', 'Vertigo [18,284]']","['ethics committee', 'Brugge Oostende', 'Maximilians University', 'Ethics Statement', 'Leading ethics', 'Medical Faculty', 'Ludwig Maximilians', 'Ethics', 'reference number', 'committee']",['17-477'],NaN

Methods Pre-treatment MR-imaging data of 69 patients enrolled into the DIRECTOR trial in recurrent glioblastoma served as a training cohort, and 49 independent patients formed an external validation cohort. Contrast-enhancing tumor and peritumoral volumes were segmented on MR images. 180 radiomic features were extracted after application of two MR intensity normalization techniques: fixed number of bins and linear rescaling. Radiomic feature selection was performed  via  principal component analysis, and multivariable models were trained to predict  MGMT  status, progression-free survival from first salvage therapy, referred to herein as PFS 2 , and overall survival (OS). The prognostic power of models was quantified with concordance index (CI) for survival data and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the  MGMT  status. Results We established and validated a radiomic model to predict  MGMT  status using linear intensity interpolation and considering features extracted from gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (training AUC = 0.670, validation AUC = 0.673). Additionally, models predicting PFS 2  and OS were found for the training cohort but were not confirmed in our validation cohort. Conclusions A radiomic model for prediction of  MGMT  promoter methylation status from tumor texture features in patients with recurrent glioblastoma was successfully established, providing a non-invasive approach to anticipate patient's response to chemotherapy if biopsy cannot be performed. The radiomic approach to predict PFS 2  and OS failed.","['Recurrent Glioblastoma', 'Radiomics', 'Mgmt Status', 'Director Trial', 'Linear Intensity Interpolation']","['Ethics Statement', 'designated authorities', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'local ethics', 'ethics committees', 'human participants', '2009-0135', '2015-0437', 'Statement']",[],NaN

In addition, an in-depth bioinformatics analysis regarding the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was performed. Methods High-throughput sequencing was used to measure the profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the peripheral blood samples isolated from six patients (three patients with PCOS and three normal women). In addition, five differentially expressed lncRNAs were chosen to validate the results of high-throughput sequencing by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, a lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed using the Cytoscape software. Results A total of 14,276 differentially expressed mRNAs and 4,048 differentially expressed lncRNAs were obtained from the RNA-seq analysis of PCOS patients and healthy controls (adjusted q-value  2.0).The qRT-PCR results were consistent with the data obtained through high-throughput sequencing. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses showed that the differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched in the chemokine signaling pathway. In addition, the analysis of the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network of the chemokine signaling pathway showed the involvement of 6 mRNAs and 42 lncRNAs. Conclusion Clusters of mRNAs and lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in the peripheral blood of PCOS patients compared with the controls. In addition, several pairs of lncRNA-mRNAs in the chemokine signaling pathway may be related to PCOS genetically.","['Messenger RNA', 'Peripheral blood', 'Polycystic ovary syndrome', 'gene ontology', 'Pathway analysis', 'Long Noncoding Rna']","['Guangdong Institute', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'family planning', 'planning science', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Committee']",[],NaN

To date, a myriad of Ab tests, both available and FDA authorized for emergency, has led to confusion rather than insight per se. The present study reports the results of a rapid, point-in-time 1,000-person cohort study using serial blood donors in the New York City metropolitan area (NYC) using multiple serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). These were then tested and associated with assays for neutralizing Ab (NAb). Of the 1,000 NYC blood donor samples in late June and early July 2020, 12.1% and 10.9% were seropositive using the Ortho Total Ig and the Abbott IgG HTSA assays, respectively. These serological assays correlated with neutralization activity specific to SARS-CoV-2. The data reported herein suggest that seroconversion in this population occurred in approximately 1 in 8 blood donors from the beginning of the pandemic in NYC (considered March 1, 2020). These findings deviate with an earlier seroprevalence study in NYC showing 13.7% positivity. Collectively however, these data demonstrate that a low number of individuals have serologic evidence of infection during this ""first wave"" and suggest that the notion of ""herd immunity"" at rates of ~60% or higher are not near. Furthermore, the data presented herein show that the nature of the Ab-based immunity is not invariably associated with the development of NAb. While the blood donor population may not mimic precisely the NYC population as a whole, rapid assessment of seroprevalence in this cohort and serial reassessment could aid public health decision making.",[],"['statement Approval', 'Ethics statement', 'written consent', 'Blood Center', 'Approval', 'Review Board', 'York Blood', 'Institutional Review', 'Ethics', 'consent']",[],NaN

We sought to investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiac injury and hypertension during the current coronavirus pandemic. Study design and methods The clinical data of 366 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed. The clinical signs and laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. Two independent, experienced clinicians reviewed and analyzed the data. Results Cardiac injury was found in 11.19% (30/268) of enrolled patients. 93.33% (28/30) of cardiac injury cases were in the severe group. The laboratory findings indicated that white blood cells, neutrophils, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, lactate, and lactic dehydrogenase were positively associated with cardiac injury marker. Compared with healthy controls, the 190 patients without prior hypertension have higher AngⅡ level, of which 16 (8.42%) patients had a rise in blood pressure to the diagnostic criteria of hypertension during hospitalization, with a significantly increased level of the cTnI, procalcitonin, angiotensin-II (AngⅡ) than those normal blood pressure ones. Multivariate analysis indicated that elevated age, cTnI, the history of hypertension, and diabetes were independent predictors for illness severity. The predictive model, based on the four parameters and gender, has a good ability to identify the clinical severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients (area under the curve: 0.932, sensitivity: 98.67%, specificity: 75.68%). Conclusion Hypertension, sometimes accompanied by elevated cTnI, may occur in COVID-19 patients and become a sequela. Enhancing Ang II signaling, driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection, might play an important role in the renin-angiotensin system, and consequently lead to the development of hypertension in COVID-19.",[],[],[],NaN

We investigated the sibling risk of hospitalization with common infections, a marker of severity. We hypothesized that having siblings hospitalized for infection would increase the proband's risk of admission with infection. Study design We used population data on Western Australian live-born singletons and their siblings between 1980 and 2014. Measures of infection were infection-related hospitalizations from discharge diagnostic codes. Exposure was having a sibling who had an infection-related hospitalization. Outcomes were infection-related hospitalizations in the child/proband. Probands were followed until an infection-related hospitalization admission (up to the first three), death, 18th birthday, or end of 2014, whichever occurred first. Infection risks were estimated by adjusted Cox proportional hazard models for multiple events. Results Of 512,279 probands, 142,915 (27.9%) had infection-related hospitalizations; 133,322 (26.0%) had a sibling with a previous infection-related hospitalization (i.e. exposed). Median interval between sibling and proband infection-related hospitalizations was 1.4 years (inter-quartile range 0.5-3.7). Probands had a dose-dependent increase in risk if sibling/s had 1, 2, or 3+ infection-related hospitalizations (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR 1.41, 95% CI 1.39-1.43; aHR 1.65, 1.61-1.69; aHR 1.83, 1.77-1.90, respectively). Among siblings with the same clinical infection type, highest sibling risks were for genitourinary (aHR 2.06, 1.68-2.53), gastrointestinal (aHR 2.07, 1.94-2.19), and skin/soft tissue infections (aHR 2.34, 2.15-2.54). Overall risk of infection-related hospitalization was higher in children with more siblings and with older siblings. Conclusion In this population-based study, we observed an increased risk of infection-related hospitalization in children whose siblings were previously hospitalized for infection.

Wearable sensors could enable this by wireless transmission of vital signs. A novel accelerometer-based device, called Healthdot, has been designed to be worn on the skin to measure the two key vital parameters respiration rate (RespR) and heart rate (HeartR). The goal of this study is to assess the reliability of heart rate and respiration rate measured by the Healthdot in comparison to the gold standard, the bedside patient monitor, during the postoperative period in bariatric patients. Data were collected in a consecutive group of 30 patients who agreed to wear the device after their primary bariatric procedure. Directly after surgery, a Healthdot was attached on the patients' left lower rib. Vital signs measured by the accelerometer based Healthdot were compared to vital signs collected with the gold standard patient monitor for the period that the patient stayed at the post-anesthesia care unit. Over all patients, a total of 22 hours of vital signs obtained by the Healthdot were recorded simultaneously with the bedside patient monitor data. 87.5% of the data met the pre-defined bias of 5 beats per minute for HeartR and 92.3% of the data met the pre-defined bias of 5 respirations per minute for RespR. The Healthdot can be used to accurately derive heart rate and respiration rate in postbariatric patients.

Methods:  Clinical data of 30 patients with OSAS were reviewed between December 2017 and December 2018. OSAS were defined as arising from the internal carotid artery (ICA), reaching from the distal dural ring to the origin of the posterior communicating artery. OSAS were classified into four types based on the angiographic findings. The balloon-assisted coils technique was used for the embolization of aneurysms. The duration of balloon inflation cycles, as well as difficulty and complications during the embolization procedure, were recorded. The immediate angiographic results were evaluated according to the Raymond scale. Clinical results were evaluated based on the MRS score. Follow-ups were performed at 18 months post-embolization by DSA or MRA at our institution.  Results:  Thirty-two aneurysms in 30 patients were detected by digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which included 30 unruptured and two ruptured cases. The patients with ruptured aneurysms were grade II status according to the Hunt-Hess scale. Three cases were type A, nine cases were type B, 17 cases were type C, and three cases were type D. According to aneurysm size, there were 19 cases of small, 11 cases of medium, two cases of large aneurysm. Thirty-two aneurysms were successfully embolized in 30 patients by balloon-assisted coils technique. The ophthalmic artery could be protected by an engorged balloon in the procedure, especially for type A aneurysms. Considering that type D aneurysm arises from the side-wall of the artery and near to tortuous ICA siphon, the balloon catheter was inflated to stabilize the microcatheter allowing for overinflation when necessary. The average duration of balloon dilatation was 4 min, and the average time was 2.5 times. Raymond class was one in 28 aneurysms and two in four aneurysms according to the immediate post-embolization angiographic results. All the patients achieved good clinical effects, except for one patient who presented with brain ischemia resulting in dizziness and contralateral limb weakness for 10 h due to prolonged temporary clamping of the responsible ICA. The follow-up angiography results were satisfactory at 18 months post-embolization.  Conclusion:  OSAS endovascular treatment with balloon-assisted coils has different advantages in a different classification. The technique is safe, effective, and relatively inexpensive, especially for small and medium OSAS.","['Safe', 'Effective', 'Ophthalmic Segment Aneurysms', 'Balloon Assisted Coils', 'Small And Medium Type']","['Medical University', 'Hebei Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'ethics committee', 'Shijiazhuang', 'China', 'human participants', 'University']",[],NaN

There has been little data on the epidemiology of workplace violence against frontline clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the pattern of workplace violence and its association with quality of life (QOL) against frontline clinicians during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in China.  Methods:  A cross-sectional online study was conducted in China between March 15 and March 20, 2020. Frontline clinicians' experience with workplace violence was measured with six standardized questions derived from the Workplace Violence Scale, while anxiety, depressive, and insomnia symptoms, and QOL were measured using the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire, respectively. Univariate analyses, multivariable logistic regression analyses, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were conducted.  Results:  A total of 15,531 clinicians completed the assessment; 2,878 (18.5, 95% CI = 17.92-19.14%) reported workplace violence during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (verbal violence: 16.1%; physical violence: 6.9%). According to multivariable models, key correlates of workplace violence were male gender, longer work experience, higher education level, smoking, working in the psychiatry or emergency department, working in tertiary hospitals, being involved in direct care of infected patients, having infected family/ friends/ colleagues, and frequently using social communication programs. Clinicians working in inpatient departments were less likely to report workplace violence compared to those working in outpatient departments. SEM analysis revealed that both violence and emotional disturbances (anxiety, depression, and insomnia) directly affected QOL (standardized direct effect = -0.031, and -0.566, respectively,  P   P   Conclusion:  Frontline clinicians were vulnerable to workplace violence during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We conducted a pilot study, based on the full-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from migrants coming to Sicily by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, with the aim to investigate the viral genome polymorphism and to describe their genetic variations and the phylogenetic relationships. On June 21, a nongovernmental organization vessel rescued 210 migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea from Libya to Sicily. Of them, 13.4% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen whole genome sequences were obtained to explore viral genetic variability. All but one of the sequences clustered with other viral African strains within the lineage A, whereas only one intermixed among B.1 lineage genomes. Our findings documented that most of the investigated migrants acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection before landing in Sicily.

SQSTM1/p62 activity mediates different biological functions. This study aimed to investigate the effect of SQSTM1/p62, a multifunctional receptor, on biological function and autophagy characteristics in the human PTC cell line TPC-1. Methods A total of 105 primary PTC samples and matched adjacent normal thyroid tissue samples were obtained to evaluate the expression of p62 in clinical patients. A similar p62 expression pattern was found in PTC cell lines and normal human thyroid follicular epithelial cells. To evaluate the effect of SQSTM1/p62 on TPC-1 cells, we constructed the p62 knockout cell line p62-KO-TPC-1. Cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis were analyzed by colony formation tests, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays and flow cytometry  in vitro . TPC-1 and p62-KO-TPC-1 human PTC cell lines in the logarithmic growth phase were subcutaneously implanted into BALB/c nude mice to verify their proliferation effect  in vivo . Furthermore, western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to detect the expression of AKT/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins. Results Overall, p62 expression was higher in tumor tissues than in normal tissues in 73 of 105 PTC patients (69.5%). The expression level of p62 in the PTC cell line was higher than that in the normal thyroid cell line. Our data indicated that  in vitro , p62 deficiency could decrease the number of colonies, inhibit cell growth and the cell cycle, and induce apoptosis. Tumor xenograft experiments in BALB/c nude mice corroborated these findings. Moreover, the molecular mechanism was explored by western blotting, and we found that the AMPK/AKT/mTOR pathway was involved. Conclusions The results indicate that p62 might mediate cell autophagy and apoptosis in TPC-1 cells  via  the AMPK/AKT/mTOR pathway and could be used as a potential therapeutic approach for PTC.","['Proliferation', 'Autophagy', 'Papillary Thyroid Cancer', 'Sqstm1/p62', 'Tpc-1']","['Zhengzhou University', 'Affiliated Hospital', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'University', 'Statement']",[],NaN

The underlying pathomechanisms of APL-associated coagulopathy are complex. However, two pathways considered to be APL-specific had been identified: 1) annexin A2 (ANXA2)-associated hyperfibrinolysis and 2) podoplanin (PDPN)-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. In contrast, since disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is far less frequent in patients with non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the pathophysiology of AML-associated hemorrhagic disorders is not well understood. Furthermore, the potential threat of coagulopathy in non-APL AML patients may be underestimated. Herein, we report a patient with non-APL AML presenting with severe coagulopathy with hyperfibrinolysis. Since his clinical course resembled a prototypical APL-associated hemorrhagic disorder, we hypothesized pathophysiological similarities. Performing multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) and immunofluorescence imaging (IF) studies, we found the patient's bone-marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) to express ANXA2 - a biomarker previously thought to be APL-specific. In addition, whole-exome sequencing (WES) on sorted BM-MNC (leukemia-associated immunophenotype (LAIP)1: ANXA lo , LAIP2: ANXA hi ) demonstrated high intra-tumor heterogeneity. Since ANXA2 regulation is not well understood, further research to determine the coagulopathy-initiating events in AML and APL is indicated. Moreover, ANXA2 and PDPN MFC assessment as a tool to determine the risk of life-threatening DIC in AML and APL patients should be evaluated.","['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia', 'Disseminated intravascular coagulation', 'Coagulopathy', 'Pdpn', 'Hyperfibrinolysis', 'Anxa2', 'Wes']","['Ethics Statement', 'Dresden ethics', 'ethics committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Statement', 'Dresden', 'human participants', 'committee', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

The spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pandemic has forced many patients to momentarily stop the scheduled BT-A injections. The goal of this study was to explore whether those patients experienced a worsening of their CM and, if any, the clinical predictors of migraine worsening after BT-A withdrawal.  Methods:  This was a retrospective, multicenter study. Patients' clinical data were obtained from their clinical documentation stored at each center. In particular, the following variables were collected: the mean number of headache days in the last month (NHD), the average number of painkillers taken in the last month (AC), the average number of days in which patients took, at least, one painkiller in the last month (NDM), the average intensity of migraine using the numeric rating scale (NRS) score in the last month, and the average score obtained at the six-item Headache Impact Test. The variables mentioned earlier were compared before and after BT-A withdrawal.  Results:  After BT-A suspension, there was a significant increase in the NHD ( P  = 0.0313, Kruskal-Wallis rank test), AC ( P  = 0.0421, Kruskal-Wallis rank test), NDM ( P  = 0.0394, paired  t -test), NRS score ( P  = 0.0069, Kruskal-Wallis rank test), and six-item Headache Impact Test score ( P  = 0.0372, Kruskal-Wallis rank test). Patients who were not assuming other preventive treatments other than BT-A displayed similar results. Patients who experienced a >30% worsening in NHD after BT-A was withdrawn displayed a longer CM history ( P  = 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis rank test), a longer MOH duration ( P  = 0.0017, Kruskal-Wallis rank test), a higher AC value at the baseline ( P  = 0.0149, Kruskal-Wallis rank test), a higher NDM ( P  = 0.0024,  t -test), and a higher average value of the NRS score ( P  = 0.0073, Kruskal-Wallis rank test).  Conclusion:  BT-A withdrawn during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pandemic was associated with a general worsening in patients suffering from CM, hence the need to continue BT-A injection to avoid patients' worsening.","['Onabotulinumtoxina', 'Chronic Migraine', 'Medication Overuse Headache', 'Migraine Frequency', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Pandemic']","['Area Vasta', 'Vasta Emilia', 'Emilia Nord', 'ethics committee', 'Bologna ethics', 'Ethics Statement', 'Nord ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', ""L'Aquila ethics""]",[],NaN

Live/dead bacteria staining results indicated that LysP108 possessed strong bactericidal ability, with an anti-bacterial rate of approximately 90%. Crystal violet staining results implied that LysP108 could also inhibit and destroy bacterial biofilms.  In vivo  animal experiments suggested that the area of subcutaneous abscess of mice infected with MRSA was significantly reduced after the combined injection of LysP108 and vancomycin in comparison with monotherapy. The synergistic antibacterial effects of LysP108 and vancomycin were confirmed.

Moreover, they often commonly coexist, which makes diagnosis and treatment difficult. A safe and effective treatment is urgently needed. Previous studies have shown that acupuncture is a cost-effective treatment for simple depression or CMSP. However, there is limited evidence that acupuncture is effective for depression comorbid with CMSP. Methods This is a randomized, sham acupuncture-controlled trial with three arms: real acupuncture (RA), sham acupuncture (SA), and healthy control (HC). Forty-eight depression combined CMSP participants and 12 healthy people will be recruited from GDTCM hospital and randomized 2:2:1 to the RA, SA, and HC groups. The patients will receive RA or SA intervention for 8 weeks, and HC will not receive any intervention. Upon completion of the intervention, there will be a 4-week follow-up. The primary outcome measures will be the severity of depression and pain, which will be assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), respectively. The secondary outcome measures will be cognitive function and quality of life, which will be measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), P300, and World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF). In addition, the correlation between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and symptoms will also be determined. Discussion The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and underlying mechanism of acupuncture in depression comorbid with CMSP. This study could provide evidence for a convenient and cost-effective means of future prevention and treatment of combined depression and CMSP.

The most important features of A. baumannii are its ability to persist in the hospital environment and rapidly develop resistance to a wide variety of antibiotics. This study aimed to determine trend of antimicrobial resistance in Acinetobacter species over a five years period. Method A retrospective data regarding occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of Acinetobacter species recovered from clinical specimens referred to the national reference laboratory was extracted from microbiology laboratory data source covering a time range from 2014 to 2018. Socio-demographic characteristics and laboratory record data was analyzed using SPSS 20. Results A total of 102 strains of Acinetobacter species were analyzed from various clinical specimens. Majority of them were from pus (33.3%) followed by blood (23.5%), urine (15.6%) and body fluid (11.7%). Significant ascending trends of antimicrobial resistance was shown for meropenem (12.5% to 60.7%), ceftazidime (82.1% to 100%), ciprofloxacin (59.4% to 74.4%), ceftriaxone (87.1% to 98.6%), cefepime (80.0% to 93.3%) and pipracillin- tazobactam (67.8% to 96.3%). However, there was descending trend of antimicrobial resistance for tobramycin (56.5% to 42.8%), amikacin (42.1% to 31.4%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (79.0 to 68.2%). The overall rate of carbapenem non-susceptible and multidrug resistance rates in Acinetobacter species were 56.7% and 71.6%.respectively. Conclusion A five year antimicrobial resistance trend analysis of Acinetobacter species showed increasing MDR and resistance to high potent antimicrobial agents posing therapeutic challenge in our Hospitals and health care settings. Continuous surveillance and appropriate infection prevention and control strategies need to be strengthened to circumvent the spread of multidrug resistant pathogens in health care facilities.",[],"['Health Institute', 'Ethiopian Public', 'Public Health', 'review committee', 'SERC', 'Ethical consideration', 'ethical clearance', 'ethical review', 'Institute', 'Ethiopian']",[],NaN

The current focus is on specific manifestations such as bullying, but the behavior is broad and heterogenous. Children spend a substantial amount of time in school, but their behaviors in the school setting tend to be less well characterized than at home. Because aggression may index multiple behavioral problems, we used three validated instruments to assess means, correlations and gender differences of teacher-rated aggressive behavior with co-occurring externalizing/internalizing problems and social behavior in 39,936 schoolchildren aged 7-14 from 4 population-based cohorts from Finland, the Netherlands, and the UK. Correlations of aggressive behavior were high with all other externalizing problems (r: 0.47-0.80) and lower with internalizing problems (r: 0.02-0.39). A negative association was observed with prosocial behavior (r: -0.33 to -0.54). Mean levels of aggressive behavior differed significantly by gender. Despite the higher mean levels of aggressive behavior in boys, the correlations were notably similar for boys and girls (e.g., aggressive-hyperactivity correlations: 0.51-0.75 boys, 0.47-0.70 girls) and did not vary greatly with respect to age, instrument or cohort. Thus, teacher-rated aggressive behavior rarely occurs in isolation; boys and girls with problems of aggressive behavior likely require help with other behavioral and emotional problems. Important to note, higher aggressive behavior is not only associated with higher amounts of other externalizing and internalizing problems but also with lower levels of prosocial behavior.",[],"['Ethics Committee', 'Medical Center', 'Helsinki University', 'ethics', 'current investigation', 'standards established', 'Bloomington IRB', 'ethics approval', 'Hospital Ethics', 'Committee']",['PNM/09/10-104).'],NaN

All individual case data was anonymized.","In the summer of 2017, an estimated 745,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in what has been described as one of the largest and fastest growing refugee crises in the world. Among numerous health concerns, an outbreak of acute jaundice syndrome (AJS) was detected by the disease surveillance system in early 2018 among the refugee population. This paper describes the investigation into the increase in AJS cases, the process and results of the investigation, which were strongly suggestive of a large outbreak due to hepatitis A virus (HAV). An enhanced serological investigation was conducted between 28 February to 26 March 2018 to determine the etiologies and risk factors associated with the outbreak. A total of 275 samples were collected from 18 health facilities reporting AJS cases. Blood samples were collected from all patients fulfilling the study specific case definition and inclusion criteria, and tested for antibody responses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Out of the 275 samples, 206 were positive for one of the agents tested. The laboratory results confirmed multiple etiologies including 154 (56%) samples tested positive for hepatitis A, 1 (0.4%) positive for hepatitis E, 36 (13%) positive for hepatitis B, 25 (9%) positive for hepatitis C, and 14 (5%) positive for leptospirosis. Among all specimens tested 24 (9%) showed evidence of co-infections with multiple etiologies. Hepatitis A and E are commonly found in refugee camps and have similar clinical presentations. In the absence of robust testing capacity when the epidemic was identified through syndromic reporting, a particular concern was that of a hepatitis E outbreak, for which immunity tends to be limited, and which may be particularly severe among pregnant women. This report highlights the challenges of identifying causative agents in such settings and the resources required to do so. Results from the month-long enhanced investigation did not point out widespread hepatitis E virus (HEV) transmission, but instead strongly suggested a large-scale hepatitis A outbreak of milder consequences, and highlighted a number of other concomitant causes of AJS (acute hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Leptospirosis), albeit most likely at sporadic level. Results strengthen the need for further water and sanitation interventions and are a stark reminder of the risk of other epidemics transmitted through similar routes in such settings, particularly dysentery and cholera. It also highlights the need to ensure clinical management capacity for potentially chronic conditions in this vulnerable population.",[],"['outbreak response', 'routine public', 'response activities', 'public health', 'data reported', 'Ethical consideration', 'data', 'data collection', 'health outbreak', 'Family Welfare']",[],NaN

Many post-processing image techniques based on CT and MR images have been widely used in related research, such as image segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and computer fluid dynamics. However, the criteria for the 3D numerical model of carotid plaque established by CT and MR angiographic image data remain open to questioning.  Method:  We accurately duplicated the geometry and simulated it using computer software to make a 3D numerical model. The initial images were obtained by CTA and TOF-MRA. MIMICS (Materialize's interactive medical image control system) software was used to process the images to generate three-dimensional solid models of blood vessels and plaques. The subsequent output was exported to the ANSYS software to generate finite element simulation results for the further hemodynamic study.  Results:  The 3D models of carotid plaque of TOF-MRA and CTA were simulated by using computer software. CTA has a high-density resolution for carotid plaque, the boundary of the CTA image is obvious, and the main component of which is a calcified tissue. However, the density resolution of TOF-MRA for the carotid plaque and carotid artery was not as good as that of CTA. The results show that there is a large deviation between the TOF-MRA and CTA 3D model of plaque in the carotid artery due to the unclear recognition of plaque boundary during 3D reconstruction, and this can further affect the simulation results of hemodynamics.  Conclusion:  In this study, two-dimensional images and three-dimensional models of carotid plaques obtained by two angiographic techniques were compared. The potential of these two imaging methods in clinical diagnosis and fluid dynamics of carotid plaque was evaluated, and the selectivity of image post-processing analysis to original medical image acquisition was revealed.","['Carotid plaque', 'computational fluid dynamic', 'Aneurysms', 'Ct Angiography', 'Mr Angiography', 'Fluid-solid Interaction']","['Chongqing Peopleâ', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Written informed', 'informed consent', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'Hospital', 'participants', 'Written']",[],NaN

The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.," Objective:  This study aims to examine the clinical characteristics of patients with brain metastases (BM) from small-cell esophageal carcinoma (SCEC) and to explore the association of the corresponding factors with overall survival (OS).  Methods:  The data of 18 patients with brain metastases from SCEC, diagnosed from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2018, in the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University were analyzed retrospectively.  Results:  The 18 patients who were included in this study accounted for 6.7% of the patients with SCEC diagnosed from 2006 to 2018. Of the 18 patients, 8 (44.4%) were females. For the entire cohort, the median OS was 7 months, the 1-year OS was 22.2%, and the 2-year OS was 0%. For patients who received whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and for those who did not (13 vs. 5), the median OS was 11.9 and 3 months, respectively, and the 1-year OS was 30.8 and 0%, respectively. When comparing diagnosis-specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) scores of patients with BM from SCEC ranging from 2.5 to 4 and from 0 to 2, the median OS was 13.1 and 4 months, respectively, and the 1-year OS was 57.1 and 0%, respectively. In the univariable regression, patients who received WBRT had improved OS compared to those who did not (HR = 0.249,  p  = 0.018), and patients with a DS-GPA score of 2.5-4 were associated with improved OS compared with patients with a DS-GPA score of 0-2 (HR = 0.050,  p  = 0.005).  Conclusion:  The incidence of brain metastases in patients with SCEC is low, but the prognosis in those patients is very poor. The DS-GPA score may be a prognostic factor of patients with BM from SCEC. Brain radiotherapy could improve the survival of these patients.","['Prognosis', 'Brain metastases', 'Brain Radiotherapy', 'Small-cell Esophageal Carcinoma', 'Ds-gpa']","['Medical University', 'Fourth Hospital', 'Hebei Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'University', 'human participants', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate a multi-modal quality improvement (QI) strategy to promote resource stewardship by reducing routine day 3 (d3) bloodwork and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for patients undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI) and timed intercourse (IC) treatment cycles. Methods After literature review, clinic stakeholders at an academic fertility centre met to discuss d3 testing utility and factors contributing to d3 bloodwork/TVUS in IC/IUI treatment cycles. Consensus was reached that it was unnecessary in patients taking oral/no medications. The primary intervention changed the default setting on the electronic order set to exclude d3 testing for IC/IUI cycles with oral/no medications. Exceptions required active test selection. Protocols were updated and education sessions were held. The main outcome measure was the proportion of cycles receiving d3 bloodwork/TVUS during the 8-week post-intervention period compared with the 8-week pre-intervention period. Balancing measures included provider satisfaction, pregnancy rates, and incidence of cycle cancellation. Results A significant reduction in the proportion of cycles receiving d3 TVUS (57.2% vs 20.8%, p  Conclusion A significant reduction in IC/IUI treatment cycles that received d3 bloodwork/TVUS was achieved without measured negative treatment impacts.

A second aim was to test a model by which the expected negative relationship between deviation from a balanced time perspective (DBTP), a measure taking temporal biases across all three time frames into account, and life satisfaction was mediated by poor sleep quality. To these ends, a sample of young adults ( N  = 386) completed a version of the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (S-ZTPI), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). A measure of chronotype was in addition included for control purposes. Bivariate analyses revealed that the S-ZTPI subscales Past Negative, Future Negative and Present Fatalistic were associated with poorer sleep quality (higher PSQI scores), with significant associations in the opposite direction for Past Positive and Future Positive. However, DBTP was the strongest predictor of (poorer) sleep quality, suggesting that time perspective biases have an additive effect on sleep quality. Regression analyses with PSQI as the dependent variable and all six ZTPI subscales as the predictors indicated that time perspective accounted for about 20% of the variance in sleep quality (17% beyond chronotype), with Past Negative, Past Positive, and Future Negative as the unique predictors. The results additionally confirmed a strong relationship between DBTP and life satisfaction. Finally, data were consistent with the hypothesis that the association of DBTP and life satisfaction is mediated, in part, by sleep quality. Taken together, the results confirmed a substantial link between time perspective sleep-related problems, factors that may have a negative impact on life satisfaction.","['Life Satisfaction', 'Sleep Quality', 'Time Perspective', 'Chronotype', 'Balanced Time Perspective']","['Ethics Statement', 'Regional ethics', 'ethics board', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'UmeÃ', 'Statement', 'Regional', 'human participants', 'board']",[],NaN

We retrospectively analyzed the rate of false-positive PET-CTs performed as interim (n = 94) and end-of-treatment (n = 8) assessments among 102 DLBCL patients treated during 2010-2017 at Oulu University Hospital. In PET-CT Deauville score ≥4 was regarded as positive. A biopsy was performed on 35 patients, and vital lymphoma tissue was detected from nine patients. Positive biopsy findings were associated with poor disease outcomes in this study. This difference was statistically significant: 2-year failure-free survival (FFS) was 44% in patients with a positive biopsy versus 83% for those with a negative biopsy (p = 0.003). The corresponding overall survival (OS) rates were 53% versus 95% (p = 0.010). In the multivariate analyses, a negative biopsy was an independent protective factor in FFS (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.093 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.017-0.511); p = 0.006) unrelated to the International Prognostic Index (IPI) (HR 1.139 [95% CI 0.237-5.474] p = 0.871) or stage (HR 1.365 [95% CI 0.138-13.470]; p = 0.790). There was no statistically significant difference in OS according to the PET results, but the FFS rate was significantly higher in patients with a negative PET. The value of PET-CT as an evaluation method suffers from a high false-positive rate, and it is inadequate alone for the justification of treatment decisions. Biopsy results provide more reliable prognostic information for the evaluation of treatment response and outcome and should be used to assess patients with positive PET-CT scans.",[],"['Northern Ostrobothnia', 'ETHICS STATEMENT', 'Ostrobothnia hospital', 'ethics committee', 'hospital district', 'district approved', 'ETHICS', 'STATEMENT', 'Northern', 'Ostrobothnia']",[],NaN

Cases of research misconduct, other transgressions related to RE and RI, and forms of ethically questionable behaviors have been frequently published. The objective of this scoping review was to collect RE and RI cases, analyze their main characteristics, and discuss how these cases are represented in the scientific literature. Methods The search included cases involving a violation of, or misbehavior, poor judgment, or detrimental research practice in relation to a normative framework. A search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, JSTOR, Ovid, and Science Direct in March 2018, without language or date restriction. Data relating to the articles and the cases were extracted from case descriptions. Results A total of 14,719 records were identified, and 388 items were included in the qualitative synthesis. The papers contained 500 case descriptions. After applying the eligibility criteria, 238 cases were included in the analysis. In the case analysis, fabrication and falsification were the most frequently tagged violations (44.9%). The non-adherence to pertinent laws and regulations, such as lack of informed consent and REC approval, was the second most frequently tagged violation (15.7%), followed by patient safety issues (11.1%) and plagiarism (6.9%). 80.8% of cases were from the Medical and Health Sciences, 11.5% from the Natural Sciences, 4.3% from Social Sciences, 2.1% from Engineering and Technology, and 1.3% from Humanities.

The study is registered with the clinical trial number of NCT01767350.,"The calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) cyclosporine A and tacrolimus comprise the basis of immunosuppressive regimes in all solid organ transplantation. However, long-term or high exposure to CNI leads to histological and functional renal damage (CNI-associated nephrotoxicity). In the kidney, proximal tubule cells are the only cells that metabolize CNI and these cells are believed to play a central role in the origin of the toxicity for this class of drugs, although the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Several studies have reported oxidative stress as an important mediator of CNI-associated nephrotoxicity in response to CNI exposure in different available proximal tubule cell models. However, former models often made use of supra-therapeutic levels of tissue drug exposure. In addition, they were not shown to express the relevant enzymes (e.g., CYP3A5) and transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein) for the metabolism of CNI in human proximal tubule cells. Moreover, the used methods for detecting ROS were potentially prone to false positive results. In this study, we used a novel proximal tubule cell model established from human allograft biopsies that demonstrated functional expression of relevant enzymes and transporters for the disposition of CNI. We exposed these cells to CNI concentrations as found in tissue of stable solid organ transplant recipients with therapeutic blood concentrations. We measured the glutathione redox balance in this cell model by using organelle-targeted variants of roGFP2, a highly sensitive green fluorescent reporter protein that dynamically equilibrates with the glutathione redox couple through the action of endogenous glutaredoxins. Our findings provide evidence that CNI, at concentrations commonly found in allograft biopsies, do not alter the glutathione redox balance in mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the cytosol. However, at supra-therapeutic concentrations, cyclosporine A but not tacrolimus increases the ratio of oxidized/reduced glutathione in the mitochondria, suggestive of imbalances in the redox environment.",[],"['Ethical Board', 'Institutional Ethical', 'Ethics statement', 'written consent', 'study protocol', 'study subjects', 'Board', 'Institutional', 'Ethical', 'study']",['of'],NaN

A futile cycle such as a single MAPK cascade governed by two underlying enzymatic reactions permits Hyperbolic (H), Signal transducing (ST), Threshold-hyperbolic (TH) and Ultrasensitive (U) operating regimes that characterize input-output behaviour. Retroactive signalling caused by load due to sequestration of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated form of the substrate in a single enzymatic cascade without explicit feedback can introduce two-way communication, a feature not possible otherwise. We systematically characterize the operating regimes of a futile cycle subject to retroactivity in either of the substrate forms. We demonstrate that increasing retroactivity strength, which quantifies the downstream load, can trigger five possible regime transitions. Retroactivity strength is a reflection of the fraction of the substrate sequestered by its downstream target. Remarkably, the minimum required retroactivity strength to evidence any sequestration triggered regime transition demands 23% of the substrate bound to its downstream target. This minimum retroactivity strength corresponds to the transition of the dose-response curve from ST to H regime. We show that modulation of the saturation and unsaturation levels of the enzymatic reactions by retroactivity is the fundamental mechanism governing operating regime transition.",[],[],[],NaN

However, information regarding PCSK9 level after HCV eradication is lacking. Hence, in this case-control retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate PCSK9 level from pretherapy baseline up to sustained virological response (SVR). Methods Eighty-four patients treated with directly acting antivirals (DAAs) between July 2015 and May 2018 were enrolled. Differences in baseline PCSK9 level due to absence/presence of recorded baseline characteristics (covariates) were evaluated. Changes in PCSK9 levels from pretherapy to SVR (ΔPCSK9) and their correlations with the covariates were assessed. The repeated measures analysis of variance was used to investigate the differences in PCSK9 level from the baseline to the achievement of SVR due to absence/presence of any covariate. Results The mean age of the patients was 67.6 ± 11 years, and 53.6% were males.

Due to disparate national regulations on various ethical aspects, such as informed consent, there is the risk of ethical compromises when involving human subjects in research. Although the Declaration of Helsinki is the point of reference for ethical conduct of research on humans, national normative requirements may diverge from its provisions. The aim of this research is to examine requirements on informed consent in biomedical research in Germany, Poland, and Russia to determine how each national regulatory framework relates to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. Methods For this analysis, we conducted a search of the legal databases ""Gesetze im Internet"" for Germany, ""Internetowy System Aktow Prawnych"" for Poland, and ""ГAPAHT - Garant"" for Russia. The search was complemented by a review of secondary literature contained in the databases Google Scholar, PubMed, Polish National Library, and eLibrary.ru. We have identified 21 normative regulations containing provisions on informed consent in clinical research in all three countries. The content of these documents was systematically categorized and analyzed. Results The normative framework in all three countries shows a strong commitment towards the core ethical principles of research envisaged in the Declaration of Helsinki. Nevertheless, provisions on informed consent vary between these three countries. The differences range from the method and language in which information should be provided, through the amount of information required to be disclosed, to the form of documenting consent or withdrawal. In the case of research on vulnerable groups, these differences are particularly visible. Conclusions The identified differences can negatively impact the ethical conduct of international clinical studies. Attention needs to be paid that flexibilities within national regulations are not misused to undermine the protection of research subjects. Achieving global or regional legislative harmonization might prove impossible. Such lack of legal consensus reinforces the significance of the international ethical agreements.

Nutritional interventions to correct prisoner behaviour have been largely overlooked in the literature. Emerging evidence suggests that dietary intake influences aggressive behaviours and that nutritional supplementation with omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) could attenuate both the severity and frequency of aggressive behaviour. Methods Adult male prisoners who have a history of aggressive behaviour (n = 600) will be recruited from at least 6 Correctional Centres and randomised to receive either n-3 LCPUFA or placebo supplementation for a 16-week duration. Treatment will be with either 1 g/day of n-3 LCPUFA (694 mg DHA and 397 mg EPA) or placebo capsules, which are a corn/soy oil blend and are identical in size and colour. The primary outcome measure is the Inmate Behavioural Observation Scale (IBOS): an objective measure of aggressive behaviour. Secondary outcome measures include questionnaires (including aggression, attention deficit disorder, impulsivity, depression/anxiety/stress scales), engagement in programmes, recidivism and quality of life. Baseline and post-intervention assessments include the IBOS, questionnaires and blood to measure the levels of n-3 LCPUFA. Discussion To conclusively test the potential that increasing n-3 LCPUFA intakes can improve rates of prisoner aggression and associated mental health and violence-related social system management costs, we propose an adequately powered multi-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, examining the effects of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on aggressive behaviour in adult male prisoners. If successful, this study will inform prisoner policy with respect to nutrition and by inference contribute to a broader community approach to preventative mental health practices.

Gaining access and coordinating many levels of different organisations and stakeholders whose cooperation and approval are crucial all add time and sometimes logistical challenges for the research team. In addition, recruiting around sensitive research topics can elicit additional barriers to successful research. The research team aimed to conduct a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial involving schools in a local government region in Victoria, Australia, to assess the effect of a vaccination-based educational card game called ""Vaxcards"" on vaccine consent returns. Schools were contacted via phone and email to determine which staff member would best be a contact point for a face-to-face meeting to discuss the methods and purpose of the study. Email follow-ups were scheduled to follow up non-responsive schools and consent forms. The minimum required sample size was 13. Of 31 eligible schools, 13 were recruited. The research team encountered several unanticipated challenges before achieving the recruitment target. The most common reasons for non-participation were being too busy with other commitments, concerns regarding the topic of vaccination being too sensitive, and concerns that key stakeholders in the school would not approve of the research topic of vaccination. One school required a review by a private research ethics board that rejected the study. Significant hesitancy and misinformation about vaccine science was observed that affected engagement with a small number of schools.

Methods In an online based, anonymous and single-blinded study, medical and non-medical employees in the emergency medical services were asked about team communication, and communication errors. Results Seven hundred and fourteen medical and non-medical rescue workers from all over Germany took part. Among them, 72.0% had harmed at least one patient during their work. With imprecise communication, 81.7% rarely asked for clarification. Also, 66.3% saw leadership behavior as the cause of poor communication; 46.0% could not talk to their superiors about errors. Of note, 96.3% would like joint training of medical and non-medical employees in communication. Conclusion Deficits in team communication occur frequently in the rescue service. There is a clear need for uniform training in team and communication skills in all professions.",[],[],[],NaN

Materials and methods This is a population-based surveillance study conducted among children with CP registered in the Bangladesh CP Register (BCPR), the first population-based register of children with CP aged  Results Between January 2015 and December 2019, 2852 children with CP were registered in the BCPR (mean (standard deviation, SD) age: 7 y 8 months (mo) (4 y 7 mo), 38.5% female). Of these, 50.2% had received rehabilitation services; physiotherapy was the most common type of service (90.0%). The mean (SD) age at commencement of rehabilitation services was 3 y 10 mo (3 y 1 mo). The odds of not receiving rehabilitation was significantly higher among female children (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.3 [95% CI: 1.0-1.7], children whose mothers were illiterate and primary level completed (aOR 2.1 [95% CI: 1.4-3.1] and aOR 1.5 [95% CI: 1.1-2.1], respectively), fathers were illiterate (aOR 1.9 [95% CI: 1.3-2.8]), had a monthly family income ~US$ 59-118 (aOR: 1.8 [95% CI: 1.2-2.6]), had hearing impairment (aOR: 2.3 [95% CI: 1.5-3.5]) and motor severity (i.e. Gross Motor Function Classification System level III (aOR: 0.6 [95% CI: 0.3-0.9]) and level V (aOR: 0.4 [95% CI: 0.2-0.7])).

Yet in Kenya, the slow rate and levels at which the household's access improved sanitation facilities remain a concern, and it is unknown if the cost of new technologies is a barrier to access. This study assessed the maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for SAFI and SATO sanitation products and identified those factors that affect the willingness to pay (WTP) valuation estimates by households in three counties in Kenya. It used quantitative economic evaluation research integrated within a cross-sectional survey. Contingent valuation method (CVM) was used to determine the maximum WTP for sanitation in households. We used the logistic regression model in data analysis. A total of 211 households were interviewed in each county, giving a total sample size of 633 households. The mean WTP for SAFI latrines was $153.39 per household, while the mean WTP for SATO pans and SATO stools was $11.49 and $14.77 respectively. For SAFI latrines, households in Kakamega were willing to pay $6.6 more than average while in Siaya, the households were willing to pay $5.1 less than the average. The main determinants of households WTP for the two sanitation products included household's proximity to the toilet (p = 0.0001), household income (β = .2245741, p = 0.004), sanitation product (β = -2968.091; p = 0.004), socioeconomic status (β = -3305.728, p = 0.004) and a household's satisfaction level with the current toilet (β = -4570.602; p = 0.0001). Increased proximity of households to the toilet, higher incomes, and providing loan facilities or subsidy to poor households could increase the demand for these sanitation technologies.",[],"['Kenya Medical', 'Research Institute', 'Ethics approval', 'Medical Research', 'obtained ethics', 'Institute', 'Kenya', 'Medical', 'Ethics', 'approval']",[],NaN

We report a rare case of severe mitral stenosis that presented with severe hypoxia and maternal decompensation in early postpartum period for the first time. A 30-year-old para 2, abortus 1, Ethiopian woman developed severe hypoxia and rapid deterioration on her sixth postoperative day after cesarean delivery for fetal bradycardia with a good fetal outcome. She was put on a mechanical ventilator when she developed respiratory failure. Initially, a diagnosis of pulmonary embolus was considered. After admission to the intensive care unit, severe mitral stenosis was diagnosed with the help of echocardiography. She was managed successfully for congestive heart failure and discharged from the intensive care unit with improvement. Conclusion The possibility of mitral stenosis, as a differential diagnosis, should be considered whenever a case of postpartum maternal collapse is encountered. We recommend a routine immediate echocardiography in any patient that experiences postpartum collapse, especially in the presence of a known trigger for heart failure such as long hours of labor, bleeding, anemia, hypotension, and infection.","['Mitral stenosis', 'Severe Mitral Stenosis', 'Maternal Collapse']",[],[],NaN

However, the use of these concepts is often unclear and ambivalent: On one hand, older people are described as a vulnerable group whose protection requires sacrifices on the part of younger generations, e.g., regarding individual freedom and economic welfare. On the other, they appear as dispensable individuals that should relinquish their claims for the sake of the young and their future prospects. Our contribution offers an analysis of intergenerational solidarity and responsibility in public discourses on COVID-19. The leading question is how both concepts are used and how the corresponding claims can be justified or criticized. We first give an overview of notions of intergenerational solidarity and responsibility in current debates. In the next step, we provide a moral philosophical clarification of both concepts and their normative presuppositions. We then conduct a descriptive ethical discourse analysis of pertinent cases from three areas of European discourse: politics, civil society, and mass media. The analysis focuses on politico-moral claims and their normative premises, ambiguities, and biases. We argue that the discourse involves assumptions about old age and generational relations that need further clarification and justification. An analysis of intergenerational solidarity and responsibility in times of COVID-19 can help understand the dynamics of social cohesion in late-modern societies.","['Ethics', 'Sociology', 'Responsibility', 'Intergenerational Relations', 'Solidarity']",[],[],NaN

Ethics This study protocol, involving human patient data, was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Queen Fabiola Children's University Hospital in Brussels (NÂ° CEH 43/19). We reviewed the clinical data of all infants affected by IPH1 followed at Hôpital Universitaire des Enfants - Reine Fabiola (HUDERF) in Brussels and at Hôpital Robert Debré in Paris between January 2005 and December 2018. All patients had genetically proven PH1, reached ESRD during the first year of life and were enrolled in a liver-kidney transplantation program. The data recorded included: patient and family history, clinical, laboratory, and genetic findings as well as additional examinations such as, renal ultrasound (US), standard bone radiographies, and ophthalmic examinations. Frequency, mode and duration of dialysis (pre and post liver transplantation) have also been recorded, as well as interval between kidney and liver transplantation. Follow-up data included patient and grafts outcomes, including post-transplantation surgical and oxalosis related complications. Glomerular filtration rates have been estimated according to the Schwartz formula ( 19). Oxalate depositions were assessed in the retina by an eye fundus examination. Bone involvement was defined by the presence of one or several of the following features on standard radiographies: cystic bone changes, deformations, fractures, dense metaphyseal bands, cortical thickening in long bones, and dense rims around the ossification nucleus in the calcaneum and carpal/tarsal bones ( 13). Numerical results have been presented as proportions for categorical variables, means and confidence interval for normally distributed continuous variables or medians with range in case of skewed distribution. Plasma oxalate levels (POx) of all patients were measured before and after LT. Normal distribution of the two samples was confirmed using Shapiro-Wilk test. The means were compared using Welch-Shattertwhaite  T-test for two independent samples with unequal variance. A  p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using XLSTAT."," Introduction:  Oxalate overproduction in Primary Hyperoxaluria type I (PH1) leads to progressive renal failure and systemic oxalate deposition. In severe infantile forms of PH1 (IPH1), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) occurs in the first years of life. Usually, the management of these infantile forms is challenging and consists in an intensive dialysis regimen followed by a liver-kidney transplantation (combined or sequential).  Methods:  Medical records of all infants with IPH1 reaching ESRD within the first year of life, diagnosed and followed between 2005 and 2018 in two pediatric nephrology departments in Brussels and Paris, have been reviewed.  Results:  Seven patients were included. They reached ESRD at a median age of 3.5 (2-7) months. Dialysis was started at a median age of 4 (2-10 months). Peritoneal dialysis (PD) was the initial treatment for 6 patients and hemodialysis (HD) for one patient. Liver transplantation (LT) was performed in all patients and kidney transplantation (KT) in six of them. A sequential strategy has been chosen in 5 patients, a combined in one. The kidney transplanted as part of the combined strategy was lost. Median age at LT and KT was 25 (10-41) months and 32.5 (26-75) months, respectively. No death occurred in the series. At the end of a median follow-up of 3 years, mean eGFR was 64 ± 29 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . All patients presented retinal and bone lesions and five patients presented bones fractures.  Conclusion:  Despite encouraging survival figures, the morbidity in IPH1 patients remains extremely heavy and its management presents a huge challenge.

This technique allows maintaining cell viability, functionality, and developmental potential at low temperatures into liquid nitrogen at -196°C. For this, the addition of cryoprotectant agents, which are substances that provide cell protection during cooling and warming, is required. However, they have been reported to be toxic, reducing oocyte viability, maturation, fertilization, and embryo development, possibly by altering cell cytoskeleton structure and chromatin. Previous studies have evaluated the effects of vitrification in the germinal vesicle, metaphase II oocytes, zygotes, and blastocysts, but the knowledge of its impact on their further embryo development is limited. Other studies have evaluated the role of actin microfilaments and chromatin, based on the fertilization and embryo development rates obtained, but not the direct evaluation of these structures in embryos produced from vitrified immature oocytes. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate how the vitrification of porcine immature oocytes affects early embryo development by the evaluation of actin microfilament distribution and chromatin integrity. Results demonstrate that the damage generated by the vitrification of immature oocytes affects viability, maturation, and the distribution of actin microfilaments and chromatin integrity, observed in early embryos. Therefore, it is suggested that vitrification could affect oocyte repair mechanisms in those structures, being one of the mechanisms that explain the low embryo development rates after vitrification.","['Embryo development', 'Vitrification', 'chromatin', 'Immature Oocytes', 'Actin Microfilaments', 'Porcine (Pig) Model', 'In Vitro Fertilization-embryos']","['Metropolitan Autonomous', 'University-Iztapalapa Campus', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'Autonomous University-Iztapalapa', 'Ethics', 'Metropolitan', 'Campus', 'Committee', 'Autonomous']",[],NaN

It is thus noted that any conclusions made based on this project were not gained through research but through a quality improvement project carried out in a local context.," Background/Objectives:  The child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) subspecialty training program at the University of Toronto was among the first fully accredited CAP programs in Canada. As one of Canada's largest CAP subspecialty programs, we attract many excellent applicants annually. While objectivity and transparency in the selection of candidates have been valued, it was unclear which applicant attributes should be prioritized. This quality improvement project was undertaken to identify the key applicant attributes that should be prioritized for admission to the program.  Materials/Methods:  An initial list of attributes was compiled by project team members and feedback solicited. Through iterative design, this list was categorized into ""end products,"" ""branding attributes"" and ""generic attributes."" The ""end products"" were removed as these represented outputs of training rather than attributes on which applicant selection should be based. Subsequent steps involved only the ""branding"" and ""generic"" attributes. A consensus-building exercise led to the creation of two short-lists of five attributes within each category. Finally, a paired-comparison forced choice methodology was used to determine the ranking of these attributes in order of importance when assessing applicants.  Results:  The final lists of ""generic"" and ""branding"" attributes developed through a consensus-building exercise are presented in rank order based on the paired-comparison methodology. The overall response rate for the forced choice electronic survey was 49% of faculty and learners.  Conclusions/Discussion:  This project used an iterative process of consensus building & pairwise comparison to prioritize key attributes for assessing trainee selection to the program. Going forward, these attributes will be incorporated into the file review and interview portions of our admissions process. In addition to emphasizing these priority attributes in admissions, there are implications for other aspects of the program including curriculum and faculty development, as well as guiding the overall mission and vision for the Division. A similar process could be undertaken by other training programs seeking to identify priority attributes for admission to their programs.","['Selection', 'Psychiatry', 'Medical education', 'Admissions', 'Child And Adolescent Psychiatry', 'Attributes']","['Statement Ethical', 'Ethics Statement', 'institutional requirements', 'Ethical review', 'human participants', 'Quality Improvement', 'Statement', 'Ethical', 'requirements', 'required']",[],NaN

Methods The expression levels of FOXO3A in 107 UTUC patients were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We examined the prognostic role of FOXO3A by using the Cox proportional hazard model. Results The results indicated that FOXO3A expression was notably decreased in UTUC tissue compared with control tissue. Decreased expression of FOXO3A was also related to advanced pathologic stage ( P  = 0.026), lymph node metastasis ( P  = 0.040), lymphovascular invasion ( P   P  = 0.048).

To account for the complexity and interactions of different systems of relationships, the purpose of the current article is to examine how students and their matched parents and teachers understand traditional and cyberbullying. Central to participants' understanding of traditional and cyberbullying was whether they considered bullying to represent harmful relationship dynamics. Three main assumptions emerged as shaping participants' understanding of bullying and appeared to obscure the deep relationship processes in bullying: (a) assumptions of gender in bullying, (b) type of bullying-comparing traditional and cyberbullying, and (c) physical bullying as disconnected from relationship dynamics. It is essential that assessment, education, and prevention and intervention strategies in traditional and cyberbullying be informed by the inherent relationships in bullying and be implemented at multiple levels of relationships and broader social systems.","['Gender', 'Cyberbullying', 'Relationship Dynamics', 'Student Perspectives', 'Traditional Bullying', 'Adult Perspectives', 'Systems Ecological Theory', 'Physical Bullying']","['Review Committee', 'Toronto Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Sciences Research', 'School Board', 'Board External', 'External Research', 'Research Review', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics']",[],NaN

Sixty-one patients presented with ischemic complications, 13 with hemorrhagic ones and 10 with compressive processes. Among 89 neurological complications 64.5% were peri-operative (occurring within the 30 days following the procedure) and 35.5% were delayed after 1 month.  Conclusions:  Overall, neurological complications after FD implantation were overrepresented by cerebrovascular ischemic events occurring during the peri-operative period, but also in a delayed manner after 1 year. Long-term follow-up is relevant after aneurysm intervention using FD.","['Stents', 'Cerebral hemorrhage', 'Platelet aggregation inhibitors', 'Subarachnoid hemorrhage', 'Stroke', 'Intracranial aneurysm']","['personne Île', 'France III', 'protection des', 'des personne', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Île', 'Comité']",[],NaN

Although the result of conservative methods have been reported with higher success rates than surgical methods, many more problems have been reported due to improper casting, casting pressure or bracing discomfort. Nowadays, infrared thermography (IRT) is widely used as a diagnostic tool to assess musculoskeletal disorders or injuries by detecting temperature abnormalities. Similarly, the foot skin temperature evaluation can be added along with the current subjective evaluation to predict if there is any casting pressure, excessive manipulation, or overcorrections of the foot, and other bracing pressure-related complications.  Purpose:  The main purpose of this study was to explore the foot skin temperature changes before and after using of manipulation and weekly castings.  Methods:  This is an explorative study design. Infrared Thermography (IRT), E33 FLIR thermal imaging camera model, was used to collect the thermal images of the clubfoot before and after casting intervention. A total of 120 thermal images (Medial region of the foot-24, Lateral side of the foot-24, Dorsal side of the foot-24, Plantar side of the foot-24, and Heel area of the foot-24) were collected from the selected regions of the clubfoot.  Results:  The results of univariate statistical analysis showed that significant temperature changes in some regions of the foot after casting, especially, at the 2nd (M = 32.05°C, SD = 0.77,  p  = 0.05), 3rd (M = 31.61, SD = 1.11; 95% CI: 31.27-31.96;  p  = 0.00), and 6th week of evaluation on the lateral side of the foot (M = 31.15°C, SD = 1.59; 95% CI: 30.75-31.54,  p  = 0.000). There was no significant temperature changes throughout the weekly casting in the medial side of the foot. In the heel side of the foot, significant temperature changes were noticed after the third and fourth weeks of casting.  Conclusion:  This study found that a decreased foot skin temperature on the dorsal and lateral side of the foot at the 6th week of thermography evaluation. The finding of this study suggest that the infrared thermography (IRT) might be useful as an adjunct assessment tool to evaluate the thermophysiological changes, which can be used to predict the complications caused by improper casting, over manipulative or stretching and casting-pressure related complications.","['Evaluation', 'Infrared thermography', 'Clubfoot', 'Thermography', 'Thermal Imaging', 'Ponseti Method']","['Children Hospitals', 'Hospitals Network', 'Sydney Children', 'Ethics Committee', 'Human Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Network Human', 'Ethics Statement', 'Australia', 'Committee']",['is'],NaN

Design Qualitative semistructured interview study with transcripts analysed thematically. Setting Primary care patients consulting with 10 GPs working at 7 GP practices of varying sizes and at a range of locations around London and the Southeast of England. Participants 28 adult patients: 16 women and 12 men ranging in age from 18 to 75 from a range of self-defined ethnic backgrounds. Participants were selected based on instances when the patients reported having used the internet before the consultation, when patients referred to the internet in the consultation or when the physician used the internet or made reference to it during the consultation. Results Patients report that they can find health information online that they believe is reliable and helpful for both themselves and their GP. However, they report uncertainty about how to share internet-based findings and reluctance to disclose their efforts at researching health issues online for fear of appearing disrespectful or interfering with the flow of the consultation. Conclusions Despite the democratisation of access to information about health due via the internet, patients continue to experience their use of the internet for health information as a sensitive and potentially problematic topic. The onus may well be on GPs to raise the likelihood (without judgement) that patients will have looked things up before consulting and invite them to talk about what they found.","['Primary Care', 'Qualitative Research', 'World Wide Web Technology']","['statements Patient', 'Research Authority', 'Ethics approval', 'Research Ethics', 'NHS Research', 'Health Research', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics', 'Patient consent', 'Research']",[],NaN

Innovative and culturally relevant approaches are needed to promote systematic and proactive organization of diabetes care for people living with diabetes on-reserve in Canada. The RADAR model is one strategy to improve care: an integrated disease registry paired with an electronic health record for local community healthcare providers with remote care coordination. We qualitatively assessed adoption and implementation of RADAR in First Nations communities in Alberta to inform its potential spread in the province. Methods We used the RE-AIM framework to evaluate adoption and implementation of RADAR in 6 First Nations communities. Using purposeful sampling, we recruited local healthcare providers and remote care coordinators involved in delivering RADAR to participate in telephone or in-person interviews at 6- and 24-months post-implementation. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed, and verified for accuracy. Data was analyzed using content analysis and managed using ATLAS.ti 8. Results In total, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews (6 at 6-months; 15 at 24-months) with 11 participants. Participants included 3 care coordinators and 8 local healthcare providers, including registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and registered dietitians. We found that adoption of RADAR was influenced by leadership as well as appropriateness, acceptability, and perceived value of the model. In addition, we found that implementation of RADAR was variable across communities regardless of implementation supports and appropriate community-specific adaptations. Conclusions The variable adoption and implementation of RADAR has implications for how likely it will achieve its anticipated outcomes. RADAR is well positioned for spread through continued appropriate community-based adaptations and by expanding the existing implementation supports, including dedicated human resources to support the delivery of RADAR and the provision of levels of RADAR based on existing or developed capacity among local HCPs.

Although REM can be detected on the basis of specific computed tomography (CT) scan findings, many radiologists are not familiar with its radiological appearance because of the scarcity of this complication, which may cause a delay in diagnosis. Case presentation The patient reported in this article was a 50-year-old Persian man with a history of inguinal hernia, who had been referred with the periumbilical pain that radiated to the right lower quadrant and developed following hernia replacement by the patient himself. REM diagnosis was based on clinical examination and CT scan findings, and surgical treatment was performed by the Lichtenstein repair and mesh implantation. Conclusions Although REM usually occurs after reduction with compression in the inguinal hernia, this unique case report highlighted the possibility of REM after self-reduction. Surgeons and radiologists should consider REM in patients with a history of inguinal hernia presenting with intestinal obstruction symptoms, even without any apparent signs of hernia in the physical examination.","['Reduction', 'Hernia', 'Incarceration']",[],[],NaN

There is a growing emphasis on person-centered contraceptive counselling, care that is respectful and focuses on meeting the reproductive needs of a couple, rather than fertility regulation. Despite the increasing global focus on person-centered care, little is known about the quality of FP care provided in low- and middle- income countries like India. This study involves the development and psychometric testing of a Quality of Family Planning Counselling (QFPC) measure, and assessment of its associations with contraceptives selected by clients subsequently. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from N = 237 women following their FP counselling in 120 public health facilities (District Hospitals and Community Health Centers) sampled across the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. The study captured QFPC, contraceptives selected by clients post-counselling, as well as client and provider characteristics. Based on formative research and using Principal Component Analysis, we developed a 13-item measure of quality of FP counselling. We used adjusted regression models to assess the association between QFPC and contraceptive selected post-counselling. Results The QFPC measure demonstrated good internal reliability (Cronbach alpha = 0.80) as well as criterion validity, as indicated by client reports of high QFPC being significantly more likely for clients with trained versus untrained counsellors. We found that each point increase in QFPC, including increasing quality of counselling, is associated with higher odds of clients selecting an intrauterine device (IUD) (aRR:1.03; 95% CI:1.01-1.05) and sterilization (aRR:1.06; 95% CI:1.03-1.08), compared to no method selected. Conclusions High-quality FP counselling is associated with clients subsequently selecting more effective contraceptives, including IUD and sterilization, in India. High-quality counselling is also more likely among FP-trained providers, highlighting the need for focused training and monitoring of quality care. Trial registration CTRI/2015/09/006219.

In our cross-sectional study with 136 general practices, 26.4% of 550 practice assistants showed high chronic stress. As machine learning strategies offer the opportunity to improve understanding of chronic stress by exploiting complex interactions between variables, we used data from our previous study to derive the best analytic model for chronic stress: four common machine learning (ML) approaches are compared to a classical statistical procedure. Methods We applied four machine learning classifiers (random forest, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors', and artificial neural network) and logistic regression as standard approach to analyze factors contributing to chronic stress in practice assistants. Chronic stress had been measured by the standardized, self-administered TICS-SSCS questionnaire. The performance of these models was compared in terms of predictive accuracy based on the 'operating area under the curve' (AUC), sensitivity, and positive predictive value. Findings Compared to the standard logistic regression model (AUC 0.636, 95% CI 0.490-0.674), all machine learning models improved prediction: random forest +20.8% (AUC 0.844, 95% CI 0.684-0.843), artificial neural network +12.4% (AUC 0.760, 95% CI 0.605-0.777), support vector machine +15.1% (AUC 0.787, 95% CI 0.634-0.802), and K-nearest neighbours +7.1% (AUC 0.707, 95% CI 0.556-0.735). As best prediction model, random forest showed a sensitivity of 99% and a positive predictive value of 79%. Using the variable frequencies at the decision nodes of the random forest model, the following five work characteristics influence chronic stress: too much work, high demand to concentrate, time pressure, complicated tasks, and insufficient support by practice leaders. Conclusions Regarding chronic stress prediction, machine learning classifiers, especially random forest, provided more accurate prediction compared to classical logistic regression.

A total of 37 semi-structured interviews and 6 focus groups were conducted. Building from thematic analysis focusing on participants' sexual encounters, perceptions about PrEP efficacy, and vulnerability contexts, we analyzed prospective acceptability of PrEP. Findings Knowledge about PrEP was incipient and characterized by adolescents' frequent doubts about its prescription and efficacy. The 'ideal' use of PrEP appeared together with consistent condom use, especially in casual sex. PrEP use was also mentioned as depending on increased learning about prevention management over time. Main barriers to PrEP use included the incorporation of a daily medication into participants' routine and its impact on their social lives, especially related to stigma. Concerns over short- and long-term side effects were also reported as barriers to PrEP use. TGW and travestis contrasted using PrEP with the precarity of their life conditions, and some expressed a critical vision about PrEP by associating it with pharmaceuticalization and trans necropolitics. Conclusions Participants' low knowledge and acceptability of PrEP are circumscribed by a rigid perception of condom as the ideal prevention method and the context of their sexual relations.

Patients with ST-segment elevations (STE) following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) are regularly admitted to the catheterisation laboratory for urgent coronary angiography. Whether patients without obvious STE (NSTE) should receive coronary angiography as part of a standardised diagnostic work-up following OHCA is still debated. Methods We analysed a cohort of 517 subsequent OHCA patients admitted at our institution who received a standardised diagnostic work-up including coronary angiography and therapeutic hypothermia. Patients were 63±14 years old, 76% were male. Overall, 180 (35%) had ST-elevation in the post-ROSC ECG, 317 (61%) had shockable rhythm (ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia) at first ECG. ROSC was achieved after 26±21 minutes.

Informed consent was obtained from all the participants.," Background:  Serious games are potential alternatives for supplementing traditional simulation-based education for neonatal resuscitation training. However, evidence regarding the benefits of using serious games to improve long-term knowledge retention of neonatal resuscitation in undergraduate medical students is lacking.  Objective:  We designed a serious computer game ""NEOGAMES"" to train undergraduate medical students in neonatal resuscitation in a cost-friendly and accessible way and to examine whether serious game-based training improves long-term knowledge retention in medical students.  Methods:  ""NEOGAMES"" consists of a screen with images of an incubator, a baby, visual objects, anatomy, action cards, monitors, real-time feedback, and emotional components. Undergraduate medical students from Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University were invited to participate and were allocated to a game group or a control group. Participants in the game group played the game before the training. All the participants completed three written tests, pre- and post-training knowledge tests and a follow-up test after 6 months.  Results:  Eighty-one medical students participated in the study. The student demographic characteristics of the groups were comparable, including sex, age, and grade point average (GPA). Significant short-term knowledge improvement was noticed only for male students in the game group based on their 5.2-point higher test scores than those of the controls ( p  = 0.006). However, long-term knowledge improvement at 6 months was identified for both male and female students in the game group, with test scores 21.8 and 20 points higher, respectively, than those of the controls ( P   Conclusions:  Long-term knowledge retention was nearly 3 times higher for the game group than for the control group. The improvement in knowledge supports the use of serious games for undergraduate medical education.","['Medical education', 'Knowledge Retention', 'Neonatal Resuscitation', 'Simulation-based Education', 'Serious Games']","['Fudan University', 'Children Hospital', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Ethics', 'human participants', 'University']","['2020300).', '2020300).']",NaN

Ethics Statement This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Zayed University, United Arab Emirates, and all participants provided written consent.","Previous studies conducted in the United States indicate that people associate numbers with gender, such that odd numbers are more likely to be considered male and even numbers considered female. It has been argued that this number gendering phenomenon is acquired through social learning and conditioning, and that male-odd/female-even associations reflect a general, cross-cultural human consensus on gender roles relating to agency and communion. However, the incidence and pattern of number gendering in cultures outside the United States remains to be established. Against this background, the purpose of this study was to determine whether people from a culture and country very different from the United States (specifically, native Arabic citizens living in the Arabic culture of the United Arab Emirates) also associate numbers with gender, and, if they do, whether the pattern of these associations is the male-odd/female-even associations previously observed. To investigate this issue, we adopted the Implicit Association Test used frequently in previous research, where associations between numbers (odd and even) and gender (male and female faces) were examined using male and female Arabic participants native to, and resident in, the United Arab Emirates. The findings indicated that the association of numbers with gender does occur in Arabic culture. But while Arabic females associated odd numbers with male faces and even numbers with female faces (the pattern of previous findings in the United States), Arabic males showed the reversed pattern of gender associations, associating even numbers with male faces and odd numbers with female faces. These findings support the view that number gendering is indeed a cross-cultural phenomenon and show that the phenomenon occurs across very different countries and cultures. But the findings also suggest that the  pattern  with which numbers are associated with gender is not universal and, instead, reflects culture-specific views on gender roles which may change across cultures and gender. Further implications for understanding the association of numbers with gender across human societies are discussed.","['Individualism', 'Numbers', 'Gender', 'Collectivism', 'Implicit Associations']","['Zayed University', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Ethics', 'University', 'human participants', 'Committee']",[],NaN

The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.," Background:  Balancing work and family demands is often a challenge. Family and job responsibilities may affect many aspects of health, and sleep is an important issue. Work-family conflict (WFC) refers to situations where it is difficult to reconcile family and professional demands. WFC can act in two directions: work-to-family conflicts occur when job demands interfere in family life; family-to-work conflicts arise when family demands interfere with job performance. This study evaluated whether dimensions of WFC-time- and strain-related, work-to-family conflict; family-to-work conflict; and lack of time for self-care and leisure due to work and family demands-were cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with sleep complaints, by gender.  Methods:  The sample comprised 9,704 active workers (5,057 women and 4,647 men) from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Standardized questionnaires were used to collect data. WFC was measured at baseline (2008-2010), and sleep complaints were measured at baseline and approximately 4 years after the first visit (2012-2014). To test the association between the four WFC dimensions and sleep complaints, crude and multiple logistic regressions were conducted to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The adjusted model included age, education, marital status, hours worked and work schedule.  Results:  Mean age at baseline was 48.2 years. Most participants were educated to University degree level (54.5%), married (68.2%) and worked ≤ 40 h/week (66.1%). At baseline, 48.3% of women and 41.1% of men reported sleep complaints. Frequent WFC was reported by women and men, respectively, as follows: time-related work-to-family conflict (32.6 and 26.1%), strain-related work-to-family conflict (25.3 and 16.0%), family-to-work conflict (6.6 and 7.6%) and lack of time for self-care (35.2 and 24.7%). For both women and men, time- and strain-related work-to-family conflicts and conflicts for lack of time for self-care were cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with sleep complaints. The findings also suggest a weaker and non-significant association between family-to-work conflict and sleep complaints.  Conclusions:  The statistically significant associations observed here underline the importance of reducing WFC. In the modern world, both WFC and sleep problems are increasingly recognized as frequent problems that often lead to ill health, thus posing a public health challenge.","['Stress', 'Sleep', 'epidemiology', 'Work', 'Work-family Conflict']","['Federal University', 'Paulo University', 'Minas Gerais', 'São Paulo', 'Espírito Santo', 'Oswaldo Cruz', 'Cruz Foundation', 'Rio Grande', 'Federal', 'University']",[],NaN

However, there have been few reports which evaluated the results of long-term mild intradialytic exercises in elderly patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in body weight, body composition, and laboratory data in elderly hemodialysis patients after 1-year intradialytic leg exercises with resistance bands. Methods A retrospective study. Twenty-one outpatients, aged 65 or older (mean ± SD, 75.2 ± 5.1 years), received intradialytic leg exercises with resistance bands for a year were analyzed. The values of dry weight, body composition, and laboratory data were collected from the year-ago period, at baseline and 1 year after baseline. Fat and muscle mass were evaluated by using a multi-frequency bioimpedance device. Results Physical performance changed and body weight increased after 1-year resistance band exercises. However, the participants gained fat mass, not muscle mass. Although the changes in biochemical data related to protein intake were equivocal, triglyceride levels increased significantly after 1-year exercises. An elevation in serum creatinine levels was observed, even if solute clearance increased significantly. Conclusions One-year intradialytic leg exercises with resistance bands may have a potential clinical benefit for body mass index even in elderly hemodialysis patients. However, optimal dietary modification is needed to achieve a balanced increase of muscle and fat mass. An increase of serum creatinine levels does not always mean muscle mass hypertrophy.

In Australia, women often access reproductive health care through a primary care clinician, however, little is known about clinicians' experiences responding to reproductive coercion and abuse. This study aims to address this gap by exploring the barriers to responding to reproductive coercion and abuse in Australian primary care. Methods In this qualitative study, twenty-four primary care clinicians from diverse clinical settings in primary care across Australia were recruited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Data were analysed thematically. Results Through analysis, three themes were developed: It's not even in the frame; which centred around clinicians lack of awareness around the issue. There's not much we can do, where clinicians described a lack of confidence in responding correctly as well as a lack of services to refer on to. Lastly There's no one to help us, explaining the disconnect between referral services and primary care as well as the impacts of lack of abortion on women experiencing reproductive coercion and abuse. Conclusions Clinicians expressed similar experiences of barriers to respond to reproductive coercion and abuse. Many clinicians felt ill-equipped to identify and respond to reproductive coercion and abuse. Some clinicians hadn't received any formal training, others were trained but had nowhere to refer women. Further complicating responses was a lack of support from referral services. This study highlights the need for more training and a streamlined referral pathways for women who experience reproductive coercion and abuse, as well as better access to reproductive health services in rural areas.",[],"['Advisory Group', 'Human Ethics', 'Ethics Advisory', 'Ethical considerations', 'Melbourneâ', 'Group', 'Project', 'University', 'Human', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

This study aimed to assess the magnitude of socioeconomic differences in adolescent vigorous physical activity (VPA) across various European countries using a wide range of SEP indicators, including family-based (education, family affluence, perceived social standing, parents' employment, housing tenure) and adolescent-based (academic performance and pocket money) ones. Methods We used data from a survey among 10,510 students aged 14-17 from 50 schools in six European cities: Namur (BE), Tampere (FI), Hannover (DE), Latina (IT), Amersfoort (NL), Coimbra (PT). The questionnaire included socio-demographic characteristics and the amount of time spent in VPA. Results The mean time spent practicing VPA was 60.4 min per day, with lower values for Namur (BE) and Latina (IT), and higher values for Amersfoort (NL). In the multivariable analysis, both categories of SEP indicators (family-based and adolescent based indicators) were independently associated with VPA. For each SEP indicator, lower levels of VPA were recorded in lower socioeconomic groups. In the total sample, each additional category of low SEP was associated with a decrease in mean VPA of about 4 min per day. Conclusions This study showed that across European cities adolescent VPA is positively related to both family-based SEP and adolescents' own SEP. When analysing socioeconomic differences in adolescent VPA, one should consider the use of multiple indicators of SEP.","['Adolescents', 'Socioeconomic Position', 'Vigorous Physical Activity']",[],[],NaN

The group is composed of five oncologists and two oncology nurses, two physicians and one nurse from the palliative care team, one intensive care physician, two psychiatrists. The other ethics committee members are a chief financial officer, a jurist and a sociologist. The members are elected for 2â€‰years. First mission of the ethic committee is to participate to multidisciplinary meetings for complex medical situations. Prior to the COVID-19 health crisis, this participation took place approximately three times a year, in our institute with 300 beds. Other missions were to organise 2-hour meetings three times a year for a theoretical debate about one ethical question and to conduct a yearly 2-day training. Medicoethical dilemmas and selected guidelines Over time, we identified some major medicoethical issues, which were regularly discussed, leading to the emergence of relevant ethical principles ( table 3). Resuscitation status was systematically discussed at admission of the patient and was regularly evaluated when new medical events occurred. Two main situations were to be avoided. Because conventional or intensive care hospital beds were overloaded, there was considerable risk of making the decision to limit treatments too readily for patients with advanced cancer and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Conversely, in the context of rapid-onset respiratory distress, there was a risk of deciding on active resuscitation without taking time to explore the patient’s wishes. Whatever their age, patients with preserved autonomy and a life expectancy of more than 1 year before COVID-19 disease had a resuscitation order status, unless they expressed their opposition. A paradigm shift occurred in the benefitâ€“risk balance of cancer treatment, affected by the new unknown COVID-19 risk. Healthcare professionals were often required to make critical decisions on the basis of inadequate data and incomplete knowledge. 20 21 The management of patients with acute respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 pneumonia was particularly challenging. First, effective treatment to reduce a pleuro-pulmonary tumour could facilitate the cure of COVID-19 pneumonia. Second, the occurrence of febrile neutropaenia could increase the risk of lung infection. Finally, delaying treatment of metastatic cancer could in turn expose the patient to tumour progression. Oncologists had to deal with these threats of different types and timing, the combination of which made the choice of the best treatment option particularly difficult. Most of the time, cancer treatments were delayed until COVID-19 pneumonia was cured. They were only considered on a case-by-case basis for patients with pleuropulmonary tumour invasion, which could contribute to respiratory failure, or any other threatening tumour localisation such as meningeal carcinomatosis. The clinical elements favouring decisions were a good general condition with preserved autonomy and an effective anticancer treatment available with low haematological or lung toxicity. For one patient included in a double-blind therapeutic trial presenting severe respiratory failure, collegiate discussion led to the decision to lift the blinding, because of the possible lung toxicity of the treatment studied. For patients with terminal respiratory failure, palliative sedation was systematically discussed. A recent French law on rights of end-of-life patients enabled them to receive ‘deep, continuous sedation until death’. 22 This treatment is to be prescribed at the patient request, when facing an incurable disease, refractory suffering and a short life expectancy (a few days). It can be requested by the person of trust or relatives if the patient is no longer conscious or able to communicate. Collegiate validation in a specific meeting is mandatory before starting this sedation. Visiting authorisations for relatives of a terminally ill patient were also frequently discussed in the onco-palliative meeting. We observed that relatives who could not visit their loved one before their death suffered an intense psychological trauma. For this reason, visiting authorisations with strict respect of local safety measures were granted to one or two relatives per day, to avoid patients with terminal disease dying without their loved ones by their side, or relatives not being able to say goodbye or undertake traditional grieving rituals. 23"," Objectives In managing patients with cancer in the COVID-19 era, clinical oncologists and palliative care practitioners had to face new, disrupting and complex medical situations, challenging the quality of the shared decision-making process. During the first lockdown in France, we developed an onco-palliative ethics meeting to enhance the quality of the decision-making process for patients with advanced cancer treated for COVID-19. Methods A least one of the institutional ethics committee members was present along with oncologists, palliative care teams, psycho-oncologists, radiologists and intensive care specialists. Specific medical parameters were systematically collected to form a standardised framework for the discussions. Results The main raised issues were the definition of new criteria for the implementation of invasive resuscitation techniques, optimal ways to adapt or delay anticancer treatment and best procedures to address terminal respiratory failure and end-of-life care. The main clinical and ethical guidelines that emerged during these debates are presented. The palliative care team played a major role in assessing and reporting patients' awareness of cancer-related prognosis and their wishes concerning invasive therapies or transfer to intensive care units, enabling an individualised benefit-risk balance assessment. The ethics committee members ensured continuous monitoring during the discussions. Their function was to recall the main ethical principles including dignity, which is conferred on people when there are treated as having equal status. Conclusions The onco-palliative ethics meeting provided a powerful avenue for improvement of collegiality and reinforcement of teamwork, which could be a major protection against burnout for healthcare professionals facing an epidemic onslaught.","['Cancer', 'Ethics', 'Supportive Care', 'End Of Life Care', 'Covid-19']","['ethics committee', 'patient', 'patients', 'caregivers open-minded', 'certified degree', 'committee members', 'treatment', 'ethics', 'committee', 'respiratory failure']",[],NaN

SSI prevention bundles have been shown to reduce SSI in colorectal surgery, but their impact on organ space infections (OSI) is variable. Adoption of an evidence-based practice without an implementation strategy is often unsuccessful. Our aim was to successfully implement an OSI prevention bundle and to achieve a cost-effective reduction in OSI following elective left-sided colorectal operations. Methods The Translating Research into Practice model was used to implement an OSI prevention bundle in all patients undergoing elective left-sided colorectal resections by a single unit from November 2018 to September 2019. The new components included oral antibiotics with mechanical bowel preparation, when required, and use of impermeable surgical gowns. Other standardised components included alcoholic chlorhexidine skin preparation, glove change after bowel handling prior to wound closure with clean instruments. The primary outcome was OSI. Secondary outcomes included bundle compliance, unintended consequences and total patient costs. Outcomes were compared with all patients undergoing elective left-sided colorectal resections at the same institution in 2017. Results Elective colorectal resections were performed in 173 patients across two cohorts. The compliance rate with bundle items was 63% for all items and 93% for one omitted item. There was a reduction in OSI from 12.9% (11 of 85) to 3.4% (3 of 88, p Conclusion Successful implementation of an OSI prevention bundle was associated with a reduced rate of OSI after elective colorectal surgery.

Various national and international projects have been initiated to reform the teaching of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (CP&T) during undergraduate medical training. However, there is as yet no list of commonly prescribed and available medicines that European doctors should be able to independently prescribe safely and effectively without direct supervision. Such a list could form the basis for a European Prescribing Exam and would harmonise European CP&T education.

This study explored the impact of COVID-19 on health knowledge, lifestyle, and healthcare seeking behaviour among residents of a resource-limited setting in Ghana. Methods This qualitative study adopted an exploratory design to collect data from 20 adult residents in the Cape Coast Metropolis using face-to-face in-depth interviews. Data collected were analysed thematically and statements from participants presented verbatim to illustrate the themes realised. Results Health knowledge has improved due to COVID-19 in terms of access to health information and increased understanding of health issues. There were reductions in risky health-related lifestyles (alcohol intake, sharing of personal items, and consumption of junk foods) while improvements were observed in healthy lifestyles such as regular physical exercise and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables. COVID-19 also positively impacted health seeking behaviour through increased health consciousness and regular check-ups. However, reduced healthcare utilization was prevalent. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a positive cue to action and helped improved health knowledge, lifestyle, and care seeking behaviour although existing health system constrains and low economic status reduced healthcare utilization. To improve health systems, health-related lifestyles and healthcare seeking behaviour as well as overall health outcomes even after the pandemic wades off, COVID-19 associated conscious and unconscious reforms should be systematically harnessed.",[],"['Health Directorate', 'Cape Coast', 'Coast Metropolitan', 'Metropolitan Health', 'Ethical issues', 'study', 'study participants', 'obtained approval', 'study obtained', 'Directorate']",['to'],NaN

Moreover, the large proportion of asymptomatic dengue cases impairs comprehensive assessment of its epidemiology even where effective surveillance systems are in place. We conducted a prospective community-based study to assess the incidence of symptomatic dengue cases in Zapopan and neighboring municipalities in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. Methods Healthy subjects aged 6 months to 50 years living in households located in the Zapopan and neighboring municipalities were enrolled for a 24-month follow-up study (NCT02766088). Serostatus was determined at enrolment and weekly contacts were conducted via phone calls and home visits. Participants had to report any febrile episode lasting for at least two days. Suspected dengue cases were tested by reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), detection of non-structural protein 1 (NS1), anti-DENV immunoglobulin G and M (IgG and IgM) assays. Results A total of 350 individuals from 87 households were enrolled. The overall seroprevalence of anti-DENV IgG at enrolment was 19.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 14.5-25.6) with the highest seroprevalence rate observed in the adult group. Over the 27-month study period from July 2016 to September 2018, a total of 18 suspected dengue cases were reported. Four cases were confirmed by RT-qPCR and serotyped as DENV-1. A fifth case was confirmed by the NS1 assay. The 13 remaining suspected cases were tested negative by these assays. Based on the 5 virologically confirmed cases, symptomatic dengue incidence proportion of 1.4% (95%CI 0.5-3.8) was estimated. No severe cases or hospitalizations occurred during the study. Conclusion Community-based active surveillance was shown as efficient to detect symptomatic dengue cases.

Interview participants gave informed consent for participation.," Background Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in England are making significant changes to improve access and effectiveness. This 'transformation' variously involves easier access to services through a Single Point of Access (SPA), more integrated services within CAMHS and enhanced co-provision across education and third sector or non-profit organisations. Methods A mixed-methods observational study was conducted to explore the process and impact of transformation over four years in two services. Ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews were conducted and Electronic Patient Records with over one million contacts analysed. Difference-in-differences analysis with propensity score matching to estimate the causal impact of the transformation on patient access was utilised. Outcomes Spend and staffing increased across both CAMHS. The SPA had growing rates of self-referral and new care pathways were seeing patients according to expected degree of psychopathology. Third sector partners were providing increasing numbers of low-intensity interventions. Although the majority of staff were supportive of the changes, the process of transformation led to service tensions. In the first year after transformation there was no change in the rate of new patients accessing services or new spells (episodes of care) in the services. However, by year three, the number of new patients accessing CAMHS was 19% higher (Incidence Rate Ratio: 1·19, CI: 1·16, 1·21) and the rate of new spells was 12% higher (Incidence Rate Ratio: 1·12, CI: 1·05, 1·20). Interpretation Transformation investment, both financial and intellectual, can help to increase access to CAMHS in England, but time is needed to realise the benefits of reorganisation.",[],"['Oxford Health', 'Health NHS', 'NHS Foundation', 'Foundation Trust', 'Ethics Anonymized', 'Anonymized routinely', 'Young Peopleâ', 'Oxford', 'Health', 'NHS']",[],NaN

Design The TrIAGE project, a prospective observational study based on electronic health record data. Patients and setting Consecutive paediatric emergency department visits for shortness of breath in five European hospitals in four countries (Austria, Netherlands, Portugal, United Kingdom) during a study period of 9-36 months (2012-2014). Main outcome measures We assessed diversity between EDs regarding resource use (diagnostic tests, therapy) and hospital admission using multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for potential confounding variables. Results In total, 13,552 children were included. Of those, 7,379 were categorized as immediate/very urgent, ranging from 13-80% in the participating hospitals. Laboratory tests and X-rays were performed in 8-33% of the cases and 21-61% was treated with inhalation medication. Admission rates varied between 8-47% and PICU admission rates varied between 0.1-9%. Patient characteristics and markers of disease severity (age, sex, comorbidity, urgency, vital signs) could explain part of the observed variability in resource use and hospitalization. However, after adjusting for these characteristics, we still observed substantial variability between settings. Conclusion European EDs differ substantially regarding the resource use and hospitalization in children with shortness of breath, even when adjusting for patient characteristics. Possible explanations for this variability might be unmeasured patient characteristics such as underlying disease, differences in guideline use and adherence or different local practice patterns.",[],[],[],NaN

The participants comprised 53 young adult outpatients (27 males, median age: 23 years) who had undergone surgical interventions (median: 3 times) for CHD. The Knowledge related to Safe Sex Practice scale (KSSP), an assessment tool containing 15 questions on sexual knowledge, was administered, and the rates of correct answers for each item and the overall scale were compared with the age and sex of a control group (n = 164). The overall mean KSSP score of the participant group (10.5 ± 1.8) was significantly lower than that of the control group (11.1 ± 1.9, p = .035). The KSSP scores of the participants with low peripheral oxygen saturation (SaO2 < 95%) were significantly lower (9.77 ± 1.85) than those with normal SaO2 (11.06 ± 1.85, p = .009). Regarding sexual health education, the participants reported receiving information about contraception as more important than other areas of sexual health. The rate of incorrect answers was higher for questions regarding natural ways of contraception utilizing infertile periods in the menstrual cycle.

This study aimed to determine whether PQ can cause pancreatic damage. The two conventional models (intragastric infusion (iG) and intraperitoneal injection (iP)) may exhibit different effects on the pancreas depending on whether or not they pass through the digestive tract. In this study, the rats were divided into four groups: the intragastric infusion group (PQ-iG,  n  = 45), intraperitoneal injection group (PQ-iP,  n  = 53), normal control group 1 (NC-iG,  n  = 6) and normal control group 2 (NC-iP,  n  = 6). Pancreatic damage was compared between groups using serum amylase activity assay, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, TUNEL assay, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Serum amylase levels in group PQ-iG were significantly higher than in group PQ-iP ( p   p  < 0.05). TEM showed expansive endoplasmic reticulum lumens and mitochondria swelling in the pancreas of the PQ-groups. It is concluded that both methods of modeling could cause pancreatic damage and the type and degree of damage would change over time. Note that pancreatic damage in group PQ-iG was more severe than that in group PQ-iP. Therefore, clinical practitioners should pay close attention to pancreatic damage caused by PQ, especially when the route of PQ administration was oral.","['Pancreatic Damage', 'Intraperitoneal Injection', 'Paraquat Poisoning', 'Intragastric Infusion', 'Multiple Organ Damage']","['Zhengzhou University', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'permit number', 'scientific purposes', 'Animal Ethics', 'animal study', 'institutional guidelines', 'Ethics', 'animal']",['2019-KY-191).'],NaN

Option B+ ART uptake, early adherence, and associated factors need to be evaluated in Central Uganda. Methods A mixed approaches study was carried out in six health facilities in Masaka, Mityana, and Luwero districts from October 2013 to February 2016. Questionnaires were administered to 507 HIV positive pregnant females seeking antenatal care services. Key informant interviews were conducted with 54 health providers, and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 57 HIV positive women on Option B+ ART. Quantitative data were analyzed using log-binomial regression model to determine factors associated with optimal adherence (taking at least 95% of the prescribed ART), while thematic analysis was used on qualitative data. Results Ninety one percent of women (463/507) received a prescription of life long ART. Of these, 93.3% (432/463) started swallowing their medicines. Overall, 83% of women who received ART prescriptions (310/374) felt they were ready to initiate ART immediately. Main motivating factors to swallow ART among those who received a prescription were women's personal desire to be healthy (92.3%) and desire to protect their babies (90.6%). Optimal adherence to ART was achieved by 76.8% (315/410). Adherence was higher among females who were ready to start ART (adj. PR = 3.20; 95% CI: 1.15-8.79) and those who had revealed their HIV positive result to someone (adj. PR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.04-1.46). Facilitators of ART uptake from qualitative findings included adequate counseling, willingness to start, and knowing the benefits of ART. Reasons for refusal to start ART included being unready to start ART, fear to take ART for life, doubt of HIV positive results, and preference for local herbs. Reasons for non-adherence were travelling far away from health facilities, fear of side effects, non-disclosure of HIV results to anyone, and perception that the baby is safe from HIV infection post-delivery. Conclusions Uptake of Option B+ ART was very high. However, failure to start swallowing ART and sub-optimal adherence are a major public health concern. Enhancing women's readiness to start ART and encouraging HIV result revelation could improve ART uptake and adherence.",[],"['Higher Degrees', 'Makerere University', 'University School', 'Uganda National', 'National Council', 'Public Health', 'Health Higher', 'Ethical considerations', 'considerations Ethical', 'Ethical approval']",[],NaN

The primary aim of this study was to describe the incidence, characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in the UK compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2. Methods and findings We conducted a national, prospective cohort study of all hospitalized pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from 01/03/2020 to 31/08/2020 using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System. Incidence rates were estimated using national maternity data. Overall, 1148 hospitalized women had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, 63% of which were symptomatic. The estimated incidence of hospitalization with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 2.0 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.9-2.2) and for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 was 1.2 per 1000 maternities (95% CI 1.1-1.4). Compared to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2, women hospitalized with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be overweight or obese (adjusted OR 1.86, (95% CI 1.39-2.48) and aOR 2.07 (1.53-2.29)), to be of Black, Asian or Other minority ethnic group (aOR 6.24, (3.93-9.90), aOR 4.36, (3.19-5.95) and aOR 12.95, (4.93-34.01)), and to have a relevant medical comorbidity (aOR 1.83 (1.32-2.54)). Hospitalized pregnant women with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to be admitted to intensive care (aOR 57.67, (7.80-426.70)) but the absolute risk of poor outcomes was low.

Results To successfully reach cases and contacts, participants recommended identifying clients' outreach preferences, engaging clients authentically, and addressing sources of mistrust. Participants felt that the effectiveness of successful isolation and quarantine was contingent on minimizing delays in reaching clients and on systematically assessing and addressing their nutritional, financial, and housing needs. They felt that successful adoption of a volunteer-driven contact tracing model depended on the ability to recruit self-motivated contact tracers and provide rapid training and consistent, supportive supervision. Participants noted that implementation could be enhanced with better management tools, such as more engaging interview scripts, user-friendly data management software, and protocols for special situations and populations. They also emphasized the value of coordinating outreach efforts with other involved providers and agencies. Finally, they believed that long-term maintenance of a volunteer-driven program requires monetary or educational incentives to sustain participation.

As most gastric cancer patients showed lower expression of these two lncRNAs, no significant association between clinicopathological features of the patients and the level of LINC02688 and  LOC25845  ( PP7080 ) expression could be detected. Furthermore, ROC curve analysis indicated that LINC02688 and  PP7080  can serve as good predictive biomarkers for distinguishing tumoral tissues from their adjacent non-tumoral counterparts.

However, there is little known about the psychological mechanisms that give rise to beliefs such as certainty of being infected by COVID-19, and this was investigated in the present study.  Objective:  Using the same data from the previous online survey with the same research team, we further investigated whether certainty of being infected by COVID-19 is associated with age, sex, health anxiety, and/or personality traits.  Methods:  Respondents ( N  = 375) filled out an online survey with 57 questions about symptoms similar to COVID-19, certainty of being infected by COVID-19, anxiety, stress, health anxiety, and personality dimensions (based on the five-factor model of personality).  Results:  Higher levels of conscientiousness and health anxiety were independently associated with certainty of being infected by COVID-19. The model predicted 29% of the variance in certainty of being infected by COVID-19.  Conclusion:  Being conscientious and worried about health issues were associated with the belief of being infected by COVID-19. Such finding may have implications for health care personnel who provide COVID-19 testing or consulting services to general population, as individuals high in these traits may over-report COVID-like symptoms. Theoretically, these findings point to psychological factors that may increase nocebo and possibly placebo effects. Clinically, the findings suggest that individuals high in conscientiousness and health anxiety may be more likely to over-report their bodily experiences.","['Expectations', 'Health Anxiety', 'Conscientiousness', 'Nocebo Effects', 'Personality Dimensions', 'Coronavirus Disease 2019']","['project number', 'Research Data', 'Regional Committee', 'Norwegian Center', 'Health Research', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'project']","['142652),', '605612).']",NaN

Included were, among others, several herpesviruses, hepatitis B virus, Merkel cell polyomavirus and, unprecedentedly, human papillomavirus 31. Given the reactivation and/or oncogenic potential of these viruses, their repercussion on hematopoietic and malignant disorders calls for careful examination. Furthermore, the implications of persistent infections on the engraftment, regenerative capacity, and outcomes of bone marrow transplantation deserve in-depth evaluation.","['Transplantation', 'DNA viruses', 'Virome', 'Human Papillomavirus 31', 'Human Bone Marrow', 'Hematopoietic Disorders']","['Hospital District', 'Uusimaa Hospital', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'District', 'Ethics', 'approval']",[],NaN

A number of discrepancies, however, are presented by the published literature, with reports suggesting that opioids may either promote or inhibit the spread of cancer. It is of great significance to determine whether morphine may increase the risk of metastasis while utilized in liver cancer surgical treatment. In this study, we explore the effects of morphine on liver cancer cells  in vitro  and  in vivo . Our results showed that morphine does not promote proliferative ability to cultured liver cancer cells. While morphine could increase the apoptosis rate of Hep3B/HepG2 cells. Furthermore, morphine could significantly inhibit the migratory and invasion ability of Hep3B/HepG2 cells. Subsequent investigations disclosed that morphine could inhibit sphere formation ability of Hep3B/HepG2 cells by using sphere formation assay. Based on nude mouse models, we demonstrated that morphine significantly reduced pulmonary tumorigenicity of Hep3B/HepG2 cells. In conclusion, our results found that morphine at clinical concentrations could suppress liver cancer cell tumor properties  in vitro  and  in vivo , indicating the safety of morphine utilization in HCC patients' pain management.","['Morphine', 'Liver cancer', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Metastasis', 'Opioids']","['Medical College', 'Huazhong University', 'Institute Research', 'Tongji Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'animal study', 'Technology', 'College']",[],NaN

We aim to determine whether CTCs or ctDNA are suitable to determine oncogenic mutations in HCC patients. Methods Twenty-six mostly advanced HCC patients were enrolled. 30 mL peripheral blood from each patient was obtained. CellSearch system was used for CTC detection. A sequencing panel covering 14 cancer-relevant genes was used to identify oncogenic mutations. TERT promoter C228T and C250T mutations were determined by droplet digital PCR. Results CTCs were detected in 27% (7/26) of subjects but at low numbers (median: 2 cells, range: 1-15 cells) and ctDNA in 77% (20/26) of patients. Mutations in ctDNA were identified in several genes: TERT promoter C228T (77%, 20/26), TP53 (23%, 6/26), CTNNB1 (12%, 3/26), PIK3CA (12%, 3/26) and NRAS (4%, 1/26). The TERT C228T mutation was present in all patients with one or more ctDNA mutations, or detectable CTCs. The TERT C228T and TP53 mutations detected in ctDNA were present at higher levels in matched primary HCC tumor tissue. The maximal variant allele frequency (VAF) of ctDNA was linearly correlated with largest tumor size and AFP level (Log10). CtDNA (or TERT C228T) positivity was associated with macrovascular invasion, and positivity of ctDNA (or TERT C228T) or CTCs (≥ 2) correlated with poor patient survival. Conclusions Oncogenic mutations could be detected in ctDNA from advanced HCC patients. CtDNA analysis may serve as a promising liquid biopsy to identify druggable mutations.","['Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Circulating Tumor Cells', 'Circulating Tumor Dna', 'Tert Promoter Mutations', 'Macrovascular Invasion']",[],[],NaN

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is the nuclear receptor that regulates the downstream target genes. This study aimed to analyze the associations among pulmonary function, DJ-1, VDR and Nrf-2 in COPD patients. Serum was collected from 180 COPD patients and control subjects. Thirty-five lung tissues were obtained. DJ-1 was measured using ELISA and western blotting. Nrf-2 and VDR were detected by immunohistochemistry. Serum and pulmonary DJ-1 levels were lower in COPD patients than those in control subjects. Pulmonary VDR-positive nuclei were reduced in COPD patients. Nrf-2-positive nuclei were reduced in lung tissues of COPD patients. On the contrary, Nrf-2-related downstream target proteins were elevated in COPD patients. Further correlation analysis indicated that forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was positively associated with pulmonary DJ-1, VDR and Nrf-2 in patients with COPD. In addition, there were positive correlations among DJ-1, VDR and Nrf-2 in lung tissues of COPD patients. In conclusion, DJ-1, VDR and Nrf-2 were decreased in COPD patients compared with control subjects.

The participants provided their written/online informed consent to participate in this study.," Background:  Past research has highlighted the role of trauma in social adjustment problems, but little is known about the underlying process. This is a barrier to developing effective interventions for social adjustment of traumatized individuals. The present study addressed this research gap through a cognitive model.  Methods:  A total of 604 young adults (aged 18-24; living in Australia) from different backgrounds (refugee, non-refugee immigrant, and Australian) were assessed through self-report questionnaires. The data were analyzed through path analysis and multivariate analysis of variance. Two path analyses were conducted separately for migrant (including non-refugee and refugee immigrants) and Australian groups.  Results:  Analyses indicated that cognitive avoidance and social problem solving can significantly mediate the relation between trauma and social adjustment ( p    0.95). According to the model, reacting to trauma by cognitive avoidance (i.e., chronic thought suppression and over-general autobiographical memory) can disturb the cognitive capacities that are required for social problem solving. Consequently, a lack of effective social problem solving significantly hinders social adjustment. There were no significant differences among the Australian, non-refugee immigrant and refugee participants on the dependent variables. Moreover, the hypothesized links between the variables was confirmed similarly for both migrant (including refugee and non-refugee immigrants) and Australian groups.  Conclusion:  The findings have important implications for interventions targeting the social adjustment of young individuals. We assert that overlooking the processes identified in this study, can hinder the improvement of social adjustment in young adults with a history of trauma.

This phase I study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of nivolumab combined with HFRT in patients with progressive advanced lung cancer following multiline treatment. Methods We enrolled 31 patients with advanced lung cancer pathologically confirmed to have progressive disease and treated with first-line or a higher therapy. Selected lesions were treated using HFRT, and nivolumab was administered within 7 days subsequently. Nivolumab was administered once a month following partial remission. Peripheral blood was collected before and after 1 month of treatment to evaluate relevant cytokines between nivolumab responders and non-responders. Results Overall, 23 patients who completed the treatment were evaluated. Of them, 9 and 14 patients underwent hypofractionated brachytherapy with 30 Gy in a single fraction  via  percutaneous interstitial implantation of (192)Ir and 40-50 Gy in 5 fractions  via  stereotactic body radiation therapy, respectively. The median follow-up period was 11 months. At the 1-year follow-up, no patient developed grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis. The overall objective response and complete remission rates were 39.13% and 13.04%, respectively. The 1-year overall survival and median progression-free survival were 60.9% and 6 months, respectively. The plasma levels of interleukin IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17A were significantly reduced after treatment in nivolumab responders. Conclusions HFRT could increase the responsivity to nivolumab and reduce its administration frequency.

We aimed to assess changes in the number of visits and characterize the profiles of these patients. Methods In this retrospective observational study, we examined the number of psychiatric ED visits and their proportion among the total number of ED visits. We also evaluated psychiatric visits characteristics during a one-month period after the declaration of deconfinement, and we compared those characteristics to characteristics observed during the same month over the previous 4 years. Results The number of psychiatric visits to our emergency department during deconfinement was similar to the number observed in the same month of previous years. However, the proportion of psychiatric visits to our emergency department among all visits to the ED rose during deconfinement to a level never before observed. The mean proportion of psychiatric admissions to all ED admissions rose from 3.5% in past years to 5.3% during deconfinement (p = 0.013). Moreover, during deconfinement, more visits (80%) were without an acute intoxication compared to past years (58.5%; p = 0.031). Also, in the deconfinement period, more visits lacked a follow-up consultation organized at discharge (40%) compared to the historical period (25%, p = 0.036).

[ 38]. This model could be useful in developing environmental ethics in codes of conduct for pharmacists. For the creation of this model, categories of elements from the moral principles’ framework of Beauchamp and Childress [ 39] and the ethical analysis framework of Veatch, Haddad, and Last [ 40] were used. Starting from these, the following categories of elements were included in the framework model: values – defined as good, beneficial things, to be protected or maximized in relation to the environment, principles – defined as general moral rules of action for protecting values, and ethics guidelines – defined as sets of specific ethical rules required to orient professionals in implementing the principles [ 39,  40]. The decision on which elements to include in the framework model, in each of these categories, was taken via an iterative process of reflection and discussion following the review of current literature."," Background Authors of various backgrounds are preoccupied with the meaning of environmental ethics, which refers to specific values, norms, attitudes, and practices with respect to all beings and elements of nature. Many international organizations have adopted important documents proclaiming the ethical obligation to protect the environment in all professional activities. At the national level, professional associations should include and develop this obligation in their codes of conduct. This study aimed to analyze and compare elements of environmental protection included in codes of conduct for pharmacists, to find ways to integrate environmental ethics into their activities. Methods Seven codes of conduct for pharmacists were analyzed using the comparative method and methods of legal interpretation. Based on acknowledged values and principles of environmental ethics, a framework model for developing environmental protection in pharmacists' activities was created via an iterative process of reflection and discussion. Results Explicit provisions for environmental ethics were found in codes in force in three countries and in a Romanian project. These provisions refer, in general, to an ethical duty of environmental protection in pharmacists' activities. Regarding the other codes, the study could only interpret stipulations of public health ethics to deduce an ethical environmental obligation. Considering the need for developing such provisions, an ethical framework was proposed as a model for professional associations of pharmacists. Conclusions The studied codes demonstrate a preoccupation of the professional associations with environmental protection in pharmacists' activities, with different degrees of interest in developing environmental ethics. To this end, the codes of conduct for pharmacists should include environmental values, principles, and ethics guidelines. Those guidelines should indicate the ethical attitude in relation to the environment for each activity.

However, less is known about associations of different specific domains and breaks of sitting on general health, back/neck pain and if physical activity could influence these associations. The aim was to investigate how workplace sitting and frequency of breaking up workplace sitting is associated with self-reported general health and self-reported back/neck pain. Methods 44,978 participants (42% women) from the Swedish working population, who participated in a nationwide occupational health service screening 2014-2019, were included in this cross-sectional study. Self-reported sitting duration and frequency of breaks from sitting at work, general health, back/neck pain, exercise, leisure time sitting, diet, smoking, stress and body mass index were assessed. Occupation was classified as requiring higher education qualifications or not. Logistic regression modelling was used to assess the association between workplace sitting/frequency of breaks in workplace sitting and poor general health and back/neck pain, respectively. Results Compared to sitting all the time at work, sitting ≤75% of the time showed significantly lower risks for poor general health (OR range 0.50-0.65), and sitting between 25 and 75% of the time showed significantly lower risks (OR 0.82-0.87) for often reported back/neck pain. For participants reporting sitting half of their working time or more, breaking up workplace sitting occasionally or more often showed significantly lower OR than seldom breaking up workplace sitting; OR ranged 0.40-0.50 for poor health and 0.74-0.81 for back/neck pain. Conclusions Sitting almost all the time at work and not taking breaks is associated with an increased risk for self-reported poor general health and back/neck pain. People sitting almost all their time at work are recommended to take breaks from prolonged sitting, exercise regularly and decrease their leisure time sitting to reduce the risk for poor health.","['Exercise', 'Health risk', 'Public Health', 'Sedentary Behaviour', 'Self-reported Health', 'Breaks', 'Working Population']",[],[],NaN

However, the lack of robust internal references largely limits their clinical application. Here we propose a ratio-based, normalizer-free algorithm to quantitate plasma miRNA for CC diagnosis. Methods A miRNA-pair matrix was established by pairing differentially expressed miRNAs in the training group from GSE106817. LASSO regression was performed to select variables. To maximize the performance, four algorithms (LASSO regression, random forest, logistic regression, and SVM) were tested for each biomarker combination. Data from GSE106817 and GSE112264 were used for internal and external verification. RT-qPCR data acquired from another cohort were also used for external validation. Results After validation through four algorithms, we obtained a 4-miRNA pair model (miR-1246 miR-451a; miR-1246 miR-4514; miR-654-5p miR-575; miR-4299 miR-575) that showed good performance in differentiating CC from normal controls with a maximum AUC of 1.00 in internal verification and 0.93 in external verification. Tissue validation showed a maximum AUC of 0.81. Further external validation using RT-qPCR data exhibited good classifier ability with an AUC of 0.88.

Methods For adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) who were admitted through Emergency Department (ED) meeting clinical criteria of severe sepsis from 11/2007 to 05/2018 at an urban tertiary academic medical center, we developed gradient boosting models (GBMs) using a total of 760 original and derived variables, including demographic variables, laboratory values, vital signs, infection diagnosis present on admission, and historical comorbidities. We identified the most impactful factors having strong association with rapid treatment, and further applied the Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values to examine the marginal effects for each factor. Results For the subgroups with or without fluid bolus treatment component, the models achieved high accuracy of area-under-receiver-operating-curve of 0.91 [95% CI, 0.86-0.95] and 0.84 [95% CI, 0.81-0.86], and sensitivity of 0.81[95% CI, 0.72-0.87] and 0.91 [95% CI, 0.81-0.97], respectively.

Reactions to emotional tears show our extraordinary capacity for detecting micro-nuances when judging another human's face. Regarding such behaviour, previous studies carried out in our laboratory have pointed to an adaptive function of emotional tears: i.e. their inhibitory influence on perceived aggressiveness. In the present work we aimed to further explore that hypothesis by extending our investigation from humans to animals, using pictures of five different animal faces (cat, dog, horse, chimpanzee, hamster) to which tears were added digitally. To this end, we conducted an online study of 403 participants recruited from different social networks and academic institutions. We questioned the participants about their perceptions of emotional intensity, aggressiveness and friendliness in the animal faces and analysed the comparisons they made between faces with and without tears. In addition, a latent variable referred to as ""passion for animals"" was measured using different indicators. By adding the results obtained in each species and breaking them down into different basic emotions, we found that the presence of tears was related to a higher absolute frequency of participants who perceived sadness, which endorsed our previous results obtained using images of humans. Regarding aggressiveness, the presence of tears favoured the perception of less aggressiveness.

There is a need for an easy and accessible home device in predicting sleep apnea. The objective of the study is to determine the predictive performance of the overnight pulse oximetry in predicting OSA in at-risk surgical patients. Methods This was a planned post-hoc analysis of multicenter prospective cohort study involving 1,218 at-risk surgical patients without prior diagnosis of sleep apnea. All patients underwent home sleep apnea testing (ApneaLink Plus, ResMed) simultaneously with pulse oximetry (PULSOX-300i, Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc). The predictive performance of the 4% oxygen desaturation index (ODI) versus apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were determined. Results Of 1,218 patients, the mean age was 67.2 ± 9.2 years and body mass index (BMI) was 27.0 ± 5.3 kg/m2. The optimal cut-off for predicting moderate-to-severe and severe OSA was ODI ≥15 events/hour. For predicting moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI ≥15), the sensitivity and specificity of ODI ≥ 15 events per hour were 88.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.7-90.6) and 95.4% (95% CI, 94.2-96.4). For severe OSA (AHI ≥30), the sensitivity and specificity were 97.2% (95% CI, 92.7-99.1) and 78.8% (95% CI, 78.2-79.0). The area under the curve (AUC) for moderate-to-severe and severe OSA was 0.983 (95% CI, 0.977-0.988) and 0.979 (95% CI, 0.97-0.909) respectively.

Participation in the individual survey and in malaria testing was voluntary, and parents signed the consent form before the interview and before their childâ€™s blood collection. Interviews and biomarker testing were performed as privately as possible. Results of interviews and biomarker testing were strictly confidential. Only the DHS research team (interviewers, health specialists, editors, and supervisors) were allowed to access the data, essentially for communications. Each respondentâ€™s interview and biomarker data files were identified only by a series of numbers.

This study aimed to identify malaria socioeconomic predictors among children aged 6-59 months in DRC and to describe a socioeconomic profile of the most-at-risk children aged 6-59 months for malaria infection. Materials and methods This study used data from the 2013 DRC Demographic and Health Survey. The sample included 8,547 children aged 6-59 months who were tested for malaria by microscopy. Malaria infection status, the dependent variable, is a dummy variable characterized as a positive or negative test. The independent variables were child's sex, age, and living arrangement; mother's education; household's socioeconomic variables; province of residence; and type of place of residence. Statistical analyses used the chi-square automatic interaction detector (CHAID) model and logistic regression. Results Of the 8,547 children included in the sample, 25% had malaria infection. Four variables-child's age, mother's education, province, and wealth index-were statistically associated with the prevalence of malaria infection in bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis (CHAID and logistic regression). The prevalence of malaria infection increases with child's age and decreases significantly with mother's education and the household wealth index. These findings suggest that the prevalence of malaria infection is driven by interactions among environmental factors, socioeconomic characteristics, and probably differences in the implementation of malaria programs across the country. The effect of mother's education on malaria infection was only significant among under-five children living in Ituri, Kasaï-Central, Haut-Uele, Lomami, Nord-Ubangi, and Maniema provinces, and the effect of wealth index was significant in Mai-Ndombe, Tshopo, and Haut-Katanga provinces. Conclusion Findings from this study could be used for targeting malaria interventions in DRC. Although malaria infection is common across the country, the prevalence of children at high risk for malaria infection varies by province and other background characteristics, including age, mother's education, wealth index, and place of residence. In light of these findings, designing provincial and multisectoral interventions could be an effective strategy to achieve zero malaria infection in DRC.",[],"['ethical review', 'DRC School', 'Review Committee', 'ICF institutional', 'review board', 'Ethical considerations', 'country ethical', 'institutional review', 'Public Health', 'Health Ethical']","['The', 'were']",NaN

It was originally believed to be a rare event in patients with thyroid hyperfunction and it was reported that hyperthyroidism had a protective role against thyroid neoplasms. However, in recent years, several studies have hypothesized that differentiated thyroid carcinomas and hyperthyroidism may coexist. Our study aims therefore to evaluate the incidence of differentiated thyroid carcinomas on definitive histological examination, in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy with coexisting hyperfunctioning thyroid disease, to understand whether hyperthyroidism can be considered a protective condition against the onset of thyroid neoplasms. Methods The study involved 1,449 patients underwent to thyroid surgery from 2010 to 2018 at the General Surgery Unit, Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Parma, Parma, Italy, presenting thyroid cancer at postoperative histological exam. Patients were divided in two groups based on the presence (Group A) or absence (Group B) of hyperfunction. All data were collected in a dedicated database and include demographic data, such as age and sex, preoperative cytology, date and type of surgery, postoperative diagnosis, characteristics of aggressiveness of the neoplasm and postoperative complications. For data analysis, a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The incidence of thyroid carcinomas was lower in patients suffering from hyperfunction compared to the incidence found in non-hyperthyroid patients, both in preoperative cytological examination and in postoperative diagnosis through histological examination. Furthermore, the tumors that have developed in patients with hyperfunction had a comparable degree of aggression and invasiveness in the two groups studied. However, we have found an equal incidence of microcarcinomas and occult carcinomas on postoperative histological examination. Postoperative complications in patients with cancer were similar, regardless of the presence or absence of hyperfunctioning thyroid disease. Conclusions Our study confirms that hyperthyroidism is a protective condition against thyroid carcinoma, but the finding of an equivalent incidence of occult carcinomas in the two groups stresses the need to perform a cytological examination in case of a nodular pathology in a hyperthyroid patient before performing a treatment.","['Hyperthyroidism', 'thyroid', 'Thyroid cancer', 'Occult Carcinoma', 'Microcarcinoma']",[],[],NaN

Nevertheless, reports regarding the influence of filter settings on MEP are sparse. Here, we compared MEP amplitudes and signal to noise ratio (SNR) using multiple high pass filter (HPF) and notch filter settings.

The four HPF settings were tested both with and without 50 Hz active notch filter. Low pass filter was kept constant at 5 kHz. Results MEP amplitudes with HPF at 10 and 20 Hz were significantly higher than at 100 Hz, regardless of the notch filter. However, SNR did not differ among HPF settings. An active notch filter significantly improved SNR. Conclusion The reduction in MEP amplitudes with HPF above 20 Hz may be due to noise reduction, since the different HPF conditions did not alter SNR. Thus, higher HPF above 50 Hz may be an option to reduce noise, the use of a notch filter may even improve SNR.

After a standardized warm-up of 1,200 m, the athletes performed a standardized training session that consisted of 2,000 m (5 × 400 m; start every 5'15"") at a best velocity then 600 m of aerobic work. Heart rate (HR) was continuously monitored during 5 × 400 m, whereas T co , thermal comfort (TC), and thermal sensation (TS) were measured before and after each 400 m. Before and after each 400 m, the swimmers were asked to flow 200 mL of cold water (1.2 ° C) or neutral (22 ° C) water packaged in standardized bottles on their face. The swimmers were asked don't drink during exercise. The velocity was significantly different between cold water and neutral water ( p   -1  ± 2.32 and 70.52 m.min -1  ± 1.73, respectively).

Because anxiety and stress can impair cognitive performance, we tested whether looming threat can similarly interfere with the process of updating representations of a statement's truthfulness. On each trial, participants saw a face paired with a personality descriptor. Each pairing was followed by a signal indicating whether the pairing was ""true"", or ""false"" (a negation of the truth of the statement), and this signal could be followed by a warning of imminent electric shock (i.e., the looming threat). As predicted, threat of shock left memory for ""true"" pairings intact, while impairing people's ability to label negated pairings as untrue. Contrary to our predictions, the pattern of errors for pairings that were negated under threat suggested that these mistakes were at least partly attributable to participants forgetting that they saw the negated information at all (rather than being driven by miscategorization of the pairings as true). Consistent with this, linear ballistic accumulator modelling suggested that this impaired recognition stemmed from weaker memory traces rather than decisional processes. We suggest that arousal due to looming threat may interfere with executive processes important for resolving competition between mutually suppressive tags of whether representations in memory are ""true"" or ""false"".","['Anxiety', 'Misinformation', 'Memory Updating', 'Memory Interference', 'Memory Re-evaluation']",[],[],NaN

Infectious diseases were less often diagnosed, while it was not clear if this was due to a decrease in prevalence or a decrease in emergency healthcare visits due to fear of COVID-19. Methods This study comprises a follow-up from a recently finished randomised controlled trial, to gain insight into the prevalence of asthma exacerbation and fear of COVID-19 in patients with moderate-severe asthma and controls in the Netherlands. Participants, patients with asthma and controls, were invited to fill out a short survey by email or post. Exacerbation frequencies until 1 July 2020 were verified with the hospitals' and general practitioners' medical records, pharmacies and patient interviews. Results In quarter 2 of 2020, mean exacerbation frequency per patient was significantly lower (χ 2 (3)=9.91, p=0.019) compared with quarter 2 in previous years. Patients with asthma were more likely to avoid (38.8%; controls, 0.0%, p Conclusion In conclusion, we found a significantly reduced asthma exacerbation frequency during COVID-19 social distancing measures compared with previous years.

Syphilis serology is imperfect and requires interpretation of multiple tests while molecular diagnostics allows for potential yes-no identification of highly infective, primary anogenital lesions. Accuracy of this testing modality has thus far been limited to small, highly selective studies. Therefore, we retrospectively assessed a large, adult population of patients with anogenital lesions seen at Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinics in Alberta, Canada who were screened for syphilis and herpes simplex (HSV) 1/2 using PCR to evaluate  Tp- PCR versus serology to diagnose primary syphilis. 114 (3.1%) of the 3,600 adult patients had at least one  Tp -PCR+ anogenital lesion with 99 (2.8%) patients having newly positive syphilis serology (new INNO-LIA positive or 4-fold RPR increase).  Tp- PCR had a sensitivity of 49.3% (95% CI 42.6-56.1) and specificity of 99.9% (99.7-100.0). Positive predictive values and negative predictive values in the study population or when corrected for provincial prevalence were 97.4% (92.5-99.5) or 0.4% (0.4-1.2) and 96.7% (96.1-97.3) or 100.0% (100.0-100.0), respectively. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were estimated at 555 (178-1733) and 0.5 (0.4-0.6), respectively. Review of all  Tp -PCR performed with or without exclusion of HSV-positive lesions resulted in no significant change in  Tp- PCR characteristics. Interestingly, 12 of the  Tp- PCR+ samples had negative serology at time of lesion sampling but became positive within our 28-day testing window. Overall, this study further supports the use of  Tp- PCR as an accurate assay to rapidly identify, treat, and prevent the spread of primary syphilis.","['Syphilis', 'Treponema pallidum', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'Molecular Diagnostic', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases (Stds)', 'Serology Diagnostic', 'Anogenital Lesions']","['Alberta Health', 'Health Research', 'Health Services', 'Conjoint Health', 'Ethics Board', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'Health', 'studies involving', 'involving human']",[],NaN

Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors are found to be effective in the treatment of primary central nervous system diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Herein, we retrospectively reported the efficacy and safety profiles of bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors in three consecutive patients with VRL. All three cases of VRL occurred in patients with pre-treated primary central nervous system lymphoma and the central nervous system was not involved at the time of VRL diagnosis. They were treated with zanubrutinib, a bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, at 160 mg twice daily orally. Rapid improvement of visual acuity and tumor control was achieved in all involved eyes of these 3 patients. Complete remission was confirmed by fundus photograph and optical coherence tomography, and the level of interleukin-10, a well-recognized biomarker for vitreoretinal lymphoma, decreased to normal in all patients. Zanubrutinib was well tolerated in all three patients, and only one adverse event of grade 3 hypertension occurred, which resolved after adjusting antihypertensive drugs. As of March 2021, these three patients have been treated with zanubrutinib for 9 months, 7 months, and 6 months, respectively, and all remained in complete remission. In conclusion, targeting bruton tyrosine kinase with zanubrutinib in vitreoretinal lymphoma is feasible and our findings can be a foundation for a paradigm shift in treatment options for this rare disease. A prospective phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib in patients with vitreoretinal lymphoma is ongoing to validate our findings (ChiCTR2000037921).","['Bruton tyrosine kinase', 'Primary central nervous system lymphoma', 'Targeted Therapy', 'Vitreoretinal Lymphoma', 'Zanubrutinib']","['Institutional Review', 'Review Board', 'Ethics Statement', 'TongRen Hospital', 'Beijing TongRen', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Hospital', 'Statement', 'Institutional']",[],NaN

It reduces the effectiveness of treatments for serious bacterial infections and thus increases the risk of fatal outcomes. Antibiotic prescriptions are often not in line with clinical evidence-based guidelines. The process of emergence of resistant bacteria can be slowed down by adherence to guidelines. Yet this adherence seems to be lacking in primary health care.  Methods and Analysis:  This pragmatic quasi-experimental study using a controlled before-after design was carried out in South-East-Lower Saxony in 2018-2020. The voluntary attendance of interactive trainings with condensed presentation of current guidelines for general practitioners (GP) on antibiotic management for urinary and respiratory tract infections is regarded as intervention. Those GP not attending the trainings constitute the control group. Data were collected via questionnaires; routine health records are provided by a statutory health insurance. The primary outcome is the proportion of (guideline-based) prescriptions in relation to the relevant ICD-10 codes as well as daily defined doses and the difference in proportion of certain prescriptions according to guidelines before and after the intervention as compared to the control group. Further outcomes are among others the subjectively perceived risk of antibiotic resistance and the attitude toward the guidelines. The questionnaires to assess this are based on theory of planned behavior (TPB) and health action process approach (HAPA). Variations over time and effects caused by measures other than WASA (Wirksamkeit von Antibiotika-Schulungen in der niedergelassenen Aerzteschaft-Effectiveness of antibiotic management training in the primary health care sector) training are taken into account by including the control group and applying interrupted time series analysis.

We evaluated the impact of age on remission induction therapy for AML. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 3,011 adult AML patients identified from a nationwide database between January 2007 and December 2011. Results Three hundred twenty-nine (10.9%) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 2,682 (89.1%) non-APL patients were analyzed. The median age was 51 years and 55% of patients were male. Six hundred twenty-three patients (21%) were at favorable risk, 1522 (51%) were at intermediate risk, and 743 (25%) were at poor risk. As the age increased, the proportion of those at favorable risk and who received induction chemotherapy decreased. After induction therapy, complete response (CR) was achieved in 81.5% (243/298) of APL and 62.4% (1,409/2,258) of non-APL patients; these rates decreased as the age increased, with an obvious decrement in those older than 60 years. The median overall survival of non-APL patients was 18.7 months, while that of APL patients was not reached, with a 75% five-year survival rate.

The 'Exercise and Depression Toolkit' was developed to help health care providers (HCP) integrate these treatment guidelines into practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate acceptability and perceived effectiveness of the toolkit in practice by HCPs working with individuals with depression. Methods A case study design was utilized. The toolkit was given to 6 HCPs to use in practice for 4 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention phone interviews were conducted, and weekly logs were provided to track use and satisfaction of interactions with individuals with depression when using the toolkit. The study was conceptually guided by a hybrid theoretical approach using the Diffusion of Innovation Theory and the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Results All HCPs used the toolkit at least once. Participants viewed their interactions when using the toolkit to be successful (considering individuals' receptiveness, its usefulness and general satisfaction.) The average success score for all participants was 5.5/7. HCPs found the toolkit to be acceptable. All participants (n = 6) viewed the toolkit as having relative advantage in helping them to discuss exercise with individuals with depression, and as relatively simple and easy to use (not complex) and adaptable to their practice needs (having trialability). Participants liked the toolkit and had mostly positive things to say about it. Participants had mixed feelings about whether changes in the people they worked with (such as mood and activity levels) could be observed (observability) and whether the toolkit changed their belief in their ability to recommend or discuss exercise (self-efficacy). Recommended dissemination strategies were adopted in promoting the toolkit. Conclusions Future work should address observability and the ability for health care providers to see other providers using it, as well as effectiveness considering outcomes for people with depression such as mood and activity changes.

Methods The expression of GRSF1 in peripheral blood was measured and analyzed in 42 septic participants and 32 healthy controls respectively by using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Clinical data were assessed by correlation analysis. In addition, GRSF1 expression was investigated in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) induced mice septic models by RT-qPCR and western blot (WB). Results The expression of GRSF1 expression in septic patients in the first day of electronic intensive care unit (eICU) administration was significantly lower in comparison with HC. Further analysis showed GRSF1 expression was strongly related to the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Low expression of GRSF1 predicted high mortality within 24 hours in septic patients and in CLP-induced mice. Conclusions Decreased expression of GRSF1 was significantly correlated with high mortality in septic patients, and also in experimental septic mice. The GRSF1 protein may be a potential prognostic biomarker in sepsis.","['Sepsis', 'Prognosis', 'Biomarker', 'G-Rich Sequence Factor 1 (Grsf1)']",[],[],NaN

However, how circRNAs regulate the progression of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) remains unclear. Methods In the present study, circRNA microarray analyses were performed with HCC tissues to identify circRNAs that are differentially expressed. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was conducted on HCC cell lines and tissues, and circ0097009 was found to be significantly upregulated. The functions of circ0097009 in HCC were investigated by a series of experiments, including cell proliferation, invasion, and mouse xenograft assays. Additionally, luciferase assays and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were used to explore the interactions of circ0097009, microRNA-1261 (miR-1261), and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) in HCC. Results Microarray analysis and qRT-PCR verified that circRNA, circ0097009, was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of circ0097009 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. Luciferase reporter assays showed that circ0097009 and SLC7A11 directly bound to miR-1261. Subsequent experiments showed that circ0097009 and SLC7A11 reciprocally regulated their expression via miR-1261 sponging by circ0097009. Conclusions Circ0097009 acts as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate the expression of SLC7A11, a key regulator of cancer cell ferroptosis, by sponging miR-1261 in HCC. Circ0097009 may be used as a diagnostic biomarker for HCC and as a potential target for HCC therapy.","['Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Circular Rnas', 'Competitive Endogenous Rnas', 'Slc7a11', 'Mir-1261']",[],[],NaN

Methods:  Clinical and laboratory data of adult COVID-19 patients in a single center in China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve and cox regression were adopted to analyze the association between respiratory alkalosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.  Results:  Of 230 adult COVID-19 patients, 66 patients (28.7%) had respiratory alkalosis on admission. Of 66 patients, the median age was 53 years old (range, 21-84 years), and 43 (65.2%) were female. Compared with those without respiratory alkalosis, patients with respiratory alkalosis were significantly older ( P  = 0.002), had a higher proportion of female ( P  = 0.004), and showed higher ratios of underlying diseases including hypertension ( P  = 0.023) and cardiovascular disease ( P  = 0.028).

The use of motion-capture technologies to improve performance or reduce injury risks in the area of kinesiology is becoming widespread. The combination of motion accuracy and sound quality feedback has the potential of becoming an important aid in violin learning. In this study, we evaluate motion-capture and sound-quality analysis technologies developed inside the context of the TELMI, a technology-enhanced music learning project. We analyzed the sound and bow motion of 50 participants with no prior violin experience while learning to produce a stable sound in the violin. Participants were divided into two groups: the experimental group ( N  = 24) received real-time visual feedback both on kinematics and sound quality, while participants in the control group ( N  = 26) practiced without any type of external help. An additional third group of violin experts performed the same task for comparative purposes ( N  = 15). After the practice session, all groups were evaluated in a transfer phase without feedback. At the practice phase, the experimental group improved their bowing kinematics in comparison to the control group, but this was at the expense of impairing the sound quality of their performance. At the retention phase, the experimental group showed better results in sound quality, especially concerning control of sound dynamics. Besides, we found that the expert group improved the stability of their sound while using the technology.

Aims:  This study aimed to evaluate whether malnutrition, as defined by these three methods, can be used to predict complications in esophageal cancer (EC) patients after esophagectomy.  Methods:  We performed a single center, observational cohort study that included 360 EC patients undergoing esophagectomy from December 2014 to November 2019 at Daping Hospital in China. The prevalence of malnutrition in the study population was prospectively defined using the PG-SGA (≥9 defined malnutrition), and retrospectively defined using the ESPEN 2015 and the GLIM. The prevalence of malnutrition and association with postoperative complications were compared in parallel for the three methods.  Results:  The prevalence of malnutrition before surgery was 23.1% (83/360), 12.2% (44/360), and 33.3% (120/360) in the study population, as determined by the PG-SGA, the ESPEN 2015 and the GLIM, respectively.

Here we aimed to determine a specific glycolysis-associated risk model to predict THCA patients' survival. We also explored the interaction between this signature and tumor immune microenvironment and performed drug screening to identify specific drugs targeting the glycolysis-associated signature. Six genes (CHST6, POM121C, PPFIA4, STC1, TGFBI, and FBP2) comprised the specific model, which was an independent prognostic indicator in THCA patients determined by univariate, LASSO and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed the excellent clinical performance of the prognostic signature. According to the specific gene signature, patients were categorized into high- and low-risk subgroups. The high-risk group was characterized by decreased immune score and elevated tumor purity, as well as worser survival prognosis compared to the low-risk group. We also validated the expression of these genes in clinical samples and  in-vitro  experiments. Lastly, we identified potential drugs targeting the glycolysis-associated signature.

The aim of this study was to examine the extent of specific HRCT patterns in IPF and determine whether they correlate with clinical features, pulmonary function tests (PFT), and survival. Methods Both the presence and extent of specific HRCT patterns, such as traction bronchiectasis, honeycombing, architectural distortion, reticulation, emphysema, and ground glass opacity, in 129 HRCT examinations were scored semi-quantitatively in three zones of each lung. HRCT examinations were also re-classified according to the 2011 and 2018 international statements. Correlations were calculated between the scores of specific HRCT patterns, clinical features, PFT, and patient survival. Results The extent of traction bronchiectasis was found to be an independent risk factor of shortened survival (HR 1.227, P=0.001). Patients with a possible usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern had a better median survival than the patients with a definite UIP pattern (61  vs.  37 months, P=0.026).

Current guidelines do not endorse routine surveillance imaging due to lack of evidence supporting a survival benefit. With current first-line palliative chemotherapy options, it is unclear whether surveillance allows for early detection of asymptomatic disease and therefore an improved opportunity to offer chemotherapy to fit patients. We sought to describe patterns of surveillance of resected pancreatic cancer at British Columbia (BC) Cancer and determine whether utilization of computerized tomography (CT) scans affected likelihood of receiving palliative chemotherapy at the time of recurrence. Methods A retrospective review was completed to identify patients treated at BC Cancer centres between 2010-2016 who had undergone curative intent resection and received at least one cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. Information was collected on baseline characteristics, imaging scans done between adjuvant chemotherapy and recurrence, and receipt of palliative chemotherapy. Two cohorts were defined based on number of scans done between completion of adjuvant chemotherapy and recurrence: those with only 1 scan were defined as ""symptomatic"" recurrences and patients who had undergone more than 1 scan were considered ""surveillance"" recurrences. Results In total, 142 patients were included of which 115 (81%) patients developed recurrence. There were 22 patients (19%) in the ""symptomatic"" cohort and 93 patients (81%) in the ""surveillance"" cohort. Median time to recurrence 274 days (9.1 months) in the symptomatic cohort compared to 471 days (15.7 months) in the surveillance group.

Genomic studies of LUSC are challenged by their low tumor cell content. We sought to define the genomic landscape and evolutionary trajectories of metastatic LUSC combining nuclei-flow sorting and whole exome sequencing. Methods Five patients with primary LUSC and six matched metastases were investigated. Tumor nuclei were sorted based on ploidy and expression of cytokeratin to enrich for tumor cells for whole exome sequencing. Results Flow-sorting increased the mean tumor purity from 26% (range, 12-50%) to 73% (range, 42-93%). Overall, primary LUSCs and their matched metastases shared a median of 79% (range, 67-85%) of copy number aberrations (CNAs) and 74% (range, 65-94%) of non-synonymous mutations, including in tumor suppressor genes such as  TP53 . Furthermore, the ploidy of the tumors remained unchanged between primary and metastasis in 4/5 patients over time. We found differences in the mutational signatures of shared mutations compared to the private mutations in the primary or metastasis. Conclusions Our results demonstrate a close genomic relationship between primary LUSCs and their matched metastases, suggesting late dissemination of the metastases from the primary tumors during tumor evolution.","['Lung cancer', 'Heterogeneity', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Metastasis', 'Whole Exome Sequencing', 'Tumor Evolution', 'Flow Sorting']",[],[],NaN

The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study."," Introduction:  Disposal of unused medications through environmentally unsafe routes is common in Indonesia. The lack of awareness of the impact of improperly disposed of medications is a significant contributing factor. The objectives of this study were to identify factors associated with lack of awareness of the impact of improperly disposed of unused medications and to assess the associations of awareness with medication disposal practices among the general population in Indonesia.  Patients and methods:  An observational cross-sectional survey was conducted using nonprobability sampling in Bandung, Indonesia, from November 2017 to January 2018 among respondents who were older than 18 years, had used any medication in the past, were literate, and had signed an informed consent document. Disposal practices and awareness regarding the impact of improperly disposed of unused medications were collected using an online- and a paper-based pre-validated questionnaire. The paper-based questionnaires were distributed to respondents in public places such as city center, markets, and religious places. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess associations of sociodemographic and other related factors with a lack of awareness. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported.  Results:  Of 497 participating respondents, 433 and 64 respondents filled an online- or a paper-based questionnaire, respectively. Most respondents were female, aged between 18 and 30 years, and students/university students. Of 497 respondents, more than half (53.1%) were not aware that improper medication disposal could harm the environment and population health. Most respondents (79.5%) had never received information about proper medication disposal practices. The education level, the number of stored medications at home, and previous education about medication disposal practices were significantly associated with awareness of proper practices. In the multivariate analysis, only those with previous education about medication disposal practices were less likely to report a lack of awareness (OR: 0.043; 95% CI: 0.02-0.09). Respondents with a lack of awareness tended to dispose of their unused medications in the garbage or shared them with friends or relatives.  Conclusion:  There is a clear need to increase awareness of the importance of proper medication disposal practices, in particular among the student population of Bandung city, Indonesia. Healthcare providers can play an important role by educating this specific population on the proper disposal of unused medications.","['Awareness', 'risk factors', 'Pharmaceutical Waste', 'Unused Medications', 'Medication Disposal Practices']","['Universitas Padjadjaran', 'Health Research', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Indonesia', 'human participants', 'Committee']",['1155/UN6.'],NaN

Methods We retrospectively analyzed 91 cases of proximal hypospadias, who had undergone either one-stage or two-stage urethroplasty. Comparisons between the two groups were made based on age, glans diameter, the length of the urethral defect, and the rate of complications. Results There was no significant difference in age at surgery, glans diameter, and the length of urethral defect between the two groups. In the one-stage group, 18 cases of urinary fistula and one case each of glans dehiscence, urethral diverticulum, and urethral diverticulum with concurrent glans dehiscence, were reported. All patients were treated using urinary fistula repair or urethroplasty. In the novel two-stage group, no cases of urinary fistula were reported after the secondary urethroplasty. However, 4 cases showed dehiscence at the glans, 2 were treated through reoperation but the 2 other 2 patients reoperation. The success rate was 62.50% and 88.57% in the one-stage and two-stage groups, respectively (P Conclusions Two-stage urethroplasty using a tubularized urethral plate and TPIF can significantly reduce the incidence of urethral fistula of the proximal hypospadias with severe chordee. However, it may increase the number of operations that need to be performed on children who do not need staged surgery.

However, the biological role and clinical significance of TP73-AS1 in pancreatic cancer (PC) remain unclear. Aim To investigate the role of TP73-AS1 in the growth and metastasis of PC. Methods The expression of lncRNA TP73-AS1, miR-128-3p, and  GOLM1  in PC tissues and cells was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The bioinformatics prediction software ENCORI was used to predict the putative binding sites of miR-128-3p. The regulatory roles of TP73-AS1 and miR-128-3p in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities were verified by Cell Counting Kit-8, wound-healing, and transwell assays, as well as flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The interactions among TP73-AS1, miR-128-3p, and GOLM1 were explored by bioinformatics prediction, luciferase assay, and Western blot. Results The expression of TP73-AS1 and miRNA-128-3p was dysregulated in PC tissues and cells. High TP73-AS1 expression was correlated with a poor prognosis. TP73-AS1 silencing inhibited PC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion  in vitro  as well as suppressed tumor growth  in vivo . Mechanistically, TP73-AS1 was validated to promote PC progression through GOLM1 upregulation by competitively binding to miR-128-3p.

Research participation by clinicians, however, is declining. Given the link between research during medical school and future research output, promotion of medical student research is one avenue by which this shortage can be addressed. Student research attitudes and participation in Australia are not well-documented in the literature. This study therefore aims to investigate research practices, motivators, and barriers amongst Australian medical students in order to determine whether there is a need for further integration of research within Australian medical school curriculums. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used to explore research experience and attitudes, as well as the enablers and barriers to research amongst students enrolled in all years of the five-year medical course at Monash University. A questionnaire was created by combining questions from several surveys on medical student research and comprised Likert scales, multiple choice options and free-text responses assessing research experience, attitudes, motivators, and barriers. Results Seven hundred and four respondents (69.4% female; survey response rate 36.7%) reported variable research experience and interest. Less than half of the cohort (n = 296; 44.9%) had contributed to a research project. Increasing employability for specialty training programs was the primary motivating factor (n = 345; 51.9%) for pursuing research, with only 20.5% (n = 136) citing an interest in academia as a motivator. Time constraints (n = 460; 65.3%) and uncertainty surrounding how to find research opportunities (n = 449; 63.8%) were the most common barriers to research. Conclusions Medical students at Monash University are interested in but have limited experience with research. Students are, however, primarily motivated by the prospect of increasing employability for specialist training; medical schools should therefore focus on encouraging intrinsic motivation for pursuing research. Greater integration of research education and opportunities within medical school curricula may also be required to provide students with the skills necessary to both pursue research and practice evidence-based medicine.","['MD', 'Research Training', 'Research Education', 'Clinician-scientist', 'Medical Student Research', 'Physician-scientist', 'Research Motivation', 'Research Barriers', 'Research Experiences', 'Research Attitudes']",[],[],NaN

In an increasingly globalized world where technological advances, multi-national research collaborations, and pandemics are creating ethical dilemmas that transcend national borders, coordination and the joining of efforts among NECs are key. The purpose of this study is to take stock of the current NEC landscape, their varying roles and missions, and the range of bioethical topics on which they deliberated since their inception. Methods Data on the availability, functions, and ethical deliberations (publications) of NECs globally were gathered through a systematic search of NEC websites and through contacts known to the authors. The search was conducted in English, French, and Spanish. The data abstraction was done in Excel and included the NEC's country, region, functions, and deliberations on bioethical issues. Deliberation topics were classified into thematic categories through an iterative process of regrouping to arrive at the main set of themes. Results 124 NECs in 100 countries were identified. 44% of the NECs are in Europe and 47% are in high-income countries. Out of the 1108 retrieved publications, 40% were on bioethics in the context of research, followed by the clinic (28%) and public health issues (22%).

Despite this, current EHR use is minimal in UK RCTs, in part due to ongoing concerns about the utility (reliability, completeness, accuracy) and accessibility of the data. The aim of this manuscript is to document the process, timelines and challenges of the application process to help improve the service both for the applicants and data holders. Methods This is a qualitative paper providing a descriptive narrative from one UK clinical trials unit (MRC CTU at UCL) on the experience of two trial teams' application process to access data from three large English national datasets: National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) and NHS Digital to establish themes for discussion. The underpinning reason for applying for the data was to compare EHRs with data collected through case report forms in two RCTs, Add-Aspirin (ISRCTN 74358648) and PATCH (ISRCTN 70406718). Results The Add-Aspirin trial, which had a pre-planned embedded sub-study to assess EHR, received data from NCRAS 13 months after the first application. In the PATCH trial, the decision to request data was made whilst the trial was recruiting. The study received data after 8 months from NICOR and 15 months for NHS Digital following final application submission. This concluded in May 2020. Prior to application submission, significant time and effort was needed particularly in relation to the PATCH trial where negotiations over consent and data linkage took many years. Conclusions Our experience demonstrates that data access can be a prolonged and complex process. This is compounded if multiple data sources are required for the same project. This needs to be factored in when planning to use EHR within RCTs and is best considered prior to conception of the trial.

Materials and Methods:  Fifteen patients with BA, 38 patients with AIS, and 36 patients with MIA were included in this study. Clinical data and CT imaging features of the three lesions were evaluated. Texture features were extracted from the thin-section unenhanced CT images using Artificial Intelligence Kit software. Then, multivariate logistic regression analysis based on selected texture features was employed to distinguish BA from AIS/MIA. Receiver operating characteristics curves were performed to determine the diagnostic performance of the features.  Results:  By comparison with AIS/MIA, significantly different CT imaging features of BA included nodule type, tumor size, and pseudo-cavitation sign. Among them, pseudo-cavitation sign had a moderate diagnostic value for distinguishing BA and AIS/MIA (AUC: 0.741 and 0.708, respectively). Further, a total of 396 quantitative texture features were extracted. After comparation, the top six texture features showing the most significant difference between BA and AIS or MIA were chosen. The ROC results showed that these key texture features had a high diagnostic value for differentiating BA from AIS or MIA, among which the value of a comprehensive model with six selected texture features was the highest (AUC: 0.977 or 0.976, respectively) for BA and AIS or MIA. These results indicated that texture analyses can effectively improve the efficacy of thin-section unenhanced CT for discriminating BA from AIS/MIA.  Conclusion:  CT texture analysis can effectively improve the efficacy of thin-section unenhanced CT for discriminating BA from AIS/MIA, which has a potential clinical value and helps pathologist and clinicians to make diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","['Lung adenocarcinoma', 'Texture analysis', 'computed tomography', 'Ground Glass Nodule', 'Bronchiolar Adenoma']","['Daping Hospital', 'Army Medical', 'Medical University', 'Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Chongqing']",[],NaN

This system identified three patient groups prioritized for additional care engagement: (1) individuals diagnosed with HIV, but not receiving treatment (the treatment gap group); (2) individuals receiving treatment for >6 months with a detectable viral load (the virologic failure group); and (3) patients lost to follow-up (LTFU). Methods The implementation strategies included three training sessions, covering system logistics, case discussions, and development of maintenance goals. These strategies were conducted within 30 HIV public healthcare services (May 2019 to April 2020). After each training session, professionals shared their experiences with CCM at regional meetings. Before and after the intervention, providers were invited to answer 23 items from the normalization process theory questionnaire (online) to understand contextual factors. The mean item scores were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The RE-AIM implementation science framework (evaluating reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) was used to evaluate the integration of the CCM. Results In the study, 47 (19.3%) of 243 patients with a treatment gap initiated treatment, 456 (49.1%) of 928 patients with virologic failure achieved suppression, and 700 of 1552 (45.1%) LTFU patients restarted treatment. Strategies for the search and reengagement of patients were developed and shared. Providers recognized the positive effects of CCM on their work and how it modified existing activities (3.7 vs. 4.4, p Conclusion Implementing CCM helped identify patients requiring more intensive attention. This intervention led to changes in providers' perceptions of CCM and care and management processes, which increased the number of patients engaged across the care continuum and improved outcomes.",[],"['São Paulo', 'Ethical Committee', 'Ethics statement', 'protocol number', 'study procedures', 'ethics committee', 'Paulo', 'Ensaios Clínicos', 'Ethical', 'University']",['3.270.762).'],NaN

After a full reading and conceptual understanding of the articles included in the review, a content analysis was carried out to figure out the ethical challenges of nurses during the pandemic. Accordingly, the ethical challenges of nurses were categorized into three areas, namely, nurses’ safety, role and moral distress, resource allocation, and the nurse–client relationship. Theme 1: Nursesâ€™ Safety, Role, and Moral Distress Under this theme, we have included five articles. Accordingly, in the fight against COVID-19, the safety of nurses is a pressing ethical issue, as they were asked to work under circumstances that put them at risk to their overall health and well-being. The lack of full protection for nurses across the health industry raises ethical questions about the extent of their duty, lack of personal protective equipment, and risk of failure of personal protective equipment. 7, 9, 12 Significant numbers of nurses were also experiencing moral distress because they were under prolonged pressure to maintain the resources needed to provide safe and high-quality nursing care. 4, 8 Nurses were also subjected to run various roles in case such a question was raised, which duty belongs to whom. 12 Theme 2: Resource Allocation Another decision demanding concern is the fair allocation of scarce resources. Based on the findings from six articles, different views have been given on how resource allocation was an ethical issue during the outbreak. Health resources are limited, from the very beginning, let alone in COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, emergency nurses are usually engaged in prioritizing patients. They are passing through blurred decisions on issues, such as which patients are most likely to get into a scarce intensive care unit bed, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Similarly, the issue of scarce personnel protective equipment for nurses is another burning ethical topic as stated by different authors. 4, 8â€“11, 13 Theme 3: Nurseâ€“Client Relationship Six articles have focused on the ethical challenges of the triangular relationship of nurseâ€“patient and family relationship. COVID-19 has also put the client-centred approach in question, which brings another ethical and professional crisis. During the pandemic, many people are dying in isolation and ICU separated from their families and even without getting the opportunities to have end-of-life-conversations. Unfortunately, families were also quarantined if they had any contact with the dying person. 8, 9 During the pandemic, in USA and Australia, some private hospital nurses were out of duty. 4 Jia et al have also mentioned some ethical challenges including insufficient response to urgency requirements of the situation. Also, interviewees reported that some staff worked slowly while rescuing patients and delivering other nursing activities that reflected a low sense of moral responsibility. 12","Currently, nurses are in the middle of the battle against COVID-19. The pandemic situation has put these professionals against various ethical challenges. Therefore, this review aims to identify the main ethical challenges faced by nurses during COVID-19 pandemic. This integrative review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols. All English version studies that reported ethical challenges of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, from November 9, 2019, to November 9, 2020, were eligible for the review. The electronic databases used were PubMed, Google Scholar, JURN, Cochrane Library E-Journals, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL. Accordingly, 8 articles were included for further analysis and synthesis. The ethical challenges of nurses were categorized into three thematic areas: nurses' safety, role and moral distress, resource allocation, and client-nurse relationship. Thus, the lack of full protection of nurses across the health industry has raised ethical questions such as the extent of their duty, scarce resources, and the failure of personal protective equipment. In connection, a significant number of nurses were also facing moral distress because of prolonged pressure to maintain the resources needed to provide safe and high-quality nursing care. Furthermore, nurses were challenged to restrict many COVID-19 patients from having end-of-life communication with their families. Overall, nurses are still facing various ethical challenges across the globe. Therefore, it is important to mobilize resources and invest in nurses to bring long-lasting solutions.","['Ethical Issues', 'Nursing Ethics', 'Covid-19']","['Ethical Challenges', 'Nurses', 'Ethical', 'Challenges', 'moral distress', 'challenges faced', 'resource allocation', 'Pandemic', 'articles', 'Theme']",['of'],NaN

We aimed to observe the effect of hsa-miR-33-5p on the apoptosis of breast cancer cells and to explore its regulatory relationship with selenoprotein T (SelT).  Methods:  RT-qPCR was used to examine the expression of hsa-miR-33-5p and SelT both in breast cancer tissues and cells. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with hsa-miR-33-5p mimics or si-SelT. Then, a flow cytometry assay was carried out to examine the apoptosis of cells. Furthermore, SelT and apoptosis-related proteins including caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, Bax, and Bcl-2 were detected  via  RT-qPCR and western blot. A luciferase reporter assay was utilized for assessing whether SelT was targeted by hsa-miR-33-5p.  Results:  Downregulated hsa-miR-33-5p was found both in breast cancer tissues and cells. After its overexpression, MCF-7 cell apoptosis was significantly promoted. Furthermore, our data showed that miR-33-5p elevated apoptosis-related protein expression in MCF-7 cells. Contrary to hsa-miR-33-5p, SelT was upregulated both in breast cancer tissues and cells. SelT expression was significantly inhibited by hsa-miR-33-5p overexpression. The luciferase reporter assay confirmed that SelT was a direct target of hsa-miR-33-5p. SelT overexpression could ameliorate the increase in apoptosis induced by hsa-miR-33-5p mimics.  Conclusion:  Our findings revealed that hsa-miR-33-5p, as a potential therapeutic target, could accelerate breast cancer cell apoptosis.","['Apoptosis', 'Breast cancer', 'therapeutic target', 'Selenoprotein T', 'Hsa-Mir-33-5p']","['Cancer Hospital', 'Linyi Cancer', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'Hospital', 'approved']",[],NaN

As there is currently no requirement to use companion diagnostic assays for PD-L1 testing in Germany different clones are used in daily routine. While the correlation of staining results has been tested in various entities, there is no data for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) so far.  Methods:  We tested five different PD-L1 clones (SP263, SP142, E1L3N, 22-8, 22C3) on primary HNSCC tumor tissue of 75 patients in the form of tissue microarrays. Stainings of both immune and tumor cells were then assessed and quantified by pathologists to simulate real-world routine diagnostics. The results were analyzed descriptively and the resulting staining pattern across patients was further investigated by principal component analysis and non-negative matrix factorization clustering.  Results:  Percentages of positive immune and tumor cells varied greatly. Both the resulting combined positive score as well as the eligibility for certain checkpoint inhibitor regimens was therefore strongly dependent on the choice of the antibody. No relevant co-clustering and low similarity of relative staining patterns across patients was found for the different antibodies.  Conclusions:  Performance of different diagnostic anti PD-L1 antibody clones in HNSCC is less robust and interchangeable compared to reported data from other tumor entities. Determination of PD-L1 expression is critical for therapeutic decision making and may be aided by back-to-back testing of different PD-L1 clones.","['PD-L1', 'Harmonization', 'Protein Quantitation', 'Hnscc', 'Tma', 'Checkpoint Inhibitors', 'Therapy Prediction']","['Ratzeburger Allee', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethikkommission der', 'Ethics Statement', 'Luebeck Ethics', 'Lübeck', 'der Universität', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants']",[],NaN

We therefore conducted a retrospective study to provide additional data on the outcome of patients with metastatic lung NETs submitted to front line SSAs. Research design and methods Patients with metastatic lung NET treated with first line SSA-monotherapy (octreotide or lanreotide) in two different reference Institutions were reviewed. Outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) overall survival (OS), overall response rate and safety. We also explored prognostic factors associated with PFS. Methods The outcome of consecutive patients (pts) with metastatic lung NETs, who underwent first-line treatment with SSAs, recruited from 2014 on 2019 in two Italian reference Institutions, was retrospectively evaluated. Results Thirty-one patients entered the study: 14 (45.2%) with typical and 17 (54.8%) atypical carcinoid. Six patients (19.4%) had a carcinoid syndrome. 60.0% of patients had Ki-67 ≤ 10%. Two (6.5%) patients obtained a partial response, 24 (77.4%) disease stabilization while 5 (16.1%) had progressive disease. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 28.6 months, median overall survival (OS) was not attained. Ki-67 ≤ 10%, typical carcinoid histotype and non-functioning disease, were associated with a non-significant PFS prolongation. PFS in patients with atypical carcinoids and in those with Ki-67 >10% was greater than 19 months. Conclusions The long PFS and OS obtained in this case series suggest that SSAs could be effective as first line approach in the management of patients with progressive, metastatic pulmonary NET.","['Somatostatin analog', 'Prognostic factor', 'Carcinoid Syndrome', 'Distant Metastases', 'Lung Carcinoid']","['European Institute', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'ethics committee', 'Oncology', 'Statement', 'European', 'Institute']",[],NaN

The results of this study will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications.," Introduction To date, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the cornerstone of obstructive sleep apnoea treatment. CPAP data describing residual sleep-disordered breathing events (ie, the CPAP-measured apnoea-hypopnoea indices (AHI-CPAP flow )) is difficult to interpret because it is an entirely different metric than the polysomnography (PSG) measured AHI gold standard (AHI-PSG gold ). Moreover, manufacturer definitions for apnoea and hypopnoea are not only different from those recommended for PSG scoring, but also different between manufacturers. In the context of CPAP initiation and widespread telemedicine at home to facilitate sleep apnoea care, there is a need for concrete evidence that AHI-CPAP flow  can be used as a surrogate for AHI-PSG gold . Methods and analysis No published systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) has compared the accuracy of AHI-CPAP flow  against AHI-PSG gold  and the primary objective of this study is therefore to do so using published data. The secondary objectives are to similarly evaluate other sleep disordered breathing indices and to perform subgroup analyses focusing on the inclusion/exclusion of central apnoea patients, body mass index levels, CPAP device brands, pressure titration modes, use of a predetermined and fixed pressure level or not, and the impact of a 4% PSG desaturation criteria versus 3% PSG on accuracy. The Preferred Reporting Items for SRMA protocols statement guided study design. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies of adult patients (≥18 years old) treated by a CPAP device will be included. The CPAP intervention and PSG comparator must be performed synchronously. PSGs must be scored manually and follow the American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines (2007 AASM criteria or more recent). To assess the risk of bias in each study, the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool will be used.

Methods The CONCEPTION study was a cohort, multidisciplinary study conducted at Conception University Hospital, in France, from March 17th to May 11th, 2020. Our study included all adult patients who underwent minor surgery in one of the seven surgical departments of our hospital: urology, digestive, plastic, gynecological, otolaryngology, gynecology or maxillofacial surgery. Preoperative self-isolation, clinical assessment using a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and chest CT scan performed the day before surgery were part of our active prevention strategy. The main outcome was the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection within 21 days following surgery. The COVID-19 status of patients after discharge was updated during the postoperative consultation and to ensure the accuracy of data, all patients were contacted again by telephone. Results A total of 551 patients from six different specialized surgical Departments in our tertiary care center were enrolled in our study. More than 99% (546/551) of included patients underwent a complete preoperative Covid-19 screening including RT-PCR testing and chest CT scan upon admission to the Hospital. All RT-PCR tests were negative and in 12 cases (2.2%), preoperative chest CT scans detected pulmonary lesions consistent with the diagnosis criteria for COVID-19. No scheduled surgery was postponed. One patient (0.2%) developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection 20 days after a renal transplantation. No readmission or COVID-19 -related death within 30 days from surgery was recorded. Conclusions Minor surgery remained safe in the COVID-19 Era, as long as all appropriate protective measures were implemented.

Aberrant glycosylation is involved in the malignant behavior of cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to reveal glycan profiles unique to relapsed TNBC patients. Methods Thirty TNBC patients who did not undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy but postoperative standard adjuvant therapy from 2009 through 2016 at Juntendo Hospital were investigated. TNBC cells were resected from primary breast cancer sections of formalin-fixed surgical specimens using laser-assisted microdissection. The binding intensities of the extracted glycoproteins to 45 lectins were quantified using lectin microarray and compared between relapsed and non-relapsed patients. Immunohistochemical staining with TJA-II lectin in specimen sections was performed. Results Five patients relapsed during the follow-up (range 37-123 months). Lectin microarray analysis revealed that 7 out of 45 lectins showed significant differences in binding intensity between the relapsed and the non-relapsed group. TJA-II, ACA, WFA, and BPL showed stronger binding in the relapsed group. PNGase F treatment of TNBC cell lysates suggested that TJA-II and ACA bind O-glycans. TJA-II staining of tissue sections revealed strong binding to cell surface membranes and to the cytoplasm of TNBC cells, but not to other types of cells. Significantly more TNBC cells were stained in tissue sections from relapsed than non-relapsed patients. Conclusions TNBC cells from relapsed patients showed a unique lectin reactivity, with higher levels of TJA-II (also WFA and BPL) binding than in non-relapsed patients.

This can lead to increased complications, including antibacterial resistance. We aim to analyze risk factors for inappropriate antibiotic prescription in these patients and describe possible complications arising from their use. Methods The SEMI-COVID-19 Registry is a multicenter, retrospective patient cohort. Patients with antibiotic were divided into two groups according to appropriate or inappropriate prescription, depending on whether the patient fulfill any criteria for its use. Comparison was made by means of multilevel logistic regression analysis. Possible complications of antibiotic use were also identified. Results Out of 13,932 patients, 3047 (21.6%) were prescribed no antibiotics, 6116 (43.9%) were appropriately prescribed antibiotics, and 4769 (34.2%) were inappropriately prescribed antibiotics.

Moreover, the incidence of potentially fatal conditions such as acute type A aortic dissection seems to have decreased since the pandemic began, whereas the number of cases of chronic ascending aortic dissections dramatically increased. We present two patients whose management has been affected by the exceptional sanitary situation we are dealing with.  Case report:  A 70-year-old man with chest pain and an aortic regurgitation murmur had his cardiac workup delayed (4 months) because of sanitary restrictions. He was then diagnosed with chronic type A aortic dissection and underwent urgent replacement of ascending aorta and aortic root. The delay in surgical treatment made the intervention technically challenging because the ascending aorta grew up to 80 mm inducing strong adhesions and chronic inflammation. The second case report concerns a 68-year-old woman with right lower-limb pain who was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. However, a CT scan to exclude a pulmonary embolism could not be realized until 5 months later because of sanitary restrictions. When she eventually got the CT scan, it fortuitously showed a chronic dissection of the ascending aorta. She underwent urgent surgery, and the intervention was challenging because of adhesions and severe inflammation.  Conclusion:  Delayed treatment due to sanitary restrictions related to COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on the management of potentially life-threatening conditions including type A aortic dissection. We should remain careful to avoid COVID-19 also hitting patients who are not infected with the virus.","['Aortic Surgery', 'Ascending Aorta', 'Chronic Aortic Dissection', 'Delayed Management', 'Covid−19']","['Statement Written', 'Ethics Statement', 'Written informed', 'informed consent', 'potentially identifiable', 'identifiable images', 'data included', 'Statement', 'Written', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

We found that Rgmb deficiency significantly altered the diversity of gut microbiota and also induced dysbiosis. In sharp contrast to the balanced distribution of various bacteria in control mice,  Prevotellaceae  was almost exhausted in Rgmb-deficient mice under both basal and inflammatory conditions. Correlation analysis indicated that  Prevotellaceae  was negatively associated with inflammation in Rgmb-deficient mice with colitis.

Radical debridement interferes with the important anatomical function of the chest wall. We report a case of chest wall NSTI that was successfully managed with early diagnosis and serial debridement. Presentation of case A 43-year-old, previously healthy woman presented with severe malaise and worsening right axillary pain. She was severely lethargic and had a painful, large, pale lesion with surrounding erythema of the right chest and trunk. Computed tomography revealed NSTI, with diffuse soft tissue inflammation extending from the axilla to the lower abdomen. There was no obvious entry portal. Prompt surgical drainage was established. Group A streptococcus infection was diagnosed. During her 3-month postoperative course, she underwent four more surgeries, including two debridements. This treatment proved successful and avoided the need for complicated muscle flap reconstruction. She was discharged on postoperative day 109. Discussion Group A streptococcus can cause NSTI even in immunocompetent patients without an entry portal. Radical debridement is recommended for infection control. Preserving anatomical chest wall function, however, is also important. Serial debridement with close follow-up solved the problem in this patient. Conclusions Serial debridement with close follow-up enabled to avoid large tissue deficits and complicated reconstruction in the case of NSTI of the chest wall.","['Group A Streptococcus', 'Chest Wall', 'Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infection', 'Serial Debridement']",[],[],NaN

The ethics committee waived the requirement of written informed consent for participation."," Background In patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/premenopausal breast cancer, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs (LHRHas) are used as standard endocrine treatment. Based on previous clinical studies, 1-month formulations are recommended in most breast cancer treatment guidelines, but long-acting formulations facilitate reductions in side effects and patient discomfort caused by frequent administration. However, few efficacy studies have been conducted on 6-month formulations. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 6-month formulations of LHRHas. Methods This retrospective study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2019 and involved premenopausal patients with HR+ breast cancer administered 6-month LHRHas as adjuvant treatment after surgery, and those previously administered chemotherapy or other LHRHa types were excluded. Patients' estradiol (E2) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were measured before surgery, and their E2 levels were also measured at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months at periodic postsurgical examinations. Results A total of 228 patients were included, and the median patient age was 44 (range, 25-54) years. The mean serum E2 and FSH levels before surgery were 69.7 (range, 4-683) pg/mL and 7.3 (range, 0.4-88.9) mIU/mL, respectively, whereas the mean serum E2 level monitored at intervals during the 6-month LHRHa administration was 5.5 (range, 4.0-52) pg/mL. No women menstruated during the follow-up period after the LHRHas administration, and the E2 levels were less than 30 pg/mL in all patients except one. Conclusions The 6-month LHRHa formulation adequately suppressed ovarian function in premenopausal patients with HR+ breast cancer. This indicates that long-acting LHRHas can be effectively used for patient convenience and that there is high compliance with long-term use.","['Breast neoplasms', 'Endocrine Therapy', 'Leuprolide Acetate', 'Premenopausal', 'Hormonal Receptor Positive']","['Medical Center', 'Asan Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'institutional review', 'review board', 'Seoul', 'Korea']",['2017-1341).'],NaN

The problem is truly a public health issue, affecting many and with serious consequences. The global burden of disease-agenda calls for effective interventions with lasting effects that have the potential to improve the mental health of young adults. In this study we aimed to determine whether yoga, a popular and widely available mind-body practice, can improve student mental health.  Methods  We performed a randomised controlled trial with 202 healthy university students in the Oslo area. The participants were assigned to a yoga group or waitlist control group in a 1:1 ratio by a simple online randomisation program. The intervention group was offered 24 yoga sessions over 12 weeks. Measurements were taken at week 0 (baseline), week 12 (post-intervention), and week 24 (follow-up). The primary outcome was psychological distress assessed by the HSCL-25 questionnaire. Analysis was performed based on the intention to treat-principle.  Results  Between 24 January 2017, and 27 August 2017, we randomly assigned 202 students to a yoga intervention group (n = 100), or waitlist control group (n = 102). Compared with the control group, the yoga participants demonstrated a significant reduction in distress symptoms both at post-intervention (adjusted difference in the mean change −0.15, 95% CI −0.26 to −0.03, p = 0.0110) and follow-up (adjusted difference in the mean change −0.18, 95% CI −0.29 to −0.06, p = 0.0025). Sleep quality also improved at post-intervention and follow-up. No adverse events were reported.  Conclusions  Our findings suggest that yoga has a moderately large and lasting effect, at least for some months, reducing symptoms of distress and improving sleep quality among students. Further research should seek ways to enhance the effect, assess an even longer follow-up period, include active control groups, and consider performing similar studies in other cultural settings.

Endoluminal negative pressure (ENP) therapy via a specifically designed polyurethane foam (EsoSponge ® , B.Braun Medical, Melsungen, Germany) has become the standard of care for AL in many specialized centres. The prophylactic (pENP) application of this technique aims to reduce postoperative morbidity and is a novel approach which has not yet been investigated in a prospective study. The aim of this study is therefore to assess the effect of pENP at the anastomotic site in high-risk patients undergoing minimally invasive transthoracic Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy. Methods and analysis The study design is a prospective, multi-centre, two-arm, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial and will be conducted in two phases. Phase one is a randomised feasibility and safety pilot trial involving 40 consecutive patients. After definitive sample size calculation, additional patients will be included accordingly during phase two. The primary outcome of the study will be the postoperative length of hospitalization until reaching previously defined ""fit for discharge criteria"". Secondary outcomes will include postoperative morbidity, mortality and postoperative AL-rates based on 90-day follow-up. A confirmatory analysis based on intention-to-treat will be performed.

Herein, we report on the successful conservative treatment of left atrial dissection while avoiding anticoagulation therapy. Case presentation A 64-year-old man developed left atrial dissection during operation for acute type A aortic dissection, most likely due to retrograde cardioplegia cannulation. As there was no connection between the left atrial dissection cavity and the left atrium on enhanced computed tomography, we did not administer anticoagulants to prevent expansion of the left atrial dissection cavity. However, the patient developed atrial fibrillation, which was successfully managed by beta-blocker and amiodarone administration. Follow-up imaging showed gradual left atrial dissection reduction, and the patient was started on anticoagulation therapy. Conclusion We were able to resolve left atrial dissection by preventing the use of anticoagulation therapy in the acute stage by managing the atrial fibrillation with antiarrhythmic drugs.","['Anticoagulation', 'Atrial fibrillation', 'Antiarrhythmic Drugs', 'Left Atrial Dissection', 'Retrograde Cardioplegia Cannulation']",[],[],NaN

Methods:  Patients diagnosed with LVT by transthoracic echocardiography between November 2009 to July 2020 at our institution were included. The endpoints were all-cause mortality and systemic embolism.  Results:  Ninety-two subjects were finally included in the study. The mean age of the cohort was 56.73 ± 14.12, and 80.4% of the patients were male. The median BNP (1st quartile-3rd quartile) was 437.5 (112.74-1317.5). The total all-cause mortality rate was 30.44% (28/92), and the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year cumulative survival rates were 85.4, 75.5, and 66.5%, respectively. Systemic embolism was identified in 10 subjects. COX multivariate analysis showed that Log BNP (HR, 4.16; 95%CI, 1.81-9.56;  P  = 0.001) and BMI (HR, 0.86; 95%CI, 0.73-0.99;  P  = 0.048) were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. In addition, patients with BNP levels in the upper median (≥ 437.5 pg/ml) had significantly higher all-cause mortality rate compared to those with lower median BNP ( P  = 0.004). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for BNP and all-cause mortality was 0.71. In the linear trend test, BNP quartiles were significantly related to all-cause mortality in all models, and the  P -values for trend in models 1, 2, and 3 were 0.005, 0.006, and 0.048, respectively.  Conclusion:  BNP level is a prognostic factor for all-cause mortality in LVT patients, and elevated BNP is indicative of a higher risk of LVT.","['Prognostic', 'B-type natriuretic peptide', 'Systemic Embolism', 'Mortality Risk', 'Ventricular Thrombus']","['Xinqiao Hospital', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Hospital', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Committee']",[],NaN

Intervention with low dose aspirin had been recommended to reduce the incidence of recurrent pre-eclampsia. However, the association between interventions and maternal and neonatal outcomes in subsequent pregnancies in women with previous pre-eclampsia has not been fully studied.  Methods:  In this prospective study, a total of 41 patients with previous pre-eclampsia received low dose aspirin and active management (including psychological and physiological intervention), between 10 to 28 weeks until 32 to 34 weeks in our regional referral hospital. The recurrence of pre-eclampsia, and maternal and neonatal outcomes in this pregnancy were analyzed and compared to our previous study which reported a 60% recurrence of pre-eclampsia in our regional referral hospital.  Results:  Thirteen women with previous pre-eclampsia developed recurrent pre-eclampsia. The time of onset or severity of pre-eclampsia in the previous pregnancy was not associated with the incidence of recurrent pre-eclampsia. The time of onset of previous pre-eclampsia was also not associated with the time of onset in subsequent pre-eclampsia. However, the number of severe recurrent pre-eclampsia was significantly reduced, compared to their first pregnancies. The number of SGA and stillbirth/neonatal death was also significantly reduced in recurrent pre-eclampsia that was actively managed, compared to their first pregnancies.  Conclusion:  Despite the small sample size included in this study, our study demonstrates that active obstetric management reduces the incidence of recurrent pre-eclampsia, compared to our previous study, and reduces the severity of recurrent pre-eclampsia. It also improves neonatal outcomes in recurrent pre-eclampsia. However, because of no controls in this study, our findings need to confirmed by a case-control or randomized clinical trial study.","['Recurrence', 'Neonatal Outcomes', 'Active Management', 'Dose Aspirin', 'Pre-Eclampisa']","['Jiaotong University', ""Xi'an Jiaotong"", 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'ref 2018-115', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'China', 'University', 'human participants']",[],NaN

This study tested whether the NIRS-based RSFC measurements can detect the abnormalities in RSFC that have been associated with MDD in previous fMRI studies. We measured 8 min of resting-state brain activity in 34 individuals with MDD and 78 age- and gender-matched healthy controls using a whole-head NIRS system. We applied a previously established partial correlation analysis for estimating RSFCs between the 17 cortical regions. We found that MDD patients had a lower RSFC between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobe that comprise the CCN, and a higher RSFC between the right orbitofrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, compared to those in healthy controls. The RSFC strength of the left CCN was negatively correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms and the dose of antipsychotic medication and positively correlated with the level of social functioning.

We describe a rare case of an adult patient with DADA2 who presented with unilateral frosted branch angiitis (FBA) combined with branch retinal vein occlusion and panuveitis.  Method:  This paper is a clinical case report.  Results:  A 31-year-old male patient complained of blurred vision in his right eye for 2 days. His fundus examination showed FBA combined with branch retinal vein occlusion and panuveitis. He had a medical history of intermittent and recurrent fever, skin rash and aphthous ulcer for 5 years, and lacunar infarction for 1 month. Laboratory examinations showed hypogammaglobulinemia and mild prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed old lacunar infarction in the right basal ganglia and the lateral ventricle and fresh lacunar infarction in the right pons, respectively. The perivascular sheathing of FBA and macular edema were resolved after steroid administration and treatment of intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. During the period of follow-up, the patient subsequently suffered from recurrence of strokes, abnormality of coagulation function, sudden hearing loss of the left ear, and diplopia. His gene sequencing results demonstrated several deletion mutations in  ADA2 , and the diagnosis of DADA2 was eventually confirmed.

However, little is known about the association between sleep timing, an important behavior marker of circadian rhythms, and dementia risk in older adults, and whether this is independent of sleep duration or quality.  Methods:  We included data from 1,051 community-dwelling older men and women (aged≥ 60y) without dementia from the Shanghai Aging Study. At baseline, participants reported sleep timing, duration, and quality using the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI). Dementia diagnosis over the following 7.3 years was determined by neurologists using DSM-IV criteria. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between bedtime (before 9 p.m., after 11 p.m. vs. 9-11 p.m.), rise time (before 6 a.m., after 8 a.m. vs. 6-8 a.m.), and risk of dementia.  Results:  A total of 238 (22.8%), 675 (64.5%), and 133 (12.7%) participants reported going to bed before 9 p.m., between 9 and 11 p.m., and after 11 p.m., respectively, while 272 (26%), 626 (59.9%), and 148 (14.2%) reported getting up before 6 a.m., between 6 and 8 a.m., and after 8 a.m., respectively. Participants who reported going to bed earlier had a lower education level, were less likely to be smokers, more likely to have hypertension or diabetes, and had longer sleep duration but poorer sleep quality compared to those who reported a later bedtime. We found 47 incidents of dementia among 584 participants followed up over an average of 7.3 years. After adjustment for demographics, education, income, body mass index, depressive symptoms, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, comorbidities, APOE4 genotype, and baseline MMSE, those with a bedtime of before 9 p.m. were two times more likely to develop dementia [hazard ratio (HR)=2.16 (95%CI: 1.06-4.40)], compared to those going to bed between 9 and 11 p.m. Later bedtime (i.e., after 11 p.m.) showed the opposite but had a non-significant association with dementia risk (HR=0.15, 95%CI: 0.02-1.29). We did not find an association for rise time and risk of dementia.  Conclusion:  Earlier sleep timing in older adults without dementia was associated with an increased risk of dementia. Future studies should examine the underlying mechanisms of this association and explore the usefulness of sleep timing as a preclinical marker for dementia.","['Sleep', 'Dementia', 'Longitudinal', 'Epidemiological Analysis', 'Low- And Lower-middle-income Countries']","['Fudan University', 'Huashan Hospital', 'Ethics Statement', 'Medical Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'Shanghai', 'China', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Hospital']",[],NaN

This study was to investigate the hemodynamic changes of distal arterial trees, and to identify the factors accounting for hyperperfusion after the obliteration of large intracranial aneurysms.  Methods:  We retrospectively reviewed data of 12 patients with intracranial carotid aneurysms. Parametric models with intracranial carotid aneurysm were created. Patient-specific geometries were generated by three-dimensional rotational angiography. To mimic the arterial geometries after complete obliteration of the aneurysms, the aneurysms were virtually removed. The Navier-Stokes equations were solved using ANSYS CFX 14. The average wall shear stress, pressure and flow velocity were measured.  Results:  Pressure ratio values were significantly higher in A1 segments, M1 segments, and M2 + M3 segments after obliteration of the aneurysms ( p  = 0.048 in A1 segments,  p  = 0.017 in M1 segments,  p  = 0.001 in M2 + M3 segments). Velocity ratio values were significantly higher in M1 segments and M2 + M3 segments after obliteration of the aneurysms ( p  = 0.047 in M1 segments,  p  = 0.046 in M2 + M3 segments). The percentage of pressure ratio increase after obliteration of aneurysms was significantly correlated with aneurysmal angle ( r  = 0.739,  p  = 0.006 for M2 + M3).  Conclusions:  The pressure and flow velocity of distal arterial trees became higher after obliteration of aneurysms. The angle between the aneurysm and the parent artery was the factor accounting for pressure increase after treatment.","['Hemodynamics', 'carotid artery', 'Computational Fluid Dynamics', 'Geometry', 'Large Intracranial Aneurysm']","['Medical University', 'Affiliatted Hospital', 'Dalian Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'University', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

Patients and Methods:  Clinical data for 975 patients diagnosed from 2011 to 2014 were used to develop the nomogram prognostic model. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the nomogram were determined by concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve. The results were validated using an independent cohort of 542 BCBM patients diagnosed from 2014 to 2015.  Results:  The following variables were selected in the final prognostic model: age, race, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, laterality, grade, molecular subtype, and extracranial metastatic sites. The C-index for the model described here was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.71). The calibration curve for probability of survival showed good agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. The model was validated in an independent validation cohort with a C-index of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.73).

Surgery is the mainstay of treatment and prognosis is generally good. For children with unresectable or metastatic tumors, however, outcome is particularly severe, limited also by the lack of predictive biomarkers of therapy efficacy and disease progression. Blood represents a minimally invasive source of cancer biomarkers for real-time assessment of tumor growth, particularly when it involves the analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTC). As CTCs potentially represent disseminated disease, their detection in the blood correlates with the presence of metastatic lesions and may reflect tumor response to treatment.

A technique that utilizes this visual-haptic interaction is called as pseudo-haptic feedback. Conventional studies have investigated pseudo-haptic feedback in situations, wherein a user manipulated a virtual object using a computer mouse, a force-feedback device, etc. The present study investigated whether and how it was possible to offer pseudo-haptic feedback to a user who manipulated a virtual object using keystrokes. Participants moved a cursor toward a destination by pressing a key. While the cursor was moving, the cursor was temporarily slowed down on a square area of the screen. The participants' task was to report, on a five-point scale, how much resistance they felt to the cursor's movement. In addition to the basic speed of the cursor, the ratio of the basic speed to the speed within the square area was varied. In Experiment 1, we found that these two factors interacted significantly with each other, but further analysis showed that the cursor speed within the square area was the most important determinant of perceived resistance. In Experiment 2, consistent with the results of the previous experiment, it was found that the cursor movement outside of the square area was not required to generate the sense of resistance. Counterintuitively, in Experiment 3, the sense of resistance was apparent even without user's keystrokes. We discuss how the sense of resistance for a cursor moved by keystrokes can be triggered visually, but interpreted by the brain as a haptic impression.","['Illusion', 'Cross-modal Interaction', 'Pseudo-haptic Feedback', 'Keystroke', 'Sense Of Resistance']","['NTT Communication', 'Communication Science', 'Science Laboratories', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'Laboratories Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Committee', 'human participants']",[],NaN

Here, we tested the hypothesis that aldosterone may be one of the driving forces behind increased FGF23 secretion in CKD. Methods Using data from a prospective study in humans, a retrospective study in dogs and cats, and an experimental study in 5/6-nephrectomized mice, we analyzed the relationship between circulating FGF23 and serum aldosterone levels in CKD across four species. To assess the effects of acute inhibition of aldosterone signaling on circulating FGF23, we acutely treated mice with established CKD with the mineralocorticoid receptor blocker canrenone (50 mg/kg iv/sc), and measured intact FGF23 before and 24 h as well as 72 h after start of administration of the drug. Results We found a tight positive association between circulating intact FGF23 and serum aldosterone in human, canine, and feline CKD patients, as well as in experimental murine CKD (humans:  r   S  = 0.57,  p  = 0.0368; dogs:  r   S  = 0.66,  p  = 0.0019; cats:  r   S  = 0.75,  p  = 0.0003; mice:  r   S  = 0.49,  p  = 0.0004). Injection of canrenone in mice with established CKD did not lead to changes in FGF23 levels within 24 h, but reduced FGF23 in all mice at 72 h.

Since MET is a known orchestrator of invasive tumor growth, we investigated its association with LNM in early oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC). As it is recommended by the NCCN to use tumor depth of invasion (DOI) in making decisions on elective neck dissection (END), the results obtained for MET positivity were aligned with those for DOI > 4 mm. The cutoff value used in our institution. Methods Tumor samples from patients who underwent primary tumor resection and neck dissection between 1995 and 2013, were collected from the archives of the Leiden and Erasmus University Medical Center. Immunohistochemistry with D1C2 was performed to identify MET negative ( Results Forty-five (44.1%) of the 102 cancers were MET positive. Ninety were cN0 of which 20 were pN+ (occult metastasis). The remaining 12 cancers were cN+, of which 10 were proven pN+ and 2 were pN0. MET positivity was associated with LNM with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 44.4% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 82.5% for pN+. For the occult group, the PPV was 36.8% and the NPV was 88.5%. Regression analysis showed that MET positivity is associated with pN+ and occult LNM ( p -value  Conclusion MET positivity is significantly associated with LNM in early OTSCC, outperforming DOI. The added value of MET positivity could be in the preoperative setting when END is being considered during the initial surgery. For cases with DOI ≤ 4 mm, MET positivity could aid in the clinical decision whether regular follow-up, watchful waiting, or END is more appropriate. Realizing that these preliminary results need to be independently validated in a larger patient cohort, we believe that MET positivity could be of added value in the decision making on END in early OTSCC.","['Met', 'Elective Neck Dissection', 'Oral Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Depth Of Invasion', 'Occult Lymph Node Metastasis']","['Scientific Societies', 'Dutch Medical', 'Medical Scientific', 'Statement Human', 'Medical Ethics', 'Ethics Statement', 'Health Research', 'Ethics Committee', 'Human tissues', 'Code']",[],NaN

The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of webcams on NICUs and to conduct a systematic assessment of their possible effects on parents and clinical staff. In addition, it aims at determining the need for webcams  in German NICUs and to identify possible barriers and moderators. The development and evaluation of practical guidance for the use of webcams will enable the comprehensive education of clinical staff and parents and, as a result, is intended to mitigate any potential undesirable consequences. Methods The study will be based on a mixed methods approach including all groups concerned in the care. Qualitative data will be collected in interviews and focus groups and evaluated using content analysis. The collection of quantitative data will be based on written questionnaires and will aim to assess the status quo as regards the use of webcams on German NICUs and the effects on parents, physicians, and nursing staff. These effects will be assessed in a randomised cross-over design. Four NICUs will be involved in the study and, in total, the parents of 730 premature babies will be invited to take part in the study. The effects on the nursing staff, such as additional workload and interruptions in workflows, will be evaluated on the basis of observation data. Discussion This study will be the largest multicentre study known to us that systematically evaluates the use of webcams in neonatal intensive care units. The effects of the  implementation of webcams on both parents and care providers will be considered. The results provide evidence to decide whether to promote the use of webcams on NICUs or not and what to consider when implementing them.

Such oversight should include the review of international research collaboration agreements, specifically those that involve partnerships between LMICs and HICs. Such reviews could include questions on whether the research conforms to data sharing, benefit sharing and capacity-building activities between LMICs and HICs. 62 As new information on COVID-19 is constantly emerging, riskâ€“benefit assessments may need to be reviewed on an ongoing basis in both LMICs and HICs. This effort may require additional training, resources and capacity development of RECs/IRBs and others in LMICs to better respond to the changing research landscape during pandemics, or other public health emergencies. There should be clear collaborative efforts and communication networks between those involved in the oversight of biobanks in LMICs and HICs to ensure adequate support and consistency for decision-making. In  box 1, we offer questions to promote the ethical oversight of biobanks and biobank research related to the current pandemic or future public health emergencies. These questions provide guidance on the review of such related research. This is not an exhaustive list of questions and should be supplemented by other local and context-specific ethics queries. However, this list can serve as the basis for review templates during these pandemics or other public health emergencies. Such templates could also assist in not only standardising the process but also providing additional support for RECs/IRBs.

However, collecting, storing and sharing human samples and data for research purposes present numerous ethical challenges. These challenges are exacerbated when the biobanking efforts aim to facilitate research on public health emergencies and include the sharing of samples and data between low/middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs). In this article, we explore ethical challenges for COVID-19 biobanking, offering examples from two past infectious disease outbreaks in LMICs where biobanking activities contributed to the perpetuation of global inequities. We focus on how the ethical imperative to promote the common good during public health emergencies can conflict with protecting the interests of biobank participants. We discuss how conducting biobank research under a waiver of informed consent during public health emergencies is ethically permissible, provided guidance is in place to prevent biopiracy and exploitation of vulnerable communities. We also highlight the need for biobank collaborations between LMICs and HICs to promote capacity building and benefit sharing.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of GAS (repeated every 3 weeks) in the treatment of locally advanced or advanced pancreatic cancer and determine the recommended dose of S-1 in this combination. Methods This is an open-label, single-arm, and single-center phase I trial. Patients who have been diagnosed with locally advanced or advanced PDAC pathologically without previous systemic treatments will be enrolled and be treated with GAS chemotherapy every 3 weeks (nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m  2 , ivgtt, day1, 8; gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 , day1, 8; different doses of S-1 within a dose escalation scheme) until the presence of disease progression (PD), intolerable adverse events (AEs), or requirement of patients and researchers. The primary endpoints are maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) allows to differentiate PWMLs based on the presence (SWI+) or absence (SWI-) of hemosiderin, but little is known about the significance of this distinction. This retrospective study aimed to compare neuroradiological and clinical characteristics of SWI+ and SWI- PWMLs.  Materials and Methods:  MR images of all VLBW infants scanned consecutively at term-equivalent age between April 2012 and May 2018 were retrospectively reviewed, and infants with PWMLs defined as small areas of high T1 and/or low T2 signal in the periventricular white matter were selected and included in the study. Each lesion was analyzed separately and characterized by localization, organization pattern, and distance from the lateral ventricle. Clinical data were retrieved from the department database.  Results:  A total of 517 PWMLs were registered in 81 patients, with 93 lesions (18%) visible on SWI (SWI+), revealing the presence of hemosiderin deposits. On univariate analysis, compared to SWI- PWML, SWI+ lesions were closer to the ventricle wall, more frequently organized in linear pattern and associated with lower birth weight, lower gestational age, lower admission temperature, need for intubation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and presence of GMH-IVH. On multivariate analysis, closer distance to the ventricle wall on axial scan and lower birth weight were associated with visibility of PMWLs on SWI ( p  = 0.003 and  p  = 0.0001, respectively).  Conclusions:  Our results suggest a nosological difference between SWI+ and SWI- PWMLs.

BRAF resistance imposes great difficulty to the treatment of CMM, and partially contributes to the poor prognosis of CMM. YAP is involved in the growth and drug resistance of a variety of tumors, and mechanical signals may affect the activation of YAP1. As a novel ultrasound treatment technology, ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction (UMMD) has been reported to have a killing effect on isolated CMM cells. In this study, the tumor tissue samples were collected from 64 CMM patients. We found that YAP1 mRNA expression was irrelevant to the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic survival of the CMM patients. The drug-resistant cell line was constructed and subcutaneously implanted into nude mice, which were further separately treated with UMMD, ultrasound (US), and microbubbles (MB). The result showed that UMMD significantly inhibited the growth of tumor tissues. Ribosome imprinting sequencing (Ribo-seq) is a genetic technology for studying protein translation at genetic level. Ribo-seq, RNA-seq, and RT-qPCR were applied to detect YAP1 expression in CMM mouse tumor tissues. Ribo-seq data revealed that UMMD greatly up-regulated the expression of YAP1, interestingly, the up-regulated YAP1 was found to be negatively correlated with the weight of tumor tissues, while no significant change in YAP1 expression was detected by RNA-seq or RT-qPCR assay. These results indicated that UMMD could inhibit the tumor growth of drug-resistant CMM by affecting the translation efficiency of YAP1, providing a strong basis for the clinical treatment of UMMD in CMM.","['Drug resistance', 'Yap1', 'Skin Melanoma', 'Ultrasound-mediated Microbubble Destruction', 'Ribosomal Blot Sequencing']","['Ethics Statement', 'Medical Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Statement', 'Medical', 'Xiangya Hospital', 'Committee', 'Central South']",[],NaN

Methods An online survey was disseminated to all hospital staff via electronic channels. The clinical audit sphinx software was used for data collection and analysis. Results The total number of responses was n = 728, almost double the rate from 2018 (N = 393). A total of 78% (N = 551) of participants were vaccinated last year. A total of 94% (N = 677) of participants reported their intention to be vaccinated this year. The main barriers listed were being unable to find time (32%, N = 36), side effects (30%, N = 33) and thinking that it does not work (21%, N = 23). The most popular suggestions for how to increase uptake were more mobile immunisation clinics (72%, N = 517) and more information on the vaccine (50%, N = 360).

To date, liver biopsy is preferred for HS evaluation. This study aims to evaluate the measurement of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) as a diagnostic tool of HS in living liver donors. Methods Candidates recruited to this study, conducted from April 2016 to February 2020, were potential donors who had undergone transient elastography using Fibroscan® and CAP measurements at liver segments VI and VII, followed by liver biopsy. The HS grades from liver biopsy were classified as S0 ( 66%). For CAP, they were S0 (≤218dB/m), S1 (218-249dB/m)), S2 (250-305dB/m)), and S3 (>305dB/m)). The CAP measurements were compared with the liver biopsy results. Results Of the 150 potential donors [male, 73.3%; mean age, 30.0±7.0 years; body mass index (BMI), 24.7±3.5kg/m2], 92 (61.3%) had no or mild HS, while 58 (38.7%) and 10% had moderate to severe HS based on CAP and liver biopsy, respectively. Subjects with moderate to severe HS per CAP were mostly males (0.014), and had higher BMI (p = .006), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (.001), gamma-glutamyl transferase (.026), and high-density lipoprotein (.008). On multivariate analysis, high ALT (OR, 1.051; 95% CI, 1.016-1.087; p = .004) was a predictor of significant HS. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of CAP to detect significant HS were 93.3%, 67.4, 24.1%, and 98.9%, respectively. Conclusion The high sensitivity and negative predictive values of CAP make it a good screening test to exclude significant HS in potential living liver donors which, in turn, can help avoid unnecessary liver biopsies.",[],[],[],NaN

Materials and methods 18 Wistar male rats were divided into the control group, immobilization group (with plaster cast fixation to immobilize the soleus muscles in a shortened position for 2 weeks), and B-SES group (with muscle contractile exercise through B-SES during the immobilization period). B-SES stimulation was performed at a frequency of 50 Hz and an intensity of 4.7 mA, muscle contractile exercise by B-SES was applied to the lower limb muscles for 20 minutes/session (twice a day) for 2 weeks (6 times/week). The bilateral soleus muscles were used for histological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and molecular biological analyses. Results The number of myonuclei was significantly higher in the B-SES group than in the immobilization group, and there was no significant difference between the B-SES and control groups. The cross-sectional area of type I and II myofibers in the immobilization and B-SES groups was significantly lower than that in the control group, and the cross-sectional area of type I myofibers in the B-SES group was higher than that in the immobilization group. However, Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 mRNA expression in the immobilization and B-SES groups was significantly higher than those in the control group. Additionally, the number of macrophages, IL-1β, TGF-β1, and α-SMA mRNA expression, and hydroxyproline expression was significantly lower in the control and B-SES groups than those in the immobilization group.

Here, we systematically evaluated whether BMSCs can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes to alleviate the symptoms of EAE mice. We used Immunofluorescence staining to detect MAP-2, GFAP, and MBP to evaluate whether BMSCs can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The effect of BMSCs transplantation on inflammatory infiltration and demyelination in EAE mice were detected by Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) and Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining, respectively.

The collected data was entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and analyzed using the SPSS version 24 statistical package. Logistic regression analysis was used to test the association. All variables at p-value  Results In this study, the intention to use maternity waiting homes was 295(48.8%, 95%CI: 47%-55%)). Occupation (government employee) (AOR:2.87,95%CI: 1.54-5.36), previous childbirth history (AOR:2.1,95%CI:1.22-3.57), past experience in maternity waiting home use AOR:4.35,95%CI:2.63-7.18), direct (AOR:1.57,95%CI:1.01-2.47) and indirect (AOR: 2.18, 1.38,3.44) subject norms and direct (AOR:3.00,95%CI:2.03-4.43), and indirect (AOR = 1.84,95%CI:1.25-2.71) perceived behavioral control of respondents were significantly associated variables with intention to use maternity waiting home. Conclusion The magnitude of intention to use maternity waiting homes among pregnant women is low. Community disapproval, low self-efficacy, maternal employment, history of previous birth, and past experiences of MWHs utilization are predictors of intention to use MWHs, and intervention programs, such as health education, strengthening and integration of community in health system programs need to be provided.",[],"['Debre Markos', 'Markos University', 'Ethical approval', 'University research', 'approval committee', 'data collection', 'approval', 'research ethical', 'primarily obtained', 'Ethical']",[],NaN

Our aim is to review the histopathological findings in TE, summarise the diagnostic features, identify any major histo-morphological indicator(s) hitherto unrecognised as such, suggest diagnostic criteria; all with the aim of improving the diagnostic capacity and reducing observer error even where the clinical suspicion is low. A case-control study in which a search in the pathology archives of a referral hospital over a 10-year period was conducted. Twenty-six cases of TE were identified, reviewed, and compared with a control population of 48 cases taken from common benign thoracic diseases. Nine notable histological features were identified in varying permutations in the test group, namely: endometrioid glands, lymphoid clusters, ceroid macrophages, siderophages, cholesterol crystals, capillary congestion, multinucleated giant cells, smooth muscle bundles and fibrosis. The first 6 features were frequent; each being present in over 13 (13/26; 50%) test cases. The first 8 features showed significant association with TE by the Chi-squared test (P<0.05). In this group, the strength of association is high for the first 4 features (Cramér's V≥0.5). The presence of ceroid macrophages is shown to be a novel key feature, previously unrecognised as such, for the identification of TE. The presence of any three of four features including endometrioid glands, lymphoid clusters, ceroid macrophages and siderophages is a suggested criterion for the definitive diagnosis of TE.",[],[],[],NaN

In HD patients, sleep fragmentation appears at an early stage of disease, although features of the earliest sleep abnormalities in presymptomatic HD are not fully established. Here we used novel automated analysis of quantitative electroencephalography to study transitions between wake and non-rapid eye movement sleep in a sheep model of presymptomatic HD. We found that while the number of transitions between sleep and wake were similar in normal and HD sheep, the dynamics of transitions from sleep-to-wake differed markedly between genotypes. Rather than the gradual changes in EEG power that occurs during transitioning from sleep-to-wake in normal sheep, transition into wake was abrupt in HD sheep. Furthermore, transitions to wake in normal sheep were preceded by a significant reduction in slow wave power, whereas in HD sheep this prior reduction in slow wave power was far less pronounced. This suggests an impaired ability to prepare for waking in HD sheep. The abruptness of awakenings may also have potential to disrupt sleep-dependent processes if they are interrupted in an untimely and disjointed manner. We propose that not only could these abnormal dynamics of sleep transitions be useful as an early biomarker of HD, but also that our novel methodology would be useful for studying transition dynamics in other sleep disorders.",[],[],[],NaN

The causative agent of SLD has only recently been identified as a novel Campylobacter species, Campylobacter hepaticus. Specific primers were designed from the hsp60 gene of Campylobacter hepaticus and PCR followed by high-resolution melt curve analysis was optimised to detect and differentiate three species of Campylobacter (Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter hepaticus). The three Campylobacter species produced a distinct curve profile and was differentiated using HRM curve analysis. The potential of the PCR-HRM curve analysis was shown in the genotyping of 37 Campylobacter isolates from clinical specimens from poultry farms. PCR-HRM curve analysis of DNA extracts from bile samples or cultures from bile samples, were identified as Campylobacter hepaticus and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The DNA sequence analysis of selected samples from each of the three HRM distinctive curves patterns showed that each DNA sequence was associated with a unique melt profile. The potential of the PCR-HRM curve analysis in genotyping of Campylobacter species was also evaluated using faecal specimens from 100 wild birds.

Written informed consent was obtained before each interview.," Background Paracetamol is recommended as first-line treatment for an acute sore throat. However, in primary care, antibiotics are still frequently prescribed as first-line management for sore throat. Objectives We aimed to explore the views and experiences of general practitioners (GPs) and patients regarding paracetamol for sore throat to understand why guidelines are often not adhered to. Methods A descriptive qualitative study with semi-structured interviews was conducted with a purposive sample of eight GPs and nine patients in Antwerp (Belgium). Data was analysed using thematic content analysis. Results The mean age of GPs was 42.4 years and of patients 51.4 years. Patients want reassurance and pain relief. Many patients do not self-manage their acute sore throat with paracetamol before consulting their GP. GPs often wrongly assume that the patient has already used pain relief without actually exploring this. Patients who do use paracetamol, do not know how to use it effectively. This leads to the perception and beliefs that it is insufficient to treat acute sore throat and when prescribed will lead to dissatisfaction. Patients generally accept the GP's recommended treatment when given a thorough explanation, since they trust their GP's expertise. Conclusion GPs play a major role in educating patients about paracetamol as effective pain-relieving treatment in acute sore throat. By actively exploring the patients' ideas, concerns and expectations (ICE), patients' satisfaction and guideline adherence could be improved.","['Patients', 'General Practitioners', 'Qualitative Research', 'paracetamol', 'Acute Sore Throat']","['Ethics Committee', 'Antwerp approved', 'Ethics', 'Committee', 'University', 'Antwerp', 'study', 'approved', 'Written informed', 'informed consent']",[],NaN

Any deviations from the protocol are described. Ethical approval was not required for this study.," Objective To determine whether medRxiv data availability statements describe open or closed data-that is, whether the data used in the study is openly available without restriction-and to examine if this changes on publication based on journal data-sharing policy. Additionally, to examine whether data availability statements are sufficient to capture code availability declarations. Design Observational study, following a pre-registered protocol, of preprints posted on the medRxiv repository between 25th June 2019 and 1st May 2020 and their published counterparts. Main outcome measures Distribution of preprinted data availability statements across nine categories, determined by a prespecified classification system. Change in the percentage of data availability statements describing open data between the preprinted and published versions of the same record, stratified by journal sharing policy. Number of code availability declarations reported in the full-text preprint which were not captured in the corresponding data availability statement. Results 3938 medRxiv preprints with an applicable data availability statement were included in our sample, of which 911 (23.1%) were categorized as describing open data. 379 (9.6%) preprints were subsequently published, and of these published articles, only 155 contained an applicable data availability statement. Similar to the preprint stage, a minority (59 (38.1%)) of these published data availability statements described open data. Of the 151 records eligible for the comparison between preprinted and published stages, 57 (37.7%) were published in journals which mandated open data sharing. Data availability statements more frequently described open data on publication when the journal mandated data sharing (open at preprint: 33.3%, open at publication: 61.4%) compared to when the journal did not mandate data sharing (open at preprint: 20.2%, open at publication: 22.3%). Conclusion Requiring that authors submit a data availability statement is a good first step, but is insufficient to ensure data availability. Strict editorial policies that mandate data sharing (where appropriate) as a condition of publication appear to be effective in making research data available. We would strongly encourage all journal editors to examine whether their data availability policies are sufficiently stringent and consistently enforced.",[],"['Protocol', 'study', 'ethics', 'analysis', 'registered', 'advance', 'stages', 'Ethical approval', 'Ethical', 'deviations']",[],NaN

The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.," Background and aim:  Bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) or non-bismuth quadruple therapy (i.e., concomitant therapy) (CT) is the first-line regimens to eradicate  H. pylori  infection in areas with high prevalence of clarithromycin (CLA) resistance. Guidelines suggest that in areas of high prevalence of  H. pylori  strains with double resistance (i.e., CLA + metronidazole), BQT should be preferred to CT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BQT administered through the three-in-one pill (Pylera) formulation in a large series of  H. pylori -infected patients, naive to treatment in a region with high CLA and dual resistance.  Patients and methods:  We treated 250 patients (148 F and 102 M, mean age 48.6 years) with H.  pylori  infection naïve to treatment. Patients received esomeprazole 40 mg bid and Pylera 3 tablets qid for 10 days. Diagnosis of H.  pylori  infection was through  13 C urea breath test ( 13 C UBT), or stool antigen test or histology, as appropriate. The evaluation of eradication was through  13 C UBT at least 45 days after the end of therapy. Incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) was assessed through a questionnaire at the end of treatment. Compliance was considered good if at least 90% of medication had been taken. Statistical analysis was per intention-to-treat e per protocol (PP). 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.  Results:  1) 13 patients (5.2%) discontinued therapy due to side effects; 2) eradication rates in ITT and PP were 227/250 (90.8%; 95% CI 86.3-93.7%) and 226/237 (95.3%; 95% CI 91-99%), respectively; 3) the prevalence of TRAEs was 26.8%; and 4) adherence to treatment was good with compliance greater than 90%.  Conclusion:  In this real-life study, we demonstrate that in an area with a high prevalence of  H. pylori  strains with CLA or CLA + metronidazole resistance, BQT using Pylera is an effective therapeutic strategy with ITT eradication rates higher than 90%; this therapy is associated with good compliance and low incidence of side effects.","['H. pylori', 'Eradication Therapy', 'Real Life', 'Bismuth Quadruple Therapy', 'Bqt']","['Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Vanvitelli', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Committee', 'Univeristy']",[],NaN

Those results represented the basis for a new Delphi study addressing a better approach to pain treatment in patients with cancer. Methods The study consisted of a two-round multidisciplinary Delphi study. Specialists rated their agreement with a set of 17 statements using a 5-point Likert scale (0 = totally disagree and 4 = totally agree). Consensus on a statement was achieved if the median consensus score (MCS) (expressed as value at which at least 50% of participants agreed) was at least 4 and the interquartile range (IQR) was 3-4. Results This survey included input from 186 palliative care specialists representing all Italian territory. Consensus was reached on seven statements. More than 70% of participants agreed with the use of low dose of strong opioids in moderate pain treatment and valued transdermal route as an effective option when the oral route is not available. There was strong consensus on the importance of knowing opioid pharmacokinetics for therapy personalization and on identifying immediate-release opioids as key for tailoring therapy to patients' needs. Limited agreement was reached on items regarding breakthrough pain and the management of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Conclusion These findings may assist clinicians in applying clinical evidence to routine care settings and call for a reappraisal of current pain treatment recommendations with the final aim of optimizing the clinical use of strong opioids in patients with cancer.,"['Opioids', 'Cancer Pain', 'Breakthrough Pain', 'Opioid-induced Bowel Dysfunction (Oibd)', 'Opioid-induced Constipation (Oic)']",[],[],NaN

Yet, heterogeneity in the causes and presentation of LBP and a lack of standardization in its management impede effective prevention and treatment. Methods We conducted a modified Delphi study to generate consensus statements for the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of LBP. A panel of five experts proposed 19 statements that were subsequently evaluated by physicians who treat LBP in their everyday clinical practice. Physicians were asked to validate statements in the form of a web survey assessing level of agreement on a five-point Likert-like scale. Results Consensus (≥ 70% agreement) was obtained for all 19 statements. Strength of agreement and physician comments highlighted the importance of pain management, but also strategies to ameliorate functional limitation and prevent future LBP episodes. Respondents favored multidisciplinary approaches and multimodal management for LBP, although there was some ambiguity as to how multidisciplinary strategies could be feasibly incorporated into daily practice. Finally, the results indicated some conflict regarding the use of imaging for the diagnosis of LBP and how to classify LBP for targeted treatment. Conclusion The results of this study provide a summary of favored clinical practice for the management of chronic LBP. While the consensus statements were generally agreeable to survey respondents, some areas of ambiguity, including how to increase the feasibility of multidisciplinary strategies, when and how to use diagnostic imaging in LBP, and LBP classification, necessitate clarification in future studies and guidelines.","['Rehabilitation', 'Low back pain', 'Chronic pain', 'Pain Management', 'Delphi Study']","['Ethical Statement', 'international guidelines', 'ethical committee', 'present study', 'national law', 'pertinent international', 'Statement', 'committee', 'guidelines', 'Ethical']",[],NaN

Focusing on the conditions in Bali, this study explored the level of compliance to public health measures targeted at COVID-19 and identified the determinants of compliance via the values, rules, and knowledge approach.  Materials and Methods:  This cross-sectional study conducted an online survey using the Google Form application from June 29 to July 5, 2020. The minimum required sample size was 664. Inclusion criteria were set as follows: 18 years of age or older and residing in Bali during the data collection period. Adherence was measured based on nine protocol indicators that were rated using a four-point Likert scale. A multiple linear regression analysis was then conducted to determine the associated factors of adherence to public health measures.  Results:  Of the 954 survey respondents, data from 743 were included for analysis. The average level of adherence to public health measures was 32.59 (range of 20-36). The linear regression analysis showed that perceived health benefits from public health measures, being female, and having COVID-19 test histories were significantly associated with adherence to public health measures.  Conclusions:  For public health measures targeted at COVID-19, adherence was strongly associated with perceived social norms, in which individuals played social community roles by adapting to standardized public health measures. It is thus imperative for governments to support and monitor public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Adherence', 'Social Norm', 'Online Survey', 'Prevention Protocol', 'Covid-19']","['Udayana University', 'Ethics Commission', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Ethics', 'Commission', 'Faculty', 'Medicine', 'Udayana']",[],NaN

The license number is SYXK (Guangdong) 2019-0136.,"The proteins in the seminal plasma and on the sperm surface play important roles in sperm function and numerous reproductive processes. The cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) are enriched biasedly in the male reproductive tract of mammals, and CRISP2 is the sole member of CRISPs produced during spermatogenesis; whereas the role of CRISP2 in fertilization and its association with fertility of boars are still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the sperm CRISP2 and boar fertility, and explore its impact sperm fertilizing ability. The levels of CRISP2 protein in sperm were quantified by ELISA; correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the association between CRISP2 protein levels and boar reproductive parameters. Meanwhile, the expression of CRISP2 in boar reproductive organs and sperm, and the effects of CRISP2 on  in vitro  fertilization (IVF) were examined. The results showed that boars with high sperm levels of CRISP2 had high fertility. The protein levels of CRISP2 in sperm were positively correlated with the litter size ( r  = 0.412,  p  = 0.026), the number of live-born piglets ( r  = 0.421,  p  = 0.023) and the qualified piglets per litter ( r  = 0.381,  p  = 0.042). CRISP2 is specifically expressed in the testis and sperm of adult boars, and its location on sperm changed mainly from the post-acrosomal region to the apical segment of acrosome during capacitation. The cleavage rate was significantly decreased by adding the anti-CRISP2 antibody to the IVF medium, which indicates CRISP2 plays a critical role in fertilization. In conclusion, CRISP2 protein is specifically expressed in the adult testis and sperm and is associated with sperm fertilizing ability and boar fertility. Further mechanistic studies are warranted, in order to fully decipher the role of CRISP2 in the boar reproduction.","['Sperm', 'Fertilization', 'Fertility', 'Boar', 'Crisp2']","['Agricultural University', 'Animal Experimentation', 'South China', 'China Agricultural', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics', 'University', 'Guangdong', 'Statement']","['is', 'is']",NaN

Results LASSO and multivariate Cox regression analyses selected an 8-gene signature comprised DLX2, FGF9, IL6R, ITGB6, MYC, LGR5, S100A2, and TNFSF12. The signature had the capability to classify PDAC patients with different DFS, both in the training and validation cohorts. It provided improved DFS prediction compared with clinical indicators. This signature was associated with several cancer-related pathways. In addition, the signature could also predict the response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-based immunotherapy. Conclusion We established a novel EMT-related gene signature that was capable of predicting therapeutic response to adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy. This signature might facilitate individualized treatment and appropriate management of PDAC patients.","['Sensitivity', 'Risk Score', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Disease-free Survival', 'Emt', 'Pdac', 'Prognostic Signature']","['Tong University', 'Ruijin Hospital', 'Shanghai Jiao', 'Jiao Tong', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Hospital affiliated', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'University']",[],NaN

Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.,"Mutation of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter has been demonstrated as an unfavorable prognostic marker in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type (IDHwt) glioma. This study aimed to investigate the immune role of  TERT  promoter mutation status which could improve prognostic prediction in IDHwt.  TERT  mutation status,  IDH  mutation, and 1p-19q codeletion status data were obtained from 614 glioma cases from the Cancer Genome Atlas, and 325 cases from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas. The same information was obtained from 49 clinical glioma tissues.  TERT  mutation is preferentially present in glioblastoma and IDH-wt gliomas and is associated with poor prognosis. Moreover,  TERT  mutation was associated with infiltration of neutrophils and expression of neutrophil chemokines. which might partially contribute to the poor outcome in IDH-wt glioma. Furthermore, patients with IDH-wt glioma did not harbor increased peripheral neutrophils, implying that the infiltrated neutrophil in the tumor environment might due to cytokine chemotaxis. In this study, we hereby propose that TERT mutation might be a molecular driver of the dysfunctional immune microenvironment in IDH-wt glioma.  TERT  mutation may be a potential immune therapeutic target for optimizing treatment combinations and patient selection for glioma immunotherapy.","['Chemokines', 'Glioma', 'neutrophil', 'Rna-seq', 'Idh Mutation', 'Tert Mutation']","['Medical University', 'China Medical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'University', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Committee', 'Hospital', 'China']",[],NaN

Psychopathic traits are typically described in two ways; Primary: shallow affect, emotional detachment, and relationship difficulties, and Secondary Psychopathic Traits: antisocial traits, impulsiveness, and emotional dysregulation. People with high psychopathic traits tend to perform lower on measures of social cognition. This study investigated the relationship of social cognition (mentalising) to primary and secondary psychopathic traits in a non-clinical sample, and investigated the psychometric properties of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) Short Forms (A and B). A community-based male sample ( N  = 1,000; age range 18-78) was recruited through an online platform. Psychopathic traits were measured using Levenson, Kiehl, and Fitzpatrick's Self-Report Psychopathy Scale, and stratified into Primary and Secondary Psychopathic traits. Secondary validation of the RMET Short Forms was completed investigating scale reliability, and validity. Findings suggest excellent psychometrics in a large community cohort for the RMET Short Forms (A and B), with significant negative correlations on social cognitive performance and high self-report psychopathy. The item valence within the social cognitive measure (positive, negative, and neutral affect stimuli) was also examined, and correlated significantly with both Primary and Secondary Psychopathic traits. This study provides further validation of the RMET Short Forms (A and B), and adds to the literature on the scale by investigating performance on short-form specific valence.

DsbA-L, an antioxidant enzyme, plays a protective role in a variety of diseases by inhibiting ER stress and regulating metabolism. However, the relationship of DsbA-L with inflammation, especially the NLRP3 inflammasome, has not been examined. In this study, we note that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and exacerbated fibrosis were observed in the kidneys of diabetic DsbA-L-knockout mice and were accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Moreover, correlation analysis shows that the phosphorylation of AMPK was negatively correlated with NLRP3 expression and tubular damage. In addition, the decreased AMPK phosphorylation and NLRP3 activation induced by high glucose (HG) in HK-2 cells could be alleviated by the overexpression of DsbA-L. Interestingly, the protective effect of DsbA-L was eliminated after treatment with compound C, a well-known AMPK inhibitor. Our findings suggest that DsbA-L inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation by promoting the phosphorylation of AMPK.","['Inflammation', 'Diabetic nephropathy', 'Ampk', 'Nlrp3 Inflammasome', 'Dsba-l']","['South University', 'Central South', 'Ethics Statement', 'Medical Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'animal study', 'University', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Medical']",[],NaN

However, it is unknown how competent and confident podiatrists are in administering CPR and how they would respond in an emergency. Having a health professional who has a competent knowledge of CPR and skills in basic life support, can improve survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest. Therefore, the aim of this study was to survey New Zealand podiatrists to determine their CPR knowledge and qualifications; beliefs about the application of CPR; and perceptions of their competency in CPR. Methods This cross-sectional study used a web-based survey. Participants were New Zealand registered podiatrists with a current annual practising certificate. The 31-item survey included questions to elicit demographic information, CPR practice and attitudes, and CPR knowledge. Responses were collected between March and August 2020. Results 171 podiatrists responded to the survey. 16 % of the podiatrists (n = 28) had performed CPR in an emergency, with a 50 % success rate. Participants were predominantly female (n = 127, 74 %) and working in private practice (n = 140,82 %). Nearly half of respondents were younger than 40 years (n = 75,44 %) and had less than 10 years of clinical experience (n = 73, 43 %). Nearly all (n = 169,97 %) participants had received formal CPR training in the past two years, with 60 % (n = 105) receiving training in the past 12 months. Most respondents (n = 167,98 %) self-estimated their CPR ability as being effective, very effective, or extremely effective. Participants' knowledge of CPR was variable, with the percentage of correct answers for CPR protocol statements ranging between 20 and 90 %. Conclusions This study provides the first insight into New Zealand podiatrists' CPR knowledge and perceptions. Podiatrists were found to have high levels of CPR confidence but demonstrated gaps in CPR knowledge. Currently, New Zealand registered podiatrists require biennial CPR re-certification. However, resuscitation authorities in New Zealand and overseas recommend an annual update of CPR skills. Based on this study's findings, and in line with Australia and the United Kingdom, the authors recommend a change from biennial to annual CPR re-certification for podiatrists in New Zealand.

As reports of intracranial IgG4-related pseudotumors are very rare, we report a case of an IgG4-related inflammatory pseudotumor involving the clivus mimicking meningioma. A 46-year-old male presented with intermittent headache for 2 years and a sudden onset of dysphagia and dysphonia of 7 days' duration along with lower limb weakness. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the skull base revealed an isointense signal on T1- and T2-weighted images from an enhanced mass located at the middle of the upper clivus region, for which a meningioma was highly suspected. Then, an endoscopic transsphenoidal approach was adopted and the lesion was partially resected, as the subdural extra-axial lesion was found to be very tough and firm, exhibiting fibrous scarring attaching to the brain stem and basal artery. After the surgery, brain stem and posterior cranial nerve decompression was achieved, and the patient's symptoms, such as dysphagia, dysphonia and lower limb weakness, improved. Pathological findings showed many IgG4-positive plasma cells and lymphocytes surrounded by collagen-rich fibers. The patient was sent to the rheumatology department for further glucocorticoids after the diagnosis of an IgG4-related inflammatory pseudotumor was made. This case highlights the importance of considering IgG4-related inflammatory pseudotumors as a differential diagnosis in patients with lesions involving the clivus presenting with a sudden onset of symptoms of dysphagia and dysphonia along with lower limb weakness when other more threatening causes have been excluded. IgG4-related inflammatory pseudotumors are etiologically enigmatic and unpredictable, and total resection might not be warranted.

Biomarkers play an important role in the early diagnosis and treatment of AMI. Recently, more and more researches confirmed that circRNA may be a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, a series of biological analyses were performed to find new effective circRNA biomarkers for AMI. Firstly, the expression levels of circRNAs in blood samples of patients with AMI and those with mild coronary stenosis were compared to reveal circRNAs which were involved in AMI. Then, circRNAs which were significant expressed abnormally in the blood samples of patients with AMI were selected from those circRNAs. Next, a ceRNA network was constructed based on interactions of circRNA, miRNA and mRNA through biological analyses to detect crucial circRNA associated with AMI. Finally, one circRNA was selected as candidate biomarker for AMI. To validate effectivity and efficiency of the candidate biomarker, fluorescence in situ hybridization, hypoxia model of human cardiomyocytes, and knockdown and overexpression analyses were performed on candidate circRNA biomarker. In conclusion, experimental results demonstrated that the candidate circRNA was an effective biomarker for diagnosis and therapy of AMI.","['Ami 2', 'Bioinformatics 4', 'Circrna1', 'Circrna_1047615', 'Microarray 3']","['Harbin Medical', 'Medical University', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'University Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Committee', 'human participants', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

Uptake characteristics on dynamic  18 F-FET PET have been shown to serve as additional imaging biomarker for prognosis. However, data on the correlation of TERTp-mutational status and amino acid uptake on dynamic  18 F-FET PET are missing. Therefore, we aimed to analyze whether static and dynamic  18 F-FET PET parameters are associated with the TERTp-mutational status in de-novo  IDH -wildtype glioblastoma and whether a TERTp-mutation can be predicted by dynamic  18 F-FET PET. Methods Patients with de-novo  IDH -wildtype glioblastoma, WHO grade IV, available TERTp-mutational status and dynamic  18 F-FET PET scan prior to any therapy were included. Here, established clinical parameters maximal and mean tumor-to-background-ratios (TBR max /TBR mean ), the biological-tumor-volume (BTV) and minimal-time-to-peak (TTP min ) on dynamic PET were analyzed and correlated with the TERTp-mutational status. Results One hundred  IDH -wildtype glioblastoma patients were evaluated; 85/100 of the analyzed tumors showed a TERTp-mutation (C228T or C250T), 15/100 were classified as TERTp-wildtype. None of the static PET parameters was associated with the TERTp-mutational status (median TBR max  3.41 vs. 3.32 (p=0.362), TBR mean  2.09 vs. 2.02 (p=0.349) and BTV 26.1 vs. 22.4 ml (p=0.377)). Also, the dynamic PET parameter TTP min  did not differ in both groups (12.5 vs. 12.5 min, p=0.411). Within the TERTp-mutant subgroups (i.e., C228T (n=23) & C250T (n=62)), the median TBR max  (3.33 vs. 3.69, p=0.095), TBR mean  (2.08 vs. 2.09, p=0.352), BTV (25.4 vs. 30.0 ml, p=0.130) and TTP min  (12.5 vs. 12.5 min, p=0.190) were comparable, too. Conclusion Uptake characteristics on dynamic  18 F-FET PET are not associated with the TERTp-mutational status in glioblastoma However, as both, dynamic  18 F-FET PET parameters as well as the TERTp-mutation status are well-known prognostic biomarkers, future studies should investigate the complementary and independent prognostic value of both factors in order to further stratify patients into risk groups.","['Molecular genetics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Amino Acid Pet', 'Fet Pet', 'Tert (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase)']","['LMU Munich', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'LMU', 'Munich', 'Ethics', 'Statement']",[],NaN

Materials and Methods:  We retrospectively analyzed DME patients who received DEX implant treatment after being refractory to at least 3 monthly intravitreal ranibizumab injections. The main outcomes were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT), and intraocular pressure (IOP).  Results:  Twenty-nine eyes of 26 patients who had previously received an average of 8.1 ± 4.4 ranibizumab injections were included. Patients received between one and three DEX implants during 12.4 ± 7.4 months of follow-up. The mean final CRT significantly decreased from 384.4 ± 114.4 μm at baseline to 323.9 ± 77.7 μm ( p  = 0.0249).

However, the role of Nrg4 in human NAFLD remains unclear to date. We analysed Nrg4 plasma levels and its association with liver disease severity together with the transcriptional profile of the Nrg4 pathway in liver and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of NAFLD patients. Methods Plasma Nrg4 levels were measured in 65 NAFLD patients and 43 healthy controls (HC). Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed and quantified with chemical shift MRI and transient elastography respectively. Furthermore, blood lipid levels, HOMA-IR and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ) were analysed. Microarray analyses to assess differences in the Nrg4 and its receptor family ErbB pathway in liver and VAT from an independent patient group with biopsy proven NAFL (simple steatosis) (n = 4), NASH (n = 5) and normal liver (n = 6) were performed. Results Plasma Nrg4 levels were not significantly different between NAFLD patients and HC (p = 0.622). Furthermore, plasma Nrg4 levels did not correlate with the hepatic fat fraction (r = -0.028, p = 0.829) and were not significantly different between NAFLD patients with or without hepatic fibrosis (p = 0.087).

Methods A retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 514 newly enrolled adults to ART from 2014 to 2018 at Debre-Markos Referral Hospital. Patients' chart number was selected from the computer using a simple random sampling technique. Data were entered into EPI- INFO 7.2.2.6 and analyzed using Stata 14.0. The mortality rate within the first year was computed and described using frequency tables.

The unchanged mortality has been attributed to suboptimal Xpert implementation. We developed a mathematical model to explore how complementary investments may improve cost-effectiveness of the tuberculosis diagnostic algorithm. Methods Complementary investments in the tuberculosis diagnostic pathway were compared to the status quo. Investment scenarios following an initial Xpert test included actions to reduce pre-treatment loss-to-follow-up; supporting same-day clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis after a negative result; and improving access to further tuberculosis diagnostic tests following a negative result. We estimated costs, deaths and disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs) averted from provider and societal perspectives. Sensitivity analyses explored the mediating influence of behavioural, disease- and organisational characteristics on investment effectiveness. Findings Among a cohort of symptomatic patients tested for tuberculosis, with an estimated active tuberculosis prevalence of 13%, reducing pre-treatment loss-to-follow-up from ~20% to ~0% led to a 4% (uncertainty interval [UI] 3; 4%) reduction in mortality compared to the Xpert scenario. Improving access to further tuberculosis diagnostic tests from ~4% to 90% among those with an initial negative Xpert result reduced overall mortality by 28% (UI 27; 28) at $39.70/ DALY averted. Effectiveness of investment scenarios to improve access to further diagnostic tests was dependent on a high return rate for follow-up visits.

Most cases are forensic cases and the results of postmortem analysis. Traumatic larynx and hyoid bone fractures represent a rare but important differential diagnosis of the common symptom hoarseness. Case presentation A 60-year-old female patient presented with unclear dysphonia and globus sensation following intubation for a surgical treatment for a lower leg fracture after a bicycle accident two months ago. Endoscopy and the computed tomography (CT) of the neck revealed a fixed and immobile fractured piece of the larynx, a hyoid bone fracture and a pseudarthrosis between the greater horn of the hyoid bone and the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage. The hyoid bone fracture led to a distortion of the supraglottis. After surgical removal of the fractured part of the hyoid bone and the pseudarthrosis separation, the supraglottis appeared symmetrical again. Four weeks after surgery the patient was symptom-free. Clinical discussion Though combined hyoid bone and larynx fractures after traumatic injuries are rare, they represent an important differential diagnosis in trauma patients with dysphagia or dysphonia. The clinical symptoms can vary and occur immediately or within a latent period taking weeks or months until the proper diagnosis. Depending on the symptoms, surgical management can be effective. Conclusion An isolated partial resection of the hyoid bone with separation of the pseudarthrosis is a reasonable therapeutic option and can lead to completely resolving symptom.

External auditory exostosis (EAE), also referred to as surfer's ear, is recognized as a potentially serious complication of surfing. Cold water (water temperature below 19 °C) is a commonly cited risk factor, with prevalence of EAE in cold water surfers ranging from 61 to 80%. However, there is a paucity of studies reporting the prevalence of EAE in surfers exposed to water temperatures above 19 °C. With mean water temperature ranging from 19 °C to 28 °C, the Gold Coast region of Australia provides the ideal environment to assess the main goal of this study: to assess the prevalence and severity of EAE in warm water surfers. Methods Eligible participants were surfers living and surfing on the Gold Coast (Queensland, Australia). Currently active surfers over 18 years of age, surfing year-round, with a minimum of five consecutive years of surfing experience were recruited to participate. Included individuals were asked to complete a questionnaire and underwent bilateral otoscopy. Results A total of 85 surfers were included, with mean age 52.1 years (standard deviation [SD] ±12.6 years) and mean surfing experience of 35.5 years (SD ±14.7 years). Nearly two-thirds of participants (65.9%) had regular otological symptoms, most commonly water trapping (66%), hearing loss (48.2%), and cerumen impaction (35.7%). Less than one-fifth of the surfers (17.7%) reported regular use of protective equipment for EAE. The overall prevalence of exostosis was 71.8%, with most of the individuals having bilateral lesions (59%) and a mild grade (grade 1, 47.5%). There was insufficient evidence for any significant associations between the main outcomes (presence and severity of EAE) and factors related to age, surfing experience, winter exposure, surfing ability, symptoms, and use of protective equipment.

We calculated the test characteristics of the pulsatility indices (PI) of the umbilical and renal arteries in addition to the derived CPR and CRR to detect a composite adverse neonatal outcome. Results The test characteristics of the four Doppler ratios to detect increased risk for the composite neonatal outcome demonstrated that the umbilical artery pulsatility index had the best test performance (sensitivity 64% (95% CI: 47-82%), PPV 24% (95% CI: 21-27), and positive likelihood ratio 2.7 (95% CI: 1.4-5.2)). There was no benefit to using the CRR compared with the CPR. The agreement between tests was moderate to poor (Kappa value CPR compared with CRR: 0.5 (95%CI 0.4-0.70), renal artery PI:-0.1 (95% CI -0.2-0.0), umbilical artery PI: 0.5 (95% CI 0.4-0.7)). Only the umbilical artery had an area under the receiver operating curve that was significantly better compared with the CPR as a reference ( p -value  Conclusions The data that we present do not support the use of renal artery Doppler as a useful clinical test to identify a fetus at risk for an adverse neonatal outcome. Within the various indices applied to this population, umbilical artery Doppler performed the best in identifying the fetuses at risk for an adverse perinatal outcome.","['Doppler', 'Renal artery', 'Pulsatility index', 'Cerebral–placental Ratio']",[],[],NaN

The study aimed to investigate the variety of depressive symptoms predictors-personal resources, adverse school and family, health, lifestyle-related (sense of coherence, self-esteem, school involvement, negative acts at school, family stress and violence, psychosomatic health complaints, physical activity, smoking, alcohol) as well as gender, employing hierarchical linear regression analysis in a large representative sample of adolescents ( N  = 2212) in Kaunas, Lithuania. Four blocks of predictors were employed in hierarchical linear regression analysis. In the final model 64.9% of depressive symptoms were explained by all the predictors. Sense of coherence was the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms (standardized regression coefficient β = -605,  p   p  < 0.001 in the final model after adjustment for all other independent variables) and accounted for 36.6% of variance. In conclusion, this study supports the notion that depressive symptoms among adolescents have multifactorial origins with many predictors showing significant effect seizes. Therefore, high sense of coherence and self-esteem, school involvement, higher levels of physical activity would be protective and influence lower levels of depressive symptoms among adolescents. Exposure to negative acts at school and negative experiences in the family, psychosomatic health complaints, smoking would increase the probability of depressive symptoms.

As coronary atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of myocardial ischemia and fibrosis, in IHD patients implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) we investigated the relation between the VA burden and the complexity of coronary atherosclerotic lesions. Methods and results In IHD patients who underwent coronary angiography and ICD implant, the Syntax scores I and II (SSI-II), as index of the severity of the coronary atherosclerotic disease, and the occurrence of VA were assessed. Overall 144 patients were included (123 males). Of these 22 patients (15%) experienced at least one episode of VA (cycle length 298 ± 19 msec) that required ICD intervention. The number of episodes per patient and per year was 4 ± 6 and 2.8 ± 4, respectively. Patients that experienced a VA compared to those free from arrhythmic events did not have distinct baseline clinical characteristics except for a higher SS I and SS II (21 (IQR 13-38) vs. 16 (IQR 10-23);  p  = 0.037; and 50 (IQR 39-62) vs. 42 (IQR 34-50);  p  = 0.012). In the binary logistic regression analyses the SS I and II were the only independent predictors of VA occurrence. A higher SS II was also associated with an earlier time to first event ( p  = 0.005). Conclusion Higher SS I-II scores reflect a more severe coronary atherosclerosis and are associated with a greater VA burden. Further studies are needed to better clarify the ability of SSI-II to stratify the risk of IHD patients to develop life-threatening VA.","['Heart Failure', 'coronary artery disease', 'Ventricular Arrhythmias', 'Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator']",[],[],NaN

All patients were treated at the University of Seville's dental school to solve mucogingival problems for aesthetic and/or functional reasons. A classification is proposed based on its severity; Major and Minor. Major complications included reepithelialization of the graft, epithelial bands, cul-de-sac, epithelial cysts, and bone exostoses. Minor complications included the graft´s color changes and superficial revascularization.

Various studies demonstrated that QFR consistently related to fractional flow reserve (FFR); however, it is still unclear to what extent QFR reflects intraluminal stenosis parameters. Given that optical coherence tomography (OCT) is currently the gold standard to assess intraluminal stenosis parameters, we investigated the relationship between OCT-derived lesion geometry and QFR.  Methods:  We determined QFR in 97 lesions from 87 patients who underwent coronary angiography and OCT due to stable angina. QFR was measured with proprietary software and compared with OCT-based assessment of intraluminal stenosis parameters as well as lesion morphology.  Results:  Mean QFR was 0.79 ± 0.10. QFR demonstrated a consistent association with FFR (R = 0.834,  p   p  = 0.015), percent area stenosis (R = 0.412,  p   p   p   2 ) and minimal luminal diameter (ROC = 0.714, optimal cut-off 1.59 mm) presented a good diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing hemodynamic relevance (QFR ≤ 0.80). There was no significant association between QFR and anatomic features of plaque vulnerability.  Conclusion:  OCT-derived intraluminal stenosis parameters are related to QFR values and predict hemodynamic lesion relevance.

(2) Methods: A multi-stage, stratified, cluster random sampling method was used to select 443 hospital administrators in six tertiary public hospitals for study. The data were collected and analyzed using the working hours measuring scale, Maslach burnout, and the subjective well-being schedule. Pearson correlation, structural equation model, and bootstrap tests were conducted to examine the association between job burnout, working hours, and SWB. (3) Results: Among the 443 respondents, 330 worked more than 8 h per day on average (76.2%), 81 had the longest continuous working time more than 16 h (18.7%), and 362 worked overtime on weekends (82.2%). The prevalence of job burnout in hospital administrators was 62.8%, among which, 59.8% have mild burnout and 3.00% have severe burnout. In the dimension of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal achievement, the proportion of people in high burnout was 21.0% (91/433), 15.0% (65/433), and 45.3% (196/433), respectively. Job burnout has a mediating effect between working hours and SWB, which accounted for 95.5% of the total effect.

The majority of the previous studies have investigated the phenomenon of CSR at the employee's level (CSR-E) to influence employee behavior positively. However, the importance of CSR-E to enhance the innovative capability of the employees at the workplace is not well-explored in extant literature. Moreover, it is not clear from previous studies how the concept of servant leadership can explain the employee's engagement towards innovative work behavior (EIB).

The data of the current study were obtained through a self-administered (paper-pencil) survey and they were analyzed through the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The empirical results of SEM analysis revealed that CSR-E and EIB are positively related and servant leadership partially mediates this relationship. The findings of the current study will be helpful for policymakers to improve their understanding towards CSR-E to induce EIB in the time of crisis.

The membrane receptor GPR17 timely regulates the early stages of OPC differentiation; however, after reaching its highest levels in immature oligodendrocytes, it has to be downregulated to allow terminal maturation. Since, in several animal models of disease GPR17 is upregulated, the aim of this work was to characterize GPR17 alterations in MS patients. We developed immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence procedures for the detection of GPR17 in human tissues and stained post-mortem MS brain lesions from patients with secondary progressive MS and control subjects. The inflammatory activity in each lesion was evaluated by immunohistochemistry for the myelin protein MOG and the HLA antigen to classify them as active, chronic inactive or chronic active. Hence, we assessed the distribution of GPR17-positive cells in these lesions compared to normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and white matter (WM) of control subjects. Our data have shown a marked increase of GPR17-expressing oligodendroglial cells accumulating at NAWM, in which moderate inflammation was also found. Furthermore, we identified two distinct subpopulations of GPR17-expressing oligodendroglial cells, characterized by either ramified or rounded morphology, that differently populate the WM of healthy controls and MS patients. We concluded that the coordinated presence of GPR17 in OPCs at the lesion sites and inflamed NAWM areas suggests that GPR17 could be exploited to support endogenous remyelination through advanced pharmacological approaches.","['Multiple sclerosis', 'Neuropathology', 'demyelination', 'Oligodendrocytes']",[],[],NaN

Design: A randomised, single-center, open-label study. Setting: A single hospital. The study was conducted from October 2018 to May 2019. Participants: In total, 109 patients were scheduled for elective total hip replacement. Interventions: Postoperative FICB with 0.375% ropivacaine in conjunction with nonopioid analgesics (paracetamol, metamizole, and pregabalin) and oxycodone as rescue analgesia. Measurements: Pain intensity was measured using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS) at rest and during rehabilitation, the total dose of postoperative oxycodone required, the occurrence of opioid-related adverse events, patient hospitalisation time, and level of satisfaction. Follow-up period: 48 h. Main Results: A total of 109 patients were randomised into two groups and, of these, 9 were subsequently excluded from the analysis (three conversions to general anaesthesia, two failures to perform FICB, four failures to use the PCA pump). Patients in the FICB group received standard intravenous analgesia with FICB, and those in the control group were managed with standard intravenous analgesia only. Pain level measured with NRS was significantly lower at rest and during rehabilitation in the FICB group. Oxycodone use in the first 48 h was significantly higher in the control group (p < 0.001); additionally, the time to the first dose of rescue analgesia was significantly shorter (p < 0.001). In the control group, there was a higher rate of side effects and a significantly longer hospitalisation time (p < 0.001). Similarly, higher satisfaction with the applied analgesic treatment was noted in the FICB group. Conclusions: FICB in elective THR treatments is an effective form of analgesia, which reduces the need for opioids, the number of complications, the length of hospitalisation, and which ensures a high level of patient satisfaction with the analgesic treatment used.

Indigenous data are scarce, but community-based cancer research can inform care in SIDS where formal research capacity is lacking, and we describe the experiences of cancer survivors in Saint Lucia in accessing health services. Purposive and snowball sampling was used to constitute a sample of survivors for interviews. Subjects were interviewed with a questionnaire regarding socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, health services accessed (physicians, tests, treatment), and personal appraisal of experience. We recruited 50 survivors (13 men, 37 women). Only 52% of first presentations were with general practitioners. The mean turnaround for biopsy results in Saint Lucia was three times longer than overseas ( p  = 0.0013). Approximately half of survivors commenced treatment more than one month following diagnosis (median of 32 days, IQR 19-86 days), and 56% of survivors traveled out-of-country for treatment. Most survivors (60%) paid for care with family/friends support, followed by savings and medical insurance (38% each).

Methods This prospective 5-year cohort study of 424 patients, with normal or mildly increased albuminuria, investigated the effect of IH-HSBP on the risk of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetic nephropathy was defined as an advancement from normal or mildly increased albuminuira to moderate or severely increased albuminuria. Results Among 424 patients, 75 developed diabetic nephropathy during the study period.

The secondary endpoints were comparisons of (1) visible or invisible neoplasia on initial endoscopic images of early-stage and advanced cancers, (2) the clinical backgrounds of patients in whom neoplasia was visible or invisible on initial endoscopic images, and (3) the clinical backgrounds of patients with distinct and indistinct UCAN borders. Results Of the 27 UCAN lesions (11 early-stage; 16 advanced-stage), 25.9% ( n  = 7) were initially visible and 74.1% ( n  = 20) were invisible. The mean interval between the last surveillance colonoscopy and UCAN diagnosis was 14.5 ± 6.7 months. Of early-stage cancers, 18.2% ( n  = 2) were visible and 81.8% ( n  = 9) were invisible.

Co-occurrence of ADHD and SUD is described as detrimental to clinical outcome by many authors, while only a few studies describe good clinical results in A-ADHD-SUD patients when they were treated for ADHD, both for the efficacy and the compliance of patients. In this study we tested to determine whether SUD can influence the treatment outcome of A-ADHD patients by correlating lifetime, past and current substance use in A-ADHD patients with their outcome (retention rate) during a 5-year follow-up of patients treated with stimulant and non-stimulant medications, using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis with overall and pairwise comparison. The association between demographic, symptomatological and clinical aspects with retention in treatment, adjusting for potential confounding factors, was summarized using Cox regression. After 5 years of observation, the cumulative treatment retention was 49.0%, 64.3% and 41.8% for A-ADHD patients without lifetime SUD (NSUD/A-ADHD), A-ADHD with past SUD (PSUD/A-ADHD) and A-ADHD with current SUD (CSUD/A-ADHD), respectively.

Male gender was also found to be an independent predictor of reduction of depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were highly prevalent in this target group, and female undergraduates seemed to be more vulnerable to developing such symptoms. Results also indicated that female undergraduates were more likely to implement the protective measures for COVID-19.

We aimed to investigate whether mindfulness (a special way of paying attention: conscious, non-judgmental, and oriented to the present moment) can be related to the SA levels among final-year medical students confronted with life-threatening situations during medical simulations. Methods: The simulations were constructed as high-fidelity scenarios in children and adults (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03761355). The components of mindfulness were assessed using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. SA among students was assessed using The Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique at three levels: (1) data, (2) comprehension, and (3) projection. Results: In total, 117 students were included. Level 1 SA positively correlated with the overall mindfulness score and its components, i.e., nonreactivity, conscious presence, and nonjudgment. Moreover, level 3 SA significantly correlated with the description, but not with the overall mindfulness score.

Since the HRV features that are extracted from RRI data easily fluctuate when arrhythmia occurs, RRI data with arrhythmia need to be modified appropriately before HRV analysis. In this study, we consider two types of extrasystoles—premature ventricular contraction (PVC) and premature atrial contraction (PAC)—which are types of extrasystoles that occur every day, even in healthy persons who have no cardiovascular diseases. A unified framework for ectopic RRI detection and a modification algorithm that utilizes an autoencoder (AE) type of neural network is proposed. The proposed framework consists of extrasystole occurrence detection from the RRI data and modification, whose targets are PVC and PAC. The RRI data are monitored by means of the AE in real time in the detection phase, and a denoising autoencoder (DAE) modifies the ectopic RRI caused by the detected extrasystole. These are referred to as AE-based extrasystole detection (AED) and DAE-based extrasystole modification (DAEM), respectively. The proposed framework was applied to real RRI data with PVC and PAC. The result showed that AED achieved a sensitivity of 93% and a false positive rate of 0.08 times per hour. The root mean squared error of the modified RRI decreased to 31% in PVC and 73% in PAC from the original RRI data by DAEM. In addition, the proposed framework was validated through application to a clinical epileptic seizure problem, which showed that it correctly suppressed the false positives caused by PVC. Thus, the proposed framework can contribute to realizing accurate HRV-based health monitoring and medical sensing systems.","['Extrasystole', 'Machine Learning', 'Heart Rate Variability Analysis', 'Autoencoder', 'Rri Data']",[],[],NaN

Objective To evaluate the test-retest reliability of ST variables and perceived exertion during the 6MWT in PwMS and comparable healthy persons. Methods We explored three 1-min intervals (initial: 0'-1', middle: 2'30″-3'30″, end: 5'-6') of the 6MWT. Six ST variables and perceived exertion were measured (respectively, using the GAITRite system and the Borg Scale). These measurements were performed twice, 1 week apart. The test-retest effects were assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) or the weighted kappa. Results Forty-five PwMS and 24 healthy persons were included. The test-retest reliability of ST variables values was good-to-excellent for PwMS (ICC range: 0.858-0.919) and moderate-to-excellent for healthy persons (ICC range: 0.569-0.946). The test-retest reliability values of perceived exertion were fair for PwMS (weighted kappa range: 0.279-0.376) and substantial for healthy persons (weighted kappa range: 0.734-0.788).

Sixteen were exposed to psychoeducation and were matched to sixteen nonexposed individuals who received their usual treatment. Both groups were compared on insight, treatment adherence, change in the number of hospitalizations and visits to the emergency services, occurrence rate after intervention, and time to the first psychiatric hospitalization and the first urgent attendance. There was a significant reduction in the mean number of hospitalizations and urgent attendances in the exposed group in comparison to the nonexposed group. The first urgent attendance was significantly sooner in the nonexposed cohort. There were no differences between groups in any of the other variables.

Nevertheless, the prevalence and relationship between SDB and severe primary mitral regurgitation (PMR) has not been well investigated to date. Methods: A cohort of 121 patients with significant PMR undergoing mitral valve surgery were prospectively enrolled and received a cardiorespiratory single night polygraphy screening using ApneaLink before surgery. Eighty-two of them underwent a follow-up examination including a follow-up single-night sleep study 3 months after surgery. Results: The mean age of patients was 65.3 ± 12.0 years. Sixty patients (49.6%) were female. The mean EuroSCORE II was 2.5 ± 2.4%. Initially, 91 (75.2%) patients presented with SDB, among whom 50.4% (46 patients, 38.0% of total cohort) were classified as moderate to severe. These patients tended to require significantly longer postoperative intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Among the 82 patients who completed follow-up exams, mitral valve surgery led to a significant reduction in relevant SDB (20.7%). The apnea-hypopnea index (from 11/h [4;18] to 4/h [3;14] (p = 0.04)), the oxygenation-desaturation index (from 8/h [3;18] to 5/h [3;12] (p = 0.008)) as well as the saturation time below 90% (from 32 min [13;86] to 18 min [5;36] (p = 0.005)), were all shown to be improved significantly. Conclusion: The prevalence of SDB is very high in patients with severe primary mitral regurgitation and may contribute to postoperative complications and prolonged intensive care.

Methods: All adults reporting specific PD medication regimens with complete dental examinations were included from the NHANES 2001 to 2018 databases. Sociodemographic, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and Hba1c data were compared according to tooth loss severity, and linear regression analyses on the impact of tooth loss on SBP, DBP and Hba1c levels were conducted. Results: The 214 included participants presented 9.7 missing teeth, 23.8% severe tooth loss and 18.2% total edentulousness. Severe tooth loss cases were significantly older (p < 0.001), had higher smoking prevalence (p = 0.008), chronic medical conditions (p = 0.012) and higher Hba1c (p = 0.001), SBP (p = 0.015) and DBP (p < 0.001) levels. Crude and adjusted linear models revealed a relationship between SBP, DBP and missing teeth; however, age confounded these links (SBP: B = 0.10, SE = 0.16, p < 0.05; DBP: B = 0.16, SE = 0.10, p < 0.05).

To further explore the role of circ_0021205 in CCA, cell functional assays were performed. The results showed that circ_0021205 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CCA cells.  In vivo  experiments showed that circ_0021205 inhibition reduced tumorigenesis in mice.

Methods:  16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to compare the microbial composition of feces. The first sample was collected within 48 h after birth, then once per week until the NEC diagnosis, and finally 1-2 weeks after treatment or 28 days after birth.  Results:  The alpha diversity of the microbiota in the NEC group was higher than that in the control group. Beta diversity analysis showed that the control group had a higher similarity at the onset of NEC, while the NEC group was distributed in subgroups. Linear discriminant analysis effect size and taxonomic composition analyses indicated that the abundance of Bacteroides and Actinobacteria in NEC infants at birth was much higher than that in the control group, and this trend continued until NEC occurred. At this time, Rhizobiales, Dysgonomonas, Ochrobactrum, Ralstonia, Pelomonas, Acinetobacter, etc., were also more abundant in NEC infants. The upregulated different metabolic pathways in the NEC group were mainly concentrated on degradation/utilization/assimilation, biosynthesis, and generation of precursor metabolites and energy.  Conclusions : 1. The microbial community differs according to the time of NEC diagnosis (bounded by 20 days). 2. No single microorganism is related to NEC, and the combined effect of multiple species is of great significance in the occurrence of NEC. Premature infants are easily affected by bacteria living in the environment, and compared with ordinary premature infants, NEC infants have a higher abundance of waterborne bacteria. Therefore, attention should be paid to the contamination of water sources and various ventilator pipelines for premature infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. 3. An in-depth study of the mode of microbial colonization in premature infants combined with the different functions of various metabolic pathways involved in different microorganisms may be able to identify the cause of NEC.","['16S rRNA', 'Newborn', 'Necrotizing enterocolitis', 'risk factors', 'Premature Infants', 'Intestinal Microbiota']","['Jilin University', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'University', 'Statement', 'Committee']",['2018-421).'],NaN

Methods Clinical data of 107 patients who underwent PD for dCCA was retrospectively collected and divided into different groups based on use of FS (FS and non-FS groups) and status of resection margin (pR0, sR0 and R1 groups), and clinical parameters and survival of patients were compared and analyzed accordingly. Results There were 50 patients in FS group with a median survival of 28 months, 57 patients in non-FS group with a median survival of 27 months. There was no statistical difference between the two groups with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis ( P  = 0.347). There were 98 patients in R0 group (88 in pR0 and 10 in sR0) and nine patients in R1 group, with a median survival of 29 months and 22 months respectively, which showed a better survival in R0 group than in R1 group ( P  = 0.006).

However, with early diagnosis and timely treatment, the burden can be mitigated. Family and friends of a person with alcohol use problems are well placed to recognize the signs, encourage professional help-seeking and help the person until treatment is received. We aimed to use the Delphi consensus methodology to develop guidelines about how members of the public can provide this ""mental health first aid"" to someone with problem drinking in China. Methods A Chinese-language questionnaire was developed, comprising statements that were endorsed for inclusion in the English-language problem drinking first aid guidelines for high-income countries. Participants were also encouraged to suggest new statements. These statements were evaluated by two Chinese expert panels - a professional panel and a lived experience panel - on how important they believed each statement was for members of the public providing mental health first aid to a person with problem drinking in China. Three survey rounds were conducted. To be included in the final guidelines, statements had to receive a ""very important"" or ""important"" rating from at least 80% of participants from each of the panels.

A written informed consent was signed by each patient before the operation."," Background Mandibular fractures constitute about 80.79% of maxillofacial injuries in Alexandria University, either as isolated mandibular fractures or as a part of panfacial fractures. The combination of symphyseal and parasymphyseal fractures represent 47.09% of the total mandibular fractures. Aim To compare the effectiveness of lag screws  vs  double Y-shaped miniplates in the fixation of anterior mandibular fractures. Methods This study is a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial, performed on sixteen patients with anterior mandibular fractures. Patients were divided equally into two groups, each consisting of eight patients. Group 1: Underwent open reduction and internal fixation using two lag screws. Group 2: Underwent open reduction and internal fixation using double Y-shaped plates. The following parameters were assessed: operating time in minutes, pain using a visual analog scale, edema, surgical wound healing for signs and symptoms of infection, occlusion status and stability, maximal mouth opening, and sensory nerve function. Cone beam computed tomography was performed at 3 and 6 mo to measure bone density and assess the progression of fracture healing. Results The study included 13 males (81.3%) and 3 females (18.8%) aged 26 to 45 years (mean age was 35.69 ± 6.01 years). The cause of trauma was road traffic accidents in 10 patients (62.5%), interpersonal violence in 3 patients (18.8%) and other causes in 3 patients (18.8%). The fractures comprised 10 parasymphyseal fractures (62.5%) and 6 symphyseal fractures (37.5%).

This raised concerns how ACE2 and the Renin-Angiotensin (Ang)-System (RAS) are to be dealt with given their roles in hypertension and their involvement in COVID-19's morbidity and mortality. Specifically, increased ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) might theoretically increase COVID-19 risk by increasing SARS-CoV-2 binding sites. However, ACE2 is part of the protective counter-regulatory ACE2-Ang1-7-MasR axis, which opposes the classical ACE-AngII-AT1R regulatory axis. We used Gitelman's and Bartter's syndromes (GS/BS) patients, rare genetic tubulopathies that have endogenously increased levels of ACE2, to explore these issues. Specifically, 128 genetically confirmed GS/BS patients, living in Lombardia, Emilia Romagna and Veneto, the Northern Italy hot spots for COVID-19, were surveyed  via  telephone survey regarding COVID-19. The survey found no COVID-19 infection and absence of COVID-19 symptoms in any patient. Comparison analysis with the prevalence of COVID-19 in those regions showed statistical significance ( p  < 0.01). The results of the study strongly suggest that increased ACE2 does not increase risk of COVID-19 and that ACEi and ARBs by blocking excessive AT1R-mediated Ang II activation might favor the increase of ACE2-derived Ang 1-7. GS/BS patients' increased ACE2 and Ang 1-7 levels and their characteristic chronic metabolic alkalosis suggest a mechanism similar to that of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine effect on ACE2 glycosylation alteration with resulting SARS-COV-2 binding inhibition and blockage/inhibition of viral entry. Studies from our laboratory are ongoing to explore GS/BS ACE2 glycosylation and other potential beneficial effects of BS/GS. Importantly, the absence of frank COVID-19 or of COVID-19 symptoms in the BS/GS patients cohort, given no direct ascertainment of COVID-19 status, suggest that elevated ACE2 levels as found in GS/BS patients at a minimum render COVID-19 infection asymptomatic and thus that COVID-19 symptoms are driven by ACE2 levels.","['ACE2', 'Angiotensin Ii Receptor Blockers', 'Bartter Syndrome', 'Gitelman Syndrome', 'Sars-cov-2', 'Angiotensin Conversing Enzyme Inhibitor']","['Statement Ethical', 'Ethical review', 'Ethics Statement', 'institutional requirements', 'local legislation', 'consent', 'Ethics Committee', 'Statement', 'Ethical', 'human participants']",[],NaN

In VSS, changes in cortical excitability in the primary visual cortex and the visual association cortex are discussed, with recent imaging studies tending to point to higher-order visual areas. Migraine, especially migraine with aura, is a common comorbidity. In chronic migraine and episodic migraine with aura but not in episodic migraine without aura, a reduced magnetic suppression of perceptual accuracy (MSPA) reflects a probably reduced inhibition of the primary visual cortex. Here we investigated the inhibition of the primary visual cortex using MSPA in patients with VSS, comparing that with MSPA in controls matched for episodic migraine.  Methods:  Seventeen patients with VSS were compared to 17 age- and migraine-matched controls. Visual accuracy was assessed by letter recognition and modulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation delivered to the occipital cortex at different intervals with respect to the letter presentation (40, 100, and 190 ms).  Results:  Suppression of visual accuracy at the 100-ms interval was present without significant differences between VSS patients and age- and migraine-matched controls (percentage of correctly recognized trigrams, control: 46.4 ± 34.3; VSS: 52.5 ± 25.4,  p  = 0.56).

The purpose of this study was to compare results of the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) between PWE who underwent epilepsy surgery before and during the pandemic period.  Methods:  Participants were PWE who underwent open cranial epilepsy surgery between February 2019 and February 2021 in our hospital.

However, positive and negative attitudes at work might also be influenced by different personal and job resources. While emotional intelligence has been significantly associated with positive job attitudes and personal well-being, no studies have yet examined the joint role of teacher happiness and emotional intelligence in key teacher job attitudes. The present study assesses whether emotional intelligence interacts with levels of teacher happiness to jointly explain important teacher job attitudes (i.e., job satisfaction and turnover intention). A total sample of 685 teaching professionals (431 female) filled out a battery of scales including subjective happiness, emotional intelligence, job satisfaction, and turnover intention. Our results revealed that subjective happiness was significantly associated with both higher job satisfaction and lower turnover intention. Likewise, emotional intelligence was positively related to happiness and job satisfaction, and negatively related to turnover intention. Finally, interaction analysis showed the main effects of happiness and emotional intelligence in explaining teacher job attitudes. Beyond the main effects, the interaction effects of happiness and emotional intelligence were significant in predicting all teachers' job attitude indicators, even controlling for the effects of their sociodemographic variables. This work expands our knowledge about the role of teachers' positive emotions in the development of positive work attitudes, and also supports the inclusion of emotional skills in future teacher preparation programs as resources to facilitate work-related well-being.","['Job Satisfaction', 'Emotional Intelligence', 'Turnover Intention', 'School Teacher', 'Subjective Happiness']","['Ethics Statement', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'Malaga', 'Statement', 'Research']",[],NaN

To date, the link between sensitivity to thyroid hormones and prediabetes remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the association between thyroid hormones sensitivity and risk of prediabetes in both general and euthyroid populations. Methods Participants with serum free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and thyrotropin (TSH) measurements from the health checkup programs of the First Hospital of China Medical University were collected. We measured the parameters representing central and peripheral sensitivities to thyroid hormones (central sensitivity, assessed by calculating Thyroid Feedback Quantile-based Index (TFQI), TSH Index (TSHI), and Thyrotroph Thyroxine Resistance Index (TT4RI); peripheral sensitivity, evaluated by FT3/FT4 ratio). Associations between thyroid hormones sensitivities and risk of prediabetes were assessed with logistic regression. Results A total of 4378 participants (mean age ± SD, 49 ± 11 years) were included, with 1457 (33%) subjects had prediabetes. The risk of prediabetes was negatively associated with levels of TSHI (odds ratio [OR] 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.97), TT4RI (OR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99) and Parametric TFQI (PTFQI) (OR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95) among all subjects. The association remained significant in euthyroid subjects and euthyroid subjects with negative thyroid autoimmunity. Higher FT3/FT4 ratio was associated with a mild increased risk of prediabetes (95% CI 1.09; 1.02-1.16). Compared with subjects in the lowest quartile of PTFQI, those in the highest quartile had lower risk of prediabetes (0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.84).

According to appendectomy and autopsy reports, benign adenomas of the appendix are sporadically reported, accounting for ~0.02-0.08% cases. Presentation of case We report the case of a 58-year-old woman with a segmental polyp protruding into the appendiceal orifice. The polyp was spotted during lower gastrointestinal endoscopy; however, treatment was postponed at the patient's request. During a confirmatory lower gastrointestinal endoscopy for treatment, the polyp was no longer found protruding from the appendiceal orifice and had disappeared. An appendicectomy was performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Pathological examination showed a low-degree atypical tubular adenoma with no malignant findings. Discussion Despite the risk of perforation, surgical resection remains the gold standard for treating appendiceal adenoma. Resection can be performed endoscopically if the stem and base of the adenoma can be identified. In the present case, laparoscopy was a good indication from the safety standpoint, and it was radically curative. Furthermore, upon performing an appendectomy, the patient was informed of the risks of cancer-related complications or the need for additional resection. Conclusion This suggestive case proves that appendiceal tumors can disappear endoscopically depending on the timing of examination and treatment.","['Case Report', 'Benign Adenoma', 'Atypical Tubular Adenoma', 'Laparoscopically Assisted Appendectomy', 'Primary Appendix']","['Ethics statement', 'questions related', 'appropriately investigated', 'work', 'Ethics', 'resolved', 'statement', 'authors', 'accountable', 'aspects']",[],NaN

However, patients with type A acute aortic dissection (AAD) during pregnancy can seriously endanger the health of either the mother or fetus that requires emergency surgical treatment without the test for COVID-19.  CASE SUMMARY  A 38-year-old woman without Marfan syndrome was admitted to the hospital because of chest pain in the 34th week of gestation. She has diagnosed as having a Stanford type-A AAD involving an aortic arch and descending aorta via aortic computed tomographic angiography. The patient was transferred to the isolated negative pressure operating room in one hour and underwent cesarean delivery and ascending aorta replacement. All medical staff adopted third-level medical protection measures throughout the patient transfer and surgical procedure. After surgery, the patient was transferred to the isolated negative pressure intensive care unit ward. The nucleic acid test and anti-COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM were performed and were negative. The patient and infant were discharged without complication nine days later and recovered uneventfully.  CONCLUSION  The results indicated that the procedure that we used is feasible in patients with a combined cesarean delivery and surgery for Stanford type-A AAD during the COVID-19 outbreak, which was mainly attributed to rapid multidisciplinary consultation, collaboration, and quick decision-making.","['Pregnancy', 'Case Report', 'Acute Aortic Dissection', 'Covid-19 Outbreak']",[],[],NaN

Methods This paper presents the results of a citizen forum that included 73 participants. A research tool titled ""the mechanics of consent"" was designed for this study. This tool is a table encouraging participants to reflect on social and research actors, types of data, and desired levels of control while sharing different types of data with different actors. Participants' discussion that led to the completion of each table were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results The results are a compilation of responses from the mechanics of consent tool divided into two sections; the first presents quantitative results of collective responses regarding attitudes to consent to donate their data. The second section present qualitative findings emerged from the discussion amongst participants. Discussion Choice and control of personal data is crucial for the public to be able to decide who and how to trust. Key information to be disclosed to potential research participants shall include information about potential risks and benefits; who will be accessing and using their data; as well as assurances that their choice will be respected. Furthermore, researchers ought to make sure they are trustworthy, by acting in a competent, reliable, and honest manner.

Methods A total of 3339 patients were randomized to either an invasive (n = 1681) or a conservative (n = 1658) strategy in the TIMI II study following thrombolysis. To make the current cohort as relevant as possible to modern pharmaco-invasively managed cohorts, patients in the invasive arm with TIMI flow grade ≥ 2 (N = 1201) at initial catheterization are included in the analysis. Of these, 259 patients had a second catheterization prior to hospital discharge, and these were used to define the natural history of LVEDP in reperfused STEMI. Results The median LVEDP for the whole cohort was 18 mmHg (IQR: 12-23). Patients were divided into quartiles by LVEDP measured during the first cardiac catheterization. During a median follow up of 3 (IQR: 2.1-3.2) years, quartile 4 (highest LVEDP) had the highest incidence of mortality and heart failure admissions. In the cohort with paired catheterization data, the LVEDP dropped slightly from 18 mmHg (1QR: 12-22) to 15 mmHg (IQR: 10-20) (p = 0.01) from the first to the pre-hospital discharge catheterization. Conclusions LVEDP remains largely stable during hospitalisation post-STEMI.

To achieve these goals, a robust prediction of the remaining survival time is useful as it can provide patients and their relatives with information for individual goal setting including appropriate priorities. The Aim of our study was to assess factors that influence survival after enrollment into ambulatory palliative care. Methods In this cross-sectional, multicenter study (n = 14 study centers) clinical records of all palliative care patients who were treated in 2017 were extracted and underwent statistical analysis. The main outcome criterion was the association of survival time with clinical characteristics such as age, type of disease, symptoms and performance status. Results A total of 6282 cases were evaluated. Median time of survival was 26 days (95 % CI: 25-27 days). The strongest association for an increased hazard ratio was found for the following characteristics: moderate/severe weakness (aHR: 1.91; 95 % CI: 1.27-2.86) Karnofsky score 10-30 (aHR: 1.80; 95 % CI: 1.67-1.95), and age > 85 (aHR: 1.50; 95 % CI: 1.37-1.64).

The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.," Background Current therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) frequently includes immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positivity is mandatory for its use in this setting. Vimentin plays a role in carcinogenesis through the activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Its prognostic impact in NSCLC has been investigated in numerous studies but little data are available on its relation with PD-L1 expression. Patients and methods We retrospectively retrieved data on patients with advanced NSCLC consecutively enrolled in a clinical trial at our institute. PD-L1 and vimentin expression were determined by immunohistochemistry. Correlations between variables were assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and the Log-rank test was used to compare survival curves. The association between demographic, clinical and biomarker information and survival was investigated with the Cox model. Results Fifty-three patients were included in the study. A weak positive correlation was observed between the PD-L1 and vimentin (ρ=0.41,  P =0.003). Patients with PD-L1 values  P =0.080). No difference in overall survival (OS) was observed on the basis of vimentin expression (HR=1.25; 95% CI: 0.59-2.66;  P =0.554). Patients harboring both vimentin and PD-L1 negative expression ( P =0.093). No significant associations were observed between gender, age at diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, histology, KRAS or EGFR status, radical surgery or immunotherapy and OS. Conclusions The weak positive association between PD-L1 and vimentin suggests a potential interplay between these biomarkers.

Sevoflurane is preferred over halothane for its faster induction of anesthesia and lesser complications. Studies on sevoflurane in pediatrics have established it as safe and effective. However, its effectiveness in adults is very limited. Hence, this study was conducted to compare the induction and intubating conditions, hemodynamic profiles, and emergence from anesthesia with sevoflurane and halothane in adults and pediatric patients. This randomized clinical study was carried out for a period of 2 years (November 2006-September 2008) in the Anesthesiology Department of a Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (Deemed to be) University. Eighty patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I and II were randomly assigned to halothane group and sevoflurane group with 40 patients in each group. Patients were induced and intubated with increasing concentrations of halothane from 0.5% to 5% and sevoflurane 1% to 7% in 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen mixture. Recordings of vitals including induction and intubation time, recovery characteristics, and recovery and discharge time was also recorded. There was a statistically significant difference between sevoflurane and halothane in the induction and intubation time indicating that sevoflurane had faster induction and shorter intubation time compared to that of halothane. Patients in halothane group had more incidence of coughing, intolerance, salivation, breathe holding, rigidity, and movement as compared to sevoflurane group. The mean time to consciousness, response to verbal commands, orientation, and recovery room discharge time was significantly shorter in sevoflurane group as compared to halothane group. Sevoflurane can be a suitable alternative to halothane for induction of anesthesia in patients with a shorter induction and intubation time with better hemodynamic stability.

The patients received the combination of oral apatinib 250 mg qd and osimertinib 80 mg qd. The efficacy was evaluated after the first month then every 2 months thereafter. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The overall response rate (ORR) and the disease control rate (DCR) of the combination of apatinib and osimertinib was 12.8% (5/39) and 79.5% (31/39), respectively.

They have expressed concerns regarding applied behavior analysis (ABA) interventions on a number of grounds, one of which is the prevalence of conflicts of interests (COIs) among autism intervention researchers. These concerns are now also being addressed by non-autistic researchers. COIs can introduce bias into the research process, and allow researchers to demonstrate positive effects for interventions that are not actually effective. Despite these concerns, there are no studies to date that examine the prevalence of COIs in behavioral journals. Because ABA services are routinely provided to autistic people in the United States as a means to address difficulties experienced by autistic people, this is an important area of investigation. We tallied author COIs in articles published over a 1-year period that tested, commented on, or reviewed ABA autism intervention strategies, extracted from eight journals devoted to publishing behavioral research.

Secondary pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) in UTI, though less common, is a known association. Features include hyponatremia and concomitant hyperkalemia.  Objectives:  We aim to highlight these uncommon sequelae in UTI to avoid incorrect diagnosis and unnecessary investigations.  Study Design:  Clinical data of patients admitted and referred to a pediatric nephrologist at the University Malaya Medical Center between May 2019 and October 2020 were collated and elaborated.  Results and Discussion:  We report three infants with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia during UTI episodes. Two infants were known to have posterior urethral valve (PUV) before the onset of UTI and one infant had UTI, which led to investigations confirming the diagnosis of bladder vaginal fistula. The electrolyte derangements were temporary and resolved within 48 to 72 h of treatment with intravenous fluid and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Out of three, only one had a hormonal study, which confirms PHA. Reduced aldosterone activity could be due to absolute reduction in aldosterone titer or lack of aldosterone responsiveness at tubular (other tissues) level. In the latter, aldosterone titer is elevated. The infant in our cohort who had hormonal evaluation had the mentioned electrolyte abnormalities with a markedly elevated aldosterone titer. This demonstrated defective action of the hormone at the level of mineralocorticoid receptor. Although the remaining two infants had no confirmatory hormonal study, all of them recovered within 48 h of hospital admission, after receiving appropriate management for the primary problem, which was UTI. We observed a slower recovery of hyponatremia in relation to hyperkalemia, but none of these infants required salt replacement upon discharge.  Conclusion:  Infants with severe UTI and deranged electrolytes should be screened for structural abnormality and vice versa. Not all infants require hormonal screening, but those who required prolonged salt replacement or showed involvement of other systems warrant further evaluation.","['Urinary tract infection', 'Hyponatremia', 'Hyperkalemia', 'Pseudohypoaldosteronism', 'Congenital Anomaly Of Kidney And Urinary Tract (Cakut)']","['Statement Written', 'Ethics Statement', 'legal guardian', 'Written informed', 'informed consent', 'potentially identifiable', 'identifiable images', 'data included', 'Statement', 'Written']",[],NaN

Therefore, this qualitative study explores these systemic barriers to a fair sharing of health data from the perspectives of Swiss stakeholders.  Methods:  Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit 48 experts active in the Swiss healthcare domain, from the research/policy-making field and those having a high position in a health data enterprise (e.g., health register, hospital IT data infrastructure or a national health data initiative). Semi-structured interviews were then conducted, audio-recorded, verbatim transcribed with identifying information removed to guarantee the anonymity of participants. A theoretical thematic analysis was then carried out to identify themes and subthemes related to the topic of systemic fairness for sharing health data.  Results:  Two themes related to the topic of systemic fairness for sharing health data were identified, namely (i) the hypercompetitive environment and (ii) the legal uncertainty blocking data sharing. The theme, hypercompetitive environment was further divided into two subthemes, (i) systemic contradictions to fair data sharing and the (ii) need of fair systemic attribution mechanisms.  Discussion:  From the perspectives of Swiss stakeholders, hypercompetition in the Swiss academic system is hindering the sharing of health data for secondary research purposes, with the downside effect of influencing researchers to embrace individualism for career opportunities, thereby opposing the data sharing movement. In addition, there was a perceived sense of legal uncertainty from legislations governing the sharing of health data, which adds unreasonable burdens on individual researchers, who are often unequipped to deal with such facets of their data sharing activities.","['Legislation', 'data sharing', 'Health Policy', 'Health Data', 'Attribution Mechanisms', 'Systemic Fairness']","['Statement Ethical', 'institutional requirements', 'Ethics Statement', 'local legislation', 'study', 'Ethical review', 'requirements', 'Statement', 'participants', 'project']",['EKNZ'],NaN

All participants and the guardians of child participants were informed of the study objectives, procedures, and potential risks. Meanwhile, written informed consent was personally signed by each adult participants, and parents or guardians were asked to provide written consent on behalf of child participants at sampling sites before collection of fecal samples involved in our study. The personal information of all participants has remained confidential."," Background:  Clonorchiasis is a serious food-borne parasitic disease caused by  Clonorchis sinensis  infection.  C. sinensis , a major fish-borne trematode, is a known causative agent of cholangiocarcinoma. The risk factors for  C. sinensis  infection include individual eating behaviors and environmental factors. In this study, we evaluated the  C. sinensis  infection rate and the associated risk factors among residents in Binyang County, Guangxi, China.  Methods:  In 2016 and 2017, five villages from Binyang, Guangxi were selected by multistage cluster random sampling for a cross-sectional study. A modified Kato-Katz thick smear method was used to examine  C. sinensis  eggs in fecal samples in triplicate (three smears for each sample). Both uni-variate and multi-variate logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify the risk factors for  C. sinensis  infection.  Results:  A total of 1,977 fecal samples were collected from villagers in the investigated areas. The overall infection rates of  C. sinensis  in Binyang County was 20.49% (405/1,977). The mean age of participants was 39.42 ± 23.48 (range: 3-89 years old), and the highest infection rate (33.72%) was seen in the age group of 40-49 years old, followed by those aged 50-59 (31.83%). Multi-variate logistic regression analysis showed that higher infection rates were significantly associated with males ( aOR  = 6.51,  95% CI  = 4.67-9.08), Zhuang ( aOR  = 2.41,  95% CI  = 1.62-3.59), ages ( aOR  = 33.51,  95% CI  = 10.13-110.86), frequency of raw fresh fish consumption ( aOR  = 14.56,  95% CI  = 9.80-21.63), and close contact with cats and dogs ( aOR  = 1.53,  95% CI  = 1.02-2.30). Occupations and education levels showed no significant association with  C. sinensis  infection ( P  > 0.05).  Conclusions:  High levels of  C. sinensis  infection were observed among residents in Binyang County, Guangxi. Intervention strategies should be strengthened among the investigated population at high risk, such as males, Zhuang and older individuals, especially those who frequently eat raw fresh fish. In addition, the individuals contacting with cats and/or dogs were observed to have significantly higher infection rate of  C. sinensis  than those having no contact with cats and dogs. The association between contacting with cats and/or dogs and  C. sinensis  infection needs to be explored and confirmed in the future study by more epidemiological investigations of human  C. sinensis  infection from different areas.","['Guangxi', 'Prevalence', 'Risk factor', 'Clonorchis sinensis', 'Logistic Analysis']","['Chinese Center', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Disease Control', 'Statement Ethical', 'National Institute', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethical approval', 'involving human', 'human stool']",['201401).'],NaN

Abnormal function of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is closely associated with changes in blood pressure. As an essential factor in the RAAS, angiotensin II (Ang II) contributes to vasoconstriction and inflammatory responses. However, the effects of overproduction of Ang II on the whole body-metabolism have been unclear. In this study, we established a hypertensive mouse model by micro-osmotic pump perfusion of Ang II, and the maximum systolic blood pressure reached 140 mmHg after 2 weeks. By ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the metabolites in the serum of hypertensive model and control mice were analyzed. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) in both positive and negative ionization modes showed clear separation of the two groups. Perfusion of Ang II induced perturbations of multiple metabolic pathways in mice, such as steroid hormone biosynthesis and galactose metabolism. Tandem mass spectrometry revealed 40 metabolite markers with potential diagnostic value for hypertension. Our data indicate that non-targeted metabolomics can reveal biochemical pathways associated with Ang II-induced hypertension. Although researches about the clinical use of these metabolites as potential biomarkers in hypertension is still needed, the current study improves the understanding of systemic metabolic response to sustained release of Ang II in hypertensive mice, providing a new panel of biomarkers that may be used to predict blood pressure fluctuations in the early stages of hypertension.","['Mice', 'Hypertension', 'Angiotensin II', 'Biomarkers', 'LC-MS', 'Metabolomics', 'Serum Metabolites']","['Jiangnan University', 'Ethics Committee', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Ethics Statement', 'Experimentation Ethics', 'animal study', 'Committee', 'Jiangnan', 'University', 'License']",[],NaN

Method:  Seven mongrel dogs were administered propranolol and continuously exposed to left superior ganglionated plexi (LSGP) stimulation, LSGP + low-level VOM stimulation, LSGP + atropine administration, LSGP + VOM filling with ethanol separately. The effective refractory period (ERP) and window of vulnerability (WOV) at the left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV), left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV) and left atrial appendage (LAA) were measured.  Result:  LSGP stimulation significantly shortens the ERP and prolonged the ERP dispersion and WOV in LSPV, LIPV, and LAA. Interestingly, low-level VOM stimulation, atropine administration, or VOM filling with ethanol were able to attenuate the effects of LSGP in all sites.

Evidence suggests that alterations to the gut microbiota may be involved in the development of autoimmune disorders. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition of gut microbiota in GD patients. Fecal samples were collected from 55 GD patients and 48 healthy controls. Using 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing, the overall bacterial richness and diversity were found to be similar between GD patients and healthy controls. However, principal coordinate analysis and partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that the overall gut microbiota composition was significantly different (ANOSIM; p  Firmicutes  phylum decreased in GD patients, with a corresponding increase in  Bacteroidetes  phylum compared to healthy controls. In addition, the families  Prevotellaceae , and  Veillonellaceae  and the genus  Prevotella_9  were closely associated with GD patients, while the families  Lachnospiraceae  and  Ruminococcaceae  and the genera  Faecalibacterium ,  Lachnospira , and  Lachnospiraceae NK4A136  were associated with healthy controls. Metagenomic profiles analysis yielded 22 statistically significant bacterial taxa: 18 taxa were increased and 4 taxa were decreased. Key bacterial taxa with different abundances between the two groups were strongly correlated with GD-associated clinical parameters using Spearman's correlation analysis. Importantly, the discriminant model based on predominant microbiota could effectively distinguish GD patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.825). Thus, the gut microbiota composition between GD patients and healthy controls is significantly difference, indicating that gut microbiota may play a role in the pathogenesis of GD. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the role of gut microbiota in the development of GD.","['16S rRNA', 'Graves’ disease', 'Next-generation Sequencing', 'Gut Microbiota', 'Clinical Parameters']","['Memorial Hospital', 'Review Board', 'Chang Gung', 'Gung Memorial', 'Institutional Review', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

This study aimed to measure Yam Daabo interventions' effects on contraceptive use in Burkina Faso at twelve months after completion of the intervention. Methods Yam Daabo was a two-group, multi-intervention, single-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial. Interventions comprised refresher training for the provider, a counseling tool, supportive supervision, availability of contraceptive services 7 days a week, client appointment cards, and invitation letters for partners. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models (log Poisson) to compare the modern contraceptive prevalence at 12 months post-intervention in the two groups. We collected data between September and November 2018. We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis and adjusted the prevalence ratios on cluster effects and unbalanced baseline characteristics. Results Twelve months after the completion of the Yam Daabo trial, we interviewed 87.4% (485 out of 555 women with available data at 12 months, that is, 247/276 in the intervention group (89.5%) and 238/279 in the control group (85.3%). No difference was observed in the use of hormonal contraceptive methods between the intervention and control groups (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.91-1.61], p = 0.191). By contrast, women in the intervention group were more likely to use long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) than those in the control group (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.35; 95% CI = [1.08-1.69], p = 0.008). Conclusion Twelve months after completion of the intervention, we found no significant difference in hormonal contraceptive use between women in the intervention and their control group counterparts. However, women in the intervention group were significantly more likely to use long-acting reversible contraceptives than those in the control group.

The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.," Purpose Agonistic  β 2-adrenergic receptor autoantibodies ( β 2-agAAbs) were recently observed in sera of patients with ocular hypertension (OHT), primary (POAG), and secondary open-angle glaucoma (SOAG), yet not in healthy controls (HCs). It was the aim of the present study to investigate the presence of  β 2-agAAb in aqueous humor (AH) samples of OAG patients and to correlate these with the corresponding  β 2-agAAb serum data. Material and methods Thirty-nine patients (21 male, 18 female) were recruited from the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Erlangen-Nürnberg: twenty-one POAG, 18 SOAG. Aqueous humor samples were collected during minimal invasive glaucoma surgery. Serum and AH samples were analyzed for  β 2-agAAb by a bioassay quantifying the beating rate of cultured cardiomyocyte (cut-off: 2 U). Results Thirty-six of 39 (92.3%) and 34 of 39 (87.2%) of OAG patients showed a  β 2-agAAb in their sera and AH samples, respectively. All  β 2-agAAb AH-positive OAG patients were also seropositive. We also observed a  β 2-agAAb seropositivity in 95 and 89% of patients with POAG and SOAG, respectively. Beta2-agAAbs were seen in 86% (POAG) and 78% (SOAG) of AH samples. The  β 2-agAAb adrenergic activity was increased in the AH of patients with POAG (6.5 ± 1.5 U) when compared with those with SOAG (4.1 ± 1.1 U; p = 0.004). Serum  β 2-agAAb adrenergic activity did not differ between the cohorts [POAG (4.5 ± 1.5 U); SOAG (4.6 ± 2.1 U; p=0.458)]. No correlation of the beating rates were observed between serum and AH samples for group and subgroup analyses. Conclusion The detection of  β 2-agAAb in systemic and local circulations supports the hypothesis of a direct functional impact of these agAAbs on ocular G-protein coupled receptors. The high prevalence of  β 2-agAAb in serum and AH samples of patients with POAG or SOAG suggests a common role of these AAbs in the etiopathogenesis of glaucoma, independent of open-angle glaucoma subtype.","['Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'glaucoma', 'Aqueous Humor', 'ß2-adrenergic Receptor']","['Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'ethics committee', 'Erlangen', 'human participants', 'Statement', 'Ethics', 'participants', 'participants provided']",[],NaN

However, previous methods are invasive and lack easy handling. A disposable, non-invasive temperature sensor using the heat flux approach (Double Sensor), was tested against the standard method: an esophagus thermometer.  Methods:  The sensor was placed on the forehead of adult patients ( n  = 25, M/F, median age 61 years) with return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest undergoing targeted temperature management. The recorded temperatures were compared to the established measurement method of an esophageal thermometer. A paired  t -test was performed to examine differences between methods. A Bland-Altman-Plot and the intraclass correlation coefficient were used to assess agreement and reliability. To rule out possible influence on measurements, the patients' medication was recorded as well.  Results:  Over the span of 1 year and 3 months, data from 25 patients were recorded. The  t -test showed no significant difference between the two measuring methods ( t  = 1.47,  p  = 0.14,  n  = 1,319). Bland-Altman results showed a mean bias of 0.02°C (95% confidence interval 0.00-0.04) and 95% limits of agreement of -1.023°C and 1.066°C. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.94. No skin irritation or allergic reaction was observed where the sensor was placed. In six patients the bias differed noticeably from the rest of the participants, but no sex-based or ethnicity-based differences could be identified. Influences on the measurements of the Double Sensor by drugs administered could also be ruled out.  Conclusions:  This study could demonstrate that measuring the core body temperature with the non-invasive, disposable sensor shows excellent reliability during targeted temperature management after survived cardiac arrest. Nonetheless, clinical research concerning the implementation of the sensor in other fields of application should be supported, as well as verifying our results by a larger patient cohort to possibly improve the limits of agreement.","['Hypothermia', 'Core body temperature', 'Cardiac arrest', 'Return Of Spontaneous Circulation', 'Intraclass Correlation Coefficient', 'Targeted Temperature Management', 'Heat-Flux Sensor']","['Universitätsmedizin Berlin', 'Charité Universitätsmedizin', 'Ethics Statement', 'committee Charité', 'Ethics committee', 'Berlin', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Charité', 'Universitätsmedizin']",[],NaN

It has been reported previously that abdominal vibration and ring massage therapy can significantly improve the symptoms of insomnia patients, enhance the activity of neurons. In addition, functional MRI (resting state brain functional magnetic resonance imaging [Rs_fMRI]) of the resting state brain test has proved that the functional connection between hypothalamus and parahippocampal gyrus could be significantly enhanced after abdominal massage treatment. It has been confirmed that there is possible involvement of brain–gut interaction effect in the treatment of insomnia, but there is a lack of research to elucidate the possible mechanisms of brain–gut interaction in the treatment of insomnia.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a novel NIR system in visualizing indocyanine green fluorescence images in the surgical field and the application value of combined methylene blue (MB) and the novel NIR system in SLNB. Methods Sixty patients with clinical node-negative breast cancer received indocyanine green (ICG) and MB as tracers. Two NIR system instruments, namely, lymphatic fluorescence imaging system (LFIS) designed by the University of Science and Technology of China and vascular imager by Langfang Mingde Medical Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Langfang vascular imager), were used as navigation assistance to locate sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Excising the lymph nodes developed by both MB and ICG by two NIR systems or palpably suspicious as SLNs and undergoing rapid pathological examination. Results Both instruments exhibited 95% (57/60) success for real-time lymphatic fluorescent images. A total of 186 SLNs were identified, of which two were pathologically confirmed as lacking any lymph node tissue. SLN identification rate was 100% (184/184) for MB plus LFIS and 86.96% (160/184) for MB alone. The median number of SLNs identified by LFIS combined with MB was 3 (range of 1-8), which was significantly higher than that by MB alone at 2 (range 1-7) (P Conclusion LFIS effectively detects SLNs in breast cancer, projects the fluorescence signals during surgery, and provides a continuous surgical navigation system without the need for a remote monitor. The ICG method navigated by combined LFIS and MB may be a promising alternative tracer for radioisotope in SLN mapping.

The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.,"A number of studies have demonstrated pragmatic language difficulties in people with Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders. However, research about how people with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders understand scalar implicatures (SIs) is surprisingly rare, since SIs have generated much of the most recent literature. Scalar implicatures are pragmatic inferences, based on linguistic expressions like  some ,  must ,  or , which are part of a scale of informativeness (e.g.,  some/many/all ). Logically, the less informative expressions imply the more informative ones, but pragmatically people usually infer that the presence of a less informative term implies that the more informative term was not applicable. In one of the few existing studies with people with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, Wampers et al. (2018) observed that in general, people with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders were less likely to derive SIs than controls. The current study has three main aims. First, we want to replicate the original finding with the scalar terms  some-all . Second, we want to investigate how these patients deal with different scalar terms, that is, we want to investigate if scalar diversity is also observed in this clinical group. Third, we investigate the role of working memory, often seen as another important mechanism to enable inferring SIs. Twenty-one individuals with a psychotic disorder and 21 matched controls answered 54 under-informative statements, in which seven different pairs of scalar terms were used. In addition, working memory capacity was measured. Patients with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders did not make more logical interpretations when processing quantifiers, disconfirming Wampers et al. (2018). However, certain scalar scales elicited more pragmatic interpretations than others, which is in line with the scalar diversity hypothesis. Additionally, we observed only partial evidence for the role of working memory. Only for the scalar scale  and-or , a significant effect of working memory was observed. The implications of these results for patients with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are discussed, but also the role of working memory for pragmatic inferences, as well as the place of SIs in experimental pragmatics.","['Working memory', 'Pragmatics', 'Experimental Pragmatics', 'Schizophrenia Spectrum And Other Psychotic Disorders', 'Scalar Implicature']","['University Psychiatric', 'Psychiatric Center', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Leuven', 'human participants', 'Ethics', 'Statement']",[],NaN

Methods:  A standardization of the risk factors for stroke was performed according to an implementation plan of stroke in a high-risk population screening and intervention project in Shandong Province. Of the 231,289 residents, 8,603 patients with a previous TIA were identified and risk factors in this cohort were analyzed for sex differences.  Results:  In our initial cohort of 231,289 residents, we found 3,390 men and 5,213 women with TIA, accounting for a prevalence of 3.1 and 4.2%, respectively. Risk factors for TIA were hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, smoking, lack of exercise, overweight, and family history of stroke. In our TIA cohort, we found that the prevalence of smoking was significantly higher in men (41.3%) compared with that found in women (4.2%). Further, hypertension (58.8 vs. 55.5%) and family history of stroke (22.3 vs. 20.0%) were more prevalent in men compared with women, whereas atrial fibrillation (AF) (14.7 vs. 16.4%), diabetes (11.1 vs. 13.2%), lack of exercise (27.2 vs. 28.0%), and overweight (29.5 vs. 35.7%) were less prevalent.

Several countries recommend levetiracetam, carbamazepine, sodium valproate, oxcarbazepine, and lamotrigine as first-line drugs. Nevertheless, some of these drugs are associated with cognitive decline. Available studies that investigated the efficacy of levetiracetam and sodium valproate on BECTS involved small sample sizes. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of levetiracetam and sodium valproate on cognition, and to investigate the prognostic factors for BECTS as whole.  Methods:  Clinical data and treatment status of all patients with BECTS at Xiangya Hospital, Central South University followed from 2008 to 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Since electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) has been confirmed to play a role in cognitive deterioration, in order to evaluate the response to drugs and their cognitive effects, we created two groups of patients according to the levels of spike wave index (SWI): group 1; 0-50% SWI and group 2; >50% SWI at the last follow up.  Results:  A total of 195 cases were enrolled: 49.7% received monotherapies, 24.1% duotherapies and 27.2% polytherapies. Medications included; levetiracetam plus other drug (s) (75.9%), levetiracetam alone (32.8%), sodium valproate plus other drug (s) (31.3%), and sodium valproate alone (5.1%). After 2 years of treatment and follow up, 71% of the cases had a good seizure outcome, 15.9% had an improvement of SWI, and 91.7% had a normal DQ/IQ. Sodium valproate combined with levetiracetam, and sodium valproate alone correlated with good improvement of SWI, whereas, focal spikes were linked with poor improvement. For both groups (group 1 and group 2): monotherapy, levetiracetam alone, and a normal DQ/IQ at seizure onset correlated with good cognitive outcomes, in contrast, polytherapy, sodium valproate plus other drug (s), levetiracetam plus sodium valproate, an initial SWI of ≥85%, and multifocal spikes were linked to cognitive deterioration.  Conclusions:  Monotherapy, particularly levetiracetam seems to be a good first-line therapy which can help in normalizing the electroencephalograph and preventing cognitive decline. Polytherapy, mostly the administration of sodium valproate seems to relate with poor cognition, therefore, it is recommended to avoid it.","['Cognition', 'Treatment', 'Intellectual Disability', 'Levetiracetam', 'Benign Childhood Epilepsy With Centrotemporal Spikes', 'Sodium Valporate']","['South University', 'Ethics Statement', 'Xiangya Hospital', 'Central South', 'Institutional Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'Hospital Central', 'studies involving', 'Ethics', 'involving human']",[],NaN

There are many different types of placebos with different effects on health-related variables. This study investigated placebo effects in the context of religious beliefs and practices. The participants received an inert substance (tap water) along with the verbal suggestion that the water would come from the sanctuary in Lourdes (a major Catholic pilgrimage site with reports of miracle cures). We investigated changes in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in three brain networks (default-mode, salience, cognitive control) associated with the drinking of the placebo water.  Methods : A total of 37 females with the belief that water from the sanctuary in Lourdes has positive effects on their spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being participated in this placebo study with two sessions. The participants drank tap water that was labeled ""Lourdes water"" (placebo) before a 15-min resting-state scan in one session. In the other (control) session, they received tap water labeled as tap water. The participants rated their affective state (valence, arousal) during the session and were interviewed concerning specific thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations directly after each of the two sessions.  Results : The placebo reduced rsFC in the frontoparietal cognitive control network and increased rsFC in the salience network (insular-cerebellar connectivity). During the session, the participants rated their affective state as very pleasant and calm. The ratings did not differ between the two conditions. Immediately after the session, the participants reported increased intensity of pleasant bodily sensations (e.g., feelings of warmth, tingling) and feelings (e.g., gratefulness) for the ""Lourdes water"" condition.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 on the intervals and outcomes of TACE in HCC patients. Materials and methods This retrospective study included 154 HCC patients who underwent follow-up after TACE treatment from January 2020 to March 2020 (n = 71, study group) and January 2019 to March 2019 (n = 83, control group) at two institutions in China. The endpoints included the follow-up interval and overall response rate (ORR). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for a worse ORR. The cut-off point was determined to divide follow-up durations into long- and short-intervals. Results The median follow-up interval was 82.0 days (IQR, 61-109) in the study group, which was significantly longer than 66.0 days (IQR, 51-94) in the control group ( P  = 0.004). The ORR was 23.9 and 39.8% in the study and control group, respectively ( P  = 0.037). The cut-off value was 95 days. The grouping (OR, 2.402; 95% CI, 1.040-5.546;  P  = 0.040), long interval (OR, 2.573; 95% CI, 1.022-6.478;  P  = 0.045), and China liver cancer staging system (OR, 2.500; 95% CI, 1.797-3.480;  P  0.001) were independent predictors for the efficacy of TACE treatment. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic causes a longer follow-up interval in general, which may further lead to a lower ORR in HCC patients.

However, effective behaviour change interventions are largely absent in routine encounters. The Train4Health project, a European strategic partnership for higher education, sought to address this problem. The primary aim of this study, which is part of an early work package, was to develop an interprofessional competency framework for health and other professions to support behaviour change for the self-management of chronic disease at a European level. A secondary aim was to derive a set of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) from an established taxonomy to link with framework competencies. Methods The study comprised two interlinked parts. Part 1 involved a two-round e-Delphi study with an interprofessional panel of 48 experts across 12 European countries to develop the behaviour change competency framework. Preparatory work included drafting a list of competency statements based on seven existing frameworks. Part 2 involved an expert panel of six behavioural psychologists deriving a set of BCTs to link with framework competencies. Their feedback was based on preparatory work, which focused on seven high priority chronic diseases for self-management, identified through European projects on self-management and identifying five relevant target behaviours from key clinical guidelines. A literature search yielded 29 effective BCTs for the target behaviours in the selected chronic diseases. Results Twenty-seven competency statements, were presented in Round 1 to the Delphi panel. Consensus was achieved for all statements. Based on comments, two statements were removed, one was added, and 14 were modified. All 15 statements subjected to Round 2 were consensus-approved, yielding a total of 12 foundational competencies for behaviour change in self-management of chronic disease and 14 behaviour change competencies. Four behaviour change competencies related to BCTs. Behavioural psychologists' feedback led to a core set of 21 BCTs deemed applicable to the five target behaviours across the seven chronic diseases.

Methods:  A subpopulation analysis ( N  = 171) was conducted within a larger, nation-wide cross-sectional study of Malaysian healthcare worker psychological distress from March 18-21, 2020. Current suicidal ideation was measured with item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The following independent variables were assessed: socio-demographic profile, occupation and service-related factors, health-anxiety (Health Anxiety Inventory, HAI), lifetime anxiety disorder and severity of depression (PHQ-9).  Results:  The proportion of healthcare workers with current suicidal ideation (19/171) and clinical depression (17/171) were 11.1 and 9.9%, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that clinical depression was the most significant factor associated with current suicidal ideation ( p   p  = 0.001, OR = 115.984, 95% CI = 2.977-85.804). Service duration of more than 10 years was associated with significantly less suicidal ideation ( p  = 0.049, OR = 0.072, 95% CI = 0.005-0.993).  Conclusions:  Depression (subthreshold and especially within the clinical range) and early-career status (<10 years in service) may be target areas of early intervention for reduction of suicidal ideation amongst healthcare workers who have served during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is warranted to elucidate specific occupational stressors related to COVID-19 work conditions to tailor appropriate suicide preventive strategies in this population.","['Malaysia', 'Early phase', 'Suicidal Ideation', 'Health-care Workers', 'Covid-19 Pandemic']","['Medical Research', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Committee', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Medical', 'Research']",[],NaN

Although comprehensive centers exist, which are well equipped to cater and tailor to the needs of this population subset, quite often their resultant complications are handled at a different institution owing to the acuity of the condition. However, interestingly the psychosocial needs, medical pathophysiology, available surgical procedures, and their resultant complications are still not a part of the regular medical curriculum. This translates into inadequate care when physicians from vast majority of institutions that do not routinely perform transgender surgery encounter these patients with complications from gender-affirming surgeries. We present a case of a patient who underwent complex multiple gender-affirming surgeries, presenting to our emergency department with an acute abdomen; this resulted in a diagnostic and management dilemma and review of brief pertinent literature. We recommend that transgender medicine and its basics needs should be exposed to currently practicing physicians by continuing medical education, trainees and medical students alike via incorporation into their curriculum, to decrease health disparities among the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community.","['Urethral stricture', 'Fasciocutaneous Flap', 'Phalloplasty', 'Neoscrotum', 'Neourethra', 'Remnant Vagina', 'Scroto-Cutaneous Fistula', 'Transgender Surgery', 'Urethro-vaginal Fistula', 'Gender-affirming Surgery']","['data analysis', 'authors vouch', 'data', 'Statement', 'analysis', 'ethics', 'authors', 'vouch', 'completeness', 'veracity']",[],NaN

Identifying the healthy genetic carriers who will develop the disease remains a challenge. A novel approach to the analysis of the digital electrocardiograms of mutation carriers through signal processing may identify early electrocardiographic abnormalities.  Methods:  A retrospective case-control study included a population of healthy genetics carriers and their wild-type relatives. Genotype-positive/phenotype-negative individuals bore mutations associated with the development of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. The relatives included had a non-pathological 12-lead electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and a cardiac magnetic resonance. Automatic digital electrocardiographic analyses comprised QRS and terminal activation delay duration, the number of QRS fragmentations, ST slope, and T-wave voltage.  Results:  Digital 12-lead electrocardiograms from 41 genotype-positive/ phenotype-negative (29 simple carriers and 12 double mutation carriers) and 73 wild-type relatives were analyzed. No differences in the QRS length, the number of QRS fragmentations, and the voltage of the T-wave were observed. After adjusting for potential confounders, double carriers showed an average ST-slope flatter than those of the simple carriers and wild type [5.18° (0.73-8.01), 7.15° (5.14-11.05), and 11.46° (3.94-17.49), respectively,  p  = 0.005]. There was a significant negative correlation between the ST slope and the age in genotype-positive/phenotype-negative relatives ( r  = 0.376,  p  = 0.021) not observed in their wild-type counterparts ( r  = 0.074,  p  = 0.570).  Conclusions:  A flattened ST segment may be an early sign of electrical remodeling that precedes T-wave inversion in healthy genetic carriers. A thorough analysis of the digital electrocardiographic signal may help identify and measure early electrical abnormalities.","['Electrocardiogram', 'Early diagnosis', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy', 'Genetic Carrier', 'Familiar Screening']","['Ethics Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'Arrixaca Ethics', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Committee', 'Ethics', 'Statement', 'Virgen', 'Arrixaca']",[],NaN

The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.,"Patients with non-disabling middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis (ND-MCAS) are at risk for disabling ischemic cerebrovascular events (DICE) despite aggressive medical therapy. In this study, we aimed to verify whether cerebral circulation time (CCT) was a potential predictor of DICE in patients with ND-MCAS. From January 2015 to January 2020, 46 patients with ND-MCAS treated with aggressive medical therapy were enrolled for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in this convenience sampling study. They were divided into the DICE (-) and DICE (+) groups based on the occurrence of DICE within 3 months after DSA. The CCT was defined as the time from the appearance of the MCA to the peak intensity of the Trolard vein during DSA. The rCCT (relative CCT) was defined as the ratio of the CCT of the stenotic side (sCCT) to the CCT of the healthy side (hCCT). The differences in sCCT, hCCT, and rCCT between the two groups were analyzed with Mann-Whitney U tests. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between the risk factors and DICE. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to assess the predictive value of rCCT in identifying DICE in ND-MCAS patients. The results showed that DICE appeared in 5 of the 46 patients within 3 months. rCCT were significantly increased in the DICE (+) group compared with the DICE (-) group [1.08 (1.05, 1.14) vs. 1.30 (1.22, 1.54),  p   p  = 0.019) after adjustment for potential confounders (age, diabetes, antithrombotic use, and stenosis degree). ROC analysis showed that rCCT provided satisfactory accuracy in distinguishing the DICE (+) group from the DICE (-) group among ND-MCAS patients (area under the curve = 0.985,  p  < 0.001), with an optimal cutoff point of 1.20 (100% sensitivity, 97.6% specificity). In conclusion, prolonged rCCT is independently associated with the occurrence of DICE in ND-MCAS patients and may be used to identify individuals at risk of DICE.","['Prognosis', 'Digital Subtraction Angiography', 'Cerebral Circulation Time', 'Disabling Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events', 'Non-Disabling Middle Cerebral Artery Stenosis']","['National Institutes', 'Zhujiang Hospital', 'Southern Medical', 'Medical University', 'Subjects Policies', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Health Human', 'Human Subjects', 'involving human']",[],NaN

Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactate acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and Leigh syndrome (LS) are both established mitochondrial syndromes; sometimes they can overlap.  Methods:  A retrospective observational cohort study was done to analyze the clinical manifestations, biochemical findings, neuroimaging and genetic data, and disease outcomes of 14 patients with identified MELAS/LS overlap syndrome.  Results:  A total of 14 patients, 9 males and 5 females, were enrolled. The median age at onset was 14 years, while the average age was 12.6 years. As for clinical features in concordance with MELAS, the top three most common symptoms were seizures, cognitive impairment, and stroke-like episodes (SLE). Brain atrophy was present in seven patients. As for the clinical hallmarks of LS, the top three most common symptoms were ataxia, spastic paraplegia, and bulbar palsy. Patients presented with individual syndrome or overlap syndromes with similar frequency, and the prognosis did not seem to be related to the initial presentation. Thirteen patients were identified with  MTND  mutations, among which m.13513G>A mutation in the  MT-ND5  gene was the most common. Only one patient with m.8344A>G mutation of  MTTK  gene was found.  Discussion:  Our study demonstrated that  MTND  genes are important mutation hot spots in MELAS/LS overlap syndrome.

Written informed consent for participation was not required for this study in accordance with the national legislation and the institutional requirements. Ethical Consideration Prior to conducting the study, ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board of Jordan University of Science and Technology. In order to maintain their privacy, the participants were informed that the interviews would be recorded, and each participant was able to choose a convenient location for the interview to be held through Zoom. Since the interviews were held  via Zoom, a waiver of documentation of informed consent was requested. Finally, all collected data were stored on a password-protected computer. Ethical Dilemma The thematic analysis of the interviews showed that the nurses were caught in an ethical dilemma. On the one hand, they felt that they should not be forced to work with COVID-19 patients, and on the other hand, they felt a national and professional sense of commitment to not saying no. Two subthemes emerged from this theme: first, working with COVID-19 patients should Be voluntary and not obligatory, and second, nurses have a community and professional commitment to caring for all patients. Working With COVID-19 Patients Should Be Voluntary and Not Obligatory Although all of the nurses in this study had voluntarily participated in the care of patients with COVID-19, they nonetheless believed that nurses should not be forced to provide care for COVID-19 patients. They highlighted that nurses could have personal or social factors that placed them and their families at risk. For example, some female nurses could be pregnant, which would place them at high risk, and other nurses could have at-risk family members, such as children or elders. One nurse stated: “  Some nurses might have serious circumstances that could prevent them from taking care of patients with COVID-19. For example, some nurses might be pregnant, whilst others might have family members with low immunity, and if nurses contract the virus, they might pass it on to their family members. Also, some nurses might have children” (NH3).  Another participant reported: “  First, I try to assess the situation and find out why the nurse is refusing to work with COVID-19 patients and whether the reasons are logical or illogical. The nurse might have a logical reason, such as certain family circumstances or psychological or pathological conditions. In these situations, we may accept the nurse's refusal to work” (NH10).  Caring for COVID-19 Patients Is a Community and Professional Commitment Some of the participating nurses believed that they had a commitment toward their country and their profession to take care of patients with COVID-19. They emphasized that as nurses, they had no choice but to agree to work with COVID-19 patients. One nurse stated: “  As a nurse, you do not have a choice of whether to work or not …. regardless of whether the disease is infectious or not …stable or not …These are patients and you need to take care of them…. I am a nurse and this is what my job requires” (NK4).  Another nurse reported: “  I am one of those nurses who would never say no…I feel that this is a community duty …I was asked, so I went for it” (NK5).  The nurses in this study found it very difficult to refuse taking care of patients with COVID-19, and they indicated that even if they were to be asked again to take care of COVID-19 patients, they would still say yes. One nurse stated: “  Even if I were to be asked again, I would not say no. I don't know …I feel it's my professional obligation to not refuse any work …I as [name of participant]   am not here to be selective in my work and to work only with stable, noninfectious cases…In the end, you as a nurse should provide care not only to stable patients but to all patients, whether they have H1N1 or COVID-19 or AIDS” (NH10). ","Working during an epidemic can be physically, emotionally, and morally demanding for nurses. In addition to caring for patients, nurses are also responsible for looking after themselves and their families. The current study aimed to explore nurses' ethics in the care of patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A descriptive qualitative approach was adopted in order to gain an in-depth understanding of nurses' experiences of caring for patients with coronavirus. A purposive sample of 10 nurses working with patients with COVID-19 was recruited. Interviews were held with the nurses, and content analysis of the interviews was conducted. Each interview was transcribed, and the text was coded into manageable categories on the word, word sense, phrase, sentence, and theme levels before analysis. Three major themes related to the nurses' ethical commitments during the COVID-19 crisis emerged during the data analysis. These themes are as follows: the obligation of nurses to provide care for patients regardless of their medical diagnosis; the ethical dilemma faced by nurses of whether to care for patients or protect themselves from the virus; and finally, the responsibility of nurses to care for themselves.","['Care', 'Nurses', 'Ethical', 'Covid-19', 'Dilemma Approach']","['Jordan University', 'Ethics Statement', 'patients', 'nurses', 'Institutional Review', 'Review Board', 'nurse', 'care', 'Study', 'work']","['Two', 'I']",NaN

These hotlines mostly offered a single-use service with short session times and allowed callers to retain anonymity. They functioned as a psychological counseling service for stress experienced in the COVID-19 public health emergency. Hotline psychological counselors must meet special competency requirements. The selection and evaluation tools for recruiting hotline counselors need to be developed.  Materials and Methods:  The initial scale of competence for psychological hotline counselors was formed by expert evaluation based on theoretical constructs and by using the Delphi method. A link to the questionnaire was sent to a WeChat group of counselors from 36 major psychological hotlines in China in two stages. The questionnaire consisted of questions to elicit basic demographic information and the initial competence scale. In the first phase, 343 valid samples were used to perform exploratory factor analysis. In the second phase, 334 valid samples were used to perform confirmatory factor analysis. The status of the competence of psychological hotline counselors was also analyzed.  Results:  The factor structure of the Psychological Hotline Counselor Competence Scale was verified and defined in terms of skills, attitude, and knowledge. The results of exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis showed that the scale has good reliability and validity (χ 2 /df = 1.758, GFI = 0.86, RMSEA = 0.05, CFI = 0.96, NFI = 0.91, NNFI = 0.95). The McDonald's omega for each factor was calculated (ω F   1  = 0.927, 95%CI [0.914, 0.940]; ω F   2  = 0.958, 95%CI [0.951, 0.965]; ω F   3  = 0.954, 95%CI [0.945, 0.961]). Meanwhile, it was found that the psychological hotline counselors' self-assessed competence had a high average score ( n  = 334).  Conclusion:  The Competence Scale for Psychological Hotline Counselors for Major Public Emergencies developed in this study has good reliability and validity, and can be a reliable tool for organizing psychological assistance and screening hotline psychological counselors during public emergencies in the future.","['Chinese Experience', 'Covid-19', 'Psychological Hotline', 'Competency Characteristics', 'Psychological Counselors']","['Statement Ethical', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethical review', 'institutional requirements', 'human participants', 'Written informed', 'local legislation', 'informed consent', 'Statement', 'Ethical']",[],NaN

Written informed consent for participation was not required for this study in accordance with the national legislation and the institutional requirements.," Background Xerostomia is one of the most common adverse events of radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients. There have been many reports on functional changes of the parotid gland after radiation therapy, but there have been few reports on the volume of the parotid gland and its relationship with oral quality of life (QOL) and even fewer reports on longitudinal change of the parotid gland volume. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term change of the parotid gland volume after intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma and the relationship between parotid irradiation dose and xerostomia symptoms. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 26 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer treated by IMRT. Longitudinal changes of parotid gland volumes after IMRT were evaluated on CT images. The parotid gland volumes in each period were converted to the ratio to parotid gland volumes before radiotherapy (relative parotid volume). Dunnett's test was used to evaluate the longitudinal changes in relative parotid volumes at 0-6, 7-18, 19-30, 31-42, 43-54 and 55-66 months after IMRT. We assessed xerostomia 3 years or more after IMRT by measuring the degree of oral moisture using a moisture-checking device (Mucus, Life Co., Ltd.) and oral QOL evaluation by GOHAI (General Oral Health Assessment Index). Results The relative parotid volumes during radiotherapy and at 0-6, 7-18, 19-30, 31-42, 43-54 and 55-66 months after IMRT were 75.2 ± 14.3%, 67.2 ± 11.4%, 68.5 ± 15.9%, 72.4 ± 14.8%, 73.0 ± 13.8%, 76.2 ± 17.5%, and 77.1% ± 17.3%, respectively. The parotid volume had recovered significantly at 43-54 and 55-66 months after IMRT, especially in parotids receiving less than 40 Gy as the mean dose. The mean irradiated dose for bilateral parotids showed negative correlations with oral QOL score and oral moisture after a long period. Conclusions The parotid volume recovered gradually but had not reached a plateau even 3 years after radiotherapy, especially in parotids receiving less than 40 Gy as the mean dose.","['Radiotherapy', 'Parotid', 'Xerostomia', 'Qol', 'Imrt']","['Tohoku University', 'University Graduate', 'Graduate School', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Medicine', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

This study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed-platinum with or without bevacizumab in Chinese chemo-naive advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients in a real-world setting. We retrospectively collected 100 patients who received pemetrexed-platinum with or without bevacizumab (PP,  n  = 46; Bev+PP,  n  = 54) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Clinical characteristics of patients were balanced, except for the proportion of stage IV b+c (Bev+PP and PP: 67.4 vs. 37.0%,  p  = 0.0066). Bev+PP significantly improved the objective response rate (ORR, 65 vs. 30%,  p  = 0.0004) and progression-free survival (PFS, 7.4 vs. 6.8 months,  p  = 0.009), but not overall survival (OS, 17.5 vs. 15.0 months,  p  = 0.553) compared with PP. Treatment ( p  = 0.001), gender ( p  = 0.008), adrenal metastasis ( p  = 0.001), and liver metastasis ( p  = 0.013) were independent risk factors for PFS. Patients with adrenal metastasis tended to be at the highest risk of not benefiting from bevacizumab addition (HR [95% CI]: 2.244 [0.6495-7.753]). The safety profile was acceptable, and grade ≥3 toxicity occurred similarly. This study showed that pemetrexed-platinum plus bevacizumab was effective compared to chemotherapy alone in Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC.","['Lung adenocarcinoma', 'Platinum', 'Bevacizumab', 'Pemetrexed', 'Adrenal Metastasis']","['Cancer Hospital', 'Review Board', 'Hangzhou Cancer', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Review', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Hospital', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

We describe a case of suspected lumbar disc herniation with sciatic herpes zoster to reduce the rate of misdiagnosis.  Case Report:  A 55-year old man, male, developed low back pain after carrying heavy items 20 years ago. Characteristics of symptoms: 1. Symptoms were aggravated in the upright lumbar forward flexion position; 2. The VAS (leg) score was 8-9 points and the VSA (lumbar) score was 0 point; 3. It can be relieved when rested in the supine position; 4. It came on intermittently with radiation pain in the right lower limb. There were several attacks every year. One month ago, there was radiating pain in the right lower limb. The pain was from the back of the right hip, behind the thigh, in lateral crural region, to the back of the foot. And Symptoms worsened for 10 days. The VAS score was 8 points. Pain could not be relieved by rest or changing posture.

The aim of this study was to create a more complete understanding of the impact of functional disability from simple bone cysts (SBCs) by combining qualitative and quantitative methods.  Methods  This study followed a convergent parallel mixed methods design. The quantitative arm included 130 children with SBC and used the Activities Scale for Kids (ASK) to measure physical function. In the qualitative arm ten children and their parents participated in interviews related to activity participation and interactions with their physical and social environments. The two data sets were analyzed independently and then the results were integrated.  Results  The ASK demonstrated 35% of children achieving the maximum score. In total, 65% of children responded “I had no medical needs” confirming that SBC, while being present throughout childhood, is largely perceived as not a chronic illness. Qualitatively most children reported minimal or no changes in activity participation but reported thinking about being more cautious during play, confirming that SBC affects effort not participation in play.  Conclusion  The diagnosis of SBC did not have a significant impact on physical function, but did alter children’s thoughts about physical activity participation. This finding suggests that physical function scores may have unappreciated ceiling effects. Outcome tools that combine both illness perceptions and physical function may help to better assess functional outcomes of SBC.

The increased prevalence of glaucoma has led to a growing demand for newer, safer, more rapid, and simpler treatments for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP). In this study, we evaluated the safety and feasibility of performing filtration glaucoma surgery with an Ab-Interno Er:YAG laser in rabbits. Methods Nine New Zealand White rabbits age 16 weeks were studied. After subconjunctival injection of mitomycin C (MMC), a novel Ab-Interno Er:YAG laser probe was inserted into the anterior chamber (AC) through a clear corneal 1 mm paracentesis and directed at the trabecular meshwork adjacent to the MMC injection area. A pulsed laser beam was applied to create a patent sclerostomy connecting the AC to the subconjuctival space, resulting in a filtering bleb. The laser system used was the Er:YAG laser system - LAS25-FCU, (Pantec Biosolutions AG, Liechtenstein). Parameters used: Wave lengh: 2940 nm, Pulse length: 100-400 μsec,frequency: 250 Hz. Average laser power in accordance to the fiber tip diameter: 0.85 W(range 0.8-0.92 W). Complete ocular exams, including IOP measurements, were performed on 1, 7, 14, and 23 days postoperatively. Three rabbits were sacrificed on days 1, 14, and 23, and histological examinations were performed on all nine eyes. Results All procedures resulted in a functional medium-large superior bleb without significant complications. The bleb was sustained in all rabbits by day 14 and in one of the three rabbits that reached the last follow-up at 23 days. No cases of postoperative hypotony were observed. There was a transient significant reduction in mean IOP on postoperative days 5 and 7 (P = 0.028). Histopathological analysis revealed a patent full-thickness scleral tunnel with only a minor degree of surrounding coagulation necrosis.

The reasons for such an inversion are poorly understood due to the rarity of the condition. We present a case of inverted Meckel's diverticulum, an uncommon finding, as a cause of recurrent intussusception. Case presentation A 30-year old Indian woman presented with complaints of pain in the central abdomen for 3 days, accompanied with vomiting and loose stools. Computed tomography images were suggestive of intussusception with intestinal obstruction. Intra-operative findings were suggestive of an intussuscepted segment of ileum measuring 10 cm in length, proximal to ileocecal junction. Ileo-ileal anastomosis was performed after appropriate resection. Upon opening the specimen, we were surprised to find an inverted Meckel diverticulum with lipoma at one end causing the intussusception. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged after 5 days. Conclusion The reasons for inversion include abnormal peristalsis around the diverticulum and non-fixity of the diverticulum itself. The inverted diverticulum itself can cause luminal compromise and acts as a lead point for intussusception leading to obstruction. Computed tomography remains the diagnostic tool of choice for identifying intestinal obstruction and intussusception. Although pathological signs, such as lipoma, can be identified, the identification of any inversion will require a proficient radiologist. Inverted Meckel's diverticulum is a rare condition which is difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Treatment is surgical, whether diagnosed pre-operatively or intra-operatively, and includes segmental resection and anastomosis. This uncommon condition should be noted as one-off differential diagnosis for intussusception and intestinal obstruction.","['Lipoma', 'Intussusception', 'Obstruction', 'Inverted Meckel’s Diverticulum']",[],[],NaN

This study aimed to develop and psychometrically test an instrument that measures physicians' awareness of bioethics and medical law and their attitudes towards the practice of medical ethics. Additionally, it examined physician correlates influencing the awareness of bioethics. Methods Following a rigorous review of relevant literature by a panel of experts, a 13-item instrument, the Omani physicians' bioethics and medical law awareness (OBMLA) questionnaire was developed with the aim of assessing physicians' awareness of bioethics and medical law. The study tool's construct validity and internal consistency reliability were examined by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and Cronbach's alpha. In a cross-sectional study, the questionnaire was distributed among a random sample of 200 physicians at a tertiary hospital in Muscat, Oman. Participant characteristics that may influence awareness of bioethics and medical law were explored. Results The EFA of the OBMLA questionnaire resulted in three well-loading factors: (1) Physicians' bioethics practice subscale (2) incentive related bioethics subscale and (3) medical law awareness subscale. Internal consistency reliability ranged between Cronbach's α: 0.73-0.8. Of the total 200 participants, 52% reported that teaching medical ethics during medical school was inadequate. The overall mean (standard deviation, SD) of the bioethics awareness score and Omani medical law awareness were 27.6 (3.5) and 10.1 (2.1) respectively. The majority of physicians (73%) reported that they frequently encountered ethical dilemmas in their practice and 24.5% endorsed the view that unethical decisions tended to occur in their practice. Conclusion The study provides an insight into the practice of bioethics, and the awareness of bioethics and medical law among physicians in a teaching hospital in Oman. The OBMLA questionnaire appears to be a valid and reliable tool to assess a physician's awareness of bioethics and medical law.

Setting Online experiment using recruitment platform Respondi. Participants UK participants (n=1744, after a pilot of n=1657) quota-sampled to be proportional to the UK national population on age and sex. Interventions Participants were given a hypothetical COVID-19 PCR test result for 'John' who was presented as having a 50% chance of having COVID-19 based on symptoms alone. Participants were randomised to receive either a positive or negative result for 'John', then randomised again to receive either no more information, or text information on the interpretation of COVID-19 test results copied in September 2020 from the public websites of the UK's National Health Service, the USA's Centers for Disease Control, New Zealand's Ministry of Health or a modified version of the UK's wording. Information identifying the source of the wording was removed. Main outcome measures Participants were asked 'What is your best guess as to the percent chance that John actually had COVID-19 at the time of his test, given his result?'; questions about their feelings of trustworthiness in the result, their perceptions of the quality of the underlying evidence and what action they felt 'John' should take in the light of his result. Results Of those presented with a positive COVID-19 test result for 'John', the mean estimate of the probability that he had the virus was 73% (71.5%-74.5%); for those presented with a negative result, 38% (36.7%-40.0%). There was no main effect of information (wording) on these means. However, those participants given the official information from the UK website, which did not mention the possibility of false negatives or false positives, were more likely to give a categorical (100% or 0%) answer (UK: 68/343, 19.8% (15.9%-24.4%); control group: 42/356, 11.8% (8.8%-15.6%)); the reverse was true for those viewing the New Zealand (NZ) wording, which highlighted the uncertainties most explicitly (20/345: 5.8% (3.7%-8.8%)).

Although the NZ wording was rated harder to understand, participants reacted to the uncertainties given in the text in the expected direction: there was a small main effect of wording on trust in the result (p=0.048), with people perceiving the test result as marginally less trustworthy after having read the NZ wording compared with the UK wording. Positive results were generally viewed as more trustworthy and as having higher quality of evidence than negative results (both p Conclusions The public's default assessment of the face value of both the positive and negative test results (control group) indicate an awareness that test results are not perfectly accurate. Compared with other messaging tested, participants shown the UK's 2020 wording about the interpretation of the test results appeared to interpret the results as more definitive than is warranted.

These attributes include sex, before and follow-up CD4 counts (BCD4, FCD4), before and follow-up viral load (BRNA, FRNA), drug type/combination (DTYPE), before and follow-up body weight (Bwt, Fwt), patient response to ART (PR), and classification targets (C1-C5). Five (5) output membership grades of a fuzzy inference system ranging from very high interaction to no interaction were constructed to model the influence of adverse drug reaction (ADR) and subsequently derive the PR attribute (a non-fuzzy variable). The PR attribute membership clusters derived from a universe of discourse table were then used to label the classification targets as follows: C1=no interaction, C2=very low interaction, C3=low interaction, C4=high interaction, and C5=very high interaction. The classification targets are useful for building classification models and for detecting patients with ADR.

Besides recruiting retired healthcare workers, medical students were considered to support this task. Commitment of medical students in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated using an online survey, with particular focus on their burdens and anxieties. This survey was distributed to students within a 2-week period in April and May 2020. Ultimately, 1241 participants were included in the analysis. During the pandemic, 67.9% (65.3% to 70.5%) of the participants reported that they had volunteered. Furthermore, 88.9% (86.9% to 90.5%) stated that they were against compulsory recruitment in this context. Students who volunteered (committed students) had a significantly lower anxiety index than non-committed students. Additionally, students were more concerned about infecting other patients and relatives than themselves. Higher levels of anxiety were related to lower levels of commitment.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many trainings planned face-to-face were carried out remotely. In this study, our aim is to evaluate students’ views on the efficiency of DAE, and to increase the efficiency of DAE in the future.  Methods  The questionnaire used in the study was applied to the first grade students in the Faculty of Medicine, at the Eskisehir Osmangazi University, in 2019–2020. 239 students completed the survey. The questionnaire consisted of the demographic information, that was obtained with voluntary consent, and sections containing suggestions on DAE, and its comparison with distance education of other basic medical science courses. The survey was prepared as a Likert scale (with 1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree), on Google forms and sent to the students online.  Results  82.4% of the students marked “totally disagree” or “disagree” for the statement of “DAE is more efficient than TAE”. The total percentage of students who marked “totally disagree” or “disagree” for the statement of “I was satisfied with the theoretical education in DAE” was 58.6%, but when it came to practical education the percentage raised to 79.9%.  Conclusions  According to the results the efficiency of DAE, especially in terms of practice lessons, was found to be lower than TAE. To make DAE a powerful alternative to TAE, future studies should aim to develop a new syllabus for DAE.","['Students', 'Medical education', 'Distance Education', 'Anatomy Education', 'Covid-19']",[],[],NaN

PR is associated with occurrence or recurrence of thrombotic and bleeding events, but this association is modulated by several factors. Conventional pharmacogenetics explains a minor part of this PR variability, and among determinants of PR, circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been the focus of attention during these last years as biomarkers to predict PR and clinical outcomes in CVD. This being said, the impact of miRNAs on platelet function and the mechanisms behind it are largely unknown. The level of a set of candidate miRNAs including miR-126-3p, miR-150-5p, miR-204-5p and miR-223-3p was quantified in plasma samples of stable CVD patients and correlated with PR as assessed by light-transmission aggregometry and in vivo thrombin generation markers. Finally, miRNA target networks were built based on genes involved in platelet function. We show that all candidate miRNAs were associated with platelet aggregation, while only miR-126-3p and miR-223-3p were positively correlated with in vivo thrombin generation markers. In silico analysis identified putative miRNA targets involved in platelet function regulation. Circulating miRNAs were associated with different aspects of platelet reactivity, including platelet aggregation and platelet-supported thrombin generation.

Currently, knowledge about and recommendations for delirium management are often based on studies in patients aged 60 to 65 years. It is not clear whether these findings apply to patients ≥80 years. Aim: Comparison of younger and older patients with delirium, especially regarding risk factors. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, within 1-year, 5,831 patients (18–80 years: n = 4,730; ≥80: n = 1,101) with delirium were enrolled. The diagnosis of delirium was based on the Delirium Observation screening scale (DOS), Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and a DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual)-5 construct of nursing instrument. Sociodemographic trajectories, as well as the relevant predisposing and precipitating factors for delirium, were assessed via a multiple regression analysis. Results: The very old were more commonly admitted as emergencies (OR 1.42), had a greater mortality risk (OR 1.56) and displayed fewer precipitating risk factors for the development of a delirium, although the number of diagnoses were not different (p = 0.325). Predisposing factors were sufficient almost alone for the development of delirium in patients ≥ 80 years of age; in 18–80 years of age, additional precipitating factors had to occur to make a delirium possible. Conclusion: When relevant predisposing factors for delirium are apparent, patients over 80 years of age require comparatively few or no precipitating factors to develop delirium. This finding should be taken into account at hospitalization and may allow better treatment of delirium in the future.","['Comparison', 'risk factors', 'Delirium', 'Prospective', 'Very Old']","['Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'ethics committee', 'Zurich', 'Statement', 'Canton', '2012-0263', 'Ethics']",[],NaN

Several trials evaluated CCT in low and intermediate risk patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) and noted that it was both safe and feasible. During the COVID19 pandemic, it is imperative to adopt a pathway for the evaluation of ACS that permits early discharge, reduces invasive coronary angiography and limits exposure of healthcare workers. Here, we present a single center experience by which CCT was incorporated in the clinical pathway of patients presenting to the ER with chest pain and ACS. Methods: This is a snapshot study of the first 27 patients who underwent CCT immediately after the lockdown in the city of Jeddah. ST elevation myocardial infarctions and hemodynamically unstable patients were excluded. Those with unstable angina or a Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction were screened for COVID19. The patients' COVID19 status and the results of the CCT were then used to determine the treatment strategy. Patient predisposition, hospital stay and exposure of staff are collected and reported. Results: All CCT images were interpretable with no limitations or significant artifact. CCT identified critical disease in 7 patients (26%), normal epicardial coronary arteries in 11 (41%) and mild to moderate disease in 9 (33%). All patients with normal or mild to moderate disease were assigned to a conservative strategy and discharged within 24 h. Those with a NSTEMI and critical anatomy were assigned to an additional invasive evaluation with subsequent revascularization. During the course of this study, no transmission to healthcare workers occurred. Conclusion: CCT enabled 80% of patients to be discharged within the first 24 h, the majority of whom were discharged from the emergency room. It was able to identify critical anatomy facilitating appropriate revascularization. This snapshot study warrants exploration of the role of CCT in ACS further particularly since the latest European Society of Cardiology's Non-STEACS guidelines suggest a role for CCT in the evaluation of low risk ACS.","['Infection', 'Revascularization', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'Cardiac Computed Tomography', 'Covid-19']","['Forces Hospital', 'King Fahd', 'Fahd Armed', 'Armed Forces', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Hospital']",[],NaN

The patient was then given first-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine and albumin paclitaxel for one cycle, but the disease continued to progress. The patient then received anlotinib combined with second-line chemotherapy (dacarbazine and cis-platinum) for six cycles, and the response reached complete remission (CR). Then the patient was given maintenance therapy with anlotinib alone, and the disease was still stable at the most recent reexamination. Progression-free survival (PFS) has lasted for more than two years, without any intolerable toxicity.

This study aimed to identify clinical serological indicators to establish a nomogram to assess LE in SLE patients with gastrointestinal manifestations.  Methods  The clinical and laboratory data of SLE patients with gastrointestinal manifestations that were hospitalized in the West China Hospital from January 2010 to January 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression model was used to select potentially relevant features. Subsequently, a nomogram was developed using multivariable logistic analysis. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve, a calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Findings  We included a total of 8,505 SLE patients, of which 251 had experienced gastrointestinal manifestations. The patients were randomly divided into training (n = 176) and validation (n = 75) groups. The LRA (LE Risk Assessment) model consisted of 11 significantly associated variables, which included complement 4, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, albumin, anion gap, age, d-dimer, platelet, serum chlorine, anti-Sjögren's-syndrome-related antigen A, anti-ribosomal P protein, and anti-ribonucleoprotein. In the training and validation cohorts, the areas under the curve were 0.919 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.876–0.962) and 0.870 (95% CI: 0.775–0.964), respectively. The nomogram demonstrated excellent performance in the calibration curve and DCA.

However, HA oral administration is less common given the scarce currently available scientific evidence. This study was aimed at evaluating the effects of oral HA administration on synovial fluid concentrations of several selected biomarkers in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) injury operated on using the tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) technique. Fifty-five dogs were included in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, clinical study; they were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo (group A; n = 25) or HA (group B; n = 30) orally for 10 weeks. Synovial fluid samples were obtained before surgery, and at 10 weeks postoperatively to measure concentrations of HA, haptoglobin, nitric oxide, and paraoxonase-1. After 10 weeks, group HA showed a significant increase in HA concentration ( p  = 0.0016) and a significant decrease in PON-1 concentration ( p  = 0.011) compared to baseline. In conclusion, post-op oral HA administration in canine patients with CCL injury leads to improvements in osteoarthritis biomarkers, namely higher synovial fluid HA concentrations and reduced synovial fluid paraoxonase-1 concentrations. These findings support the bioavailability of orally-administered HA and its usefulness in improving biomarkers of osteoarthritis.","['Hyaluronic acid', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Canine', 'Synovial fluid', 'Paraoxonase-1', 'Cranial Cruciate Ligament']",[],[],NaN

In this, open-label, non-randomized, prospective, observational, and descriptive study, a PK model of cefepime was developed for patients with hematological neoplasms and post-chemotherapy febrile neutropenia. This study was conducted at a cancer referral center, and study participants were receiving 2 g IV doses of cefepime every 8 h as 30-min infusions. Cefepime PK was well described by a two compartment model with a clearance dependent on a serum creatinine level. Using Monte Carlo simulations, it was shown that continuous infusions of 6g q24h could have a good achievement of PK/PD targets for MIC levels below the resistance cut-off point of Enterobacteriaceae. According to the simulations, it is unnecessary to increase the daily dose of cefepime (above 6 g daily) to increase the probability of target attainment (PTA). Cumulative fraction of response (CFR) using interment dosing was suboptimal for empirical therapy regimens against  K. pneumoniae  and  P. aeruginosa , and continuous infusions could be used in this setting to maximize exposure.

Primary outcome  measure was symptom resolution from allergy immunotherapy (AIT). IDT identified 57% more patients as being allergic, and 8.6 times more reactive allergens than would have been diagnosed using only SPT. Patients diagnosed by IDT had the same degree of symptom improvement from immunotherapy, independent of allergen sensitivity (66% by SPT vs. 63% by IDT;  p  = 0.69, not different). Low-sensitivity allergy tests, which may fail to identify allergy in over two thirds of children aged 3 to 15 as being atopic, or among 60% of patients with ETD, may explain why many physicians do not consider allergy as a treatable etiology for their patient's OME/ETD.

These results suggest the importance to evaluate the cognitive functions using an adequate tool in patients with stroke undergoing a robotic rehabilitation intervention.","['Memory', 'Attention', 'Rehabilitation', 'Stroke', 'Robotics', 'Executive Function']",[],[],NaN

Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)1 and SOCS3 block STAT3, and low SOCS1 levels have been reported in IPF fibroblasts and shown to facilitate collagen production. Fibroblasts and lung tissue from IPF patients and controls were used to examine the mechanisms underlying SOCS1 down-regulation in IPF. A significant reduction in basal  SOCS1  mRNA in IPF fibroblasts was confirmed. However, there was no difference in the kinetics of activation, and methylation of SOCS1 in control and IPF lung fibroblasts was low and unaffected by 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine' treatment.  SOCS1  is a target of microRNA-155 and although microRNA-155 levels were increased in IPF tissue, they were reduced in IPF fibroblasts. Therefore, SOCS1 is not regulated by  SOCS1  gene methylation or microRNA155 in these cells. In conclusion, we confirmed that IPF fibroblasts had lower levels of SOCS1 mRNA compared with control fibroblasts, but we were unable to determine the mechanism. Furthermore, although SOCS1 may be important in the fibrotic process, we were unable to find a significant role for SOCS1 in regulating fibroblast function.","['Fibroblast', 'SOCS1', 'fibrosis', 'JAK/STAT pathway', 'Mir155', 'L-6']",[],[],NaN

ELISAs (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays) are the most widely used approach for arboviruses diagnosis. However, some limitations include antibody cross reactivities when viruses belong to the same genus, and sensitivity variations in distinct epidemiological scenarios. As chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus, no serological cross reactivity with dengue virus (DENV) should be observed. Here, we evaluated a routinely used chikungunya commercial IgM (Immunoglobulin M) ELISA test (Anti-Chikungunya IgM ELISA, Euroimmun) to assess its performance in confirming chikungunya in a dengue endemic area. Samples ( n  = 340) representative of all four DENV serotypes, healthy individuals and controls were tested. The Anti-CHIKV IgM ELISA test had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 25.3% due to the cross reactivities observed with dengue. In dengue acute cases, the chikungunya test showed an overall cross-reactivity of 31.6%, with a higher cross-reactivity with DENV-4. In dengue IgM positive cases, the assay showed a cross-reactivity of 46.7%. Serological diagnosis may be challenging and, despite the results observed here, more evaluations shall be performed. Because distinct arboviruses co-circulate in Brazil, reliable diagnostic tools are essential for disease surveillance and patient management.","['Brazil', 'Dengue Cross-reactivity', 'Anti-chikungunya Igm Elisa', 'Chikungunya Diagnosis']","['Oswaldo Cruz', 'Cruz Foundation', 'Ethic Committee', 'Ethics Statement', 'Foundation Ethic', 'CAAE', 'February', 'Committee', 'cases analyzed', 'ongoing project']",[],NaN

We provided evidence that early stimulation of the chicken microbiota with in ovo delivered synbiotics influenced gene expression and DNA methylation in the liver. Therefore, we hypothesize that the stimulation of microbiota by administering bioactive substances in ovo also affects the activity of miRNA in liver. For the analysis of miRNA activity, RNA was isolated from liver of adult broiler chicken and native chicken breed. The animals received a prebiotic, probiotic and synbiotic in ovo on day 12 of egg incubation. The analysis of miRNA expression was performed using the LNA method on a miRNA panel selected on the basis of previous microarray experiments. We have found increased miRNA expression activity after probiotic and synbiotic administration, especially in native chicken breed. Our results suggest that prebiotics reduce or do not affect miRNA activity. We have also shown that miRNA activity is regulated by the substance and genotype of the chicken. We can conclude that miRNAs constitute an important component of the molecular mechanism of host–probiotic interaction in liver.","['Bioactive substances', 'Intestinal Microbiota', 'Host-probiotic Interaction', 'In Ovo Technology']",[],[],NaN

Salivary α-synuclein (aSyn) and its nitrated form, or 3-nitrotyrosine-α-synuclein (3-NT-αSyn), hold promise as biomarkers for idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD). Nitrative stress that is characterized by an excess of 3-nitrotyrosine proteins (3-NT-proteins) has been proposed as a pathogenic mechanism in IPD. The objective is to study the pathological role of native αSyn, 3-NT-αSyn, and 3-NT-proteins in the saliva and submandibulary glands of patients with IPD. Methods. The salivary and serum αSyn and 3-NT-proteins concentration is evaluated with ELISA in patients and controls. Correlations of αSyn and 3-NT-proteins content with clinical features of the disease are examined. Immunohistochemical 3-NT-αSyn expression in submandibulary gland sections is analyzed. Results. (a) Salivary concentration and saliva/serum ratios of native αSyn and 3-NT-proteins are similar in patients and controls; (b) salivary αSyn and 3-NT-proteins do not correlate with any clinical feature; and (c) three patterns of 3-NT-αSyn-positive inclusions are observed on histological sections: rounded “Lewy-type” aggregates of 10–25 µm in diameter, coarse deposits with varied morphology, and spheroid inclusions or bodies of 3–5 µm in diameter. “Lewy-type” and coarse inclusions are observed in the interlobular connective tissue of the gland, and small-sized bodies are located within the cytoplasm of duct cells. “Lewy-type” inclusions are only observed in patients, and the remaining patterns of inclusions are observed in both the patients and controls. Conclusions. The patients’ saliva presents a similar concentration of native αSyn and 3-nitrotyrosine-proteins than that of the controls, and no correlations with clinical features are found. These findings preclude the utility of native αSyn in the saliva as a biomarker, and they indicate the absence of nitrative stress in the saliva and serum of patients. As regards nitrated αSyn, “Lewy-type” inclusions expressing 3-NT-αSyn are observed in the patients, not the controls—a novel finding that suggests that a biopsy of the submandibulary gland, if proven safe, could be a useful technique for diagnosing IPD. Finally, to our knowledge, this is also the first description of 3-NT-αSyn-immunoreactive intracytoplasmic bodies in cells that are located outside the nervous system. These intracytoplasmic bodies are present in duct cells of submandibulary gland sections from all subjects regardless of their pathology, and they can represent an aging or involutional change. Further immunostaining studies with different antibodies and larger samples are needed to validate the data.","['Saliva', 'Nitration', 'α-synuclein', 'Parkinson', 'Nitrative Stress', 'Lewy-Type']","['test', 'Ethics Comparisons', 'Ethics', 'variables', 'Internal Ethics', 'Research Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'Universitario Valme', 'Scientific Board', 'Hospital Universitario']",[],NaN

Currently, Chagas disease is a major public health concern worldwide due to globalization, and there are no treatments neither vaccines because of the long-term nature of the disease and its complex pathology. Current treatments are limited to two obsolete drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, which lead to serious drawbacks. Taking into account the urgent need for strict research efforts to find new therapies, here, we describe the in vitro and in vivo trypanocidal activity of a library of selected forty-eight selenocyanate and diselenide derivatives that exhibited leishmanicidal properties. The inclusion of selenium, an essential trace element, was due to the well-known extensive pharmacological activities for selenium compounds including parasitic diseases as T. cruzi. Here we present compound 8 as a potential compound that exhibits a better profile than benznidazole both in vitro and in vivo. It shows a fast-acting behaviour that could be attributed to its mode of action: it acts in a mitochondrion-dependent manner, causing cell death by bioenergetic collapse. This finding provides a step forward for the development of a new antichagasic agent.","['Chemotherapy', 'drug discovery', 'Trypanosoma Cruzi', 'Neglected Tropical Diseases', 'American Trypanosomiasis', 'Chagas Disease', 'Screening Cascade', 'Target Product Profile', 'Selenium Derivatives']","['Animal Experimentation', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Female BALB', 'Scheme', 'CEEA', 'Spain', 'animal work', 'Ethics', 'animal']",[],NaN

The data comprised ASL and dynamic 15O-water PET data with arterial blood sampling of eighteen subjects (eight patients with focal epilepsy and ten healthy controls, age 21 to 61 years). 15O-water PET parametric CBF images were generated using a basis function implementation of the single tissue compartment model. Cortical and subcortical regions were automatically segmented using Freesurfer. Average CBFASL and CBFPET in grey matter were 60 ± 20 and 75 ± 22 mL/100 g/min respectively, with a relatively high correlation (r = 0.78, p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis revealed poor agreement (bias = −15 mL/100 g/min, lower and upper limits of agreements = −16 and 45 mL/100 g/min, respectively) with a negative relationship. Accounting for the negative relationship, the width of the limits of agreement could be narrowed from 61 mL/100 g/min to 35 mL/100 g/min using regression-based limits of agreements. Although a high correlation between CBFASL and CBFPET was found, the agreement in absolute CBF values was not sufficient for ASL to be used interchangeably with 15O-water PET.","['Validation', 'ASL', 'CBF', 'Pet/mr', '15O-water Pet']",[],[],NaN

However, patients carrying only one heterozygous pathogenic (monoallelic) GJB2 variant represent a long-lasting diagnostic problem. Interestingly, previous results showed that individuals with a heterozygous pathogenic GJB2 variant are two times more prevalent among those with hearing loss compared to normal-hearing individuals. This excess among patients led us to hypothesize that there could be another pathogenic variant in the GJB2 region/DFNB1 locus. A hitherto undiscovered variant could, in part, explain the cause of hearing loss in patients and would mean reclassifying them as patients with GJB2 biallelic pathogenic variants. In order to detect an unknown causal variant, we examined 28 patients using NGS with probes that continuously cover the 0.4 Mb in the DFNB1 region. An additional 49 patients were examined by WES to uncover only carriers. We did not reveal a second pathogenic variant in the DFNB1 region. However, in 19% of the WES-examined patients, the cause of hearing loss was found to be in genes other than the GJB2. We present evidence to show that a substantial number of patients are carriers of the GJB2 pathogenic variant, albeit only by chance.","['Hearing loss', 'Next Generation Sequencing', 'Dfnb1 Region', 'Gjb2 Monoallelic Variant']",[],[],NaN

The disease affects 0.7–15% of the general population, being most common in post-menopausal women. Although BMS is related to anxiety and/or depression and sleep disturbances, its etiology as well as its diagnosis remain unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to contribute to the knowledge about this syndrome and to look for objective diagnostic tools. Therefore, whole saliva proteomes of patients suffering from BMS were compared to those of healthy persons. The results of this study manifest alterations in salivary proteins related to stress, immune system, and inflammation and, therefore, suggest implication of these pathways in BMS development. Moreover, biomarkers related to stress, immune system, and inflammation, such as salivary amyloid A, immunoglobulins, or leukocyte elastase inhibitors, among others, could contribute to BMC management, although further research is needed to confirm these suppositions.  Abstract  Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic oral condition characterized by an intraoral burning sensation, taste alterations, and dry mouth sensations. Although a number of factors have been closely related to the appearance of the symptoms, including anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances, the etiology of BMS remains unclear. Furthermore, currently no objective diagnostic tools exist, making its diagnosis challenging. Therefore, to contribute to the knowledge about BMS etiology and look for objective tools for its diagnosis, the present study was conducted. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the proteomic profile of the resting whole saliva of patients with BMS and age and sex-matched controls using two-dimensional electrophoresis. The results showed evidence of changes in saliva at the level of proteins related to important pathways such as stress (sAA), immune system (Ig), and inflammation (leukocyte elastase inhibitor). While some of our findings have been previously described others, such as the deregulation of the coiled-coin domain containing protein 25 in BMS, are presented here for the first time to our knowledge. Thus, saliva provides us with relevant information about BMS pathophysiology and could be considered a suitable biofluid for its study and/or diagnosis.","['Saliva', 'Proteomics', 'Burning mouth syndrome']",[],[],NaN
