1,"Germacrene A is heat-labile and is converted to β-elemene upon heating (De Kraker et al.,  1998).

Based on this work, a GC injector temperature of 150°C was used in all GC-MS analyses, resulting in a significantly increased fraction of germacrene A detected compared to β-elemene, although a large part of germacrene A was still converted to β-elemene (Figure  3).

20,"Interestingly, six DEGs were closely associated with the α-linolenic acid metabolism that finally leads to JA biosynthesis (Table  3; Fig.  3). The JA signaling pathway is the most important signal-transduction pathway in response to predation and pathogen attack, acting as a “master switch” [ 7,  29– 31]. It may play a central role to trigger expression of those DEGs encoding lipoxygenase (EC:1.13.11.12), acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 (EC: 2.3.1.16), two kinds of oxidase (EC:1.3.3.6; EC:5.3.99.6) and jasmonate O-methyltransferase (EC:2.1.1.141).

Free-acid JA might not be able to move across the cellular membrane without a carrier because of its acidic nature; nonetheless, MeJA could diffuse to distal parts of plant via the vapor phase or by intercellular migration [ 37,  38].

22,"In plants, fatty acids are stored as triacylglycerides; therefore, enzymatic oxidative degradation of lipids is preceded by the action of acyl hydrolase, liberating the free fatty acids from acylglycerols. Saturated and unsaturated volatile C 6 and C 9 aldehydes and alcohols are important contributors to the characteristic aromas of tea, which are described as a “fresh green” odor. The short-chain aldehydes and alcohols are mostly produced by plants in response to external stress and play an important role in the plants defense strategies (Additional file  3: Figure S2A) [ 43– 47]. Quantitatively and qualitatively, the majority of plant volatiles originate from saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. In tea plants, we identified many fatty acid-derived straight-chain alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters and lactones, which are formed by three basic processes: α -oxidation, β-oxidation and the lipoxygenation.

In addition, VTs decreased or were not affected by the long term (14 days) LED treatments ( Fig. S1, Supplementary information).

Besides these non-volatile compounds, volatile profiles can also be modulated by specific light wavelengths, which were mostly investigated in flowers and fruits 524. In the present study, blue and red lights promoted accumulations of most endogenous volatiles in the tea leaves ( Figs 1,  2,  3), providing an evidence of modulation of leaf volatiles by light wavelength. In fruits of tomato, strawberry, and blueberry, the light wavelength did not significantly affect or increase the accumulation of VFADs compared with the dark treatment 5. In contrast, VFADs in tea leaves were significantly increased by blue and red lights ( Fig. 3). In petunia flowers, red and far-red lights had more effects on VPBs and blue light had little or no effect on them 5, whereas VPBs in tea leaves had more response to blue and red lights ( Fig. 2).

In the present study, blue and red lights can achieve the enhancement of contents of the three classes of volatiles.

37,"To further find out how blue and red lights increase the volatiles in the preharvest tea leaves, we investigated the effects of blue and red lights on the pathways of VTs, VPBs, and VFADs including key precursors and genes. At present, analytical methodology of geranyl diphosphate (GDP) in tea leaves is unavailable. Firstly we established an acid hydrolysis of GDP to determine GDP amount by measuring the amounts of volatiles from the acidic hydrolysis of GDP. Linalool was positively recognized as a major volatile product of the acidic hydrolysis of GDP ( Fig. S3A). Furthermore, a good linear relationship was established between GDP amount and its acidic hydrolyzed product (linalool) content, although in the acidic hydrolysis system, GDP was not completely (or 100%) transformed to linalool ( Fig. S3B). In contrast to the dark treatment, blue and red lights did not increase the level of GDP that leading to the formation of VTs ( Fig. 1), and decreased the level of  l-phenylalanine ( l-Phe), which is a key precursor of VPBs ( Fig. 2). α-Linolenic acid was not detected in tea leaves, which may be due to that its content was below detection limit. However, linoleic acid was detected and its content was not increased by the light wavelength ( Fig. S4). Interestingly, blue and red lights significantly up-regulated the expression levels of  terpene synthase ( TPS) involved in the formation of VTs,  phenylalanine ammonialyase ( PAL) involved in the formation of VPBs, and  9/13-lipoxygenase ( LOX) involved in the formation of VFADs ( Figs 1,  2,  3).

In fresh tea leaves, most volatile terpenes are mono-terpenes that are derived from GDP 7. Analytical result of GDP amounts of tea leaves showed that blue and red lights did not significantly affect the amount of GDP in contrast to the dark treatment ( Fig. 1), suggesting the GDP content was not influenced by light wavelength. As GDP can be converted to volatile mono-terpenes under the action of  TPS, we investigated the effects of blue and red lights on the  TPS1,  TPS2, and  TPS3, which are possibly involved in formation of linalool and geraniol in tea leaves 27. Furthermore, the  TPS1 and  TPS3 recombinant proteins produced in  Escherichia coli were demonstrated to exhibit the activity of transformation from GDP to linalool ( Fig. S6A,B).

40,"The second most ubiquitous class of plant volatiles consists of VPBs containing an aromatic ring. Most volatiles from this class are derived from shikimate  vial-Phe. The first committed step in the biosynthesis of many VPBs is the deamination of  l-Phe to  trans-cinnamic acid (CA) by the enzyme PAL 25, whereas the biosynthesis of other VPBs- related compounds such as 2-phenylethanol, does not occur  via CA and competes with PAL for  l-Phe utilization, and is formed under the actions of PAAS and PAR 2829. In the present study,  l-Phe amount of tea leaves exposed to blue and red lights was much lower than that of dark treatment ( Fig. 2). In our previous study, most amino acids including  l-Phe were present at higher levels in dark treated leaves in contrast to tea leaves exposed to light condition, which may be due to the degradation of proteins under dark-induced carbohydrate starvation 9. In contrast, expression level of  PAL gene was significantly up-regulated by blue and red lights, which may lead to big increase in benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde ( Fig. 2). The PAL was reported to be involved in the pathway from  l-Phe to CA in tea leaves 30 and PAL recombinant protein produced in  E. coli exhibited the activity of transformation from  l-Phe to CA ( Fig. S6A,C). Blue and red lights did not affect the amount of 2-phenylethanol.This may be due to that blue and red lights did not increase expression levels of  PAAS and  PAR genes, which are likely involved in the formation of 2-phenylethanol in tea leaves (Figs S7 and S8).

41,"A third group of plant volatiles is derived by oxidative cleavage and decarboxylation of various fatty acids, resulting in the production of shorter-chain volatiles with aldehyde and ketone moieties.

The first step of this pathway is the dioxygenation of unsaturated fatty acids, catalyzed by LOX.

The  LOX1 identified in tea leaves is proposed as a wounding stress-response gene 31. The other three genes are proposed to likely be light wavelength-response genes.

In the present study, single light wavelength had less remarkable influence on the formation of volatiles in the postharvest leaves compared with the preharvest leaves, which may be due to the relatively short time application of single light wavelength on postharvest leaves.

GO enrichment analysis showed that most of the gene sets were downregulated in the SOF library, and these genes were mainly related to epigenetics, flower development, cytosols, and binding ( S12 File). KEGG classification showed that 14 groups were significantly enriched, and most of these genes were downregulated in the SOF library and were related to ribosomes and DNA replication ( S12 File).

The functional annotation for these unigenes was provided in  S13 File. For example, contig_2561 showed lower expression levels in SOFB and SOF than in SOB and was homologous with  Catharathus roseus cinnamic acid 4-hydrolase (C4H), related to flavonoid biosynthesis. Other genes associated with anthocyanins biosynthesis showed higher expression levels in SOB and SOF than in SOFB.

72,"Previously, we reported the occurrence of a mixture of triterpenes belonging to ursane, lupane, oleanane, lanostane, and cycloartane skeletons in the Brazilian yellow propolis sample from Mato Grosso do Sul under evaluation [ 11]. The presence of such lipophilic compounds and the absence of aromatic compounds were confirmed by  1H-NMR analysis of EEYP and fractions obtained by chromatography. By gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, lupeol and  β-amyrin were identified as the main triterpenes in yellow propolis [ 11], representing 44.80% and 13.64%, respectively, of the total composition of the extract (see Table 1S in Supplementary Material available online at  http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/2906953). All fractions obtained by chromatographic fractionation of EEYP had similar chemical profiles by  1H-NMR and showed the lack of aromatic compounds and predominance of high field resonances.

73,"To compare the impact of single and combined stress on physiological and transcriptional plant responses, tea plants were exposed to cold, drought, and their combination. The optimal experimental conditions for single stress were defined first and then combined. Mild conditions were chosen to mimic long-term stresses that naturally occur in the field compared with the drought or cold shock used in comparable studies. As illustrated in Figure  1A, drought treatment (DT) was applied by gradually withholding water and lasted 15 days to induce leaf senescence. For cold treatment (CT), plants were exposed to decreased temperatures of acclimation (15/10°C) for 3 days and chilling (6/4°C for 3 days and 4/2°C for 9 days) for 12 days For combined stress treatments (CD), we applied cold and drought stress simultaneously for 15 days. Well-watered plants under ambient temperatures (25°C day/20°C night) were used as a control (CK). After 15 days of stress treatment, a number of curly yellow and reddish-brown leaves were observed in DT, while for CT, only some wilting and yellow patches were observed (mainly 1st–3rd leaf). As for CD stressed plants, leaf senescence was remarkably delayed, and drought did not induce the severe senescence response (Figure  1A). As a starting point for the analysis, we determined relative electrolyte conductivity (REC), relative water content (RWC), and leaf maximum photochemical quantum yield of PS II ( Fv/Fm) of different treatment groups at six time-points (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days) (Figures  1B–D). It was expected that both cold and drought stresses may cause cell dehydration and over-accumulation of ROS, resulting in damage to membrane and photosynthesis system at the cellular level. At the time of harvest, a significant reduction in RWC and  Fv/Fm, and an increase in EL were found for CT and CD, which was emphasized even more on DT (Figures  1B–D).

Our analysis also revealed a substantial number of CD-unique DEGs (3543, 31.5%), which were absent from the list of DEGs under CT and DT. In addition, only 2071 genes (12.7% of all DEGs) were modulated in all the three stress conditions, and only 7721 of genes (47.4% of all DEGs) that responded to either CT or DT were activated by CD (Figure  2A). The CD triggered a totally different and higher response compared to each of the different stresses applied individually, suggesting that tea plants may develop some distinct response mechanism when presented with combined CD stress.

In addition, 38% of the unigenes were involved in the “prioritized,” “combinatorial,” and canceled” mode, whose expressing patterns under CD cannot be predicted from the CT or DT alone due to the interaction of two kinds of stress responses.

79,"To assess how low temperature can delay drought-induced senescence, we performed a BLAST search of 16,294 DEGs against 6446 SAG sequences reported on the Leaf Senescence Database (LSD) (Li et al.,  2014). The output of the BLAST search was that 6878 candidate unigenes displayed high sequence similarity. Among these candidates, 3538, 3406, and 4756 putative  SAGs were differentially expressed under CT, DT, and CD, respectively. Based on the clustering analysis results (i.e., mode 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, and 20 in Figure  3), we further selected  SAGs with known effect (promote or delay) in LSD to mining the key genes that have a potential role in delaying leaf senescence under CD (Figure  4; Supplementary Table  5). Among the delaying subsets (39), the most significantly expressed categories were genes associated with chlorophyll biosynthesis ( CAO), nutrient recycling ( ATG8F and  ATG4), hormone response pathway (e.g.,  ABA2, ARR9, and  EIN4), lipid metabolism (e.g.,  ASAT1, PDAT1 and  HMG1/ 2/R1/ R2), stress response (e.g.,  LTI65/ RD29B and  DREB1C), signal transduction (e.g.,  ESC, PHYA1, FRI) and protein degradation/modification (e.g.,  PUB44, RPN10/ 5A, and  AP1M2/2M/4M) (Figure  4A; Supplementary Table  5). As for the promote subsets (59), genes related to carbohydrate metabolism ( HXK2), chlorophyll degradation ( CLH2 and  FTSH4/5/6), hormone response pathway (e.g.,  BRI1/SR160, ARF5/19, ETR1, ACS1/10/12, and  LOX2.1/6), signal transduction (e.g.,  GBF1, CYCD6-1, HD3A, PHYC, and  MMK2) and transcription regulation (e.g.,  RAV1, BEL1, DEFA, and  WRKY6/41/53) were overrepresented. Most of these  SAGs have clear functional connections to senescence programs (Figure  4B; Supplementary Table  5). For example,  DREB1C/CBF2 (c24529_g1), a well-known transcription activator acts to enhance plant frost tolerance, was up-regulated in CT and CD (Heidarvand and Maali Amiri,  2010). This gene has also previously been shown to delays the onset of leaf senescence and extends the life span of the plants (Sharabi-Schwager et al.,  2010a). Noteworthy, both the target ( LTI65/ RD29B, c24070_g1) and the activator ( CAMTA3, c71106_g1) of CBF2 can be found significantly induced exclusively in CD.  ARF19 (c65424_g2) encoding a member of the auxin response factor were repressed in CT and CD. This gene is known to function as a transcriptional activator to enhance the senescence and abscission phenotypes (Ellis et al.,  2005).  LOX2.1 (c70024_g1 and c69658_g5) involved in JA-mediating leaf senescence was repressed in CT and CD (He et al.,  2002).  HMG1 (c69026_g2) was significantly induced in response to CT and CD, and it has been implicated in modulating cell elongation and senescence by promoting triterpene biosynthesis (Suzuki et al.,  2004). These results suggested that although DT usually results in leaf senescence, CT can delay the senescence process by manipulating a set of transcription factors (TFs), hormone regulation-related genes and  SAGs in tea plants.","['BLAST search', 'Supplementary Table', 'Senescence Database', 'Leaf Senescence', 'senescence', 'low temperature', 'Figure', 'sequences reported', 'BLAST', 'drought-induced senescence']","[CD, 9, ATG8F, ARR9, PDAT1, PHYA1, FRI, RPN10/, HXK2, CLH2, ARF5/19, ETR1, ACS1/10/12, CYCD6-1, HD3A, PHYC, BEL1, DEFA, c24529_g1, Heidarvand, LTI65/ RD29B, c24070_g1, CAMTA3, c71106_g1, CBF2, c65424_g2, auxin response factor, CD, c70024_g1, c69658_g5, CD, c69026_g2, CD]",[],[],NaN

In addition, genes relevant to signaling transduction and stress response were mostly induced among the CD uniquely responsive genes. These results hinted toward prioritized plant responses for growth, signaling and stress responses under combined CD stress. Accordingly, membrane protection (e.g.,  FAD3), cell wall maintaining/remodeling (e.g.,  CALS8/10/12, UPTG2, KAM1, GMGT1, and  EXPA1), redox (e.g.,  GRXS10, PNC2, APX2/ 6 and PER25/48), and stress response (e.g.,  LEA1, HSP70-14/15/16, and  HSFA4A) related genes were highly induced among the CD-unique DEGs, whilst chlorophyll degradation (e.g.,  FTSH) related genes were repressed. Meanwhile, calcium (e.g.,  CCAMK, CML31, and  CPK2), phytohormones (e.g.,  IAA30, GA2OX8, PYL8, ARR9, and  ERF061/ 118), and MAPK signaling pathway (e.g.,  MPK9/ 19/20, NPK1, MEKK1, and  YDA), transcription regulation (e.g.,  C3H, NAC002, MYB108, WRKY71, BHLH35, and  VIP1) and ubiquitin-26S proteasome system (e.g.,  XERICO and  KEG) were further activated by combined CD stress. For example, the RING-type E3  XERICO has been shown to increase ABA levels and improve drought tolerance by inducing the expression of  NCED3 (Ko et al.,  2006). In our study, two  XERICO (c52433_g1 and c44256_g1) were uniquely induced in CD, and two  NCED3 (c63576_g6 and c63576_g7) were induced to a highest level in CD. Gibberellin 2-oxidase 8 ( GA2ox8) and two-component response regulator ARR9 ( ARR9), the negative regulators of some bioactive GA and CK signaling respectively, were induced exclusively by CD. Both GA and CK have been known as negative regulators of plant abiotic stress tolerance (Yamaguchi and Kamiya,  2000; Ha et al.,  2012). This indicated growth-restraining is also an integral part of plant stress tolerance to promote survival during CD (Achard et al.,  2006). Callose has been implicated as an essential component in abiotic and biotic stresses tolerance by reinforcing cell wall (Chen and Kim,  2009). The specifically induction of callose synthase 8/10/12 ( CALS8/10/12) indicating cell wall thickening maybe one of the strategies used by tea plants to cope with combined CD stress (Supplementary Table  6).","['Supplementary Figure', 'stress', 'functional category', 'significantly up-regulated', 'terms include', 'stress response', 'Supplementary Table', 'classification analysis', 'found functional', 'down-regulated terms']","[CD-unique, “growth”, “cell, ”, “, ”, “cell, CD, UPTG2, KAM1, GMGT1, PNC2, APX2/ 6, PER25/48, HSP70-14/15/16, CD-unique, CML31, GA2OX8, PYL8, ARR9, MAPK, NPK1, MEKK1, NAC002, MYB108, WRKY71, BHLH35, ubiquitin-26S, ABA, Ko et, c52433_g1, c44256_g1, CD, c63576_g6, c63576_g7, Gibberellin 2-oxidase 8, GA2ox8, ARR9, ARR9, GA, CK, CD, GA, CK, Ha, callose synthase, 8/10/12, CALS8/10/12]",[],[],NaN
82,"KEGG pathway analysis showed that genes modulated in CT, DT, and CD were associated with similar pathways viz., MAPK signaling, photosynthesis, antioxidant, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and secondary metabolites biosynthesis (Figure  5B). Pathways related to antioxidant protection (“carotenoid biosynthesis,” “flavonoid biosynthesis,” “glutathione metabolism,” and “ascorbate and aldarate metabolism”) were significantly up-regulated, whereas photosynthesis-associated pathways (“photosynthesis,” “photosynthesis-antenna proteins,” and “porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism”) were down-represented under both single and combined stresses. These observations suggested that the suppression of photosynthesis and the activation of antioxidant system may be considered as common stress responses, which could have some positive functions such as the protection from the photodamage during stress. Apart from these shared stress responses, the combined stress invoked different pathways. For instance, CD-unique DEGs mapped to oxidative phosphorylation, pentose phosphate pathway, fructose, and mannose metabolism, galactose metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, terpenoids metabolism, zeatin, folate, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, and various antioxidative pathways, such as peroxisome, glutathione, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism (Supplementary Table  7). In addition, we observed a more pronounced reduction in photosynthesis-related pathways, enhanced ROS production (up-regulation of respiratory burst oxidase homolog proteins ( Rboh) and peroxisomal-(S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase ( GLO); Supplementary Table  8), and enriched “apoptosis” pathway in DT, which indicating the occurrence of drought-induced leaf senescence (Figure  5B). We then detailed investigated the “starch and sucrose metabolism” pathway, and we found most starch degradation related genes (e.g., Alpha-amylase 1/1.1,  AMY1/1.1; Beta-amylase 1/2/3/7,  BAM1/2/3/7) were up-regulated, while most genes involved in starch synthase (e.g., Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase 1,  PGI1; Soluble starch synthase 1,  SSI1; Granule-bound starch synthase 2,  SS2; Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase large subunit 1,  ADG2; and Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase large subunit,  AGPS1/3) were repressed under all stress conditions. In addition, sucrose synthesis related genes (e.g., sucrose-phosphate synthase 2/3/4,  SPS2/3/4) were specifically up-regulated in CT, while genes associated with sucrose degradation (e.g., Acid beta-fructofuranosidase,  TIV1 and Sucrose synthase 2/3,  SUS2/3) were highly induced in DT while compared to CT and CD. Several key enzymatic genes related to cell wall degradation, loosing and modification (e.g., pectinesterase 2,  PECS-2.1; and pectinesterase/pectinesterase inhibitor 40,  PME40) were significantly induced during DT, which was otherwise repressed upon CT and CD. In contrast, enzymatic genes which are essential for the cell wall biosynthesis, such as galacturonosyltransferase 1/10/11 ( GAUT1/10/11), UDP-glucuronate 4-epimerase 3 ( GAE3), were specifically up-regulated under CT and CD.

83,"During a combined stress situation, resource constraints dictate that the plant may be able to induce only the most effective genes. To identify the key genes for producing plants resistant to combined CD stresses, we calculated the fold changes between combined stress and each single stress (i.e., CD/CT and CD/DT) for the 725 co-up-regulated genes, and 319 genes tended to show more enhanced expression in combined stress condition than in both single stresses were retained (Figure  6; Supplementary Table  9). We found these genes were associated with TFs (e.g.,  WRKY48, MYB39/306, HSFA8, ERF110/053, and  DREB2A/C), detoxification (e.g.,  CYP94A2/22), cell wall remodeling (e.g.,  EXPA1 and XTH23), ubiquitin mediated proteolysis (e.g.,  UBC4/32/38, COP1, and ATL42), hormone signal transduction (e.g.,  PLD1, IAA17, and  PP2C3/AIP1), terpenoids metabolism (e.g.,  HMGR1/2), carbohydrate metabolism (e.g.,  SUC2/7, and  BAM3) and stress tolerance (e.g.,  LEA5/14-A). They could be further classified into three subgroups. We observed a higher expression in Group I and II, which are more likely candidates to be involved in plant adaptations to combined CD stress. For example,  SUT2/7 (Sucrose Transporter 2/7) in the Group I, encoding the sucrose transporters responsible for loading of sucrose in source leaves for export to sinks, have shown to be induced by low temperature and osmotic stress via ABA signaling pathway (Gong et al.,  2015). Many genes among the Group II (e.g.,  NAC7/19, DREB2A/C, LEA5/14-A, NCED3, MYB39/306, and ERF53) have been known to impart abiotic stress resistance to plants and cope with multiple stresses via ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways (Yoshida et al.,  2014). DREB2A and DREB2C are key TFs involved in the signal transduction network that control the plant's response to dehydration and cold stress. The DREB2C overexpression lines conferred freezing and heat tolerance to plants, and it was previously reported to interacts with ABF2, a bZip protein regulating ABA-responsive gene expression, and its overexpression affects ABA sensitivity (Lee et al.,  2010). LEA proteins may have protective functions during cellular dehydration through mechanisms such as hydration buffering, ion trapping, antioxidant protection, stabilization of sensitive enzymes and membrane protection (Tunnacliffe and Wise,  2007). Overexpressing the  ZmDREB2A showed upregulation of 44 genes belonging to LEA, heat shock, detoxification proteins and enzymes involved in metabolism, etc. (Qin et al.,  2007). However, the overexpression of  DREB2A also adversely affects plant growth (Sakuma et al.,  2006). Intriguingly, gene encoding Growth-regulating factor 7 ( GRF7, c59210_g1), an inhibitor of DREB2A was highly induced in CT and CD (Kim et al.,  2012). This may indicate that tea plants tend to keep up with the trade-off between increased stress tolerance and adverse effects to plant growth in CT and CD. In addition, we found 36.7% (117) of candidate genes has no annotation results on Swiss-prot database, which may be the tea plant-specific genes that response to combined CD stress. Thus, the manipulation of these candidate genes, or their regulators, may represent an effective strategy for the genetic engineering of plant varieties resistant to concurrent cold and drought stresses.","['stress', 'combined stress', 'genes', 'Supplementary Table', 'combined', 'resource constraints', 'constraints dictate', 'plant', 'stress situation', 'Group']","[CD, CD/DT, MYB39/306, ERF110/053, XTH23, ubiquitin, COP1, ATL42, IAA17, sucrose transporters, ABA, DREB2A/C, LEA5/14-A, NCED3, MYB39/306, ERF53, DREB2A, DREB2C, DREB2C, ABF2, bZip, ABA, Wise, GRF7, c59210_g1, DREB2A, CD, CD]",[],[],NaN

99,"The caladium root transcriptome as assembled above consists of 137,354 transcripts and 71,825 unigenes. This number of unigenes largely exceeds the number of gene models in the majority of sequenced plant genomes (20,000 to 40,000) [ 26]. This phenomenon seems to be not uncommon in transcriptome assemblies and analyses of other aroids [ 25] and other non-model plants [ 26]. In  Anthurium, a high proportion of short unigenes (69.8%) and a large number of unigenes (111,268) were reported [ 25]. Several factors might have contributed to this phenomenon. The lack of reference genome sequences in non-model plants makes it difficult to reconstruct full-length gene transcripts from short sequence reads and read alignments. Consequently, multiple unigenes representing the same genes might have failed to be assembled and were treated as independent unigenes, resulting in large numbers of short unigenes and excessive unigene numbers [ 26]. Alternative splicing of protein-coding genes and expression of transposable elements and pseudogenes will certainly result in larger numbers of transcripts than the number of gene models annotated based on genome sequences. A third potential cause of the large number of unigenes in the current caladium root transcriptome assembly might be the relative large size of the caladium genome (≈4.5 Gb) [ 1]. When a species possesses a large sized and highly duplicated genome, the number of unigenes tended to be larger [ 26]. In  Amorphophallus bulbifer, an aroid with a genome of ≈9.0 Gb, 119,678 unigenes was reported for its leaf transcriptome. In  Allium cepa, a plant with a nuclear genome of 16 Gb, its bulb transcriptome consisted of 115,251 unigenes [ 27].","['unigenes', 'number', 'genome', 'large number', 'large', 'transcriptome', 'numbers', 'short unigenes', 'non-model plants', 'gene']","[caladium genome, ≈4.5, ≈9.0, 119,678, 115,251]",[],[],NaN

Several factors might have contributed to the presence of large numbers of short unigenes, including under-estimated sequencing depth needs, the use of stringent parameters in the assembly process, lack of reference genomes for read mapping, and highly complex transcriptomes. Deep sequencing using the single molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) technology may be a very effective approach to extending unigenes to full-length transcripts.","['caladium unigenes', 'unigenes', 'short unigenes', 'non-model plants', 'sequencing', 'caladium', 'short', 'novo assembly', 'frequent issue', 'assembly process']","[caladium unigenes, SMRT]",[],[],NaN

102,"In response to attacks by necrotrophic pathogens, the innate immune system of plants perceives PAMPs with PRRs and activates PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) against the pathogens [ 13]. PTI involves a number of cellular processes, including accumulation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, modulation of hormone level, secretion of antimicrobial compounds, and reinforcing of the cell wall [ 34]. In this study, we compared unigenes in the root transcriptome of “Candidum” (moderately resistant to  P. myriotylum) with those in the root transcriptomes of “Gingerland” and “Miss Muffet” (both highly susceptible to the pathogen) and identified 4518 unigenes that were present only in the root transcriptome of “Candidum” ( Figure 6 and  Table S7). These unique unigenes were examined for potential involvement in disease resistance and plant defense, in particular, (1) early signal perception and transduction in plant-pathogen interactions; (2) hormone regulation during plant defense responses to necrotrophic pathogens; and (3) secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activities in plant defense ( Table 5).","['PAMP-triggered immunity', 'innate immune', 'immune system', 'perceives PAMPs', 'activates PAMP-triggered', 'necrotrophic pathogens', 'PTI involves', 'root transcriptome', 'plant defense', 'PTI']","[necrotrophic pathogens, PAMPs, PRRs, PTI, “Candidum”, “Gingerland”, “Miss, ”, “Candidum”]",[],[],NaN
103,"Recognition of PAMPs through membrane-localized PRRs during plant-pathogen interactions can induce an immune response syndrome [ 35]. Previous studies have indicated that a series of plant RLKs could be PRRs for plant immune responses [ 36]. Lack of RLKs could attenuate plant responses to pathogens, resulting in disease susceptibility [ 37]. All RLKs are transmembrane proteins, each containing a signal sequence, a putative extracellular domain at the amino-terminal, and an intracellular kinase domain at carboxyl-terminal [ 38]. Previous studies have shown that RLKs participate in many biologically important processes that confer disease resistance [ 39].","['plant-pathogen interactions', 'response syndrome', 'membrane-localized PRRs', 'Previous studies', 'RLKs', 'immune', 'immune response', 'Recognition', 'syndrome', 'Previous']","[PAMPs, PRRs, RLKs, PRRs, RLKs, RLKs, RLKs]",[],[],NaN
104,"Of the 4518 unigenes found only in “Candidum”, 50 unigenes can be translated into RLKs, including one  l-type lection receptor kinase (LecRK), one cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase (CRK2), 12 receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinases (STKs), 31 proline-rich receptor-like protein kinases (PERKs), and five possible RLKs ( Table 5 and  Table S8). LecRKs are important immune receptors that bind to the effectors produced by  Phytophthora infestans [ 40]. Previous studies have shown that  LecRK genes confer resistance in  Arabidopsis to several necrotrophic oomycetes including  Phytophthora brassicae and  Botrytis cinerea [ 41, 42]. The one  LecRK homolog in “Candidum” may play a positive role in its disease resistance. CRKs are one of the largest classes of RLKs in plants [ 43]. Studies in  Arabidopsis have shown that CRKs regulate plant development, stress adaptation, and disease resistance [ 44]. Yang et al. [ 45] found that a novel  CRK homolog ( TaCRK1) is involved in wheat resistance to  Rhizocotonia cerealis and the expression levels of  TaCRK1 were significantly higher in moderately resistant lines than in highly susceptible lines. In “Candidum” root transcriptome, only one  CRK homolog ( CRK2) was observed ( Table 5). Another important type of plant receptor-like kinases are STKs, which can phosphorylate the hydroxyl group (OH) of serine or threonine residues, resulting in functional alterations of target proteins [ 46]. The phosphorylated proteins play an important role in disease resistance pathway by triggering a series of downstream activities including protein modulation, protein-protein interaction, transcription factor activation, and secretion of antimicrobial metabolites [ 47]. It has been shown that two wheat  STK homologs,  Tsn1 and  Stpk-V, are the key genes conferring resistance against biotrophic  Blumeria graminis (wheat powdery mildew) and the necrotrophic pathogens  Stagonospora nodorum (Stagonospora nodorum blotch) and  Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (tan spot) [ 46, 48]. In this study, 12  STK homologs were observed exclusively in the “Candidum” root transcriptome ( Table 5). In addition, we found that a majority of RLKs in the “Candidum” (60%) root transcriptome belong to PERKs. In  Arabidopsis, PERKs represent a small family of RLKs, all sharing an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a kinase domain [ 38]. PERKs in  Arabidopsis roots are involved in callose and cellulose deposition; PERK1 mutants have lost their ability to accumulate callose and cellulose in cell walls [ 49]. Silva and Goring [ 50] found that PERK1 could response to both mechanical stresses and infection by fungal pathogens and may have a function in the general perception of wounds or recognition of pathogen stimuli. In the “Candidum” root transcriptome, 31  PERK homologs were observed ( Table 5), and these  PERKs may be good candidates for further gene expression studies. There were five possible  RLK-like unigenes ( Table 5) that could not be further annotated, suggesting that these  RLK-like unigenes may represent unique transcripts in caladium and their functions remain to be studied.","['Candidum', 'Table', 'l-type lection', 'lection receptor', 'resistance', 'Arabidopsis', 'root transcriptome', 'disease resistance', 'CRK homolog', 'RLKs']","[RLKs, receptor kinase, LecRK, cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase, CRK2, 12 receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinases, receptor-like protein kinases, PERKs, RLKs, LecRKs, “Candidum”, RLKs, CRKs, “Candidum”, CRK2, wheat  STK, wheat powdery mildew, RLKs, “Candidum”, PERKs, PERKs, RLKs, PERKs, PERK1, PERK1, PERK]",[],[],NaN
105,"After plant perception of PAMPs, signals from the PRR complexes are transferred to downstream targets through several secondary messengers, including influx of calcium (Ca 2+), reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [ 51]. The calcium influx is an early step in the signal transduction processes [ 52]. Ca 2+ influx can be sensed by several stimulus-specific Ca 2+-binding sensors such as calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) and Calmodulins (CaMs). Previous studies have shown that transgenic potato plants containing  StCDPK4 and  StCDPK5 ( CPK homologs) gain resistance to  Phytophthora infestans [ 53]. A wheat  CPK homolog ( TaCPK7-D) is involved in determining resistance to necrotrophic pathogen  Rhizoctonia cerealis. Here, we identified eight CPKs homologs only in “Candidum“ ( Table 5 and  Table S9) and suspect that they may be important signal sensors which modulate resistance to necrotrophic pathogens. CaMs and CaM-like (CML) genes could trigger plant defense responses to a broad range of pathogens. In tobacco, a  CML gene,  NtCaM13, is a key gene for resistance to the necrotrophic pathogens  Pythium aphanidermatum and  Rhizoctonia solani [ 54]. Four  CaM gene homologs were identified among “Candidum” unigenes ( Table 5). ROS are important signals to modulate the expression of defense-related genes to fungal pathogen attacks [ 55]. The production of ROS involves a number of oxidative enzymes such as the NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase, the superoxide dismutase, the cell wall peroxidase, the oxalate oxidase, the lipoxygenase, and the polyamine oxidase [ 56]. These enzymes work collaboratively or separately to initiate a series of responses including cell wall remodeling, signal transduction, programming cell death, and post-translation regulation to resist pathogens [ 56]. So far, our understanding of the roles ROS play in plant roots and resistance against necrotrophic pathogens is still rudimentary [ 56]. In banana, studies have shown that a NADPH oxidase homolog ( Rboh) confers resistance against the necrotrophic pathogen  Fusarium oxysporum. In  Arabidopsis and cotton,  F. oxysporum-resistant lines accumulated ROS faster than the susceptible lines [ 57, 58]. In this study, we identified five putative ROS-related unigenes (superoxide dismutase) that were exclusively expressed in “Candidum” ( Table 5). MAPK activation is another early signaling activity after plants sense the attack from pathogens [ 59]. Plant MAPK cascades transfer signals from PRRs to downstream components [ 60]. In  Arabidopsis, MAPK cascades involve several MAPKs such as MEKK1, MKK1/MKK2 (two redundant MAPKKs), MPK4/MPK5 (two redundant MAPKs), and MPK3/MPK6 (two partially redundant MAPKs). Previous studies have shown that MPK3, MPK4, MPK6, MKK1, MKK2, and MEKK1 are involved in innate immune responses against necrotrophic pathogens [ 61]. Of 4956 unigenes only observed in the “Candidum” root transcriptome, there were eight  MAPK homologs including three  MPK1, two  MPK2, one  MPK4, one  MPK5, and one  MPK14 homolog ( Table 5).","['Table', 'necrotrophic pathogens', 'secondary messengers', 'reactive oxygen', 'oxygen species', 'Candidum', 'ROS', 'necrotrophic', 'pathogens', 'resistance']","[PAMPs, mitogen-activated protein kinases, MAPKs, calcium-dependent protein kinases, CPKs, CaMs, CPK homologs, CPKs, CaMs, CaM-like (CML), superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, oxalate oxidase, lipoxygenase, polyamine oxidase, NADPH oxidase homolog, superoxide dismutase, MAPK, MAPK, PRRs, MAPK, MAPKs, MEKK1, MKK1/MKK2 (, MAPKKs, MAPKs, MPK3/MPK6, MAPKs, MPK3, MPK4, MPK6, MKK1, MKK2, MEKK1, MPK2]",[],[],NaN
106,"Increased biosynthesis of hormones is an important plant defense response to invading pathogens [ 37]. In plants, ethylene (ET) and jasmonic acid (JA) are two important hormones involved in resistance against necrotrophic pathogens.  S-adenosylmethionine ( S-AdoMet) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) are two precursors of ethylene [ 62]. Enzymes catalyzing ET biosynthesis reactions include ACC synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO) [ 62]. Among the annotated unigenes in “Candidum”, both key enzymes participating in ET synthesis were identified ( Table 5 and  Table S10). Synthesized ethylene can be then perceived and transduced by ethylene receptors to trigger downstream biological responses. There are several types of ethylene receptors in  Arabidopsis, such as ethylene receptors (ETRs), ethylene response sensors (ERSs), and ethylene insensitive (EINs) [ 63]. However, the roles ethylene receptors play in necrotrophic pathogen resistance seem to be different depending on plant species and the types of pathogens. In  Arabidopsis, the  ein2 (ethylene insensitive) mutant lines displayed increased susceptibility to the necrotrophic pathogen  Botrytis cinerea [ 64], while in soybean, the  etr1 and  etr2 (ethylene-resistant) mutant lines showed increased resistance against  Phytophthora sojae [ 65]. In this study, we observed 14  ETR homologs that were expressed in the three caladium cultivars. One  ETR-like unigene was expressed exclusively in the “Candidum” root transcriptome; this unigene could be a good candidate for future studies.","['ethylene', 'ethylene receptors', 'plant defense', 'ACC', 'important hormones', 'invading pathogens', 'receptors', 'important plant', 'Candidum', 'defense response']","[ACC oxidase, “Candidum”, ethylene receptors]",[],[],NaN
107,"JA is another important hormone in plant defense against many necrotrophic pathogens [ 66]. It has been reported that exogenous applications of methyl jasmonate to  Arabidopsis enhance plant resistance to root rot disease caused by the necrotrophic pathogen  Pythium mastophorum [ 67]. Cohen et al. [ 68] found that methyl jasmonate-treated potatoes showed increased resistance to  Phytophthora infestans. Studies in tomato have shown that the  CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1 gene ( COI1), the acyl-CoA oxidase gene ( ACX1A), the  suppressor of prosystemin-mediated responses2 ( SPR2), and the  defenseless1 gene ( def1) are involved in JA-induced defense responses against necrotrophic pathogens such as  Botrytis cinerea [ 37]. Tomato plants with either one of these genes mutated could not correctly process JA synthesis, and JA signal perception or transduction, resulting in disrupted immune responses and susceptible plants [ 37]. We found that 55 unigenes were potentially involved in JA synthesis and expressed in all three caladium cultivars. One  ACX1A homolog was expressed only in “Candidum” ( Table 5), which suggests that this unigene may be a good candidate for further gene expression studies.","['important hormone', 'necrotrophic pathogens', 'pathogen Pythium', 'Pythium mastophorum', 'necrotrophic', 'Arabidopsis enhance', 'gene', 'pathogens', 'plant', 'plants']","[potatoes, COI1, ACX1A, SPR2, def1, JA signal]",[],[],NaN
108,"Plants can secrete secondary metabolites around their rhizosphere to inhibit or repel soil-borne pathogens. In general, phenolics and terpenoids are two primary classes of root-secreted antimicrobial metabolites [ 69]. Common root-secreted phenolic compounds include phenylpropanoids and flavonoids [ 70]. Many phenylpropanoids from a broad range of plant species have shown antimicrobial activities [ 71]. Phenylpropanoids in chickpea roots affect resistance against the necrotrophic pathogen  Fusarium oxysporum; resistant chickpea varieties produce significantly more phenylpropanoids than susceptible ones [ 72]. Lanoue et al. [ 71] found that phenylpropanoids were constitutively secreted by the barley root system and inhibited  Fusarium graminearum spore germination. In “Candidum“, we found two unigenes that are likely involved in phenylpropanoid synthesis. Flavonoids are often one of the largest groups of phenolics in root exudates [ 69]. Studies in maize have indicated that high levels of flavonoids are associated with an increased defensive state in its roots [ 73]. We identified four unigenes in “Candidum” that are likely involved in flavonoid synthesis ( Table 5 and  Table S11).","['secrete secondary', 'repel soil-borne', 'secondary metabolites', 'phenylpropanoids', 'soil-borne pathogens', 'Candidum', 'metabolites', 'antimicrobial metabolites', 'Fusarium', 'Table']","[“Candidum“, “Candidum”]",[],[],NaN
109,"Terpenoids are another large group of compounds in root exudates that have antimicrobial activities [ 74].

We identified four unigenes in the “Candidum” root transcriptome that are likely involved in the terpenoid synthesis pathway. Derivatives of tryptophan are another important antimicrobial root exudates. Typical examples of tryptophan derivatives include camalexin, which is produced by  Arabidopsis and exhibits antimicrobial activities to a wide range of soil-borne pathogens including  Pythium sylvaticum,  Rhizoctonia solani, and  Sclerotinia sclerotiorum [ 77, 78]. In the “Candidum” root transcriptome, we found nine tryptophan synthesis-related unigenes ( Table 5 and  Table S11), which may be involved in resistance against soil-borne necrotrophic pathogens.

113,"Molecular markers have become a highly valuable tool in genetic improvement of plant resistance to various pathogens [ 81].

The availability of molecular DNA markers closely linked to or associated with caladium root rot resistance will empower breeders to implement highly desired marker-assisted selection in caladium.

The results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses of all phytochemical compounds from the essential oils are reported in (Table  1 and Supplementary Table  S1). The identified phytochemical compounds are listed based on the retention time, compound mass and percentage of peak area (Fig.  1A,B). In young leaves, the monoterpene compounds were shown as the main group (66.64%), followed by the group of sesquiterpene compounds (15.87%) and diterpene compounds (1.4%). In old leaves, the monoterpene compounds were observed to be the main group (52.7%), followed by the sesquiterpene group (15.01%) and the diterpene group (14.18%), and only one triterpene compound represented 0.16%. Sesquiterpenes form the main group of compounds (23%) found in the stems, followed by diterpenes (19.53%), monoterpenes (19.11%) and and one triterpene compound represented 0.02% (Supplementary Table  S1). Moreover, the three hexane extracts from the different tissues for essential oils contained unique, common and major phytochemical compounds. For example, the essential oil extracts of young leaves (A) had 61 unique compounds, 35 common compounds shared with the essential oil extracts from old leaves, five common compounds shared with the essential oil extract from stems and 12 common compounds shared among all three plant parts. Furthermore, the old leaves (B) contained 57 unique compounds and four common compounds shared with the stems. On the other hand, the stems (C) contained 61 unique compounds (Fig.  1C).

The distribution of the assembled transcript length ranged from 200 to >2,000 bases; the maximum number of transcripts (34,051 transcripts, 38.45%) ranged from 200 bp to 500 bp, followed by 22,529 transcripts (25.44%) ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 bp and then 17,658 transcripts (19.94%) ranging from 500 to 1,000 bp. On the contrary, the lowest number of transcripts (14,316 transcripts, 16.17%) was obtained for a size of more than 2,000 bp. By contrast, the assembled unigene lengths were distributed between 200 and >2,000 bp. The maximum number of unigenes (27,381 unigenes, 56.26%) ranged from 200 to 500 bp, followed by 8,576 unigenes (17.62%) ranging from 500 to 1,000 bp and then 8.068 unigenes (16.58%) ranging from 1000 to 2,000 bp. Finally, the lowest number of unigenes (4,646 unigenes, 9.54%) was obtained for a size of >2000 bp.

116,"The total number of unigenes (48,671, 100% of all unigenes) was compared against the public dabases, including the NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (NR), the NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the KEGG orthology (KO), Swiss-Prot, the protein family annotation (PFAM), Gene Ontology (GO), and the euKaryotic Ortholog Groups database (KOG) annotation databases (Supplementary Table  S3 and Fig.  S2). The annotation percentage results in this research were higher than the annotation percentages in other non-model plant studies [58% in safflower ( Carthamus tinctorius) and 58.01% in Chinese fir ( C.  lanceolata)] 9,  25,  26. The international standardized gene functional annotation system (GO Annotation) provides a powerful way to recognize the functions and properties of sequences that have not been characterized for an organism 27. The BLAST2 GO program was used to categorize the functions of these annotated unigenes, and a total of 22,891 unigenes (47.03% of all of the assembled unigenes) were mapped to at least one GO term. Based on sequence homology, the unigene sequences from  S.  officinalis were categorized into 48 functional groups under three general sections: 59,883 were assigned to the biological process (BP), 43,029 were assigned to the cellular component (CC) and 29,760 were assigned to the molecular function (MF) sections. As a result, cellular process (13,933) and metabolic process (13,423) were the most enriched GO terms in the biological process (BP) section. Regarding the CC section, the cell (8,737) and cell part (8,720) were the most enriched. Within the molecular function (MF) section, binding (13,539) and catalytic activity (11,726) were highly enriched (Fig.  2). These results revealed that the main Gene Ontology (GO) classifications in the annotated unigenes were responsible for metabolism and fundamental biological regulation. These results were similar to previous results with the  S.  miltiorrhiza transcriptome and with the transcriptomes of  O.  sanctum and  O.  basilicum (members of the same family), which have the highest percentages of metabolic process, cellular process, cell, cell part, binding and catalytic activity 28,  29.

The lowest percentage of unigenes categories included channel regulator activity (56), cell junction (28) and cell killing (27).

To identify active biological functional pathways in the leaf tissues of  S.  officinalis, all 48,671 unigene sequences were mapped in reference to the canonical pathways of KEGG, but 9,716 (19.96%) unigene sequences could be assigned to 267 KEGG pathways. Furthermore, all transcripts were classified into five larger pathway categories, including cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, metabolism and organismal systems (Fig.  3). The highest number of transcripts from  S.  officinalis was assigned to the metabolism category, followed by genetic information processing, organismal systems, and cellular processes, whereas the lowest number of transcripts was related to the category of environmental information processing. Interestingly, 608 transcripts of  S.  officinalis were related to the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolite pathways, which were sorted into 27 subcategories, with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (ko00940), terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (ko00900) and carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00906) representing the largest subcategories (Supplementary Table  S4).

118,"Various types of terpenoids were found in the essential oil extracts of  S.  officinalis. The mixture contained mainly myrcene, (+)-neomenthol, 1,8-cineole, (3S)-linalool, α-humulene/β-caryophyllene, momilactone-A, gibberellin 3, gibberellin 2, ent-copalyl diphosphate, ent-kaurene, ent-kaurenoic acid, ent-isokaurene C2, gibberellin 20, and beta-amyrin. Precursor molecules for terpenoid biosynthesis are derived from the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) and plastidial methyl-erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. Therefore, queries against the Lamiaceae family transcriptome libraries were applied to identify and to determine genes that encode enzymes involved in the different steps of the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, such as Mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase, Isopentenyl phosphate kinase, isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase for swithing IPP to DMAPP isomerase, GPS (geranyl pyrophosphate synthase), FPS (farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase) and GGPS (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase) 31,  32. Furthermore, we identified and estimated the expression levels of isoprenoid genes by using uniprot annotations against the transcriptome libraries (Table  2). From the annotation data analyses, we found many transcript genes related to isoprenoid biosynthesis from the MEP pathway with higher expression levels, including gene transcripts such as  SoDXS4, 1(1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 4, 1),  SoDXR (1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase),  SoMCT (2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase),  SoISPF (2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase),  SoHDS2 ((E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase 2),  SoHDR2,3 (4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase 2, 3) and  SoIDI1 (isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase1). Additionally, we obtained some gene transcripts that were related to isoprenoid biosynthesis from the MVA pathway with higher expression levels, such as  SoAACT1, 4 (acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase 1, 4),  SoHMGS (hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA synthase),  SoHMGR4, 3, 2 (hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase 4, 3, 2)  SoMVK (mevalonate kinase) and  SoPMK (phospho-mevalonate kinase). Moreover, the transcriptome dataset of  S.  officinalis presented other genes, such as  SoGPS,  SoFPS2, and  SoGGPSΙΙ10, which are the immediate precursor of the mono-, sesqui-, and di-terpene biosynthesis pathway. The  SoGPS,  SoFPS2, and  SoGGPSΙΙ10 genes were highly abundant in leaves and had higher values of fragments per kilobase of transcripts per million mapped fragments (FPKM), which were 20.23, 281.11 and 49.23, respectively (Fig.  4 and Table  2).

119,"Plants produce various terpenoid compounds with highly diverse structures. These compounds play an important role and function in the interactions with environmental factors and in fundamental biological processes 32,  33. Multiple terpenoids are synthesized in plants by the expression of many TPS genes. Moreover, some TPSs have the ability to catalyse the production of multiple products. Thus, the  TPS gene family was classified according to phylogenetic relationships into eight subfamilies (TPS a, b, c, d, e/f, g, and h), which comprise mono-, sesqui-, di- and triterpene synthases 34. Therefore, the annotation of transcriptome data from  S.  officinalis against the Lamiaceae family and Arabidopsis revealed many terpene synthases involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, e.g., myrcene, (+)-neomenthol, 1,8-cineole, (3S)-linalool, α-humulene/β-caryophyllene, momilactone-A, gibberellin 3, gibberellin 2, ent-copalyl diphosphate, ent-kaurene, ent-kaurenoic acid, ent-isokaurene C2, gibberellin 20, beta-amyrin and squalene. From the dataset, 65 TPS unigenes were identified and determined based on sequence similarities with a TPS sequence in the canonical annotation reference database. Twenty unigenes were annotated as being involved in monoterpene biosynthesis, including myrcene/ocimene synthase, (+)-neomenthol dehydrogenase, 1,8-cineole synthase, (+)-sabinene synthase and (3S)-linalool synthase, and three other unigenes were annotated as being involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis, including α-humulene/β-caryophyllene synthase and (−)-germacrene D synthase. Additionally, 29 unigenes were annotated as being involved in diterpene biosynthesis, including momilactone-A synthase, gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin 2-oxidase, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, ent-kaurene synthase, ent-kaurenoic acid hydroxylase, ent-isokaurene C2-hydroxylase and gibberellin 20-oxidase. Finally, 12 unigenes were annotated as being involved in triterpene biosynthesis, including beta-amyrin synthase, squalene monooxygenase, and farnesyl-diphosphate, but some of these 12 genes showed high abundance in leaves and higher FPKM values (Fig.  4 and Table  3). The previous compounds have significant pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, anti-HIV, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. Sesquiterpenoids are similar to triterpenoids as both share the same origin and originate from farnesyl diphosphate (FDP). Triterpenoid compounds originate from the conversion of FDP into squalene by squalene synthase (SQS) and then to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene by squalene monooxygenase (SQE)]. Subsequently, (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene is converted to beta-amyrin and camelliol C in the presence of multifunctional (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene cyclase via beta-amyrin synthase and camelliol C synthase, respectively. Similar reports about triterpenoid biosynthesis from (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene cyclases are available for  O.  basilicum and  Catharanthus roseus35,  36.

120,"The Illumina HiSeq 2000 system offers the opportunity to analyse molecular markers such as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) that are related to terpenoid pathway genes. SSR molecular markers have proven to be a powerful method for understanding genetic variation. Moreover, polymorphic SSR markers are very important for the investigation of related comparative genomics, genetic diversity, evolution, linkage mapping, gene-based association studies, and relatedness. Even though SNP markers have become promising, especially for studying complex genetic traits and high-throughput mapping, SSRs provide many advantages compared with other marker systems. Hence, SSRs have become the preferable codominant molecular marker for the construction of linkage maps 37. Therefore, the development of novel SSR molecular markers for  S.  officinalis plants could be a valuable tool for breeding studies and genetic applications. Therefore, SSR markers were identified from transcriptome sequencing data using MISA (MIcroSAtellite) ( http://pgrc.ipkgatersle-ben.de/misa/misa.html). Of the 48,671 transcripts of  S.  officinalis, 7,439 transcripts were observed to have SSRs (Supplementary Table  S5). The total number of SSR-containing sequences in  S.  officinalis was 9,149 following stringent selection criteria used to identify these SSRs. The analysis data showed that dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant motif type in  S.  officinalis (4,295; 44.132%), followed by mononucleotide (2,348; 24.13%), trinucleotide (2,317; 23.81%), tetranucleotide (116; 1.191%), and hexanucleotide (39; 0.4%) types, while the pentanucleotide type was the least abundant motif (34; 0.35%) (Supplementary Tables  S6 and  S7 and Fig.  S3). Except for the absence of mononucleotides, these results were similar to the previous results obtained from the transcriptomes of  O.  sanctum and  O.  basilicum (members of the same family), which have dinucleotide repeats as the most abundant motif type, followed by tri-, tetra-, hexa- and penta nucleotide types as the least abundant motif  6. After analysing the data from mono- to hexanucleotide motifs to obtain the number of repeat units, we found that the highest repeat unit of potential SSRs was 6, which accounted for 1,999 SSRs (21.86%), followed by 10 SSRs (1,490; 16.30%), 5 (1,411; 15.43%), and 7 (1,301; 14.23%), and the smallest repeat unit of potential SSRs was ≥24 (7; 0.08) (Supplementary Table  S7). The AG/CT dinucleotide repeat was the most prevalent motif detected in all SSRs (2,999; 30.81%) followed by A/T as a mononucleotide repeat (2,272; 23.34%). By contrast, the least abundant motif in all SSRs (4; 0.041%) was detected in (AAAAC/GTTTT/AAAAG/CTTTT/AAAAT/ATTTT/AAACC/GGTTT) as pentanucleotide repeat and in (AAAATG/ATTTTC/AAATAG/ATTTCT/AAATTC/AATTTG/AACAAT/ATTGTT) as hexanucleotide repeat. Finally, several SSR motifs were associated with many unique sequences that encode enzymes (e.g. SoDXS4, SoDXS5, SoHDR2, SoHMGS, SoHMGR3, SoFLDH, SoPCYOX1, SoFNTA, SoDHDDS1, SoDHDDS5, momilactone-A synthase, SoGGPSΙΙ7, SoGGPSΙΙ10, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, ent-kaurenoic acid hydroxylase, beta-amyrin synthase and squalene monooxygenase) involved in terpenoid biosynthesis (Supplementary Table  S8).","['Illumina HiSeq', 'Supplementary Table', 'SSRs', 'molecular markers', 'SSR markers', 'abundant motif', 'SSR molecular', 'markers', 'pathway genes', 'SSR']","[SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, http://pgrc.ipkgatersle-ben.de/misa/misa.html, 48,671, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, ≥24 (7, SSRs, A/T, SSRs (4, SoDXS4, SoDXS5, SoHDR2, SoHMGS, SoHMGR3, SoFLDH, SoPCYOX1, SoFNTA, SoDHDDS1, SoDHDDS5, momilactone-A synthase, SoGGPSΙΙ7, SoGGPSΙΙ10, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, beta-amyrin synthase]",[],[],NaN
121,"To determinate the reliability of the Illumina HiSeq 2000 read analysis, eleven candidate genes with a higher differential expression were selected, and their expression profiles were compared within young leaf, old leaf, stem, flower and bud flower samples. Quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR was used to determine the ‘transcriptional control’, which indicates the number of mRNA copies of the enzyme that complements the end-product quantity. Therefore, the correlation between the  TPS mRNAs with their products and the end-products showed a relationship between the chosen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), monoterpene synthase ( SoGPS; comp20551_c0), sesquiterpene synthase ( SoFPS2; comp10352_c0), diterpene synthase ( SoGGPS; comp25415_c0), myrcene/ocimene synthase ( SoMYRS; comp11163_c0) 1,8-cineole synthase ( SoCINS; comp26990_c0), (3S)-linalool synthase-2 ( SoLINS; comp6814_c0), α-humulene/β-caryophyllene synthase ( SoHUMS;comp101158_c0), (−)-germacrene D synthase ( SoTPS6; comp26367_c0), squalene monooxygenase ( SoSQUS; comp26984_c0), (+)-sabinene synthase ( SoSABS; comp18462_c0) and (+)-neomenthol dehydrogenase ( SoNEOD; comp10962_c0) and the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway of  S.  officinalis.  SoACTIN was used as an internal reference gene (Supplementary Table  S9). The expression patterns of the eleven selected DEGs in the young leaf, old leaf, stem, flower, and bud flower samples were examined (Fig.  5) by qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with the results from the Illumina HiSeq 2000 read analysis. At the current stage, we may be able to answer the question which terpenoid compounds accumulate mostly in which  S.  officinalis tissue. From our results, we found that  SoGPS,  SoFPS,  SoMYRS, and  SoCINS genes showed the highest expression levels in young leaves, followed by old leaves, stems, flowers and bud flowers. Moreover, (+)-sabinene synthase ( SoSABS) genes showed the highest expression levels in young leaves, followed by bud flowers, old leaves, flowers, and stems. (3S)-linalool synthase ( SoLINS) genes showed the highest expression levels in stems, followed by bud flowers, young leaves, old leaves, and flowers. Furthermore, diterpene synthase gene  SoGGPS showed the highest expression levels in stems, followed by old leaves, young leaves, flowers and bud flowers. On the other hand,  SoTPS6 gene showed the highest expression levels in young leaves followed by bud flowers, old leaves, stems, and flowers. Squalene monooxygenase ( SoSQUS) gene showed the highest expression levels in young leaves followed by old leaves, flowers, bud flowers, and stems. Finally, a α-humulene/β-caryophyllene synthase ( SoHUMS) gene showed the highest expression levels in stems, followed by young leaves, old leaves, bud flowers and flowers. These results were compatible with our GC-MS analysis data, indicating that indicated that the main group of terpenes in young leaves, old leaves and stems consisted of mono- and sesquiterpenes. According to the findings of the GC-MS analysis, the major monoterpene compound in young and old leaves was 1,8-cineole (Table  1). Therefore, we suggest that young leaves are the primary site for monoterpene, sesquiterpene and 1,8-cineole synthase biosynthesis and accumulation, followed by old leaves, and then stems. These results are in agreement with those of previous studies 38,  39 that reported that the main monoterpenes in  S.  officinalis and other  Salvia plant species are formed and accumulate in very young leaf epidermal glands, as the formation of most epidermal glands and the accumulation of the monoterpenes take a very short time in young leaf tissues. Consequently, in our study we focused on young leaves in which these genes are expressed at higher levels; monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are also formed at their highest levels in young leaves. In addition, from our study, we found a correlation between the 1,8-cineole accumulation and 1,8-cineole synthase ( SoCINS) expression levels in different tissues. For instance, the most abundant 1,8-cineole accumulation and highest  SoCINS expression were in young leaves, followed by old leaves, stems, flowers and bud flowers (Table  1 and Fig.  1). Our results are in line with those of previous studies 40–  47 that reported that the monoterpene levels are thought to be mainly controlled transcriptionally producing different TPS enzymes. (+)-Neomenthol was not detected by GC-MS analysis as was expected from gene expression analysis, showing the expression of a putative neomenthol dehydrogynase gene that were detected in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 reads and qRT-PCR. This could be due to other unknown reasons 48. The combination of the analysed data reads from the Illumina HiSeq 2000, qRT- PCR and the GC-MS will pave the way for understanding the complex mechanisms for controlling and regulating the diverse production of terpene compounds.

Samples of infected were collected 45 days after transgenic tobacco acclimatization (Fig.  6A). We then used semiquantitative RT-PCR to analyse the positive transgenic tobacco and assessed the expression levels of terpene genes from the different samples (Fig.  6B and Supplementary Fig.  S4). The terpenes were extracted with hexane and analysed by GC-MS. The mono-, sesqui-, di- and triterpene peaks were clearly detected, and the type and amount of compounds represented by the percentage of peak area (% peak area). Compounds were identified by comparing the mass spectra of the compounds with mass spectra libraries.

124,"Croteau and coworkers had revealed the carbocationic reaction mechanism for all monoterpene synthases by reporting that the reaction was initiated by the divalent metal ion-dependent ionization of the substrate. The resulting cationic intermediate undergoes a series of hydride shifts or other rearrangements and cyclizations until the reaction was terminated by the addition of a nucleophile or proton loss. They also illustrated this reaction mechanism by studying the native enzymes with substrate inhibitors, analogues and intermediates 51,  52. Moreover, Croteau  et al. 1987 53 elucidated the preliminary conversion of the geranyl cation to the tertiary linalyl cation to facilitate cyclization to a six-membered ring. Afterwards, the linalyl cation provides the cyclic α-terpinyl cation; this is an important branching point intermediate in the formation of all cyclic monoterpenes because multiple terpene products can be obtained through electrophilic attack of C1 on the C6–C7 linalyl cation double bond and from the α-terpinyl cation 53. From the previous discussion, the reaction mechanisms of monoterpene synthases are highly reticulate. The individual intermediate may have multiple fates, which suggests the explanation for the ability of terpene enzymes to make various terpene products 54–  57. On the other hand, the carbocationic reaction mechanism that uses sesquiterpene synthase to form sesquiterpenes by catalysing farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) recycling is similar to the reaction mechanism by those monoterpene synthases. Moreover, the larger carbon skeleton of FPP and the presence of three double bonds instead of two suggest a rationale for increases of the structural diversity of the sesquiterpene products. Furthermore, the initial cyclization reactions for sesquiterpene synthases can be divided into two types. Type one involves cyclization of the initially formed farnesyl cation to yield 11-membered (E)-humulyl cation) rings of large size and a C2–C3 double bond (this type has no barrier to cyclization). The second type involves cyclization that proceeds after the tertiary nerolidyl cation produced from preliminary isomerization of the C2–C3 double bond. This isomerization mechanism is directly analogous to the isomerization of GPP to yield a linalyl cation in monoterpene synthesis. The nerolidyl cation is considered an intermediate in the sesquiterpene synthase mechanism 58–  62.","['reaction mechanism', 'cation', 'reaction', 'linalyl cation', 'divalent metal', 'metal ion-dependent', 'ion-dependent ionization', 'mechanism', 'monoterpene synthases', 'carbocationic reaction']","[metal ion-dependent, α-terpinyl, C1, C6–C7 linalyl, α-terpinyl cation, 54–  , C2–C3, C2–C3, 58–  ]",[],[],terpene synthase
125,"Collectively, we can state that the ability of  TPS genes to convert a prenyl diphosphate substrate into diverse products during different reaction cycles is one of the unique traits of this type of enzyme. As described above, this property is found in the majority of all characterized monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases. However, some monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases can catalyse substrates into a single product, and the proteins may have specific methods for multiple product formations. For example, γ-humulene synthase from  A.  grandis has two DDxxD motifs located on opposite sides and can generate 52 different sesquiterpenes. This protein is able to bind substrates with two different conformations, resulting in different sets of products 63. In another example regarding the first monoterpene synthase cloned from  Salvia officinalis, (+)-sabinene synthase produces 63% (+)-sabinene but also 21% γ-terpinene, 7.0% terpinolene, 6.5% limonene and 2.5% myrcene in  in vitro assays 64. These additional monoterpene products or their immediate metabolites are also found in the monoterpene-rich essential oil of the  S.  officinalis plant.","['TPS genes', 'prenyl diphosphate', 'reaction cycles', 'unique traits', 'TPS', 'diphosphate substrate', 'sesquiterpene synthases', 'diverse products', 'monoterpene', 'Collectively']",[],['TPS'],[],terpene synthase
126,"We evaluated the physiological response of plants that were grown under changing watering regimes. Initially the plants were well-irrigated for 7 days, followed by suspended irrigation for 46 days to impose increasing drought stress after which irrigation was resumed. Two main parameters were monitored to determine drought severity:  E at midday and  gsc at midday. The drought treatment induced an intense reduction in midday  E and  gsc at Day 26 in comparison with control plants, 19 days after irrigation was stopped (Figure  1). Although the  E in Figure  1B is the average of five replicates, and the  gsc in Figure  1C is of individual plants, the pattern of  E matched the pattern of  gsc throughout the experiment and both of these parameters were correlated with daily changes in VPD (Figure  1). As the drought persisted, the  gsc of the drought-treated trees gradually decreased from 319 at Day 21 to 171 at Day 26, and dropped to 94 mmol s −1 g −1 toward the end of the drought period (Figure  1C). After irrigation was resumed, the  E and  gsc of the drought-treated trees were restored back to the levels recorded prior to the drought treatment, indicating that the drought treatment was not terminal ( Negin and Moshelion 2016). Two drought-treated and two irrigated (control) trees were selected for molecular study at six different physiological stages based on the  gsc. The stages selected for transcriptome profiling (Figure  1C) were as follows: (D1) pre-stomatal response at Day 21 with 319  gsc; (D2) partial stomatal closure at Day 27 with 171  gsc; (D3) minimum transpiration at Day 53 with 94  gsc; (D4) post-irrigation at Day 54 with 116  gsc; (D5) partial recovery at Day 56 with 271  gsc; and (D6) full recovery at Day 69 with  gsc of 523 mmol s −1 g −1.","['Day', 'gsc', 'Figure', 'drought', 'watering regimes', 'changing watering', 'drought treatment', 'days', 'plants', 'irrigation']","[−1 g, −1, −1 g, −1]",[],[],NaN

129,"Gene-expression profiling of drought-treated and control trees at the six above-mentioned physiological stages allowed us to analyze transcripts that are differentially expressed between drought-treated and control plants (Figure  3). In general, the number of DE transcripts increased gradually as the drought progressed and decreased gradually during recovery. Transcript down-regulation was dominant in response to drought, while transcript up-regulation was dominant following re-watering and throughout the recovery period (Figure  3). Only 27 up-regulated and 27 down-regulated transcripts were identified among the drought-treated and control clones at Stage D1 (pre-stomatal response, Figure  1C). In agreement with the physiological data collected at Stage D2, at which point a reduction in  gsc was noted (Figure  3B), 223 transcripts were up-regulated while 370 transcripts were down-regulated. At Stage D3, at the time of the lowest observed transpiration rate and  gsc (Figures  1B and  3B), the up-regulation of 878 transcripts and down-regulation of 1490 transcripts was noted. Several hours after re-watering, at Stage D4, 2071 transcripts were up-regulated while 1505 transcripts were down-regulated. These numbers were reduced to 537 up-regulated transcripts and 510 down-regulated transcripts at Stage D5 (partial recovery). The number of up-regulated transcripts increased dramatically to 1275 at Stage D6 (full recovery), while the number of down-regulated transcripts had declined to 336 by that point (Figure  3A).

Based on the GO enrichment results, we have generated a Heatmap that reflects the dynamic response of different biological processes at 10 drought-related physiological categories. These categories included growth, membrane integrity, sugar metabolism, stomatal function, photosynthesis, ion transport, terpene biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, protein metabolism, DNA metabolism and hormones (Figure  4). Processes that promote growth were mainly enriched in the down-regulated transcripts at D3, while the cell wall organization process was enriched at D4 after re-watering. Lipid biosynthetic process was enriched at D2 down-regulated transcripts, and was further enriched at D3 and D4 suggesting reduced membrane formation in response to drought. Disaccharide and oligosaccharide metabolic processes were enriched in the up-regulated transcripts at D3–D5, while carbohydrate metabolic processes were enriched in the up-regulated as well as in the down-regulated transcripts at D3 and D4. Catabolic processes of starch, polysaccharide and mannan were enriched in the down-regulated transcripts at D4, suggesting decline in degradation processes. Transcripts related to stomatal opening were enriched in the up-regulated transcripts at D3 and D4. Photosynthesis related processes were enriched in the up-regulated transcripts only, at D4 after re-watering and at D6 at full recovery. Processes related to anion transport were enriched in the down-regulated transcripts at D3, while processes related to cation transport were enriched in the up-regulated transcripts at D4. The majority of processes related to terpene and flavonoid biosynthesis were commonly enriched in the down-regulated transcripts at D2–D5. Protein metabolism-related processes including regulation of phosphatase activity and aromatic amino acid biosynthetic process were enriched in the down-regulated transcripts at D3, while processes related to negative regulation of protein degradation were enriched at D4, suggesting decline in protein degradation after re-watering.

Among the metal ions tested, Mn  2+ was the most effective for MpIspS activity, with an optimal concentration of 5 mM (Fig.  3a and  b). By considering the highest activity with Mn 2+ to be 100%, activities of 91, 86, 79, 74, 53, 48, and 2% were detected in the presence of Zn 2+, Cu 2+, Ni 2+, Co 2+, Mg 2+, Ca 2+, and Fe 2+, respectively. The observation of maximal activity of MpIspS in the presence of Mn 2+ was interesting, given that all IspSs that have been characterized prefer Mg 2+ as a cofactor [ 10,  12,  13,  28]. In some cases, Mn 2+ can partially substitute for Mg 2+ [ 5,  12,  13]. The IspS from  Casuarina equisetifolia [ 29] , Campylopus introflexus [ 30], and MpIspS (this study) displayed the highest activities in the presence of Mn 2+, with the activities being less in the presence of Mg 2+.","['terpenoid synthases', 'activity', 'MpIspS activity', 'metal ions', 'divalent metal', 'MpIspS', 'presence', 'metal', 'divalent', 'metal cofactor']","[Mg 2, MpIspS, MpIspS, Mn  2, MpIspS, Cu 2, Mg 2, Fe 2, MpIspS, Mn 2, Mg 2, Mn 2, Mg 2+, IspS, equisetifolia [ 29], MpIspS, Mn 2, Mg 2]",[],[],NaN
147,"The MpIspS activity was examined over a pH range of 4.5–7.5 containing 5 mM Mn 2+ or 1 mM Mg 2+. The maximal enzyme activity was observed at pH 6.0 and 5 mM Mn 2+ (Fig.  4a). At pH 5.5 and 7.0, the activity was approximately 40% of the maximum. Additionally, we tested the pH dependency in the presence of Mg 2+ favorable for IspS activity. Maximal enzyme activity was observed at pH 6.0–6.5 and 1 mM Mg 2+ (Additional file  2: Figure S2). The effect of temperature on enzyme activity was investigated. Maximum activity was recorded at 50 °C (Fig.  4b). At temperatures of 30 and 45 °C, the activity was approximately 80% of the maximum. The maximum activity of various IspSs from  Populus alba at pH 8 and 40 °C [ 10],  P. tremuloides at pH 8 and 32 °C [ 11,  12],  Salix discolor at pH 8 and 35 °C [ 31],  Campylopus introflexus at pH 8.6 and 40 °C [ 30],  Casuarina equisetifolia at pH 8 and 40 °C [ 29],  Ficus septica at pH 9.5 and 40 °C [ 29], and  F. virgate at pH 10 and 40 °C [ 29] have been reported. Interestingly, previously characterized IspSs have been demonstrated to be active at a broad range of pH values with pH optima between 7 and 10. In addition, IspSs appear to have temperature optimum in the 35–40 °C range. Monoterpene synthases display pH optima ranging from 6 to 7 [ 32– 34], because monoterpene synthases activity was related to chloroplast pH in plants. An acidic chloroplast pH and temperature above 40 °C favors the emission of monoterpenes [ 35].  M. polymorpha generally grows in acidic, weathered soils where the pH may be as low as 3.6 [ 36] and in the presence of terpene emission [ 23]. These ecological may be related with the pH optimum of MpIspS for isoprene conversion.","['activity', 'enzyme activity', 'Maximum activity', 'maximum', 'maximal enzyme', 'Fig.', 'enzyme', 'temperature', 'range', 'MpIspS activity']","[MpIspS, Mn 2, Mn 2+, Mg 2, IspS, introflexus, 35–40 °C, 32–, MpIspS]",[],[],terpene synthase
148,"The kinetic parameters of purified recombinant MpIspS protein for DMAPP were determined. The curves of the Michaelis-Menten equation with the experimental data for DMAPP are shown in Fig.  5. MpIspS activity increased with increasing DMAPP concentration up to 15 mM, and higher concentrations inhibited the activity under our assay conditions. Therefore, the  Km value was estimated by non-linear curve fitting of Michaelis–Menten formula at concentrations below 15 mM. Consequently, the  Km,  kcat, and  kcat/ Km of MpIspS for DMAPP as substrate were 8.11 mM, 21 min − 1, and 2.59 mM − 1 min − 1, respectively. Turnover rates ( kcat) for other IspSs are 1.7 s − 1 for  P. tremuloides [ 12], 1.8 min − 1 for  P. alba [ 10], 5.28 min − 1 for  P. montana [ 24], 0.66 min − 1 for  F. septica [ 29], and 0.9 min − 1 for  C. equisetifolia [ 29]. The  Km values of IspSs from  P. alba [ 29],  F. septica [ 29],  P. tremuloides [ 12],  Salix discolor [ 5], and  Quercus robur [ 14] are 15.9, 3.4, 8, 8, and 0.53 mM respectively. Michaelis constants ( Km) for IspS are usually very large compared to monoterpene or sesquiterpene synthases, which have apparent  Km values in the μM range [ 7]. The large  Km of isoprene synthases is evolutionarily advantageous by ensuring that carbon is first directed to essential physiological functions of the plant and only secondarily to isoprene production, because the main role of isoprene could be to alleviate abiotic stresses [ 7,  24]. Additionally, Sharkey proposed that isoprene serves to protect plant membranes against heat stress [ 37]. Eventually, for the biotechnological production of isoprene, the high  Km and low activity of IspSs should be engineered because the requirement of high substrate (DMAPP) concentrations could become an obstacle to achieving high rates of isoprene synthesis.","['min', 'DMAPP', 'kinetic parameters', 'purified recombinant', 'recombinant MpIspS', 'MpIspS protein', 'DMAPP concentration', 'isoprene', 'increasing DMAPP', 'MpIspS']","[MpIspS, DMAPP, MpIspS, DMAPP, Michaelis–, MpIspS, DMAPP, − 1, − 1 , − 1, − 1, tremuloides [ 12], − 1, − 1, − 1, − 1, alba [ 29], tremuloides [ 12], IspS]",[],[],terpene synthase
149,"Wild-type  E. coli can produce isoprene by the introduction of plant-derived IspS because it possesses an endogenous methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway that is capable of which producing DMAPP. However, the amount of isoprene that is produced is very low because of the limited availability of DMAPP. In other studies, the MVA pathway has been reconstructed with multiple genes derived from various bacteria and yeast, and co-expressed along with IspS to enhance isoprene production by supplying enough amount of DMAPP [ 15,  17,  19] (Fig.  6a). To determine the in vivo isoprene production by MpIspS from glycerol, an MpIspS expressing plasmid, pTSN-MpIspS was introduced into  E. coli DH5α with the exogenous MVA pathway encoded by pSEVA231-MVA plasmid (Fig.  6a).

As expected, isoprene was not produced in cells harboring the pTSN plasmid (no IspS) and the pSEVA231-MVA plasmid (MVA pathway) (Additional file  2: Figure S2). The optimal culture conditions for maximal isoprene production by MpIspS along with the MVA pathway should be further studied.

The amino acid sequence of  Camellia sinensis TPS8 (CsiTPS8) was quite similar to that of ChTPS1 and had only one amino acid substitution (R477H) except for the N-terminal extension.

167,"As mentioned above, seven  ChTps1a-g clones were individually expressed in the MVA-pathway-engineered  E.  coli that can utilize acetoacetate as a substrate 35, and sesquiterpenes synthesized by each clone were analyzed by GC-MS. An empty vector clone showed two peaks (Fig.  2b). The predicted compounds of Peaks 4 and 5 were farnesol and farnesyl acetate, respectively, which are likely to be derived from FPP, and were found to disappear in the ChTps1 products, generating several new peaks, instead (Fig.  2a). Thus, we focused on three new distinct peaks (Peaks 1, 2, and 3) that were considered to be the ChTPS1 (ChTPS1a) products. The MS of the predominant product (Peak 2) had the highest similarity to that of guaiol in the MS database (Fig.  2e,f). We then mixed authentic guaiol with the ChTPS1 products, and carried out GC-MS analysis. As a result, the peaks of Peak 2 and guaiol were not overlapped, indicating that Peak 2 was not guaiol (Fig.  2h–j). Thus, the Peak 2 compound was purified, and subjected to 1D ( 1H and  13C) and 2D ( 1H- 1H COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY) NMR spectroscopic analyses (in CDCl 3).  1H and  13C NMR and HSQC spectral analysis of the Peak 2 compound confirmed that it possessed 4 methyls, 5 sp 3 methylenes, 2 sp 3 methines, 2 sp 3 quarternary carbons, 1 sp 2 methine, and 1 sp 2 quarternary carbon. Further, two vicinal  1H spin networks of H-1-H-11 and H-6 to H-9 (bold line in Fig.  3a) observed in the  1H- 1H COSY spectrum and the key  1H- 13C long range couplings observed in the HMBC spectrum (arrows in Fig.  3a) proved the planar structure of the Peak 2 compound as shown in Fig.  3a. The relative configuration of the Peak 2 compound was analyzed by NOESY spectrum, and the observed key NOEs (arrows in Fig.  3b) proved the relative configuration of the Peak 2 compound as shown in Fig.  3b. From these observations, the Peak 2 compound was identified to be valerianol. These results indicated that ChTPS1 synthesizes valerianol as the predominant product. The MS of Peak 1 (minor) coincided to that of elemol, while the MS of Peak 3 (minor) was an unknown sesquiterpene, (Fig.  2c,d,g). In order to check whether Peak 1 was elemol or not, we mixed authentic elemol with the ChTPS1 products, and carried out GC-MS analysis. Consequently, the peaks of Peak 1 and elemol were overlapped, indicating that the Peak 1 GC product was elemol (data not shown). Elemol was reported to be a thermal rearrangement product from hedycaryol 30,  38. It is therefore likely that elemol originated from hedycaryol during the heating-up process of GC-MS. The Peak 1 compound was confirmed to be hedycaryol by HPLC analysis, the same as described previously (data not shown) 30. The plausible conformations of hedycaryol were reported by Faraldos  et al. 39 Based on these results,  ChTps1 ( ChTps1a) was identified as a novel gene encoding valerianol [valerianol/hedycaryol (minor)] synthase (Fig.  3c).

168,"The product amounts of all ChTPS1 substitution clones were less than ChTPS1 (ChTPS1a) (Fig.  4).

As for the ChTPS1f product, the second and third most abundant products were in reverse order. These two sesquiterpenes were contained equally in the product of ChTPS1g. As for ChTPS1d, no TPS product was observed. These differences in each ChTPS1 product amount were attributed to the differences in amino acid sequences (Table  1). For example, Peak 2 valerianol amounts of ChTPS1c and f were almost the same, but the Peak1 hedycaryol amount of ChTPS1f was about 4 times higher than that of ChTPS1c (Fig.  4). This difference in the ChTPS1f enzyme activity was induced by the single amino acid substitution K541N (Table  1).

169,"The plausible 3D structural model of ChTPS1 was built by SWISS-MODEL 40 using the pdb of Tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase 16 as the template. Then the ChTPS1 3D model was applied to predict the effect of amino acid substitutions (Supplementary Table  S2). The substitution sites were roughly divided into 3 parts: surface, internal and loop. Substitutions on the molecular surface would have a little effect on the enzyme activity, whereas those exist in the internal part might have some effect interacting with neighboring residues. The loop, which means β-turn between α-helices, sometimes locates at the surface of the molecule and contributes to determine the molecular structure. Hence, substitutions in the loop would change the structure and have severe effects in some cases. Supplementary Table  S2 summarized these effects of substitutions in the ChTPS1 clones. Intriguingly, ChTPS1 clones contained 4 substitutions in the loops and 2 of them showed characteristic changes of the enzyme activity. One was K541N, which increased the Peak 1 ratio, mentioned above, and the other was R477H (see below). R477 is located at the loop and forms an ionic bond with E487 located at the α-helices based on the model structure.

They were formed from linalool within the hive conditions. Hotrienol derive either from dehydration of 2,6-dimethylocta-3,7-diene-2,6-diol or from allylic rearrangement and dehydration of 3,7-dimethylocta-1,7-diene-3,6-diol, which can be liberated from the corresponding glucoside or from dehydration of 8-hydroxylinalool [ 7]. Lilac aldehydes are formed by oxidation of lilac alcohols generated by hydroxylation of linalool to ( E)-8-hydroxylinalool, and further to ( E)-8-oxolinalool. Dill ether and  p-menth-1-ene-9-al isomers and  p-menth-1-ene-8-ol (α-terpineol) are also derived from ( E)-8-hydroxylinalool via allylic rearrangement and cyclisation of 8-hydroxygeraniol. Epoxidation of linalool gives 6,7-epoxylinalool, which undergoes further reactions to form linalool oxides and anhydrolinalool oxides, which can further yield lilac alcohols. The formation of linalool oxides and 2,6-dimethylocta-3,7-diene-2,6-diol was probably catalysed by the enzymes secreted by the bees [ 7].","['minor constituent', 'Linalool', 'HS-HoS', 'lilac', 'linalool oxides', 'dill ether', 'HS-NE', 'dehydration', 'lilac aldehydes', 'present']","[HS-NE, HS-HoS., 1.2%–2.3, HS-HoS., 2,6-dimethylocta-3,7-diene-2,6-diol, 3,7-dimethylocta-1,7-diene-3,6-diol, E)-8-hydroxylinalool, E)-8-oxolinalool, α-terpineol, E)-8-hydroxylinalool, 6,7-epoxylinalool, 2,6-dimethylocta-3,7-diene-2,6-diol]",[],[],NaN

These compounds (except hexadecanoic acid) were found also in the nectar extracts (E-NE) and the honey-sac extract (E-HoS), but cannot be connected with specific botanical origin since they can be transferred from the comb environment [ 33]. Similar applies for higher alkanes found only in the honey extracts: tetracosane (1.1%–20.8%; 0.1%–29.7%), tricosane (0.3%–26.4%), docosane (0.2%–15.7%; 0.0%–8.5%) or heneicosane (0.0%–3.7%; 0.0%–3.0%).

Moreover, the six hexane extracts from the different tissue essential oils have unique, common and major compounds. For example, the extracts of old leaf essential oils (A) had 57 unique compounds, three common compounds shared with extracts from young leaf essential oils, one common compound shared with extracts from stem essential oils, three common compounds shared with extracts from flower essential oils and two common compounds shared with extracts from bud flower essential oils. Furthermore, the young leaf essential oils (B) contained 19 unique compounds.

Also, the extracts from flower essential oils (D) had 30 unique compounds, four common compounds shared with extracts from bud flower essential oils. Moreover, the extracts from bud flower essential oils (E) and the root essential oils (F) had 24 and 37 unique compounds, respectively ( Fig. 1C).

N-octadecanal was characterized as the major compound in stem extracts (38.78%), followed by undecane, 2-methyl (1.27%), and then squalene (0.15%). Furthermore, the essential oils of flowers was also characterized by 2-methyloctacosane (5.34%), followed by 10-methyleicosane (1.9%), and tetracosane, 2-methyl (1.7%).

198,"Plants produce various terpenoid compounds with highly diverse structures. These compounds play an important role and functions in the interactions with environmental factors and in fundamental BPs. 37,38 Multiple terpenoids are synthesized in plants by the expression of many terpene syntheses (TPSs) genes. Moreover, some TPS genes have the ability to catalyse the production of multiple products. Thus, the TPS genes family was classified according to phylogenetic relationships into eight subfamilies (TPS a, b, c, d, e/f, g and h), which comprises mono-, sesqui-, di- and triterpene synthases. 39 Therefore, the annotation of transcriptome data from  S. guaranitica against the Lamiaceae family and Arabidopsis revealed many terpene synthases involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, e.g. myrcene, (+)-neomenthol, 1, 8-cineole, (3S)-linalool, (E, E)-geranyl linalool, geraniol isomerase, farnesol, α-humulene, valencene, germacrene-A,  cis-muuroladiene, selinene, gamma-cadinene, bicyclogermacrene, momilactone-A, gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin 2-oxidase, ent-copalyl diphosphate, ent-kaurene, ent-kaurenoic acid, 9 beta-pimara-7, 15-diene, ent-isokaurene C2-, gibberellin 20-, beta-amyrin, squalene, farnesyl- pyrophosphate and camelliol C. From the dataset, 69 TPS unigenes were identified and determined based on sequence similarities with a TPS sequence in the canonical annotation reference database. Twenty unigenes were annotated as being involved in monoterpene biosynthesis, including myrcene/ocimene synthase, (+)-neomenthol dehydrogenase, 1,8-cineole synthase, (3S)-linalool synthase, (E, E)-geranyl linalool synthase and geraniol isomerase synthase, and 12 other unigenes were annotated as being involved in sesquiterpene biosyntheses, including farnesol dehydrogenase, α-humulene/β-caryophyllene synthase, valencene synthase, germacrene-A synthase,  cis-muuroladiene synthase, germacrene-D synthase, selinene synthase, gamma-cadinene synthase and bicyclo-germacrene synthase. Additionally, 30 unigenes were annotated as being involved in diterpene biosynthesis, including momilactone-A synthase, gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin 2-oxidase, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, ent-kaurene synthase, ent-kaurenoic acid hydroxylase, 9beta-pimara-7, 15-diene oxidase, ent-iso kaurene C2-hydroxylase and gibberellin 20-oxidase. Finally, seven unigenes were annotated as being involved in triterpene biosyntheses, including beta-amyrin synthase, camelliol C synthase, squalene monooxygenase and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyl transferase, but some of these previous genes showed high abundance in leaves and higher FPKM values ( Fig. 4 and  Table 2). The previous compounds have significant pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, anti-HIV, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. 40 Sesquiterpenoids are similar to triterpenoids as both share the same origin and originate from FPP. Triterpenoid compounds originate from the conversion of FDP into squalene by squalene synthase (SQS) and then to (S)-2, 3-epoxysqualene by squalene monooxygenase (SQE). Subsequently, (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene is converted to beta-amyrin and camelliol C in the presence of multifunctional (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene cyclase via beta-amyrin synthase and camelliol C synthase, respectively. Similar reports about triterpenoid biosynthesis from (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene cyclases are available for  O. basilicum and  Catharanthus roseus.41,42","['synthase', 'TPS', 'TPS genes', 'diverse structures', 'highly diverse', 'gibberellin', 'involved', 'unigenes', 'squalene', 'genes']","[BPs, b,, c, d,, (3S)-linalool, E, E)-geranyl linalool, germacrene-A, momilactone-A, gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin 2-oxidase, ent-copalyl diphosphate, gibberellin 20-, (+)-neomenthol dehydrogenase, (3S)-linalool synthase, E, E)-geranyl linalool synthase, geraniol isomerase, farnesol dehydrogenase, α-humulene/β-caryophyllene synthase, germacrene-A, germacrene-D synthase, bicyclo-germacrene synthase, momilactone-A synthase, gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin 2-oxidase, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, ent-kaurene synthase, 9beta-pimara-7, 15-diene oxidase, ent-iso kaurene, C2-hydroxylase, gibberellin 20-oxidase, camelliol C synthase, farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyl transferase, anti-HIV, FDP, SQS, (S)-2, 3-epoxysqualene, squalene monooxygenase, camelliol C, camelliol C synthase]","['(TPSs)', 'TPS', 'TPS', '(TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS']",[],terpene synthase
199,"The Illumina HiSeq 2000 system offers the opportunity to analyse molecular markers such as SSRs that are related to terpenoid pathway genes. SSR molecular markers have proven to be a powerful method for understanding genetic variation. Moreover, polymorphic SSR markers are very important for the investigation of related comparative genomics, genetic diversity, evolution, linkage mapping, gene-based association studies and relatedness. Even though SNP markers have become promising, especially for studying complex genetic traits and high-throughput mapping, SSRs provide many advantages compared with other marker systems. Hence, SSRs have become the preferable codominant molecular marker for a construction of linkage maps. 43 Therefore, the development of novel SSR molecular markers for  S. guaranitica plants could be a valuable tool for breeding studies and genetic applications. Therefore, SSR markers were identified from transcriptome sequencing data using MISA (MIcroSAtellite) ( http://pgrc.ipkgatersle-ben.de/misa/misa.html). Of the 61,400 transcripts of  S. guaranitica, 5,262 transcripts were observed to have SSRs ( Supplementary Table S7). The total number of SSR-containing sequences in  S. guaranitica was 5,931, following stringent selection criteria used to identify these SSRs. The analysis data showed that dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant motif type in  S. guaranitica (2,787; 45.25%), followed by trinucleotide (1,555; 23.58%), mononucleotide (1,452; 23.58%), tetranucleotide (92; 1.493%), and hexanucleotide (28; 0.454%) types, while the pentanucleotide type was the least abundant motif (17; 0.276%) ( Supplementary Table S8 and  Fig. S4). Except for the absence of mononucleotide, these results were similar to the previous results obtained from the transcriptome of  O. sanctum and  O. basilicum (members of the same family), which have dinucleotide repeats as the most abundant motif type, followed by tri-, tetra-, hexa- and pentanucleotide types as the least abundant motif. 7 After analysing the data from mono- to hexanucleotide motifs to obtain the number of repeat units, we found that the highest repeat unit of potential SSRs was 10, which accounted for 1,376 SSRs (27.08%), followed by 5 SSRs (1,049; 20.65%), 7 (728; 14.33%), and 6 (573; 11.28%), and the smallest repeat unit of potential SSRs was ≥24 (3; 0.0 5%) ( Supplementary Table S9). The AG/CT dinucleotide repeat was the most prevalent motif detected in all SSRs (1,893; 30.73%), followed by A/T as a mononucleotide repeat (1,408; 22.86%). In contrast, the least abundant motif in all SSRs (3; 0.048%) was detected in (AAAAC/GTTTT/AAAAG/CTTTT/AAACC/GGTTT) as pentanucleotide repeat and in (AAACAC/GTGTTT/AAACGG/CCGTTT/AAAGAC/CTTTGT) as hexanucleotide repeat. Finally, several SSR motifs were associated with many unique sequences that encode enzymes (e.g.  SgDXS1,  SgDXR1,  SgMCT,  SgHDR9,  SgIDI3,  SgAACT1,  SgHMGS,  SgHMGR2,  SgHMGR6,  SgMVK2,  SgGGPSΙΙ2,  SgGibberellin 20-oxidase,  SgBeta-amyrin synthase,  SgSqualene monooxygenase and  Sgfarnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase) involved in terpenoid biosynthesis ( Supplementary Table S10).","['Illumina HiSeq', 'Supplementary Table', 'SSRs', 'molecular markers', 'abundant motif', 'SSR markers', 'markers', 'SSR molecular', 'pathway genes', 'SSR']","[SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, http://pgrc.ipkgatersle-ben.de/misa/misa.html, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, SSRs, ≥24 (3, SSRs, A/T, SSRs (3, AAAAC/GTTTT/AAAAG/CTTTT/AAACC/GGTTT, AAACAC/GTGTTT/AAACGG/CCGTTT/AAAGAC/CTTTGT]",[],[],NaN
200,"To determinate the reliability of the Illumina HiSeq 2000 read analysis, 15 candidate genes with a higher differential expression were selected, and their expression profiles were compared within young leaf, old leaf, stem, flower, bud flower and root samples. Quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR was used to determine the ‘transcriptional control’ which indicates the number of mRNA copies of the enzyme that complements the end-product quantity. Therefore, the correlation between the TPS mRNAs with their products and the end-products showed a relationship between the chosen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), monoterpene synthase ( SgGPPS; KX893917), sesquiterpene synthase ( SgFPPS; KX893918), β-caryophyllene ( SgHUMS; KX893973), neomenthol synthase-1 ( SgNEOD-1; KX893955), neomenthol synthase-2 ( SgNEOD-2; KX893956), neomenthol synthase-3 ( SgNEOD-3; KX893957), germacrene-A synthase ( SgTPS-1; KX893975), selinene synthase ( SgTPS-3; KX893978), germacrene- d synthase ( SgTPS-6; KX893977), linalool synthase-1 ( SgLINS-1; KX893965), linalool synthase -2 ( SgLINS-2; KX893966), (E, E)-geranyl linalool synthase ( SgGLNS; KX893967), geraniol isomerase synthase ( SgGERIS; KX893968), valencene synthase ( SgTPS-V; KX893974), farnesol dehydrogenase ( SgFARD; KX893969) and the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway of  S. guaranitica.  SgACTIN was used as an internal reference gene ( Supplementary Table S1). The expression patterns of the 15 selected DEGs in the young leaf, old leaf, stem, flower, bud flower and root samples were examined ( Fig. 5) by qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with the results from the Illumina HiSeq 2000 read analysis. At the current stage, we may be able to answer the question which terpenoid compounds of  S. guaranitica accumulated mostly in which tissue. From our results, we found that the next gene, geranyl diphosphate synthase ( SgGPPS) gene showed the highest expression levels in the young leaves, followed by roots, stems, old leaves, bud flowers and flowers. These results were nearly compatible with our GC-MS analysis data indicating that the main group of terpenes in roots, bud flowers and young leaves consisted of monoterpene. According to the findings of the GC-MS analysis, we found eight monoterpene compound are accumulated in the root, two monoterpene compounds in bud flowers and one monoterpene compound are accumulated in young leaves ( Table 3).Therefore, we suggest that the roots are the primer site for monoterpene biosynthesis and accumulation, followed by, bud flower, and young leave. These results are not in agreement with 6,44,45 that found that the main monoterpenes in some salvia plant species are formed and accumulated in very young leaves epidermal glands. Because, the formation of most epidermal glands and the accumulation of the monoterpenes, take very short time in young leave tissues. And our  S. guaranitica plant has limited number from epidermal gland trichomes on old leave, young leaves and stem. Moreover, Sesquiterpene synthase (FPPS) gene recorded the highest expression levels in the root followed by flower, bud flower, young leave, old leave and stem. On the other hand, these results were not similar with GC-MS analysis data that showed that the main group of sesquiterpenes was mostly accumulated in young leaves. Which have five compounds followed by old leaves have 12 compounds, roots have four compounds, flowers have two and bud flower has one compound ( Table 3). Besides, from our study, we found a correlation and linkage between the β-Caryophyllene product and β-Caryophyllene synthase genes expression level in different tissues. For instance, the highest of the β-Caryophyllene synthase gene product and expression level presented in the young leaves followed by old leaves, roots then flowers ( Table 3 and  Fig. 1). Also, we found a correlation and linkage between the (-)-Germacrene D, Germacrene-A product and Germacrene-D synthase (TPS-6), Germacrene-A synthase (TPS-1) genes expression level in different tissues. Such as the highest of (-)-Germacrene-D, Germacrene-A gene product and expression level present in the young leave followed by old leave. Some of our results are in agreement with those of the previous studies 6,44–53 that reported that the terpene quantity levels are thought to be mainly controlled transcriptionally thought producing the different TPS enzymes. (+)-Neomenthol dehydrogenase-1,-2,-3, TPS-3-Selinene synthase, Linalool synthase-1,-2, (E, E)-geranyl linalool synthase, Geraniol isomerase synthase, TPS-Valencene synthase and Farnesol dehydrogenase genes that were detected in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 reads and QRT-PCR but was not detected in the GC-MS analysis data. We suggest that this could be due to the cyclic expression of terpene synthases is under circadian control. Although, changes in transcript levels may not directly determine protein levels or enzyme activities due to possible posttranscriptional, post-translational or enzyme-regulatory mechanisms, the positive correlation between transcript levels and volatile emission suggests that changes in transcript level are an important determinant of scent production. Furthermore, the different rates of protein synthesis and proteolytic turnover and/or differences in protein modifications. And the secondary modification of monoterpene olefins (e.g. oxidation/glycosylation) or sequestration also could contribute to the monoterpene emission profile. 54 The combination of the analysed data reads from Illumina HiSeq 2000, qRT-PCR and the GC-MS will pave the way to understand the complex mechanisms of controlling and regulating the diversity of terpene compound production.

Transgenic  A. thaliana was carried out by using the Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip method of  A. thaliana flowers using  A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 carrying pB2GW7-FPPS, pB2GW7-GPPS and pB2GW7-LINS under the control of 35S promoter vector. Fully mature leaves from fifteen 35-day-old putative transgenic plants and wild type plant ( Fig. 6A), were collected for semiquantitative RT-PCR to analyse the positive transgenic  A. thaliana and assessed the expression levels of terpene genes from the different samples ( Fig. 6B).

Compounds were identified by comparing their mass spectra the compounds with mass spectra libraries. The detected components were also confirmed by comparing them with the published references and extracts of wild-type Arabidopsis which produce different types and amounts of terpenes. Overexpression of the  SgFPPS,  SgGPPS, and  SoLINS genes produced different amounts from mono-, sesqui- and di-terpenes and other terpenoids.

203,"Furthermore, Croteau and coworkers shed light on the carbocationic reaction mechanism for all monoterpene synthases by reporting that the reaction was initiated by the divalent metal ion-dependent ionization of the substrate. The resulting cationic intermediate undergoes a series of hydride shifts or other rearrangements and cyclizations until the reaction was terminated by the addition of a nucleophile or proton loss. Croteau and coworkers illustrated this reaction mechanism by studying the native enzymes with substrate inhibitors, analogues and intermediates. 55,56 Moreover, Rodney Croteau et al. 56 elucidated the preliminary conversion of the geranyl cation to the tertiary linalyl cation to facilitate cyclization to a six-membered ring. Afterward, the linalyl cation provides the cyclic α-terpinyl cation; this is an important branching point intermediate in the formation of all cyclic monoterpenes because multiple terpene products can be obtained through electrophilic attack of C1 on the C6–C7 linalyl cation double bond and from the α-terpinyl cation. From the previous discussion, the reaction mechanisms of monoterpene synthases are highly reticulate. The individual intermediate may have multiple fates, which suggests the explanation for the ability of terpene enzymes to make various terpene products. 57–60 On the other hand, the carbocationic reaction mechanism that uses sesquiterpene synthase to form sesquiterpenes by catalysing FPP recycling is similar to the reaction mechanism by those monoterpene synthases. Moreover, the larger carbon skeleton of FPP and the presence of three double bonds instead of two suggest a rationale for increases of the structural diversity of the sesquiterpene products. Furthermore, the initial cyclization reactions for sesquiterpene synthases can be divided into two types. Type one involves cyclization of the initially formed farnesyl cation to yield 11-membered ((E)-humulyl cation) rings of large size and a C2–C3 double bond (this type has no barrier to cyclization). The second type involves cyclization that proceeds after the tertiary nerolidyl cation produced from preliminary isomerization of the C2–C3 double bond. This isomerization mechanism is directly analogous to the isomerization of GPP to yield a linalyl cation in monoterpene synthesis. The nerolidyl cation is considered an intermediate in the sesquiterpene synthase mechanism. 61–65 Collectively, we can state that the ability of TPS genes to convert a prenyl diphosphate substrate into diverse products during different reaction cycles is one of the unique traits of this type of enzyme. As described above, this property is found in the majority of all characterized monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases. However, some monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases can catalyse substrates into a single product, and the proteins may have specific methods for multiple product formations. For example, γ-humulene synthase from  A. grandis has two DDxxD motifs located on opposite sides and can generate 52 different sesquiterpenes. This protein is able to bind substrates with two different conformations and resulting in different sets of products. 66 In another example regarding the first monoterpene synthase cloned from  Salvia officinalis, (+)-sabinene synthase produces 63% (+)-sabinene but also 21% γ-terpinene, 7.0% terpinolene, 6.5% limonene and 2.5% myrcene in  in vitro assays. 67 These additional monoterpene products or their immediate metabolites are also found in the monoterpene-rich essential oil of the  S. guaranitica plant.","['reaction mechanism', 'cation', 'reaction', 'linalyl cation', 'monoterpene', 'sesquiterpene synthases', 'monoterpene synthases', 'synthases', 'mechanism', 'shed light']","[metal ion-dependent, α-terpinyl, C1, C6–C7 linalyl, α-terpinyl cation, C2–C3, C2–C3, 61–65]",['TPS'],[],terpene synthase

Furthermore, α-farnesene was produced in both insect treatments ( Figure 1A,B). This showed that tea plants could release HIPVs, including α-farnesene, when attacked by different herbivore mouthparts. Although secretion from herbivore mouthparts could influence the HIPVs released to some extent, we concluded that wounding was the common factor during attack, and that α-farnesene produced by wounding might have an insect-resistance function. To verify this hypothesis, we mechanically damaged tea leaves to simulate herbivore attack and discovered the formation of α-farnesene with a significantly increased content compared with the control ( Figure 1C).

In contrast, the unigenes associated with starch, sucrose, and galactose metabolism were significantly down-regulated from the full to late blossoming stage ( Figure S4B).

Unexpectedly, qRT-PCR results demonstrated that the expressions of all four candidate  OfUGTs presented a continuously decreasing trend through the blossoming stages ( Figure 3), which was opposite to the increasing trend of terpenoid glycosides ( Zeng et al., 2016).

Subsequently, GC-MS analysis calculated the glycoside contents by quantifying the corresponding aglycones released from the glycosides. The results showed that considerable glycosides of linalool and its oxides were accumulated in the leaves with substrate injection (CK), while no glycoside was detected from wild-type tobacco leaves, indicating that the injection effectively promoted the absorption and conversion of the substrates by the leaves. It was worth noting that remarkable increase in glycoside of linalool oxide was only observed in  UGT85A84-infiltrated plants, suggesting that UGT85A84 was capable of catalyzing linalool oxides. All the four OfUGTs showed low activities towards linalool since no significant increase in linalool glycoside was observed in the transgenic plants ( Figure 5). This result was similar to the phenomenon in  O. fragrans flowers.

Target analysis of LC-MS was an effective method for determining the specific product ( Takafumi et al., 2018). Thus, the biochemical characteristics of UGT85A84 were investigated with different sugar donors (UDP-Glc, UDP-Xyl, UDP-Rha) and aglycones (linalool, linalool oxides), respectively ( Figure S7). After 1 h or 16 h incubation, only two glycosylated products, with retention time of 6.50 min and 5.95 min, were formed in the UDP-Glc reaction mixtures ( Figure 6;  Figure S8C). No products were detected in the UDP-Xyl and UDP-Rha reactions, demonstrating that UGT85A84 had no catalytic activity towards these two sugar donors. Further full scan and MS/MS mass spectral data were used to identify and quantify the reaction products. Linalool-glycoside was shown to be the corresponding formate adduct based on the  m/z 361 [M + formate] -1 in full scan mode and the expected pseudo-molecular ion at  m/z 315 in MS 2 ( Figure 6) in the UDP-Glc + linalool reactions.

The apparent  Km for linalool and linalool oxide were 136 µM and 202 µM ( Table 2), respectively, indicating that UGT85A84 had higher catalytic efficiency with linalool than with linalool oxide  in vitro. This result contrasts the catalytic performance in  N. benthamiana leaves, which might be explained by the fact that linalool is a low molecular weight compound that is highly volatile and thus might be easily released instead of being glycosylated in  N. benthamiana leaves.

282,"For assessment of the tea  TPS gene functions, full-length transcriptome sequencing data 37,  38 were employed to verify the putative functional  TPS genes obtained from tea genome. Sequence similarity comparison between the full-length transcripts of  TPS and genome assembly were conducted using BLAST with a threshold E-value < 1e-5 and identity >98%. After series of BLAST using the nucleotide sequence and manual evaluation, 80 tea  TPS genes divided into three types: putative functional  TPS genes with full coding sequences and complete structures (23 members); full-length coding  TPS genes with disordered structure (9 members); and partial  TPS genes (48 members), respectively (Supplementary Table  S4). The first type of tea  TPS genes had 23 members and all had an uncompromised open reading frame in either transcriptomic or genomic data (Table  1). Thus, they were most likely functional.  CsTPS57, CsTPS76, and  CsTPS78 have been proved as active ocimene synthase, bifunctional linalool/nerolidol synthases and nerolidol synthase, respectively 33,  34,  39. Another 20  TPS genes possessed full-length coding sequences either revealed by transcriptome data or genome assembly. These genes also possessed the intron-exon structure, i.e. seven exons for TPS-a, TPS-b, and TPS-g and 13 to 15 exons for TPS-e/f and TPS-c. Moreover, these genes contain the specific protein features of  TPS gene family, such as the ‘DDXXD’ and ‘NSE/DTE’ motifs (Supplementary Table  S4), which are important for metal dependent ionization of the prenyl diphosphate substrate in the C-terminal domain 23,  40,  41. Out of these 20  TPS genes, 5, 11, and 2 were annotated as monoterpene, sesquiterpene and diterpene synthase genes in addition to 3 bifunctional  TPS genes (mono- and sesqui-terpene synthase genes) (Table  1).","['TPS genes', 'TPS', 'tea TPS', 'functional TPS', 'TPS gene', 'genes', 'Supplementary Table', 'Table', 'coding TPS', 'bifunctional TPS']","[CsTPS76, TPS-b, TPS-g, ‘DDXXD, ‘NSE/DTE, prenyl diphosphate, sesqui-terpene synthase genes]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'CsTPS57,', 'CsTPS76,', 'CsTPS78', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-g', 'TPS-e/f', 'TPS-c.', 'TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS']",[],terpene synthase

Intact tea leaves usually do not release any perceivable volatiles, but they contain significant amount of terpenoid volatile precursors, which contribute to the aroma formation of made teas 11. On the contrary, tea flowers have a great potential to be utilized because of their abundant functional molecules such as saponins, polysaccharides, aromatic compounds and functional proteins 42 and emit substantial volatiles, including terpenoid compounds 16. Therefore, terpenoid profiling in tea leaves and flowers combined with  CsTPS transcriptomic analysis may reveal the association between  CsTPS gene expression and their chemical products, which could be helpful for further  CsTPS gene functional characterization. In the present study, the abundance of the internal volatile terpenoids and emitted volatile terpenoids (collectively from free and hydrolyzed glycosides) from tea leaves and flowers were analyzed by GC-MS. In total, seventeen monoterpenes and eleven sesquiterpene compounds were identified from tea leaves and flowers (Fig.  4A,B).

CsTPS51- 56, were annotated as putative α-farnesene synthase according to BLASTP results (Supplementary Table  S2).

Another possibility could not be excluded that the function of these  CsTPS genes could be wrong. Furthermore, all sesquiterpenoids were mainly generated from flowers, rather than leaves, except for nerolidol (Fig.  4B).

It is interesting to note that emitted linalool from homogenized flowers was significantly higher than that from homogenized leaves ( p < 0.01) while the opposite was found for geraniol.

304,"In “LD vs CK” comparison, the overrepresented pathways associated with feeding-induced defense included “flavonoid biosynthesis”, “phenylalanine metabolism”, “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”, “plant-pathogen interaction”, and “phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan biosynthesis” ( Figure 4D). In addition, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was fairly active in insect-infested tea leaves. Pathways of “phenylalanine metabolism”, “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis”, “flavonoid biosynthesis”, and “phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis” are closely related to the biosynthesis of catechins, proanthocyanidins, flavones, and flavonols. Therefore, the elevated production of flavonoid compounds upon insect attack was most likely the result of induced gene expression in these pathways. GO analysis showed that up-regulated DEGs were mainly linked to carbon and nitrogen metabolism, biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, lipids, steroids and sulfur compounds, protein modifications and transport of amino acids, organic acids, and anions ( Supplemental Table S7). On the other hand, the enriched down-represented GO categories contained genes mainly related to photosynthesis, cellular homeostasis, dicarboxylic acid metabolic process, RNA polyadenylation, amine biosynthetic process, and small molecule biosynthetic process ( Supplemental Table S8).","['plant-pathogen interaction', 'phenylalanine metabolism', 'defense included', 'Supplemental Table', 'feeding-induced defense', 'biosynthesis', 'phenylpropanoid biosynthesis', 'phenylalanine', 'tryptophan biosynthesis', 'Figure']","[“LD, CK”, ”, “phenylalanine, ”, ”, “, ”, “phenylalanine, ”, mitogen-activated protein kinase, MAPK, “phenylalanine, ”, ”, “flavonoid, ”, “phenylalanine, ”]",[],[],NaN

These pathways presumably play critical roles underlying resistance to tea green leafhopper infestation. By GO enrichment analysis, we identified 81 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated GO categories. More specifically, the up-regulated GO categories in LD mainly included genes involved in the biosynthesis of chitins, polysaccharides, lipids and fatty acids, protein modifications, and transport of organic acids ( Supplemental Table S9).

This enzyme catalyzes decarbonylation of fatty aldehydes to produce long-chain hydrocarbons contributing to the formation of the cuticular wax, an active component of plant adaptations to biotic and abiotic stresses. The chemical compositions of the wax were implicated to be associated with plant-insect and plant-pathogen interactions ( Bernard and Joubès, 2013).

310,"To further assess the effect of  CER1 induction on wax biosynthesis, cuticular wax compositions of leafhopper-damaged leaves (LD), and undamaged controls (CK) were analyzed  via GC-MS and GC-FID. Representative chromatograms of tea samples and C 10-C 40 alkane standard mixtures were shown in  Supplemental Figure S4 in  Data Sheet 1. In total, 354–393 compounds were detected from the wax mixtures of CK samples (n = 3) and 397–414 compounds were detected from those of LD samples (n = 3) ( Supplemental Table S12). The wax mixtures on sampled tea leaves from both groups consisted mainly of fatty acids, alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, and primary alcohols, similar to a recent report on the predominant wax constituents of tender tea leaves ( Zhu et al., 2018) ( Table 3). The wax load per unit of leaf area of LD leaves presented no drastic change compared to CK. Since  CER1 is mainly involved in very-long-chain (VLC) alkane biosynthesis, we specifically focused on the differences in VLC alkane levels between LD and CK leaf waxes. A further analysis of the chain length distribution within the alkane fractions indicated that they were characterized by odd-numbered homologs ranging from C25 to C37. C29 alkanes increased significantly ( p < 0.05) in LD, showing a 43.6% increase compared to CK. Interestingly, there was also a large increase of primary alcohols (C28, C30, and C32) and a decrease in C28 aldehydes.

311,"Transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators that orchestrate the regulation of many different aspects of plant development and responses. Since transcriptional reprogramming is governed mostly by TFs, we therefore sought to identify differentially expressed TFs among different treatment groups. As illustrated in  Table 4, comparisons of LD with CK identified 228 differentially expressed TFs, in which 153 were up-regulated and 75 were down-regulated. Comparisons of LD with MD identified 213 differentially expressed TFs, in which 138 were up-regulated and 75 were down-regulated. In contrary, only 31 TFs showed differential abundance with respect to mechanical damage. Major TF families such as AP2/ERF, bHLH, MYB, NAC, WRKY, and bZIP were documented to be closely related to defense signaling ( Ng et al., 2018). In agreement with previous findings, we found that TF families with the most members overrepresented in LD were WRKY (24), AR2/ERF (24), bHLH (18), NAC (10) as well as GRAS (10). Potentially acting as a regulator of SA pathway, WRKY was the largest and the most significantly over-represented TF group, with all identified DEGs in this group being exclusively up-regulated ( Table 4). Equally overrepresented was the AP2/ERF family, a regulator for the ERF-branch of the JA pathway. There were 24 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated genes in this family. Belonging to the bHLH family, MYC2 TF acts a master regulator of JA signaling pathway. Four MYC2-encoding transcripts, namely TEA009193, TEA012449, TEA016380, and TEA019380, were found to respond more strongly to the insect feeding than to the mechanical damage.

A full-length transcriptome of whole  E. (M.) onukii insect was sequenced with three generation PacBio sequencing technology (unpublished data). Three isoprenyl diphosphate synthases including two farnesyl diphosphate (FPPS,  EoFPPS1 and  EoFPPS2) homologue genes and one geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPPS,  EoTPS) homologue genes were found in this full-length transcriptome. These three genes were cloned from  E. (M.) onukii successfully. The full length of EoFPPS1 (GenBank Accession Number MH383157) was 1179 bps, encoding 392 amino acids. The full length of EoFPPS2 (GenBank Accession Number MH383158) was 1287 bps, encoding 428 amino acids. The full length of EoTPS (GenBank Accession Number MH383159) was 912 bps, encoding 303 amino acids. The calculated molecular masses of EoFPPS1, EoFPPS2, and EoTPS were 45, 49, and 35 kDa, respectively. Neighbor-joining tree was generated with other isoprenyl diphosphate synthases in insect. The two farnesyl diphosphate synthase, EoFPPS1 and EoFPPS2, belong to the FPP synthase family.

To better determine the enzymatic activity of EoFPPS1, the ORF lacking pupative mitochondrial targeting peptide (the first 25 amino acids, EoFPPS1S) was also expressed in  E. coli ( Figure 4a). The activity assay results showed that only EoTPS converted GPP to geraniol ( Figure 4b,  Figure S1).

The results showed that there is no difference of geraniol formation between EoFPPS1 and empty vector, or between EoFPPS2 and empty vector.

347,"UVR8 is a UV-B receptor and mediates UV-B induced plant responses through signal transduction pathway ( Kliebenstein et al., 2002). To understand roles of  UVR8 and its signal transduction pathway in tea plants in response to UVB exposure at different time periods, transcriptional alteration of the genes in this pathway were examined in this study. We identified only one UVR8 transcript in our transcriptomic data even though 10 more UVR8 transcripts were retrieved from tea genome after performing a local blast. Our data showed that in all the UV-B treated tea plants,  UVR8 transcription levels were down-regulated ( Figure 3). Transcription levels of  HY5,  MYB4,  bHLH62, and  MYB12, transcriptional factors regulating the downstream structural genes, were all affected differently at different exposure times ( Figure 3A). Here, we observed  HY5 was down-regulated at 0.5 h and up-regulated at 2 and 8 h treatments. Four  MYB4 ( MYB4-1, MYB4-2, MYB4-3, and  MYB4-4) were observed to be altered differently through all the treatments while  MYB12 and  bHLH 62 were up-regulated at 8 h treatment ( Figure 3B). Transcript abundance of 8 selected genes in this pathway was validated using real-time qPCR analysis. Consistent UV-B responses at different exposure time were observed between the RT-qPCR analysis and RNA-Seq gene expression ( Figure 3B). UVR8 transduction pathways responded to UVB exposure leading to suppression of  UVR8 gene and differential expression of genes downstream UV8.

348,"It has been widely reported that UV-B irradiation induces flavonoids and anthocyanins accumulation which acts as UV-B protectant in different plant species. The tea plant is classified as extraordinary plant species due to its enormous accumulation of flavonoids ( Punyasiri et al., 2004). We examined the effect of different time exposure of UV-B on tea shoots using transcriptomic data ( Figure 4). Thirty transcripts were differentially affected in this pathway with 11 down-regulated and 19 up-regulated. We observed up-regulation of transcripts  4CL2-1, 4CL2-3 were up-regulated at 2 and 8 h treatment while  4CL2-2 and  4CL2-4 were upregulated at 8 and 2 h treatment, respectively.

Moreover, divergent expression patterns of some genes in phenylpropanoid pathway including transcriptional factor  MYB4 were also noted ( Figure 4A and  Supplementary Table S5).  MYB4-1 and  MYB4-3 were all down-regulated by all the three treatments while  MYB4-2 was up-regulated in all the treatments. It was interesting to note suppression of most structural genes at 8 h treatment but no changes were observed in 0.5 and 2 h treatment. Up regulation of  MYB4-2 at 8 h treatment could have suppressed the structural genes as observed at 8 h treatment.  MYB4-4 was up-regulated at 0.5 and 2 h treatment, but such an enhancement did not exert any detectable regulatory effects on its target genes except for  F3′5′H-1, in flavonoid pathway. Down regulation of  MYB4-1 and  MYB4-3 at 8 h treatment could have led to upregulation of structural genes  4CL2-1, 4CL2-2, 4CL2-3, 4CL2-4, DFR-4, ANR-2, CHI, FSLI, ANS, LAR-1, LAR-2, and  LAR-3 ( Figure 4B).

350,"One of the unresolved questions related to terpenoid metabolism is whether light differentially regulates the expression of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis ( Dolzhenko et al., 2010). To have a better insight into the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway by UV-B light exposure, we exposed tea shoots to UVB to four different exposure periods as described in methodology and evaluated some of the main genes involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis ( Figure 5A). We compared the expression levels of the genes in diterpenoid, monoterpenoid, and sesquiterpenoid pathways in all the UV-B treatments. Most of genes in diterpenoid biosynthesis were up-regulated across all the UV-B treated tea shoots. The majority of genes were down-regulated in monoterpenoid biosynthesis in 2 and 8 h exposure while upregulation was observed at 0.5 h treatment. Four genes in monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway annotated as TPS13-1, TPS13-2, (+)-neomentholdehydrogenase1-1 (MNR1-1), (+) neomentholdehydrogenase1-2 (MNR1-2), were up-regulated ( Supplementary Table S5).

Among them, a certain number of biosynthetic pathways were related to the major saffron characteristic secondary metabolites (e.g., crocin, picrocrocin and safranal).

Meanwhile, phylogenetic analysis was performed to reflect the evolutionary relationships among species as well as their estimated divergent times ( Fig. 2C). Our results showed that, among the 19,106 gene families inferred to be present in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the 12 representative plant species analyzed, 8357 families were contracted in  C. sativus, whereas new gene copies were gained within 2843 families ( Fig. 2C).

These findings suggest a possible mechanism for evolution or domestication of this sterile triploid  C. sativus promoted by either natural or artificial selection. In traditional agriculture practice, male sterility was known to spontaneously evolve and could be extensively used to produce offspring with compensatory advantages over their parents  [90]. Thus, our observation of a large expansion occurred in functional genes related to male sterility may imply some kinds of selection pressures or adaptive responses targeted for desirable characteristics in  C. sativus, such as increased production, improved quality, enhanced adaptation and genetic stability against various biotic and abiotic stresses.

Our results confirmed that the ancient WGD event, referred as  τ for monocots, was shared among  C. sativus,  A. officinalis[67] and  A. comosus[66]. This  τ event, thus, was considered to occur in the common ancestor of monocots. Another WGD event was found and designated as the recent WGD β) event in  C. sativus ( Fig. 2D). By contrast, there were two recent WGD events (namely α and β) occurred in  A. officinalis and  A. comosus ( Fig. 2D). As the peaks of these recent WGD events separated from each other, the distinct β event in  C. sativus was most likely to occur after divergence with  A. officinalis. Upon the WGD event, new gene copies could undergo relaxed selections shortly after their duplication in the genome, which enables them to tolerate almost all nucleotide changes  [94]. Subsequently, the WGD event would allow the survival of polyploidy in short-term and the formation of species in long-term  [95]. In  C. sativus, more than 35% duplicates have survived after the β WGD event. The robustness is therefore essential in the innovation of gene families associated with the regulatory and synthetic pathways of distinct secondary metabolites that are unique to  C. sativus.

Biochemical analysis showed that crocin, safranal and picrocrocin is produced by cleaving zeaxanthin predominantly at the symmetric 7,8/7′,8′ double bonds in  C. sativus[98]. In fact, the substrate zeaxanthin is usually converted into 3-hydroxy-β-ionone through the cleavage at the 9,10/9′,10′ double bonds in most plant species, such as  Z. mays[99],  D. carota[100],  S. lycopersicum[101] as well as  C. sativus[102] ( Fig. 3A).

The details of the DEGs for leaf vs. strobilus, leaf vs. root, leaf vs. stem, strobilus vs. root, strobilus vs. stem, and stem vs. root are shown in  Table S11. The largest differences were found for leaf vs. root, in which 9660 DEGs were determined, including 4092 upregulated unigenes and 5568 downregulated unigenes, and the number of annotated DEGs was also the greatest ( Table S12,  Figure 6c).

425,"In the wintersweet genome, repetitive elements occupied 45.73% of the genome, of which 96.69% were annotated as transposable elements (TEs) (Additional file  1: Table S12). Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTRs) were the major class of TEs that accounts for 36.2% of the assembly. Among the LTRs, the LTR/Gypsy elements were the most abundant, composing 23.3% of the genome, followed by LTR/Copia elements (8.6%, Additional file  1: Table S12). Besides the main groups of LTR elements, 3.65% of the genome was annotated as DNA elements and 3.45% as long interspersed nuclear elements, whereas the rest were assigned to other repeat families or could not be assigned (Additional file  1: Table S12). Transposable elements are unevenly distributed across the chromosomes and found to be particularly abundant in centromeric regions (Fig.  1b). Further comparative analysis of the distribution of TEs indicated a higher proportion in intergenic regions (79.19%) when compared to genic regions (16.04%) and regions adjoining genes (4.77%) (Additional file  2: Fig. S5a). Within genic regions, the TEs exhibited unequal distribution between exons and introns. 98.98% of TEs in the genic regions occurred in introns and constituted 25% of the total length of introns (Additional file  2: Fig. S5b). Comparison of gene structure with other species revealed that the average length and number of exons is similar, while the average length of introns is slightly longer and to some extent can be attributed to repeat accumulation. Moreover, the time of the LTR-RT burst in wintersweet was estimated using the 8812 putative complete LTR-RTs and revealed a peak substitution rate at around 0.03 (Additional file  2: Fig. S6). We assumed a mutation rate of 1.51 × 10 − 9 per base per year [ 14], resulting in an insertion time of approximately 9.9 Ma.","['Additional file', 'Additional', 'file', 'elements', 'Fig.', 'Table', 'regions', 'repetitive elements', 'elements occupied', 'LTR']","[TEs, S12, TEs, S12, S12, TEs, TEs, TEs, LTR-RT, − 9]",[],[],NaN
426,"In order to investigate the evolution of TEs in Magnoliids, phylogenetic trees of domains in reverse transcriptase genes were constructed for both  Ty1/Copia and  Ty3/Gypsy superfamily.

Compared with  L. chinensis and  C kanehirae, the LTR-RTs in wintersweet and  C.  chinensis exhibited higher diversity and abundance within the tork clade, indicating greater expansion and divergence in wintersweet and  C.  chinensis genome.

427,"The phylogenetic relationships of Magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots have been somewhat controversial in plant taxonomy. In an effort to infer the phylogenetic position of the Magnoliids relative to monocots and eudicots, a set of 213 evaluated single-copy ortholog sets (OSCG) were first identified with OrthoMCL [ 23] using genome data from 17 flowering plant species that includes 5 monocots, 6 eudicots, 5 magnoliids, and 1 basal angiosperm. We applied both coalescent and concatenation approaches to reconstruct phylogenetic trees using the 213-gene dataset. Both coalescent and concatenation analyses yielded an identical highly supported topology with magnoliids as a sister group to eudicots after their divergence from monocots (Fig.  2a and Additional file  2: Fig. S8a). To avoid the potential errors in ortholog identification, we also used SonicParanoid [ 24] to extract single-copy genes (SSCG) from the 17 plant genomes described above. Only those genes sampled from at least 14 species were utilized for the construction of phylogenetic trees. On the basis of 216 single-copy genes, the phylogenetic trees were then similarly inferred by both coalescent and concatenation methods as those described above. The resulting species trees were topologically identical to the phylogenetic findings revealed by OrtholMCL described above (Additional file  2: Fig. S8b).","['Magnoliids', 'phylogenetic', 'phylogenetic trees', 'plant taxonomy', 'Fig.', 'eudicots', 'phylogenetic relationships', 'monocots', 'Additional file', 'trees']","[Magnoliids, single-copy, OSCG, OrthoMCL [ 23], SonicParanoid [, single-copy, single-copy, OrtholMCL]",[],[],NaN
428,"Although the same set of phylogenetic relationships among Magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots was consistently recovered, the topological conflicts were also observed among coalescent-based gene trees (Additional file  2: Fig. S8c). To estimate the discordance among gene trees in OSCG and SSCG datasets, we took advantage of the quartet score in ASTRAL [ 25] to display the proportions of gene trees in support of three different branching orders for Magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots (Additional file  2: Fig. S8d) and found that the percentages of gene trees supporting Magnoliids and eudicots together forming a sister group with monocots is higher than the other two topologies (Additional file  2: Fig. S8c). However, in the phylogenetic analyses of a concatenated sequence alignment of 38 chloroplast single-copy genes for 26 taxa, the magnoliids were placed as a sister group to the clade consisting of eudicots and monocots (Additional file  2: Fig. S9). Furthermore, the short phylogenetic branches among magnoliids, eudicots, and monocots clades, representing rapid speciation events, were also observed in these phylogenetic genes. The phylogenetic incongruence between nuclear and plastid genomes may be caused by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which appears more frequently during the rapid divergence of early mesangiosperms. As the inadequate taxon sampling could result in incongruent phylogeny, we improved the taxon sampling by adding additional genome data from 11 phylogenetically pivotal species and a transcriptome data set of chloranthales to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree. This approach recovered the same phylogenetic relationships among magnoliids, eudicots, and monocots (Additional file  2: Fig. S10). Thus, from these results, we believe the phylogenetic relationship proposed in our study is relatively accurate under the current dataset. Based on the high-confidence phylogenetic tree and calibration points selected from articles and TimeTree website, the divergence time between the magnoliids and the eudicots were estimated to be 113.0–153.1 Ma (95% confidence interval) (Fig.  2a), which overlaps with three recent estimates (114.6–164 Ma, 117–189 Ma, and 136.0–209.4 Ma) [ 13,  25,  26].","['Additional file', 'Fig.', 'gene trees', 'Additional', 'Magnoliids', 'phylogenetic', 'file', 'eudicots', 'topological conflicts', 'monocots']","[OSCG, plastid, chloranthales, TimeTree, 113.0–153.1 , 114.6–164 , 117–189 , 136.0–209.4 ]",[],[],NaN
429,"Whole-genome duplication (WGD) has long been regarded as the major driving force in plant evolution [ 27]. To investigate WGD events during the evolutionary course of wintersweet, we first searched for genome-wide duplications and assigned them into four different modes with MCScanX analysis (Additional file  2: Fig. S11). The WGD/segmental duplication was identified as the dominant type that includes 4511 paralogous gene pairs in 265 syntenic blocks. Among these syntenic blocks, 36.09% were found to share relationships with three other blocks across the genome (Additional file  2: Fig. S12). The widespread synteny and well-maintained one-versus-three syntenic blocks suggest that two WGD events might have occurred during wintersweet genome evolution. It is well accepted that  Amborella is a single living species that is the sister lineage to all other groups within the angiosperms, and there is no evidence of lineage-specific polyploidy after it diverged from the last common ancestor of angiosperms [ 28]. Collinearity and synteny analysis between the wintersweet and  Amborella genome also provided clear structural evidence for two WGDs in wintersweet with a 1:4 syntenic depth ratio in  Amborella-wintersweet comparison (Fig.  3a). To further elucidate the polyploidy of wintersweet genomes, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of wintersweet with  C. kanehirae and  L. chinensis. Syntenic depth ratios of 4:4 and 2:4 were inferred in the wintersweet- Cinnamomum and wintersweet- Liriodendron comparisons, respectively (Fig.  3b). Based on the syntenic relationships between and within each species, our analyses collectively indicate that wintersweet underwent two WGD events.

430,"To estimate the timing of the two WGD events in the wintersweet genome, we characterized synonymous substitutions on synonymous nucleotide sites (Ks) between collinear homoeologs within or between wintersweet and other three species including  C. chinensis,  Cinnamomum kanehirae, and  Liriodendron chinensis from Magnoliids. The Ks distributions of one-to-one orthologs identified between  Amborella and the other four species show different Ks peaks, suggesting divergent evolutionary rates among these four species (Additional file  2: Fig. S13). After correction for evolutionary rate [ 29], the synonymous substitutions per site per year as 4.21 × 10 − 9 for Laurales were calculated using the mean Ks values of syntenic blocks, resulting in the estimated time of the WGD event at approximately 77.8 million and 112.1 million years ago (Ma), respectively (Fig.  3c). Previous analysis of the genome of  Cinnamomum suggested that the ancient WGD event seems shared by Magnoliales and Laurales [ 13], and the absolute dating of the identified WGD events in  Liriodendron tulipifera also supported this hypothesis [ 14]. In our study, we also detected two and one polyploidization events in  Cinnamomum and  Liriodendron respectively, but no common WGD event was shared by these two species. Furthermore, the wintersweet genome shares an ancient WGD event with  Cinnamomum but not with  Liriodendron. Moreover, the trees of the syntenic gene groups of wintersweet and  Liriodendron vs.  Amborella indicated that wintersweet and  Liriodendron experienced a WGD event respectively after their divergence from a common ancestor (Additional file  2: Fig. S14 and Additional file  3: Supplementary Note 3).

This ancestor went through a WGD event to reach a 20-chromosome intermediate and then experienced chromosomal rearrangements to form present-day karyotypes. In wintersweet, all the chromosomes underwent rearrangements and every chromosome came from at least two ancient chromosomes.

432,"Wintersweet is one of the perennial trees that bloom in the deep winter. It took approximately 10 months for  C. praecox to complete its reproductive development. To investigate this whole process of the flower development that may influence the final flowering time, we first performed a systematic study on the floral ontogeny and developmental patterns by paraffin sections through observation. The results indicated that the floral bud was initiated in April, floral patterning and floral organ specification occurred from April to July, slow growth in summer, the male and female gametophytes were formed in October and December respectively, the flower bud transitioned into dormancy, then break occurred in December, and the flower bloomed in deep winter (Fig.  4a).

433,"Floral initiation is controlled by the spatial and temporal expression of flowering-time-related genes in multiple pathways [ 11]. Many genes from these pathways have been identified and characterized in various herbaceous and perennial species and reported to have the conserved function [ 30– 32]. A database of flowering-time gene networks was recently constructed in  Arabidopsis thaliana [ 30]. Taking advantage of this database, we identified 594 flowering-time genes in eight pathways (Additional file  1: Table S13). Analysis of RNA-seq data shown that during the floral transition the flowering-time genes related to gibberellin biosynthesis and signaling transduction pathway were significantly activated (padj < 0.01), and the expression of some genes in photoperiodic and circadian clock pathways were also upregulated (Fig.  4b and Additional file  1: Table S14) suggesting the endogenous hormone (gibberellin) and environmental factor (photoperiod) may play a major role in the switch from vegetative to reproductive growth in spring.","['Additional file', 'genes', 'flowering-time genes', 'multiple pathways', 'temporal expression', 'Floral initiation', 'pathways', 'Table', 'flowering-time', 'Additional']","[flowering-time-related, S13, RNA-seq, S14]",[],[],NaN
434,"After floral patterning and floral organ specification from April to July, the floral organ development processes slowly from Summer to Autumn, during which the temperature is very high and maximum temperature could reach up to 39 °C (Fig.  4a and Additional file  1: Table S15). Therefore, the temperature may be a key factor that affects the flower organ slow development. The direct reflection is the significantly increased expression level of heat shock protein genes (Fig.  4b). In addition, comparing with other developmental stages, many genes associated with cell division downregulated significantly (Fig.  4b and Additional file  1: Table S16). Heat stress transcriptional factors (HSFs) and heat responsive genes play an essential role in heat stress response [ 33]. We have found 21 members in HSF family in  C. praecox. Six  HsfA1s, which serve as the master transcriptional regulators in the heat stress response, were identified (Fig.  4b and Additional file  1: Table S17). The DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) regulated by the HsfA1s. Both  HsfA1-1 and  DREB2A-1 displayed an opposite expression pattern with the genes related to cell division (Fig.  4b and Additional file  1: Table S15). The DRE sequence (CTAGA motif) which is recognized by DREB2A was also detected in the promoter of the cell division genes (Additional file  2: Fig. S16a). These results may suggest that the heat signals can be integrated into transcriptional regulatory networks by the HSFs then to regulate expression of the genes related to the cell division, finally resulting in the slow growth of flower organs.","['Additional file', 'floral organ', 'Fig.', 'floral patterning', 'Additional', 'floral', 'Table', 'processes slowly', 'maximum temperature', 'organ specification']","[S15, heat shock protein, S16, HSFs, HSF, S17, PROTEIN2A, DREB2A, HsfA1s, HsfA1-1, S15, DRE, DREB2A, HSFs]",[],[],NaN
435,"In total, 58 MADS-box genes were identified in the wintersweet genome, 31 of which are MIKC-type MADS-box genes (Additional file  1: Table S13). Phylogenetic and collinearity analyses of these genes indicated that the homologs of ABCE model prototype genes, except for  AP1/FUL, were all found to be duplicated (Fig.  4c). Four  AGL6s, generated by WGD events, were identified in wintersweet assembly, the number of which is larger than that in Arabidopsis and rice. Among these genes, the  CpAGL6a has been reported to promote flowering when overexpressed in  Arabidopsis [ 34]. Meanwhile, the FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC), which serves as a flowering repressor [ 35], was lost in wintersweet (Fig.  4c). The selective expanded promoter and loss of repressor of flowering-time related genes may be associated with the earlier flowering of wintersweet. The morphology between the inner and outer perianth in wintersweet displayed a slight difference, which is the same as in some basal eudicots ( Ranunculus and  Aquilegia). “Sliding boundary” model was proposed to explain this morphology in  Ranunculus, in which the B-function homologs are expressed in those whorls that produce petaloid organ [ 36]. The B-function homologs in wintersweet displayed broad expression pattern, with  AP3b preferably expressed in the outer perianth whorl (Fig.  4c), which supported the “sliding boundary” model and may complement the absence of a clear morphological distinction between sepals and petals in wintersweet. The strong expression of C-function homologs is limited to stamen and carpel, which suggests that these genes have a conserved function in stamen and carpel specification. The expression profiles of wintersweet ABCE homologs during the flower development largely agree with the gradual formation of the floral organs they specify (Fig.  4b).","['Additional file', 'MADS-box genes', 'MIKC-type MADS-box', 'wintersweet', 'genes', 'Fig.', 'wintersweet genome', 'Table', 'MADS-box', 'Additional']","[MADS-box, MIKC-type MADS-box, S13, ABCE, WGD, FLOWERING LOCUS, FLC, wintersweet (Fig.  , “, “, wintersweet ABCE]",[],[],NaN
436,"The relative earlier flowing time in winter suggested the shorter chilling requirement for dormancy release and earlier bud break in wintersweet. The members of the  SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE ( SVP) clade of the MADS-box gene family, including SVP and DAM genes, are well known to be associated with dormancy release and bud break [ 37,  38]. Two homologs of  SVP genes were identified in the wintersweet genome. Phylogenetic analysis of  SVPs revealed that these two genes cluster close to  PtSVL (Additional file  2: Fig. S16b), the function of which had been characterized as a repressor in the genetic network of temperature-mediated vegetative bud break in hybrid aspen [ 39]. The downstream genes of  PtSVL in the network including  TEOSINTE BRANCHED1,  CYCLOIDEA,  PCF/BRANCHED1 ( TCP18/BRC1), and  FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT), which function as negative and positive regulators of temperature-mediated control bud break, were also identified in the wintersweet genome (Additional file  2: Fig. S16c).

437,"Wintersweet is one of the perennial trees that bloom in the deep winter, during which the temperature always falls below the freezing point. Therefore, wintersweet has evolved a systematic mechanism to withstand cold stress. Volatile glycosylation is a common form of plant volatile compounds and plays an important role in response to abiotic stress in plants [ 41]. Recent studies revealed that the volatile terpene glucosylation mediated by UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) was involved in the modulation of cold stress tolerance in tea plants [ 42]. In wintersweet, abundant volatiles were present in glycosidically bound forms, such as linalool glucoside, benzaldehyde benzyl alcohol (Additional file  2: Fig. S17). The considerable expansion in the UGT family (Additional file  1: Table S10) and abundant terpene glycosides in wintersweet flowers lead to the hypothesis that the strong cold tolerance of wintersweet, to some extent, is related to the volatile glucosylation.","['deep winter', 'freezing point', 'perennial trees', 'Additional file', 'Wintersweet', 'cold stress', 'Volatile', 'stress', 'Additional', 'cold']","[Wintersweet, UDP-glycosyltransferases, UGTs, UGT]",[],[],NaN
438,"Monoterpenes are the major components of floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in wintersweet, especially the linalool, which accounts for more than half of the floral scent [ 5]. In plants, monoterpenes/diterpenes and sesquiterpenes are usually generated via the 2- C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway and the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, respectively [ 43]. A total of 46 genes in these two pathways were identified (Additional file  1: Table S18). The key genes involved in the MEP pathway such as 1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase ( DXS), 1-deoxy- d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase ( DXR), and isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase ( IDI) were generated through WGD events (Fig.  5a). The high rate of paralog generation in these genes could increase the efficiency of catalytic reaction through dosage effects, thereby increasing the metabolic flux toward the MEP pathway. Terpene synthases (TPSs) are the enzymes responsible for the last catalytic reaction in the MVA and MEP pathway to generate terpenoid compounds. With the aid of the assembly genome, a total of 52 complete  CpTPSs were identified (Additional file  1: Table S19), the number of which is approximately double that detected by transcriptomics in our previous study [ 5]. Phylogenetic analysis of TPS from four species revealed that  CpTPSs were clustered into five of six subfamilies described for land plants (Fig.  5b). The majority of  CpTPSs were placed in the TPS-a (18) and TPS-b (24) subfamilies, which is predominantly composed of angiosperm-specific sesquiterpene and monoterpene synthases respectively [ 44]. Comparative genomics analysis revealed that the TPS genes are significantly expanded, especially in the TPS-b subfamily (Fig.  5b and Additional file  1: Table S10).

Subcellular localization analysis showed that  CpTPS4 and  CpTPS9 were localized to the plastid whereas  CpTPS42 was targeted to the cytosol (Additional file  2: Fig. S19).  CpTPS42 was shown to be a sesquiterpene synthase, which mainly catalyzed the formation of nerolidol, together with other sesquiterpenes (Fig.  5e).  CpTPS4 and  CpTPS9 are both monoterpene synthases and produce β-pinene and linalool as its main product respectively (Fig.  5e).

Enhanced levels of the monoterpenes including linalool, limonene, β-ocimene, and trans-β-ocimene were found in transgenic tobacco leaves in comparison with the wild type control (Fig.  5f).

Similar to  P. mume, the expansion of the  BEAT homologous genes was mainly attributed to tandem and WGD duplication events [ 47].

These genes might be responsible for benzyl acetate biosynthesis in the wintersweet flower. Methyl salicylate is also the major composition of floral VOCs in wintersweet. Three tandem duplication-derived salicylic acid methyltransferase ( SAMTs) were identified in the wintersweet (Additional file  2: Fig. S22), two of which were highly expressed in the flower and their expression patterns correlated with methyl salicylate emission, suggesting that these two genes may be primarily responsible for methyl salicylate biosynthesis (Fig.  6a). These observations above suggested that the expansion of specific genes and selective expression in flower could induce the heightened activity of the corresponding enzymes, which resulted in the abundant characteristic aroma formation in the flowers of wintersweet.","['BEAT homologous', 'benzyl alcohol', 'alcohol acetyltransferase', 'Benzyl acetate', 'Additional file', 'floral scent', 'BEAT', 'reaction catalyzed', 'homologous genes', 'dominant compounds']","[S21, WGD, SAMTs, wintersweet (Additional file]",[],[],NaN
444,"Generally, monoterpene volatiles are the main terpenes in orchids. These are produced by TPS proteins using GPP as a substrate [ 6, 7]. To further confirm the role of DoTPS10 in the synthesis of monoterpenes, a His-tagged vector (pET32a) was used to produce the recombinant DoTPS10 protein. The vector was successfully expressed as a soluble protein in  E. coli BL21. DoTPS10 protein was purified using a His-trap Ni-sepharose high performance column. His-tagged vector (pET32a) had an Mw of 23.8 kDa, containing 4.8 kDa of six His-tags, and recombinant DoTPS10 protein exhibited an approximate Mw of 88.3 kDa on SDS-PAGE ( Figure 10E). After recombinant DoTPS10 protein was incubated with GPP, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis showed that empty pET32a could not produce linalool while the recombinant DoTPS10 protein singly converted the substrate GPP to the corresponding product linalool ( Figure S3,  Figure 9G,H).","['main terpenes', 'Figure', 'protein', 'monoterpene volatiles', 'recombinant', 'GPP', 'His-tagged vector', 'TPS proteins', 'Generally', 'His-trap Ni-sepharose']","[DoTPS10, DoTPS10, pET32a, His-tags, pET32a]","['TPS', 'DoTPS10', 'DoTPS10', 'DoTPS10', 'DoTPS10', 'DoTPS10', 'DoTPS10']",[],NaN

After the removal of redundant sequences, 34 TPS genes were obtained ( Table 1). The open reading frame (ORF) of  DoTPS ranged from 378 ( DoTPS12) to 2571 bp ( DoTPS4), the deduced length of the amino acids ranged from 125 (DoTPS12) to 856 aa (DoTPS4), and molecular weight (Mw) ranged from 14.98 (DoTPS12) to 100.05 kDa (DoTPS4).

448,"To gain further insight into the evolutionary relationships among the TPS subfamilies, an unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method implemented in MEGA 7.0 with the Jones–Taylor–Thornton (JTT) model based on multiple sequence alignment of TPS members from  Abies grandis,  A. thaliana,  Apostasia shenzhenica,  D. officinale,  Oryza sativa,  Phalaenopsis equestris,  Populus trichocarpa,  Selaginella moellendorffii,  Solanum lycopersicum, and  Sorghum bicolor ( Figure 3,  Table S6). The phylogenetic tree demonstrates that TPS proteins were clustered into seven subfamilies (TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, TPS-d, TPS-e/f, TPS-g, and TPS-h) according to the published report [ 1, 15]. Thirty-four DoTPS proteins appeared in only four groups (TPS-a, TPS-b, TPS-c, and TPS-e/f, 14, 16, 1, and 3, respectively), and 88.2% of them belonged to TPS-a or TPS-b subgroups. Similarly, there were 20 and 9 TPS proteins present in  P. equestris and  A. shenzhenica, the amount of TPS-a, and TPS-b accounted for 12/20, and 7/9, respectively ( Figure 3). This phenomenon was similar to that in  A. thaliana and  O. sativa [ 1, 10]. Remarkably, in the TPS-a group, dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants formed distinct subgroups, which were observed previously [ 1, 15] and termed them as TPS-a1 (dicots) and TPS-a2 (monocots), suggesting that the  TPS-a genes evolved independently. Similar to the TPS-a group, the TPS-c group was further divided into dicot and monocot subclades. Consistent with a previous report, the TPS-d subfamily was specific to gymnosperms, and the TPS-h subfamily was only observed in  S. moellendorffii [ 1, 11, 12, 17], inferring that they might play a particular role in these species.","['Populus trichocarpa', 'Solanum lycopersicum', 'Abies grandis', 'Sorghum bicolor', 'Apostasia shenzhenica', 'Oryza sativa', 'Phalaenopsis equestris', 'TPS proteins', 'TPS members', 'phylogenetic tree']","[NJ, TPS-b, TPS-g, TPS-h, TPS-b, TPS-e/f, 14, TPS-a, sativa [ 1, TPS-a1 (, TPS-h, moellendorffii [ 1]","['TPS', 'TPS', 'TPS', '(TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS-d,', 'TPS-e/f,', 'TPS-g,', 'TPS-h)', 'DoTPS', '(TPS-a,', 'TPS-b,', 'TPS-c,', 'TPS-e/f,', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-b', 'TPS', 'TPS-a,', 'TPS-b', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a1', 'TPS-a2', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-a', 'TPS-c', 'TPS-d', 'TPS-h']",[],NaN

As illustrated in  Figure 4, the arginine-tryptophan motif, R(R)X 8W, was found in all the DoTPS-a and DoTPS-b proteins, except DoTPS8, at the  N-terminus. It plays a role in initiation of the isomerization cyclization reaction [ 1, 10]. However, the arginine-tryptophan motif, R(R)X 8W, varied or was even absent in TPS-c and TPS-e/f proteins. Two aspartate-rich motifs, DDxxD and NSE/DTE, are essential for cleaving prenyl diphosphate substrate by chelating a trio of Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ at the  C-terminus [ 9, 11]. The DDxxD motif was conserved in almost all the DoTPS proteins, except three DoTPS proteins (DoTPS1, DoTPS8 of the TPS-a group, and DoTPS31 of the TPS-c group). DoTPS31 was the only TPS-c member in  D. officinale. The TPS-c subfamily is mainly found in land plants and its prenyl diphosphate unit is not cleaved [ 1]. The NSE/DTE motif was absent in DoTPS8, -11, and -12 of the TPS-a group, DoTPS1, -19, and -24 of the TPS-b group, and DoTPS32 of the TPS-e/f group ( Figure 4).

The  cis-acting elements in the promoter regions of  DoTPS genes were classified into three categories of  cis-elements linked to plant growth and development, phytohormone responsiveness, and stress responsiveness ( Figure 5). In the plant growth and development category (159/759), 10  cis-elements involved in circadian rhythms, endosperm expression (AAGAA-motif and GCN4-motif), flowering (AT-rich element, CCAAT-box, and MRE), shoot and root meristem expression (CAT-box), seed expression (RY-element), shoot expression (As-2 element), and zein metabolism (O 2 site) were found, the highest proportion being the As-2 element (30%).

460,"LTR retrotransposons are the predominant repeat elements that tend to be poorly assembled in draft genomes 25, and it has been reported that the LTR assembly index (LAI), which approximates the ratio of intact LTRs to total LTRs, can be exploited to evaluate assembly continuity. Thus, we investigated the LTR composition of the LJ43 genome and compared it with the composition of the SCZ and YK10 genomes and found that the LAI of the LJ43, SCZ, and YK10 genomes was 11.78, 5.45, and 2.86, respectively, thereby indicating that a larger number of intact LTR retrotransposons had been assembled in the LJ43 genome. We subsequently used LTR-finder to detect intact LTR retrotransposons in the three tea genomes, aligned the 5ʹ and 3ʹ terminal repeats using MUSCLE (version 3.8.31), and calculated the Kimura two-parameter distance for each alignment using EMBOSS (version 6.4.0). To calculate the insertion time of each LTR, we used the equation Time = Ks/2μ (μ = 6.5E-9) 26. Unexpectedly, we found that the LTR of LJ43 had accumulated fewer point mutations and obtained calculated peaks of LTR insertion in LJ43, SCZ, and YK10 of 1, 9, and 9 million years ago (mya), respectively (Supplementary Fig.  6). To further investigate this seemingly anomalous pattern, we performed NGS read error correction during genome assembly. Comparison of the genome sequences corrected by PacBio reads and NGS reads revealed that 98.19% of the 5ʹ and 3ʹ terminal IR sequences were corrected by NGS reads of no more than three bases (Supplementary Fig.  6d). Moreover, error correction did not alter the Ks, which ranged from 0.013 (the peak of LJ43) to 0.117 (the peak of SCZ and YK10). Taken together, our analyses indicate that the assembled LJ43 genome is more complete than previously sequenced tea genomes, has a high LAI, and contains more recently derived LTRs, which results in contrasting estimates of LTR insertion time among LJ43, SCZ, and YK10.","['LTR retrotransposons', 'LTR', 'intact LTR', 'total LTRs', 'LTR insertion', 'Supplementary Fig.', 'SCZ', 'LTRs', 'LAI', 'LTR composition']","[LTRs, LJ43, YK10, LJ43, SCZ, YK10, LJ43, LTR-finder, 5ʹ, 3ʹ terminal repeats, μ , LJ43, LJ43, SCZ, 9, NGS, 5ʹ, 3ʹ terminal, LJ43, SCZ, YK10, LJ43, LTRs, LJ43, SCZ, YK10]",[],[],NaN

To overcome the assembly problem caused by the high level of heterozygosity (2.79–3.40%) of the tea plant genome, we generated nonredundant genome sequences using Hifiasm 25 and Purge_Dups 26, yielding a contig-level assembly with a total size of 2.94 Gb. The assembled genome size was consistent with the genome size estimated using flow cytometry (Supplementary Table  2).

A similar level of SV was observed in the three genomes, ranging from 294.08 (9.77%) to 380.32 (12.63%) Mb. The SVs were not evenly distributed across the 15 chromosomes. For instance, chromosome 1 has a high SV frequency and the longest total length, and chromosome 12 has the lowest SV frequency (Fig.  4a). These SVs affected 14,347, 13,119, and 15,222 protein-coding genes in SCZ-Chr, LJ43 and DASZ, respectively, suggesting that the SVs had a large effect on gene function.

These genes were involved in a variety of metabolic pathways in our KEGG analysis (Supplementary Fig.  2), including zeatin biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and diterpenoid biosynthesis, indicating the metabolic differentiation of tea germplasm resources. While HD is suitable for high-aroma oolong tea, SCZ and LJ43 are famous for processing into green tea. We analyzed the SV annotation genes of HD vs. SCZ-chr and HD vs. LJ43 and found that these genes were annotated in many aroma-related pathways (Fig.  4c and Supplementary Fig.  3), which indicated that SVs may affect the high-aroma characteristics of HD.

496,"As a famous high-aroma backbone parent, HD has been used to breed a series of high-quality offspring. Compared with ordinary tea cultivars, the molecular mechanism of high-aroma formation is worthy of in-depth exploration.

TPS is an important enzyme that can catalyze the production of a variety of terpenoids, which are essential for the tea aroma from the substrate.

Classification of other plants showed that TPS-a is mainly composed of sesquiterpene synthases, TPS-b and TPS-g are mainly monoterpene synthases, and TPS-c/e/f include diterpene synthases 33. Our results showed that 27  HDTPSs were highly expressed in at least one tissue (TPM > 10), whereas 12 were expressed in SCZ (Supplementary Table  8). The apical buds and young leaves of tea plants are the major economically important tissues used for processing tea beverages. We further analyzed the expression of  TPS genes in buds and young leaves and discovered that 18  TPSs were highly expressed in HD (TPM > 10) and 10 in SCZ.

However, the TPM values of the apical buds and young leaves of one  HDAFS were 6-fold and 80-fold greater than in SCZ, respectively. The expression of NES of HD in young leaves was nearly 3-fold that of SCZ. In addition, we tested the aroma components of the leaves of HD and SCZ in October. The changes in the marked terpenoids were consistent at the genetic level, except for ( E)-nerolidol, which may be due to the season and the unprocessed state of the tissues (Supplementary Fig.  5).

The CBFs of tea plant were initially identified in the previous draft genome and were found to be rapidly induced by cold stress and to regulate target genes in multiple pathways 41,  42. We are interested in the number of CBF regulatory factors in tea plants, and the recently published chromosome-level genomes of tea plants provide convenience for our identification and comparison. We identified six CBFs in the four tea plant genomes, two more than in  Arabidopsis, which was consistent with previous experimental verification 42. The CBFs of tea plant and  Arabidopsis clustered into different clades, indicating species conservation (Fig.  7a). However, the CBF clades from the four tea germplasms were different, which may be related to the different degrees of cold resistance of various tea plant resources.  Arabidopsis AtCBF1-3 is recognized as an important cascade core that regulates cold acclimation. They are arranged in tandem on chromosome 4 to regulate target genes in response to cold stress through binding G/ACCGAC motifs (Fig.  7b) 40,  43.

By comparing the AP2 DNA-binding domain and two flanking signature sequences of CBFs among HD, DASZ, and  Arabidopsis, we observed that the overall CBF protein sequences were highly conserved, and the similarity reached 89.77% (Fig.  7d). Among them, CBFs from tea plants and  Arabidopsis showed some amino acid differences at multiple positions. Compared with the ancient tea tree, one of the CBF genes (HD.06G0016290) from the elite tea cultivar HD showed amino acid mutations at 8 positions, which may affect its cold response and DNA-binding function.

Furthermore, the level of nudix, which is considered the core enzyme in the initial hydroxylation of phosphate groups, changed significantly in the MeJA-primed samples. In addition, the expression of phosphatases possibly catalyzing a second hydroxylation of phosphate groups (GP, FP, GGP) apparently declined. MeJA priming also changed the levels of key enzymes in the nonmevalonate pathway. Specifically, in the carotenoid metabolism pathway, six key DEPs (zeta-carotene desaturase, ZDS; cytochrome P450-beta-ring hydroxylase, LUT5; carotene epsilon-monooxygenase, LUT1; carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1, CCD1; xanthoxin dehydrogenase, ABA2; and abscisic-aldehyde oxidase, AAO3) were tagged. Two ZDS proteins were identified; one had higher expression levels (1.4 (12 h), 1.7 (24 h), and 1.9 (48 h)), whereas the other had lower levels (0.8 (12 h), 0.9 (24 h), and 0.8 (48 h)), compared to those in the 0 h samples.

To date, the precise biological function remains unclear, and the corresponding enzymatic characterization needs to be performed in subsequent studies.

511,"MeJA priming induced the formation of GLVs from lipids and induced the storage of glycosides of GLVs as precursors. This could be associated with the higher abundance of LOXs (Fig.  2). It can be reasonably inferred that the dramatic decrease in 13S-hydroperoxy-(9 Z,11 E)-octadecadienoic acid (13 S-HpODE) was due to its utilization as a direct precursor for successive C6–C9 GLV biosynthesis. High expression levels of AOS and AOC were involved in the first step of the catalytic conversion of 13S-HpODE to 12-oxophytodienoic acid (12-OPDA). Subsequently, validation of the higher expression levels of both 12-oxophytodienoate reductase (OPR) and acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 (ACAA1) indicated efficient conversion from 12-OPDA to 3-oxo-2-(cis-2’-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoate. This is the first time that this crucial intermediate (3-oxo-2-(cis-2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoate) has been tentatively identified in samples. Interestingly, the intermediate was continuously consumed, which resulted in the formation of a series of JA products. The expression of enoyl-CoA hydratase (MFP2) decreased in the treated samples at 12 h but increased at later time points. We hypothesize that MFP2 acts as a switch controlling JA biosynthesis and is also causally related to the difference observed after the different priming durations. Often, the results after 12 h of priming differ from those after 24 h and 48 h of priming, for instance, the expression levels of HPL and ALDH2. In the case of excess JA accumulation after priming, the expression of MFP2 was inhibited, leading to a slow down of further JA biosynthesis. However, after the conversion of JAs to JA derivatives, MFP2 was re-expressed to maintain its physiological levels. It is important to investigate the identified hydroxylated JAs in MeJA-primed leaves, especially 12-hydroxy- and 4′-hydroxy-JAs, which have been reported to deactivate the JA pathway in tea plants.","['expression levels', 'priming induced', 'induced', 'expression', 'MeJA priming', 'priming', 'levels', 'GLV biosynthesis', 'GLVs', 'conversion']","[GLVs, LOXs, C6–C9 GLV, AOS, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1, ACAA1, 3-oxo-2-(cis-2’-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoate, 3-oxo-2-(cis-2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoate, JA, enoyl-CoA hydratase, MFP2, MFP2, JA, HPL, ALDH2, MFP2, JAs, MFP2, JAs, 4′-hydroxy-JAs]",[],[],NaN

Although significant differences were observed at the metabolomic level, no apparent changes in the expression levels of terpene synthase (TPS) were found in MeJA-primed leaves compared to untreated leaves. A possible explanation might be that these changes occurred earlier after MeJA priming. Interestingly, three nudix enzymes, which possibly catalyze the conversion of GPP to GP, might also be effective in geraniol biosynthesis via phosphatase activity.
