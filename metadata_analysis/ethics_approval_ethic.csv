The outbreak was first prominent in the southern region (Sabha) and then spread to the western and eastern parts of Libya. By 24/12/2020, the reported total number of deaths from COVID-19 reached 1415. There seems to be no published data on the size of the epidemic in Libya. Here, we estimated the number of Libyans exposed to COVID-19 by using a COVID-19 mortality adjusted mathematical model for the spread of infectious diseases. We estimated that 14-20% of the Libyan population have been exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the risk of spread of COVID-19 infections during the coming months is high, and a considerable number of Libyans, particularly the elderly and people with chronic diseases, should be protected against COVID-19 infection.

Informed consent was obtained from all participants included in the study.," Objective:  Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be part of a multisystem small-vessel disorder. Since the kidney and brain share unique susceptibilities to vascular injury, kidney impairment may be predictive of the presence and severity of CSVD. This study explored the relationship between CSVD and CKD.  Methods:  Between December 2015 and December 2017 (follow-up 10-20 months) 52 patients with chronic nephritis and CKD were classified into a progressive group ( n  = 17) and stable group ( n  = 35). Age, gender, hypertension, diabetes and smoking were matched between groups. CSVD features of both groups, including enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces (VRS), white matter lesions (WML), lacunar infarcts (LI), and cerebral microbleeds (CMB) were evaluated by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.  Results:  WML and CMB in the progressive group were exacerbated at follow-up compared to initial exam ( p  = 0.004 and 0.041, respectively). There was no significant change in VRS, WML, LI, or CMB in the stable group at follow-up compared to initial exam. CMB were significantly different between the progressive group and stable group at follow-up.etimtaed Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly correlated with VRS, WML, and CMB at follow-up ( p  = 0.037, 0.041, and 0.009, respectively).  Conclusions:  Patients with progressive CKD have a higher prevalence and severity of CSVD, which correlates with deterioration of renal function as assessed by decreased eGFR. Thus EGFR may also be of value in the prediction of cerebral small vessel disease.","['MRI', 'glomerular filtration rate', 'Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Cerebral Small Vessel Disease', 'Virchow-robin Spaces']","['Ethics Review', 'Review Board', 'Board approval', 'Ethical approval', 'approval number', 'Ethics', 'Review', 'Board', 'Ethical', 'number']",['YS-2016-109.']

Many differences in academic performance have been associated with the sex of the student.  Objectives : This study aims to understand the impact of absenteeism on the final grades earned by full-time medical laboratory sciences undergraduate students and whether this is affected by sex. Academic performance was analyzed using students' final grades from two consecutive semesters (January to April and September to December 2019). The differences between male (n = 43) and female (n = 72) students were evaluated by Pearson's correlation. During the semester, all teaching and assessment methods were standardized across both course sections to avoid confounding effects derived from the teaching method. Academic performance was assessed both objectively (multiple-choice questions) and subjectively (short essay questions). The mean scores of male and female students during two semesters were significantly different (p = 0.0180). To correlate marks with absenteeism, the correlation coefficient (r) was negative, which indicates an inverse correlation between absence rate and scores. Interestingly, a statistically significant correlation between absenteeism and final grades was found in the male sample population (p = 0.0011 for the first semester; p = 0.0255 for the second semester) that was not observed for their female counterparts (p = 0.2041; p = 0.1537). The results indicate that academic performance among women is not solely dependent on class attendance but likely involves other factors such as self-learning, and group discussion. The mean scores of female medical sciences students were significantly higher than the male students for two consecutive semesters. Male overall scores seem to be conditional on the instructor's explanation. This sex-based variation in academic performance revealed by taking absenteeism rate into account warrant further investigation.","['Sex', 'Grade', 'Absenteeism', 'Academic Performance', 'Self-learning']","['King Khalid', 'Khalid University', 'University Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'approval number', 'sensitive data', 'personal information', 'Ethics approval', 'ECM', 'Ethical Committee']","['ECM#2020-183–(HAPO-06-B-001),', 'ECM#2020-183–(HAPO-06-B-001)']"

In January of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic owing to its global spread. Because no studies have investigated COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, this study investigated similarities and differences between demographic data during the COVID-19 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective trend analysis was performed to assess demographic data of all laboratory-confirmed MERS and COVID-19 cases. Patients' charts were reviewed for data on demographics, mortality, citizenship, sex ratio, and age groups with descriptive and comparative statistics; the data were analyzed using a non-parametric binomial test and chi-square test. Of all COVID-19 patients in Saudi Arabia,78%were male patients and 22% were female patients. This proportion of male COVID-19 patients was similar to that of male MERS patients, which also affected male patients more frequently than female patients. The number of COVID-19-positive Saudi cases was lower than that of non-Saudi cases, which were in contrast to that of MERS; COVID-19 appeared to be remarkably similar to MERS with respect to recovered cases. However, the numbers of critical and dead COVID-19 patients have been much lower than those of MERS patients. The largest proportion of COVID-19 and MERS cases (44.05% and 40.8%, respectively) were recorded in the Western region. MERS and COVID-19 exhibited similar threats to the lives of adults and the elderly, despite lower mortality rates during the COVID-19 epidemic.

This paper aims to evaluate the impact of the local and national rules on the trial authorisation process in European and non-European countries. National/local provisions and procedures, number of Ethics Committees and Competent Authorities to be addressed, documentation required, special provisions for the paediatric population, timelines for completing the authorisation process and queries received were collected; compliance with the European provisions were evaluated. Descriptive analysis, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test and General Linear Model analysis were used to determine factors potentially influencing the timelines. The Cluster Analysis procedure was used to identify homogenous groups of cases. Result The authorisation process was completed in 7.7 to 53.8 months in European countries and in 17.1 to 27.1 months in non-European countries. The main factors influencing these timelines were the requests for changes/clarifications in European countries and the different national legislations in non-European countries. Conclusion This work confirms that the procedures and requirements for the clinical trial application of a paediatric trial are different. In the European Union, the timeframes for submission were generally harmonised but longer. In non-European countries, delays were caused by national dispositions but the entire authorisation process resulted faster with less requests from ECs/CAs. The upcoming application of Regulation (EU) 536/2014 is expected to harmonise practices in Europe and possibly outside.

Such effects have been demonstrated across a number of applied settings, including forensic and clinical contexts. Previous research, however, has not quantified the cost of such suboptimal decisions. We assessed the magnitude of the negative consequences of decision fatigue in the finance sector. Using 26 501 credit loan applications evaluated by credit officers of a major bank, we show that in this real-life financial risk-taking context credit loan approvals across the course of a day decreased during midday compared with early or later in the workday, reflecting a preference for the default option. To quantify the economic loss associated with such decision variability, we then modelled the bank's additional credit collection if all decisions had been made during early morning levels of approval. This would have resulted in $509 023 extra revenue for the bank, for one month. Thus, we provide further evidence that is consistent with a pattern of decision fatigue, and that it can have a substantial negative impact in the finance sector that warrants considerations to counteract it.","['Decision Making', 'risk', 'Finance', 'Ego Depletion', 'Decision Fatigue']","['data analysis', 'authors confirm', 'ethical guidelines', 'archival data', 'University', 'Cambridge', 'Ethics', 'analysis', 'authors', 'confirm']",[]

Objective To characterize where drugs were tested for FDA approval and to determine how commonly and quickly these drugs received marketing approval in the countries where they were tested, both overall and by country income level and geographical region. Design, setting, and participants This cross-sectional analysis of trials supporting FDA approval of novel drugs in 2012 and 2014, sponsored by large drug companies, did not involve human participants. The settings were the countries hosting trials supporting US drug approval. Data sources included Drugs@FDA, ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and drug regulatory agency websites. Data analysis was completed March through September 2020. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcomes were the proportion of drugs approved for marketing in the countries where they were tested for FDA approval within 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of FDA approval and the proportion of countries contributing participants to trials supporting FDA approvals receiving market access to the drugs they helped test within 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of FDA approval. Results In 2012 and 2014, the FDA approved 34 novel drugs sponsored by large companies, on the basis of a total of 898 trials, 563 of which had location information available. Each drug was tested in a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 25 (18-37) unique countries, including a median (IQR) of 20 (13-25) high-income countries, 6 (4-11) upper-middle-income countries, and 1 (0-2) low-middle-income country. One drug was approved for marketing in all testing countries within 1 year of FDA approval and 15% (5 of 34 drugs) were approved in all testing countries within 5 years of FDA approval. Of the 70 countries contributing research participants for FDA drug approvals, 7% (5 countries) received market access to drugs they helped test within 1 year of FDA approval and 31% (22 countries) did so within 5 years. Access within 1 year occurred in 13% (5 of 39) of high-income countries, 0 of 22 upper-middle-income countries (0%), and 0 of 9 lower-middle-income countries (0%), whereas at 5 years access rates were 46% (18 of 39 countries), 9% (2 of 22 countries), and 22% (2 of 9 countries), respectively. Approvals were faster in high-income countries (median [IQR], 8 [0-11] months) than in upper-middle-income countries (median [IQR], 11 [5-29] months) or lower-middle-income countries (median [IQR], 17 [11-27] months) after FDA approval.

Premarket approval evaluates high-risk medical devices and requires clinical trials, whereas 510(k) clearance evaluates moderate-risk devices and relies on benchtop (nonclinical and biomechanical) and descriptive data. Existing literature suggests that the clinical trials required by PMA are associated with reduced risk of recall compared with devices granted 510(k) clearance. Several investigators have found weaknesses in pivotal PMA trials, raising safety concerns. Furthermore, methodological factors may have led to a previous underestimation of recall risk for devices with PMA. Objectives To compare risk of recall and high-risk recall between devices that received 510(k) clearance and those that received PMA and to compare the risk of recall between devices for medical specialties. Design, setting, and participants This cohort study compared devices with 510(k) clearance vs those with PMA that reached the market between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2017. Two- to 12-year follow-up was obtained from the FDA's 510(k) and PMA medical device database. Orthopedic surgery was chosen arbitrarily as the reference category for analysis between specialties because no baseline exists. Statistical analysis was performed from February 1 to November 1, 2020. Main outcomes and measures The FDA issues recalls for safety concerns. These recalls are stratified into class I, II, and III, with class I representing high-risk issues for serious harm or death. The main outcome was the hazard ratio of any recall and class I recall between devices with PMA and those with 510(k) clearance. The secondary outcome was the recall hazard ratio between specialties with respect to the reference category. A single Cox proportional hazards regression model evaluating the association of medical specialty and FDA approval pathway with the risk of recall was performed. Results During the study period, 28 246 devices received 510(k) clearance and 310 devices (10.7%) received PMA; 3012 devices (10.7%) with 510(k) clearance and 84 devices (27.1%) with PMA were recalled. A total of 216 devices (0.8%) with 510(k) clearance and 16 devices (5.2%) with PMA had class I recalls.

This prompted us to carry out a thorough immunological study in a patient treated with umbilical cord-derived MSCs and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for COVID-19-related pneumonia. The exploratory analyses were assessed on both peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar fluid lavage samples at baseline and after cellular infusion by means of single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, ELISA, and functional assays. Remarkably, a normalization of circulating T lymphocytes count paralleled by a reduction of inflammatory myeloid cells, and a decrease in serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mostly of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, were observed. In addition, a drop of plasma levels of those chemokines essential for neutrophil recruitment became evident that paralleled the decrease of lung-infiltrating inflammatory neutrophils. Finally, circulating monocytes and low-density gradient neutrophils acquired immunosuppressive function. This scenario was accompanied by an amelioration of respiratory, renal, inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic indexes.

We applied two ESMO-MCBS versions to the last 12 years of European cancer drug approval and compared two predefined marketing authorisation timeframes to identify potential score changes over time. Material and methods Originator solid cancer drugs and indication extensions that were approved between 1 January 2009 and 31 October 2020 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) were included in our analyses. To evaluate the clinical benefit of these cancer indications, the original ESMO-MCBS (v 1.1) and a locally adapted ESMO-MCBS version were applied to the study sample. Thus, two ESMO-MCBS versions were compared, and an additional analysis was conducted to identify potential score differences between two approval timeframes 2009-2014 versus 2015-2020. Results A total of 144 cancer indications intended as curative (n = 9) or non-curative (n = 135) treatment options were eligible for an ESMO-MCBS assessment. Solely a minority of the assessed cancer indications met the meaningful clinical benefit (MCB) criteria independent of the applied version of the scale and treatment intention (original: n = 48/144, 33.3% versus adapted: n = 27/144, 18.8%). Comparing the two EMA approval timeframes, a growing number of approved cancer indications could be observed: 2009-2014: n = 9/year versus 2015-2020: n = 14/year. In addition, almost no difference in the proportion of cancer indications that have met the MCB criteria was detectable when comparing the predefined authorisation timeframes (MCB increase original: +4.1% and adapted: +3.9%). Conclusion Applying both versions of the ESMO-MCBS can help to identify potentially beneficial cancer indications, but also those with rather uncertain or low clinical benefit and thus, support the fair allocation of limited health care resources.","['Clinical Benefit', 'Health Technology Assessment', 'Esmo-mcbs', 'Cancer Drug Approval', 'Evidenced-based Decision Making']",[],[]

Drug developers must receive a designation before they are eligible for the economic incentives of the Orphan Drug Act in the United States. We created a database of all orphan drugs designated between 1983 and 2019 that included numerous drug characteristics, including therapeutic area. In addition, we constructed a ""broad disease"" categorization of designations as an alternative to therapeutic area, based on disease etiology and age of onset rather than organ system. By looking at the pattern of orphan drug designations over the past four decades, this analysis studied the impact of the evolving rare disease drug development landscape and considers the future of rare disease therapies over the coming decades. Results Between 1983 and 2019, a total of 5099 drugs and biologics received orphan drug designation. Designations more than doubled between the 1980s and 1990s, almost doubled between the 1990s and 2000s, and almost tripled in number between the 2000s and 2010s. The top three therapeutic areas represented in the orphan drug designations were: oncology (1910, 37%), neurology (674, 13%), and infectious diseases (436, 9%). The broad disease categorization found that the proportion of designations for pediatric-onset diseases has increased in the most recent decade to 27%. Conclusions Analysis of the last four decades of orphan drug designation indicates seismic shifts have occurred in the rare disease drug development space. The number of designations granted more than quadrupled between the 1990s and 2010s. While these substantial increases led to growth in the absolute number of designations within all therapeutic areas (bar one) and broad disease categories, the relative proportions have seen considerable change over time. In the most recent decade, there have been notable increases in the proportion of drugs in oncology, pediatric-onset diseases, and neurologic disorders.

Objective To characterize pivotal trials supporting recent supplemental new indication approvals of drugs and biologics by the FDA and to compare them with pivotal trials that supported these therapeutics' original indication approvals. Design, setting, and participants This is a cross-sectional study characterizing pivotal trials supporting supplemental indication approvals by the FDA between 2017 and 2019 and pivotal trials that supported these therapeutics' original indication approvals. Data analysis was performed from August to October 2020. Main outcomes and measures Number and design of pivotal trials supporting both supplemental and original indication approvals. Results From 2017 to 2019, the FDA approved 146 supplemental indications for 107 therapeutics on the basis of 181 pivotal efficacy trials. The median (interquartile range) number of trials per supplemental indication was 1 (1-1). Most trials used either placebo (77 trials [42.5%; 95% CI, 35.6%-49.8%]) or active comparators (65 trials [35.9%; 95% CI, 29.3%-43.1%]), and most of these multigroup trials were randomized (141 trials [99.3%; 95% CI, 96.0%-100.0%]) and double-blinded (106 trials [74.5%; 95% CI, 66.6%-81.0%]); 80 trials (44.2%; 95 CI, 37.2%-51.5%) used clinical outcomes as the primary efficacy end point. There was no difference between oncology therapies and those approved for other therapeutic areas to have supplemental indication approvals be based on at least 2 pivotal trials (11.5% vs 20.6%; difference, 9.1%; 95% CI, 2.9%-21.0%; P = .10).

Social and behavior change (SBC) programs often try to shift drivers of high fertility through multiple channels including mass and social media, as well as community-level group, and interpersonal activities. This study seeks to assist SBC programs to better tailor their efforts by assessing the effects of intermediate determinants of contraceptive use/uptake and by demonstrating their potential impacts on contraceptive use, interpersonal communication with partners, and contraceptive approval. Methods Data for this study come from a cross-sectional household survey, conducted in the states of Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara in northwestern Nigeria in September 2019, involving 3000 women aged 15 to 49 years with a child under 2 years. Using an ideational framework of behavior that highlights psychosocial influences, mixed effects logistic regression analyses assess associations between ideational factors and family planning outcomes, and post-estimation simulations with regression coefficients model the magnitude of effects for these intermediate determinants. Results Knowledge, approval of family planning, and social influences, particularly from husbands, were all associated with improved family planning outcomes. Approval of family planning was critical - women who personally approve of family planning were nearly three times more likely to be currently using modern contraception and nearly six times more likely to intend to start use in the next 6 m. Husband's influence was also critical. Women who had ever talked about family planning with their husbands were three times more likely both to be currently using modern contraception and to intend to start in the next 6 m. Conclusion SBC programs interested in improving family planning outcomes could potentially achieve large gains in contraceptive use-even without large-scale changes in socio-economic and health services factors-by designing and implementing effective SBC interventions that improve knowledge, encourage spousal/partner communication, and work towards increasing personal approval of family planning. Uncertainty about the time-order of influencers and outcomes however precludes inferences about the existence of causal relationships and the potential for impact from interventions.","['Nigeria', 'Family Planning', 'Social And Behavior Change']",[],[]

Devices indicated for the pediatric population that use the PMA pathway have not been well characterized or analyzed. Objective To identify and characterize high-risk devices with pediatric age indications derived from PMA statements. Design, setting, and participants In this cross-sectional study of PMA statements, those statements containing the words indicated or intended for medical devices listed in the FDA PMA database as of February 2020 were retrieved. Age indications were manually annotated in these approval statements via PubAnnotation. Based on the PMA identification from the PMA statements, device metadata including product codes, regulation numbers, advisory panels, and approval dates were queried. Main outcomes and measures The main outcome was discernment of the distribution of devices indicated for the pediatric population (neonate, infant, child, and adolescent). Secondary measures included outlining the clinical specialties, device types, and lag time between the initial approval date and the first date of an approval statement with a pediatric indication for generic device categories. Results A total of 297 documents for 149 unique devices were analyzed. Based on the manual age annotations, 102 devices with a pediatric indication, 10 with a neonate age indication, 32 with an infant age indication, 60 with a child age indication, and 94 with an adolescent age indication were identified. For indications for patients from age 17 to 18 years, the number of devices available nearly doubled from 42 devices to 81 devices. Although more than half of the surveyed devices had a pediatric age indication, many were available only for a limited range of the pediatric population (age 18-21 years). For indications for patients from age 0 to 17 years, the mean (SD) number of clinical specialties at each age was 7.27 (1.4), and 12 clinical specialties were represented from ages 18 to 21 years. Conclusions and relevance In this cross-sectional study on device PMA statements, a gap was identified in both quantity and diversity of high-risk devices indicated for the pediatric population.

An informed consent form was obtained from each participant who agreed to participate in completing the questionnaire.," Background With the magnitude and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the usual face-to-face consultation within a clinical setting is no longer feasible. Thus, this led to the need for alternate means to provide adequate patient care for surgical patients. This is where the role of smartphones comes into play, in which it is thus of paramount importance. This research study aimed to assess the usefulness of smartphones in surgical practice during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study is based on a questionnaire distributed among surgeons in different levels of practice working at Kuwait governmental hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was developed via Google Docs to collect data for the current study. Results Out of 600 surgeons, 180 have responded to the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 30%. Of these, 42.8%, 85.5%, and 58.9% were aged between 35 and 44 years, were male, and Kuwaiti nationals, respectively. Almost all of the respondents (99.5%) were using smartphones for hospital-related work. The most common uses of the smartphones involved texting (70%), and viewing or taking images and videos using built-in cameras (60%) either in the emergency department, outpatient clinics, wards, or operating rooms. The majority of the respondents (88%) rated the use of smartphones in practice as important. Conclusion This study revealed that using smartphones in surgical practice was prevalent among the respondent surgeons in Kuwait during the pandemic. The majority of them considered using smartphones in practice to be important, due to its benefits in facilitating doctor-doctor and patient-doctor communication, reviewing the literature, and making clinical decisions.

The vast amount of scientific literature makes it impossible for researchers and physicians to extract all relevant information manually. Methods In order to cope with the large amount of literature we applied an automated text mining approach to assess the relations between 30 most frequent cancer types and 270 anti-cancer drugs. We applied two different approaches, a classical text mining based on named entity recognition and an AI-based approach employing word embeddings. The consistency of literature mining results was validated with 3 independent methods: first, using data from FDA approvals, second, using experimentally measured IC-50 cell line data and third, using clinical patient survival data. Results We demonstrated that the automated text mining was able to successfully assess the relation between cancer types and anti-cancer drugs. All validation methods showed a good correspondence between the results from literature mining and independent confirmatory approaches. The relation between most frequent cancer types and drugs employed for their treatment were visualized in a large heatmap. All results are accessible in an interactive web-based knowledge base using the following link: https://knowledgebase.microdiscovery.de/heatmap . Conclusions Our approach is able to assess the relations between compounds and cancer types in an automated manner. Both, cancer types and compounds could be grouped into different clusters.

Our objective was to describe state variation in the effect of initial social distancing policies and non-essential business (NEB) closure on infection rates early in 2020. Methods We used an interrupted time series study design to estimate the total effect of all state social distancing orders, including NEB closure, shelter-in-place, and stay-at-home orders, on cumulative COVID-19 cases for each state. Data included the daily number of COVID-19 cases and deaths for all 50 states and Washington, DC from the New York Times database (January 21 to May 7, 2020). We predicted cumulative daily cases and deaths using a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution and a log link for two models. Results Social distancing was associated with a 15.4% daily reduction (Relative Risk = 0.846; Confidence Interval [CI] = 0.832, 0.859) in COVID-19 cases. After 3 weeks, social distancing prevented nearly 33 million cases nationwide, with about half (16.5 million) of those prevented cases among residents of the Mid-Atlantic census division (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania). Eleven states prevented more than 10,000 cases per 100,000 residents within 3 weeks.

The use of intraoperative lung protective ventilation (LPV) strategies, usually including the use of a low V t , low PEEP and low plateau pressure, seem to reduce the risk of PPC and are strongly recommended in almost all surgical procedures. Nonetheless, feasibility of LPV strategies in neurosurgical patients are still debated because the use of low Vt during LPV might result in hypercapnia with detrimental effects on cerebrovascular physiology. Aim of our study was to determine whether LPV strategies would be feasible compared with a control group in adult patients undergoing cranial or spinal surgery. Methods This single-centre, pilot randomized clinical trial was conducted at the University Hospital ""Maggiore della Carità"" (Novara, Italy). Adult patients undergoing major cerebral or spinal neurosurgical interventions with risk index for pulmonary post-operative complications > 2 and not expected to need post-operative intensive care unit (ICU) admission were considered eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to either LPV (Vt = 6 ml/kg of ideal body weight (IBW), respiratory rate initially set at 16 breaths/min, PEEP at 5 cmH2O and application of a recruitment manoeuvre (RM) immediately after intubation and at every disconnection from the ventilator) or control treatment (Vt = 10 ml/kg of IBW, respiratory rate initially set at 6-8 breaths/min, no PEEP and no RM). Primary outcomes of the study were intraoperative adverse events, the level of cerebral tension at dura opening and the intraoperative control of PaCO 2.  Secondary outcomes were the rate of pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications, the number of unplanned ICU admissions, ICU and hospital lengths of stay and mortality. Results A total of 60 patients, 30 for each group, were randomized. During brain surgery, the number of episodes of intraoperative hypercapnia and grade of cerebral tension were similar between patients randomized to receive control or LPV strategies. No difference in the rate of intraoperative adverse events was found between groups. The rate of postoperative pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications and major clinical outcomes were similar between groups. Conclusions LPV strategies in patients undergoing major neurosurgical intervention are feasible. Larger clinical trials are needed to assess their role in postoperative clinical outcome improvements.

It also looks at whether various factors explain the time between patent application to New Drug Submission (NDS) and compares Canadian and American times. Drugs approved between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2018 are examined. Design Descriptive study. Data sources Websites from Health Canada, Food and Drug Administration, Merck Index, United States Patent and Trademark Office, WHO and previously published articles. Interventions None. Primary and secondary outcomes The primary outcomes are time to market, time from patent application to NDS (pre-NDS time), review time, time from approval to availability (postapproval time) and factors that may influence the pre-NDS time. The secondary outcome is a comparison of Canadian and American review times and times between patent application and approval. Results There were 113 drugs available for analysis. The median time to market was 11.80 years (IQR 9.40-14.05). The component median times were pre-NDS 10 years (IQR 8.05-12.80), review time 0.96 years (IQR 0.75-1.15) and postapproval time 0.15 years (IQR 0.08-0.28). Less than 8% of the pre-NDS time was explained by the factors that were analysed in a multiple linear regression equation.

Of 199 approvals, 159 (80%) were supported by at least one RCT, 63 (32%) by at least one RCT having OS as the primary or co-primary endpoint, 74 (37%) by at least one blinded RCT, and 30 (15%) by at least one blinded RCT having OS as the primary or co-primary endpoint. Whereas 40 approvals (20%) were not supported by any RCT and, of those, 9 (22%) were followed by a post-approval RCT. While the majority of approvals of cancer medicines approved by EMA was supported by at least one RCT, we noted substantial methodological heterogeneity of the studies.

Robotic surgery within spatially-constrained workspaces in children makes traditional platforms less translatable. Da Vinci's newest single port (SP) robotic platform provides narrow, and deep access, making pediatric robotic surgery more feasible. Case presentation A five-year old female presented with hepatosplenomegaly due to hemolytic anemia from pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD). When she progressed to requiring monthly transfusions, a splenectomy was performed to avoid the complications associated with frequent blood transfusions. The robotic approach was used to remove the intact spleen because traditional minimally invasive surgery can result in post-operative splenosis. Discussion The patient successfully underwent single-port, robotic splenectomy - the first known splenectomy in a child using this approach. Furthermore, during the operation an accessory spleen was encountered in the omentum and was also successfully removed robotically. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Conclusion This case demonstrates that the SP robot can be used for splenectomy to eliminate the risk of splenosis and achieve a superior cosmetic result.","['Splenectomy', 'Pediatric', 'Case Report', 'Da Vinci', 'Robotic', 'Single Port']","['require ethical', 'Ethical approval', 'studies involving', 'involving patients', 'patients require', 'approval', 'Research studies', 'Ethical', 'Review Board', 'Chicago Institutional']","['for', 'is']"

We aimed to determine whether causes of suboptimal cancer treatment prescriptions differed between periods of stockout and full treatment supply. Design A retrospective cohort study of systemic therapy prescriptions for patients diagnosed with the twelve most common solid tumour cancers treated in 2016. Setting Princess Marina Hospital in Gaborone, Botswana. Participants Patients in the retrospective cohort who experienced any suboptimal treatment events, defined as ≥7 days delay or switch from guideline-concordant initiated therapy. Primary and secondary outcome measures Frequency of delays and patterns of prescription changes for specific regimens and cancer types. Results 167/378 patients contributed to 320 suboptimal events (115 therapy switches, 167 delays and 38 events with both), over 1452 total chemotherapy cycles received. Events during stockout were 43% delays, 43% switches and 14% both during stockout periods and 67.2% delays, 24.4% switches and 8.4% both during non-stockout periods (p Conclusions The aetiology of suboptimal events differed during stockout and non-stockout periods. Prescription patterns that involved de-escalation of initiated therapy and substitution of paclitaxel with docetaxel occurred frequently during periods of drug stockout.

In recent years, most Latin American (LA) countries have reformed their marketing authorization (MA) rules to directly accept or abbreviate the approval process in case of earlier authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration, mainly. This study assessed the potential impact of decisions taken by EMA regarding the approval of new cancer drugs based on no evidence of overall survival or in potentially biased clinical trials in LA countries. Design Descriptive analysis. Setting Publicly accessible marketing authorization databases from LA regulators, European Public Assessment Report by EMA, and previous studies accessing EMA approvals of new cancer drugs 2009-2016. Main outcome and measures Number of new cancer drugs approved by LA countries without evidence of overall survival (2009-2013), and without at least one clinical trial scored at low risk of bias, or with no trial supporting the marketing authorization at all (2014-2016). Results Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru have publicly accessible and trustful MA databases and were included. Of the 17 cancer drugs approved by EMA (2009-2013) without evidence of OS benefit after a postmarketing median time of 5.4 years, 6 LA regulators approved more than 70% of them. Of the 13 drugs approved by EMA (2014-2016), either without supporting trial or with no trial at low risk of bias, Brazil approved 11, Chile 10, Peru 10, Argentina 10, Colombia 9, Ecuador 9, and Panama 8. Conclusions LA countries keep approving new cancer drugs often based on poorly performed clinical trials measuring surrogate endpoints.

Despite an extensive literature on the topic of peer review and publications on criteria by which clinical investigations are reviewed, publications analyzing peer review and other processes leading to government funding decisions on large multi-site clinical trials proposals are sparse. To partially address this gap, we reviewed the outcomes of scientific and programmatic evaluation for all letters of intent (LOIs) received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) between July 4, 2008, and November 28, 2016. If accepted, these LOIs represented initial steps towards later full proposals that also underwent scientific peer review. Twenty-two of 87 LOIs were ultimately funded and executed as CSP projects, for an overall success rate of 25%. Most proposals which received a negative decision did so prior to submission of a full proposal. Common reasons for negative scientific review of LOIs included investigator inexperience, perceived lack of major scientific impact, lack of preliminary data and flawed or confused experimental design, while the most common reasons for negative reviews of final proposals included questions of scientific impact and issues of study design, including outcome measures, randomization, and stratification. Completed projects have been published in high impact clinical journals. Findings highlight several factors leading to successfully obtaining funding support for clinical trials.

Regulators have increasingly emphasized lifecycle evaluation of approved therapeutics, and postmarketing studies are intended to advance our understanding of therapeutic safety and efficacy. However, little is known about the indications that clinical studies outlined in postmarketing requirements and commitments investigate, including whether they are intended to generate evidence for approved or other clinical indications. Therefore, we characterized US Food and Drug Administration postmarketing requirements and commitments for new therapeutics approved from 2009 to 2018. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of all novel therapeutics, including small-molecule drugs and biologics, receiving original US Food and Drug Administration approval from 2009 to 2018, using approval letters accessed through the Drug@FDA database. Outcomes included the number and characteristics of US Food and Drug Administration postmarketing requirements and commitments for new therapeutics at original approval, including the types of studies outlined, the indications to be investigated, and the clinical evidence to be generated. Results From 2009 to 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration approved 343 new therapeutics with 1978 postmarketing requirements and commitments. Overall, 750 (37.9%) postmarketing requirements and commitments outlined clinical studies. For 71 of 343 (20.7%) therapeutics, no postmarketing requirements or commitments for clinical studies were outlined, while at least 1 was outlined for 272 (79.3%; median 2 (interquartile range: 1-4)). Among these 272 therapeutics, the number of postmarketing requirements and commitments for clinical studies per therapeutic did not change from 2009 (median: 2 (interquartile range: 1-4)) to 2018 (median: 2 (interquartile range: 1-3)). Among the 750 postmarketing requirements and commitments for clinical studies, 448 (59.7%) outlined new prospective cohort studies, registries, or clinical trials, while the remainder outlined retrospective studies, secondary analyses, or completion of ongoing studies. Although 455 (60.7%) clinical studies investigated only original approved therapeutic indications, 123 (16.4%) enrolled from an expansion of the approved disease population and 61 (8.1%) investigated diseases unrelated to approved indications. Conclusions The US Food and Drug Administration approves most new therapeutics with at least 1 postmarketing requirement or commitment for a clinical study, and outlines investigations of safety or efficacy for both approved and unapproved indications. The median number of 2 clinical studies outlined has remained relatively constant over the last decade. Given increasing emphasis by the US Food and Drug Administration on faster approval and lifecycle evaluation of therapeutics, these findings suggest that more postmarketing requirements and commitments may be necessary to address gaps in the clinical evidence available for therapeutics at approval.","['Clinical evidence', 'Clinical Trials', 'Pharmaceutical Regulation', 'The Us Food And Drug Administration', 'Postmarketing Requirements', 'Postmarketing Commitments']",[],[]

However, the biosimilar industry faces multiple challenges and obstacles in developing and marketing these complex products. Divergent regulatory framework in emerging countries adds to repetitive trials and increased cost of biosimilar development, delaying the approval process. Due to such roadblocks, healthcare systems and patients are yet to realize the full benefits of biosimilars. Objectives The aim of this exploratory study was to specifically identify the challenges faced by the industry in emerging countries including Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Turkey and Mexico (BRICS-TM), pertaining to biosimilar development and the regulatory approval process. In particular, this study aims to understand the perceptions of industry on the barriers faced by them in terms of complexity, costs for biosimilar development and time-to-market for biosimilar product. Methods A semi-quantitative questionnaire was designed based on secondary research. A total of 93 industry personnel and representatives from 14 trade associations from the BRICS-TM countries with 15-year minimum experience were identified and invited to take part in the study and participate in interviews, which were recorded verbatim. Data processing and analysis was carried out; descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data and content analysis was employed to generate themes for qualitative data. Results Of the 107 biopharmaceutical industry and trade association representatives invited to participate in the study, respondents from 33 biopharmaceutical companies agreed to take part and underwent the interviews. The industry personnel perceived biosimilar guidelines and approval processes as being protracted and in a state of evolution. The absence of an abridged approval pathway limited effectiveness of the regulatory process. The biggest hurdles in the development of biosimilar dossiers were the sourcing of the reference biological product and expectations around confirmatory clinical trials by the agencies. The non-comprehensive implementation of a stepwise approach resulting in unnecessary toxicity studies was also reported as a major challenge. The authors recommend further primary research with BRICS-TM regulatory agencies in order to propose a simplified pathway for development and approval. Conclusions Lack of standardized biosimilar development criteria and regulatory convergence across BRICS-TM agencies has led to challenges in multi-country development programmes for these medicines, in turn impacting the ability of industry to launch newer and more affordable biosimilars.",NaN,"['Technology ECDA', 'Ethics Approval', 'Science', 'Health', 'Engineering', 'ECDA', 'University', 'Hertfordshire', 'Approval', 'Technology']",['for']

We also found a mediation effect in the impact of narcissism on happiness through gaming disorder. According to the results, we think that the problem is not caused by the individual but by society. For a solution, we recommend making more macro-level social work interventions within the framework of system theory instead of the current medical model in combating gaming disorder.","['Happiness', 'Narcissism', 'Compensation Theory', 'Gaming Disorder']",[],[]

However, it is preventable, and hospitals can decrease VAP rates. This study aims to retrospectively assess VAP rates in the intensive care unit of Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital of the University of Health Sciences, with reference to  Acinetobacter baumannii , one of the causative organisms. Methods This study enrolled a total of 2277 patients hospitalized between the years of 2011 and 2015. The required data were collected by reviewing medical files of the patients through computerized hospital databases. VAP rate and ventilator utilization (VU) ratio were calculated using the United States Center for Disease Control National Healthcare Safety Network methodology. Results Of the study patients, 302 (13.26%) were seen to have developed VAP. Among these patients, 191 (63.25%) were microbiologically diagnosed VAP caused by  A. baumannii . Pooled means of VU ratio and VAP rate were 0.70 and 22.91, respectively. Conclusion The results of this study will motivate the infection control committee of the study hospital to assess current infection control program and strategies so that high VAP rate in the study intensive care unit can be reduced to the minimum possible level.","['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Ventilator-associated pneumonia', 'intensive care unit', 'Oncology Hospital']",[],[]

CRERC 2026) in Tanzania; University of Malawi College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee (COMREC) in Malawi; and University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee (UNZABREC) and National Health Research Authority (NHRA) in Zambia. Informed consents were obtained verbally from interview respondents.," Background An estimated nine out of ten persons in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are unable to access timely, safe and affordable surgery. District hospitals (DHs) which are strategically located to provide basic (non-specialist) surgical care for rural populations have in many instances been compromised by resource inadequacies, resulting in unduly frequent patient referrals to specialist hospitals. This study aimed to quantify the financial burdens of surgical ambulance referrals on DHs and explore the coping strategies employed by these facilities in navigating the challenges. Methods We employed a multi-methods descriptive case study approach, across a total of 14 purposively selected DHs; seven, three, and four in Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia, respectively. Three recurrent cost elements were identified: fuel, ambulance maintenance and staff allowances. Qualitative data related to coping mechanisms were obtained through in-depth interviews of hospital managers while quantitative data related to costs of surgical referrals were obtained from existing records (such as referral registers, ward registers, annual financial reports, and other administrative records) and expert estimates. Interview notes were analysed by manual thematic coding while referral statistics and finance data were processed and analysed using Microsoft Office Excel 2016. Results At all but one of the hospitals, respondents reported inadequacies in numbers and functional states of the ambulances: four centres indicated employing non-ambulance vehicles to convey patients occassionally. No statistically significant correlation was found between referral trip distances and total annual numbers of referral trips, but hospital managers reported considering costs in referral practices. For instance, ten of the study hospitals reported combining patients to minimize trip frequencies. The total cost of ambulance use for patient transportation ranged from I$2 k to I$58 k per year. Between 34% and 79% of all patient referrals were surgical, with total costs ranging from I$1 k to I$32 k per year. Conclusion Cost considerations strongly influence referral decisions and practices, indicating a need for increases in budgetary allocations for referral services. High volumes of potentially avoidable surgical referrals provide an economic case - besides equitable access to healthcare - for scaling up surgery capacity at the district level as savings from decreased referrals could be reinvested in referral systems strengthening.","['Costs', 'Sub-Saharan Africa', 'Ambulance', 'District Hospital', 'Global Surgery', 'Referral Systems']","['National Institute', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethical considerations', 'NIMR', 'Christian Medical', 'Medical Research', 'Medical College', 'Kilimanjaro Christian', 'Research', 'Research Authority']","['NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol.', 'CRERC']"

Considering the role of CSNK2A1 in cancer progression and the phosphorylation of SIRT6 and the role of SIRT6 in chemoresistance through the DNA damage repair pathway, CSNK2A1 and SIRT6 might be involved in resistance to conventional anti-cancer therapies. We evaluated the expression of CSNK2A1 and phosphorylated SIRT6 in the 37 osteosarcoma patients and investigated the effects of CSNK2A1 and the phosphorylation of SIRT6 on Ser338 on resistance to the anti-cancer effects of doxorubicin. Higher expression of CSNK2A1 and phosphorylated SIRT6 was associated with shorter survival in osteosarcoma patients. U2OS and KHOS/NP osteosarcoma cells with induced overexpression of CSNK2A1 were resistant to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin, and the knock-down of CSNK2A1 potentiated the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin. CSNK2A1 overexpression-mediated resistance to doxorubicin was associated with SIRT6 phosphorylation and the induction of the DNA damage repair pathway molecules. CSNK2A1- and SIRT6-mediated resistance to doxorubicin in vivo was attenuated via mutation of SIRT6 at the Ser338 phosphorylation site. Emodin, a CSNK2A1 inhibitor, potentiated the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in osteosarcoma cells. This study suggests that blocking the CSNK2A1-SIRT6-DNA damage repair pathway might be a new therapeutic stratagem for osteosarcomas.","['DNA damage', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Prognosis', 'doxorubicin', 'Sirt6', 'Csnk2a1']",[],[]

First, we set the following three parameters to observe cases: (i) the FDA regulatory reforms, (ii) early application of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), to both research and clinical settings, and (iii) accumulation of open data. Then, we performed a comparative analysis of MSK-IMPACT with FoundationOne CDx and Oncomine Dx Target Test, both of which were FDA-approved tumor profiling tests launched in 2017. As a result, we found that MSK-IMPACT secures neutrality as a non-profit organization, achieves the active incorporation of basic research results, and performs superiorly in clinical operations, such as patient enrollment. On the contrary, we confirmed that FoundationOne CDx was the most prominent case in terms of the number of new drugs and expanded indications approved in which the FDA's expedited approval programs were considerably utilized. Consequently, to uncover the full potential of MSK-IMPACT, it is suggested that more intersectoral collaborative activities between various healthcare stakeholders, in particular, pharmaceutical companies, for driving clinical development must be carried out based on an organizational framework that facilitates collaboration.","['Open Data', 'Next-generation Sequencing (Ngs)', 'New Drug Development', 'Regulatory Reform', 'Tumor Profiling Test']",[],[]

The acceleration in vaccine development required to combat the current pandemic is not at the expense of the necessary regulatory requirements, including robust and comprehensive data collection along with clinical product safety and efficacy evaluation. Due to the previous development of vaccine candidates against the related highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the antigen that elicits immune protection is known: the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or specific domains encoded in that protein, e.g., the receptor binding domain. From a scientific point of view and in accordance with legal frameworks and regulatory practices, for the approval of a clinic trial, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut requires preclinical testing of vaccine candidates, including general pharmacology and toxicology as well as immunogenicity. For COVID-19 vaccine candidates, based on existing platform technologies with a sufficiently broad data base, pharmacological-toxicological testing in the case of repeated administration, quantifying systemic distribution, and proof of vaccination protection in animal models can be carried out in parallel to phase 1 or 1/2 clinical trials. To reduce the theoretical risk of an increased respiratory illness through infection-enhancing antibodies or as a result of Th2 polarization and altered cytokine profiles of the immune response following vaccination, which are of specific concern for COVID-19 vaccines, appropriate investigative testing is imperative. In general, phase 1 (vaccine safety) and 2 (dose finding, vaccination schedule) clinical trials can be combined, and combined phase 2/3 trials are recommended to determine safety and efficacy.

Existing treatments are only indicated in severe ROP cases due to the high invasiveness and the potential risk of irreversible side effects. We previously elucidated that ripasudil, a selective inhibitor of the Rho-associated protein kinase, has the ability to inhibit abnormal retinal neovascularisation in animal models. In addition, ripasudil eye drops (Glanatec ophthalmic solution 0.4%) have been already used for the treatment of glaucoma. Since eye drop therapy is less invasive, early intervention for ROP is possible. The purpose of this phase I/II trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ripasudil eye drops for preterm infants with ROP. Methods and analysis This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm phase I/II trial. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ripasudil as much as possible, ripasudil will be administered to all enrolled preterm infants with zone I/II, stage 1, or worse ROP. The safety and efficacy of ripasudil in treated patients will be assessed in comparison to a historical control group. Because this is the first trial of ripasudil in preterm infants, a dose-escalation study (once daily for 1 week, then two times per day for 2 weeks) will be conducted in phase I. After obtaining approval from the independent data and safety monitoring board to continue the trial after the completion of phase I, phase II will be conducted. In phase II, ripasudil eye drops will be administered two times per day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint in phase II is also safety. Efficacy and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated as secondary endpoints.

Although they represent 10-15% of all pituitary tumors, only a small fraction of plurihormonal pituitary adenomas clinically secrete multiple hormones. The most common hormone combinations secreted by plurihormonal pituitary adenomas are growth hormone, prolactin, and one or more glycoprotein hormones. The most common hormonal symptom is acromegaly (50%). The aim of this case report is to bring awareness about this rare type of pituitary adenomas and to describe the unique presentation of our patient, even though plurihormonal pituitary adenomas are known mostly as a clinically silent tumors. Case presentation Herein, we describe an unusual case of plurihormonal pituitary adenoma with triple-positive staining for adrenocorticotropic hormone, growth hormone, and prolactin. The patient is a 65-year-old Egyptian woman who presented with mass effect symptoms of the pituitary tumor, which primarily manifested as severe headache and visual field defects. She also presented with some cushingoid features, and further analysis confirmed Cushing's disease; slightly high prolactin and normal growth hormone levels were observed. She underwent transsphenoidal surgery and has been in remission thus far. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature, but none has exhibited silent acromegaly or mass effect symptoms as the initial presentation. Conclusion This case highlights an unusual plurihormonal pituitary adenoma case with a rare combination of secreted hormones; mass effect symptoms were dominant, as were uncommon visual field defects.

Methods Patients treated after cf-LVAD implantation from December 2014 to January 2020 were enrolled. Baseline data were collected and potential risk factors were elaborated. The multi-modal treatment was based on antibiotic therapy, daily wound care, surgical driveline reposition, and heart transplantation. Time of infection development, freedom of reinfection, freedom of heart transplantation, and death in the follow-up time were investigated. Results Of 75 observed patients, 26 (34.7%) developed a driveline infection. The mean time from implantation to infection diagnosis was 463 (±399; range, 35-1400) days. The most common pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (n = 15, 60%). First-line therapy was based on antibiotics, with a primary success rate of 27%.

Surgical driveline reposition is a reasonable treatment option and does not preclude subsequent heart transplantation due to limited reinfection freedom.","['Left Ventricular Assist Device', 'Driveline Infection', 'Surgical Reposition']",[],[]

The article is exempt from ethical committee approval because no change has been made in terms of standard operative technique and perioperative management.,"The aim of this study is to report the reallocation of carotid surgery activity with the support of telemedicine in a COVID-free clinic during COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis or asymptomatic vulnerable plaques were reallocated to a COVID-free private clinic which began to cooperate with the National Health System during the emergency. Quick training of staff nurses was performed. Surgeons moved to the COVID-19 free clinic. Remote cerebral monitoring was performed with the support of telemedicine. Twenty-four patients underwent standard carotid endarterectomy with eversion technique. Five patients (20.8%) had recently symptomatic stenosis, and the remaining 19 patients (79.2%) had a risky asymptomatic carotid stenosis. No technical issue with remote cerebral monitoring was detected. In the early postoperative period, no neurological/systemic complication was observed. Three patients under dual antiplatelet therapy (12.5%) had neck hematoma. All patients were discharged the day after surgery. In our preliminary experience, reallocation in a COVID-free clinic allowed us to maintain a functioning carotid surgery activity during COVID-19 pandemic. A multidisciplinary approach and support of telemedicine were crucial. Training of unskilled nurse staff was necessary.","['Telemedicine', 'Carotid Surgery', 'Covid-19']","['Ethics Subjects', 'written informed', 'informed consent', 'Ethics', 'Subjects', 'Statement', 'procedure', 'perioperative management', 'written', 'informed']",[]

This study also aimed to evaluate the regulatory review processes and the good review practices that have been implemented by SAHPRA to support the assessment of new chemical entities and generic product applications for market authorization in the business-as-usual and backlog process streams.  Methods:  A questionnaire was completed and verified by SAHPRA to describe the structure of the organization, the resources available, the process for regulatory review of new chemical entities and generic products and the level of implementation of good review practices and regulatory decision-making practices for market authorization. Data were collected and analyzed on the overall approval timelines for new chemical entities and generic products registered by SAHPRA in 2020 in the business-as-usual and backlog process streams.  Results:  A full, independent scientific review was conducted for all new chemical entities and generic product applications in the business-as-usual stream. Facilitated regulatory pathways were introduced for the review of new chemical entities and generic products in the backlog stream. As a result, the timelines for approval of applications in the backlog stream were 68% quicker for both new chemical entities and generics, using facilitated regulatory pathways, such as abridged and verification review models.  Conclusion:  The comparisons made through this study provided insight into the improvements that have been made through the establishment of SAHPRA and the transition in 2018 from the MCC. The re-engineered processes that have been developed and implemented by SAHPRA to address the backlog in the review of the applications for market authorization have demonstrated a decrease in the overall median approval times. The expansion of these processes into the routine review of medical products will contribute to the enhanced regulatory performance of SAHPRA and patients' access to new medicines.","['Backlog', 'Good Review Practices', 'Regulatory Performance', 'South African Health Products Regulatory Authority', 'South African Regulatory Review Times']","['Technology ECDA', 'Reference Protocol', 'Ethics Approval', 'Protocol number', 'Science', 'LMS', 'PGR', 'Health', 'Engineering', 'ECDA']",['LMS/PGR/UH/03873].']

Not only was it a scientific and medical achievement but it also paved the way for the drug-diagnostic codevelopment model, where a predictive biomarker assay is developed in parallel to the drug. One of the challenges in the development of trastuzumab was to select the right patient population likely to respond and here, it was critical to have access to an accurate, robust and reliable assay for detection of HER2 overexpression in tumors. In the clinical development of trastuzumab, a clinical trial assay (CTA), developed by Genentech, was used for selection of HER2 positive patients. However, during the phase III trial with trastuzumab, a new optimized IHC assay, HercepTest™ was designed and developed by Dako. In the final stage of its development, a comparative study with the CTA was conducted in order to show concordance between the two assays. In September 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) simultaneously granted approval to trastuzumab and HercepTest™. The assay has been used for patient selection in a number of significant breast cancer clinical trials such as the HERA, CLEOPATRA, EMILIA and more. In these trials, HercepTest™ demonstrated its clinical utility in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic setting as well as in relation to different types of HER2 targeted therapies. Likewise, the assay was used for selection of HER2 positive gastric cancer patients in the important ToGA trail. HercepTest™ was the first companion diagnostic ever approved by the FDA, and more than 20 years of use has documented its clinical impact.","['Breast cancer', 'Gastric cancer', 'Trastuzumab', 'Pertuzumab', 'Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine', 'Companion Diagnostics', 'Herceptest', 'Drug-diagnostic Codevelopment']",[],[]

Fibrin glue-induced adverse events are generally rare. Herein, we describe a rare case of fibrin glue-induced eosinophilic pleural effusion (EPE). Case presentation A 77-year-old man underwent partial pulmonary resection for right lower lobe lung cancer, and the pulmonary staple stump was subsequently covered with fibrin glue. Antibacterial drugs were administered for the treatment of postoperative pneumonia. However, re-elevation of the inflammatory cell number was observed, and computed tomography revealed an increase in right pleural effusion. Although thoracoscopy was performed based on a possibility of empyema, no empyema was observed. The eosinophil count in the pleural effusion was 11%; thus, the patient was diagnosed with EPE, which was resolved after thoracic drainage, without corticosteroid administration. Fibrin glue was identified as the causative agent, using a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test. Clinical discussion EPE is defined as an eosinophil count of ≥10% in the pleural effusion. If pleural effusion on the surgical side, with fever or an elevated inflammatory cell number, is observed in the early postoperative period after pulmonary resection, empyema should be considered foremost. In this case, the administration of antibacterial drugs was ineffective, and the patient was eventually diagnosed with EPE. Conclusion EPE should be considered as a rare fibrin glue-induced adverse event after pulmonary resection. It is recommended that the leukocyte fraction be examined, if pleural effusion is collected for postoperative pleural effusion.","['Lung cancer', 'Postoperative complication', 'Case Report', 'Fibrin Glue', 'Eosinophilic Pleural Effusion']","['Ethical approval', 'case reports', 'approval Ethical', 'Ethical', 'approval', 'institute', 'required', 'paper', 'case', 'reports']",[]

Various management approaches are already available, but an internationally approved management guideline is not yet established. There is a major concern in the current management of wide excision technique as it frequently results in massive bone defect. Case presentation Here we present a case of osteofibrous dysplasia on a 10-year-old girl in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital with chief complaint of mild persistent pain of her lower leg since two years before with slight bowing deformity. The radiograph and histopathological examination support the diagnosis of osteofibrous dysplasia. She was managed with en-bloc resection (wide excision) of the tumor, followed with reconstruction using biomaterials substitute; combination between demineralized bone matrix (Bonegener R ) and bone substitute ""hydroxyapatite and calcium sulphate"" and internal fixation using plate and screw. Results Clinical and radiological evaluation showed successful improvement and outcome. The patient showed progressive functional outcomes and achieved functional score of 100% LEFS at 3 years follow-up. The plate and screw was removed at 48 weeks after adequate callus formation andradiological union was achieved. Conclusion Simple reconstruction using biomaterial bone substitute not only created new bone formation with good stability, but also enabled patient to have an improved quality of life. This method is recommended to overcome the massive bone defect after tumor resection in osteofibrous dysplasia patient.","['Biomaterial', 'Wide Excision', 'Massive Bone Defect', 'Osteofibrous Dyplasia']",[],[]

The part of the study that uses anonymized data from the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare did not require ethical approval (2017/5:1).," Objective The consequences of a low autopsy rate are not considered in determining the cause of death. Method We have analyzed the Cause of Death Register of the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare since it started 1969 to and including 2016 to visualize the decline in the frequency of clinical autopsies over time and evaluated the effect on the quality of the cause of death diagnoses. Results Over the five decades studied, the frequency of clinical autopsies declined from almost 40% to less than 5%. The rate of decline was not even. Political decisions and changes of healthcare organization in Sweden affected the slope of decline of autopsies superimposed on a linear decline over time reflecting changes in clinical routines. A request of clinical autopsies was highly dependent on the level of care at the time of death, with the lowest number of requests for persons who died in nursing homes. The age at the time of death was a major factor affecting the number of autopsies, resulting in an autopsy rate of less than 1% in the ages where most persons die. Although men were autopsied more often than women, a gender-specific difference was not seen after correction for the age of death. We also found a higher rate of unspecific and irrelevant diagnosis in the cases not autopsied and we know from earlier studies by us and other authors that the cause of death diagnoses were missed in between 30% and 50% of the cases not autopsied. Conclusion The decline in the clinical autopsy rate reduced the value of the death certificate register. An increase in the number of autopsies performed will improve the understanding of disease and cause of death, as well as to better inform next of kin.","['Autopsy', 'Cause of death', 'Gender Differences', 'Forensic Autopsy', 'Age Dependence', 'Autopsy And Level Of Care', 'Death Certificate Errors', 'Clinical Autopsy']","['Stockholm approved', 'Regional Ethical', 'Ethical Board', 'Swedish Board', 'ethical approval', 'Regional', 'Stockholm', '208-31', 'Board', 'require ethical']",[]

To date, the clinical evidence of the efficacy of REBOA is still debated. We aimed to conduct a systematic review assessing the clinical efficacy and safety of REBOA in patients with major trauma and uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock. Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE and CENTRAL up to June 2020. All randomized controlled trials and observational studies that investigated the use of REBOA compared to resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) with/without REBOA or no-REBOA were eligible. We followed the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Two authors independently extracted data and appraised the risk of bias of included studies. Effect sizes were pooled in a meta-analysis using random-effects models. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. Primary outcomes were mortality, volume of infused blood components, health-related quality of life, time to haemorrhage control and any adverse effects. Secondary outcomes were improvement in haemodynamic status and failure/success of REBOA technique. Results We included 11 studies (5866 participants) ranging from fair to good quality. REBOA was associated with lower mortality when compared to RT (aOR 0.38; 95% CI 0.20-0.74), whereas no difference was observed when REBOA was compared to no-REBOA (aOR 1.40; 95% CI 0.79-2.46). No significant difference in health-related quality of life between REBOA and RT (p = 0.766). The most commonly reported complications were amputation, haematoma and pseudoaneurysm. Sparse data and heterogeneity of reporting for all other outcomes prevented any estimate. Conclusions Our findings on overall mortality suggest a positive effect of REBOA among non-compressible torso injuries when compared to RT but no differences compared to no-REBOA. Variability in indications and patient characteristics prevents any conclusion deserving further investigation. REBOA should be promoted in specific training programs in an experimental setting in order to test its effectiveness and a randomized trial should be planned.","Systematic Review, Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion Of The Aorta, Major Trauma Haemorrhage, Resuscitative Thoracotomy",[],[]

Thereafter, the Netherlands was one of the first countries to implement R-biosimilars, given lower costs compared with rituximab originator (R-originator). This study's objective was to investigate whether overall survival (OS) of patients with DLBCL receiving R-biosimilars is similar to patients treated with R-originator. DLBCL patients ≥18 years, diagnosed between 2014 and 2018, who received at least 1 cycle of rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) were identified in the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients were categorized into R-originator or R-biosimilars groups based on data from a central repository of the Dutch medicinal drug market. The primary end point was 3-year OS, defined as the time between diagnosis and all-cause death. By the end of 2018, 91% of purchased rituximab were biosimilars. In total, 4429 patients were identified with 876 in the R-biosimilars group and 3553 in the R-originator group. Patients in the R-biosimilars group less frequently received >6 cycles of R-CHOP compared with patients treated with R-originator (24% vs 30%, P = .003). The 3-year OS did not differ between patients treated with R-originator or R-biosimilars (73% vs 73%, P = .855). This was confirmed with a multivariable Cox regression analysis accounting for sex, age, International Prognostic Index score, and number of R-CHOP cycles.

Quantitative data on the extent of the delays due to national or local review in randomised clinical trials is scarce. Materials and methods We assessed the times needed to obtain regulatory approval and to initiate a trial site for an academic, EU-funded, phase III, randomised clinical trial of pharmacological prevention of complications in patients with acute stroke in over 80 sites in nine European countries. The primary outcome was the time from the first submission to a regulatory authority to initiation of a trial site. Secondary outcomes included time needed to complete each individual preparatory requirement and the number of patients recruited by each site in the first 6 and 12 months. Results The median time from the first submission to a regulatory authority to initiation of a trial site was 784 days (IQR: 586-1102). The single most time-consuming step was the conclusion of a clinical trial agreement between the national coordinator and the trial site, which took a median of 194 days (IQR: 93-293). A longer time to site initiation was associated with a lower patient recruitment rate in the first six months after initiation (B = -0.002;  p  = 0.02). Discussion  Conclusion In this EU-funded clinical trial, approximately 26 months were needed to initiate a trial site for patient recruitment. The conclusion of a contract with a trial site was the most time-consuming activity. To simplify and speed up the process, we suggest that the level of detail of contracts for academic trials should be proportional to the risks and commercial interests of these trials.","['Stroke', 'Randomised Clinical Trial', 'Regulatory Approval']",[],[]

The cuff pressure-time curve dynamically fluctuated, and exceeded 30 cmH 2 O in all patients, whereas decreased to ≤ 20 cmH 2 0 in 42 (69%) patients. Ratio of the period with such an increase and decrease of cuff pressure to the total duration of surgery were 40% (28-66%) and 9% (0-21%), respectively (median, interquartile range).

Secondary objectives include assessment of the ability of camostat to reduce the requirement for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related hospital admission and to reduce the requirement for supplementary oxygen and ventilation as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, to evaluate overall mortality related to COVID-19 and to evaluate the efficacy of camostat by effect on clinical improvement. Research objectives include to assess change in COVID-19 symptom severity, to evaluate the ability of camostat to reduce viral load throughout duration of illness as well as translational research on host and viral genomics, serum antibody production, COVID-19 diagnostics, and validation of laboratory testing methods and biomarkers. Trial design SPIKE-1 is a randomised, multicentre, prospective, open label, community-based clinical trial. Eligible patients will be randomised 1:1 to the camostat treatment arm and control arm (best supportive care). The trial is designed to include a pilot phase recruiting up to 50 patients in each arm. An initial review at the end of the pilot phase will allow assessment of available data and inform the requirement for any protocol adaptations to include refinement of eligibility criteria to enrich the patient population and sample size calculations. Up to 289 additional patients will be randomised in the continuation phase of the trial. A formal interim analysis will be performed once 50% of the maximum sample size has been recruited PARTICIPANTS: The trial will recruit adults (≥ 18 years) who score moderate to very high risk according to COVID-age risk calculation, with typical symptoms of COVID-19 infection as per Public Health England guidance or equivalent organisations in the UK, Health Protection Scotland, Public Health Wales, Public Health Agency (Northern Ireland) and with evidence of current COVID-19 infection from a validated assay. The trial is being conducted in the UK and patients are recruited through primary care and hospital settings. Intervention and comparator Eligible patients with be randomised to receive either camostat tablets, 200 mg four times daily (qds) for 14 days (treatment arm) or best supportive care (control arm). Main outcomes Primary outcome measure: the rate of hospital admissions requiring supplemental oxygen. Secondary outcome measures include: the rate of COVID-19 related hospital admission in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; the number of supplementary oxygen-free days and ventilator-free days measured at 28 days from randomisation; the rate of mortality related to COVID-19 one year from randomisation; the time to worst point on the nine-point category ordinal scale (recommended by the World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019)) or deterioration of two points or more, within 28 days from randomisation. Research outcomes include the assessment of change in COVID-19 symptom severity on days 1-14 as measured by (1) time to apyrexia (maintained for 48 hrs) by daily self-assessment of temperature, time to improvement (by two points) in peripheral oxygenation saturation defined by daily self-assessment of fingertip peripheral oxygenation saturation levels, (3) assessment of COVID-19 symptoms using the Flu-iiQ questionnaire (determined by app recording and/or daily video call (or phone) consultation and (4) assessment of functional score (where possible) at screening, day 7 and 14. The ability of camostat to reduce viral load throughout duration of illness will be assessed by (1) change in respiratory (oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR) log10 viral load from baseline to Days 7 and 14, (2) change in respiratory (saliva RT-PCR) log10 viral load from baseline to Days 1-14 and (3) change in upper respiratory viral shedding at Day 1 -14 measured as time to clearance of nasal SARS-CoV-2, defined as 2 consecutive negative swabs by qPCR.

A shorter application form specific to routinely collected retrospective data would be helpful. CAG have now introduced what is known as the precedent set pathway 15 to enable a more timely review process, which although a step in the right direction applies only to specific situations, known as the ‘precedent set categories’. These categories include: applications to identify a cohort of patients and subsequently seek their consent; accessing data on site to extract anonymised data; validity of consent; data cleansing of historical studies; time limited access to undertake record linkage/validation and anonymisation of data. The latter category was not a feasible category for us to apply for expedited review as we required pseudonymised data from each data controller to link all data sets at University College London. The original data linkage plan had involved each audit sending their data to NHS Digital, so we would receive the final linked data set only. However, following feedback from a study that had adopted this strategy, that this had lengthened the process, without them having access to any of the data sets during this time, we opted for each audit completing their own linkage to the core NCHDA dataset. This allowed us to receive and begin working on each data set as it reached us, without needing to have received every data set. NHS Digital was the lengthiest application process and therefore the original planned linkage would have delayed us even further. We did not seek to receive the identifiers from each audit for the sake of data minimisation and governance. Ethics statements Patient consent for publication Not required."," Background We can improve healthcare services by better understanding current provision. One way to understand this is by linking data sets from clinical and national audits, national registries and other National Health Service (NHS) encounter data. However, getting to the point of having linked national data sets is challenging. Objective We describe our experience of the data application and linkage process for our study 'LAUNCHES QI', and the time, processes and resource requirements involved. To help others planning similar projects, we highlight challenges encountered and advice for applications in the current system as well as suggestions for system improvements. Findings The study set up for LAUNCHES QI began in March 2018, and the process through to data acquisition took 2.5 years. Several challenges were encountered, including the amount of information required (often duplicate information in different formats across applications), lack of clarity on processes, resource constraints that limit an audit's capacity to fulfil requests and the unexpected amount of time required from the study team. It is incredibly difficult to estimate the resources needed ahead of time, and yet necessary to do so as early on as funding applications. Early decisions can have a significant impact during latter stages and be hard to change, yet it is difficult to get specific information at the beginning of the process. Conclusions The current system is incredibly complex, arduous and slow, stifling innovation and delaying scientific progress. NHS data can inform and improve health services and we believe there is an ethical responsibility to use it to do so. Streamlining the number of applications required for accessing data for health services research and providing clarity to data controllers could facilitate the maintenance of stringent governance, while accelerating scientific studies and progress, leading to swifter application of findings and improvements in healthcare.","['Information management', 'epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Audit', 'Health Informatics', 'Quality In Health Care']","['data', 'CAG approval', 'recruiting participants', 'CAG', 'clinical trials', 'prospectively recruiting', 'NHS Digital', 'set', 'data set', 'cohorts prospectively']",[]

In Mozambique, a public state of emergency was declared at the end of March 2020. This has limited people's movements and reduced public services, leading to a decrease in the number of people accessing health care facilities. An implementation research project, The Alert Community for a Prepared Hospital, has been promoting access to maternal and child health care, in Natikiri, Nampula, for the last four years. Nampula has the second highest incidence of Covid-19. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic Government restrictions on access to maternal and child healthcare services. We compared health centres in Nampula city with healthcare centres in our research catchment area. We wanted to see if our previous research interventions have led to a more resilient response from the community. Methods Mixed-methods research, descriptive, cross-sectional, retrospective, using a review of patient visit documentation. We compared maternal and child health care unit statistical indicators from March-May 2019 to the same time-period in 2020. We tested for significant changes in access to maternal and child health services, using KrushKall Wallis, One-way Anova and mean and standard deviation tests. We compared interviews with health professionals, traditional birth attendants and patients in the two areas. We gathered data from a comparable city health centre and the main city referral hospital. The Marrere health centre and Marrere General Hospital were the two Alert Community for a Prepared Hospital intervention sites. Results Comparing 2019 quantitative maternal health services access indicators with those from 2020, showed decreases in most important indicators: family planning visits and elective C-sections dropped 28%; first antenatal visit occurring in the first trimester dropped 26%; hospital deliveries dropped a statistically significant 4% (p = 0.046), while home deliveries rose 74%; children vaccinated down 20%.

Although several approaches to treating PD have been described, there is still a lack of agreement on which is the best. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of endoscopic pilonidal sinus treatment (EPSiT) at a tertiary care academic center.  Methods:  Between June 2017 and January 2021, a total of 32 patients [12 women (37.5%) and 20 men (62.5%)] with a mean age of 29.22 ± 12.98 years were treated with EPSiT. Pre- and post-operative symptoms were assessed with a score of 0-5. Success was defined as the absence of any subjective symptoms, as well as by complete post-operative wound healing.  Results:  Most of the patients had a midline external opening (17/32; 53.1%), with a mean number of external openings of 2.41 (1-4) ± 1.04. The median post-operative pain score was 0, and the mean follow-up period was 22 (4-42) ± 11.49 months. The time to wound healing was reduced in patients with one opening (28.14 ± 4.06 days) compared to patients with two or more openings (33.64 ± 7.3 days) ( p  = 0.067). The mean operative time was longer in patients who subsequently had a recurrence (41.75 ± 6.24 vs. 34.18 ± 6.24 min;  p  = 0.031). The overall success rate was 87.5% (28/32), and the mean time to recurrence was 3.25 (2-5) ± 1.26 months.  Conclusions:  EPSiT represents a viable option for the treatment of PD.

It is hoped that this benchmark study provides an opportunity for BRICS-TM agencies to identify the key areas for improvement in their regulatory processes.  Materials and Methods:  A semi-quantitative questionnaire was developed covering the different criteria used in biosimilar development and registration process. Eleven regulatory agencies from BRICS-TM and ACSS (Australia, Canada, Switzerland and Singapore) countries were invited to take part in this study. Data processing and analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics for quantitative data and content analysis to generate themes for qualitative data.  Results and Discussions:  Nine of the 11 regulatory agencies recruited for the study completed the questionnaire. China and Singapore did not meet the deadline due to lack of resources. The organisational structure of BRICS-TM agencies revealed support from external assessors by most of these agencies in comparison with ACSS agencies. There was absence of reliance approach and participation in harmonisation activities across most BRICS-TM agencies. Despite alignment over biosimilarity, the mandate for  in vivo  non-clinical studies and additional local clinical studies in some of the BRICS-TM countries illustrates a lack of effective implementation of a step-wise approach. Adopting flexible regulatory standards in the sourcing of a RBP (Reference Biologic Product) by BRICS-TM similar to ACSS, will facilitate cost-effective development of biosimilar products.  Conclusions:  Comparative assessment of the biosimilar regulatory framework of BRICS-TM with ACSS agencies reveals the scope for enhancing efficiency of the regulatory approval process. To achieve this, BRICS-TM agencies should consider relying on reference agencies for alternative review mechanisms such as abridged or verification models, streamlined processes for providing scientific advice to developers and for waiving local clinical studies in-lieu of advanced scientific data.","['Development', 'Emerging Markets', 'Regulatory Agency', 'Acss Biosimilar', 'Brics-Tm']","['Technology ECDA', 'Reference Protocol', 'Ethics Issues', 'Protocol number', 'Science', 'PGR', 'aLMS', 'Issues', 'Statement', 'Health']",['aLMS/PGR/UH/03332']

Material and methods Our study employed a projective quantitative research design. SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis was used to map ARS internal competencies towards external contexts, and potential opportunities and risks in the robotic market. The ARS purchase and procedural costs were evaluated in two different scenarios. Results In the first scenario, setting the purchase cost of the Avatera at around $1.3-1.5 million, a total $400 procedural cost reduction compared to the RAS performed with the da Vinci Xi can be calculated. In the second scenario, with a purchase cos of the ARS of $700.000-800.000 and considering a 5-year period with an annual ARS volume of 500 procedures, only an additional $300 will be attributed to the robot itself. Our projections revealed that for an effective competition the purchase cost of ARS should range between $700.000 and $800.000 during the initial phase of market entry. The marketing strategy of the ARS should be oriented towards countries without any robotic system in operational use, followed by countries where the competition intensity in the marketplace is low. Conclusion The introduction of new robotic systems will greatly affect and reshape the market of robotic surgery. The ARS has all the technical capacity ensuring the performance of high-quality surgical procedures. A fast spread and implementation of the ARS could be expected should the purchase and maintenance costs be kept low.","['Cost Analysis', 'Da Vinci', 'Robot-assisted Surgery', 'Swot Analysis', 'Business Modeling', 'Avatera Robotic System']",[],[]

Design A registry-based retrospective cohort study. Setting Patients diagnosed with node-positive CGA in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 2010 to 2015. Participants A total of 1038 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (7:3) to the training set (n=723) or validating set (n=315). Primary outcome measure Cancer-specific survival (CSS). Results The baseline characteristics of the training and validation sets were similar. Based on the optimal cut-off values, LNR was classified into low ( 0.33) groups; LODDS was also classified into low ( -0.65) groups. CSS was significantly different across LNR and LODDS subgroups. The Harrell concordance index of the N stage was lower than that of the LNR or LODDS. The Akaike information criterion of the N stage was higher than that of the LNR or LODDS. Independent predictors included race, T stage, M stage and LNR (or LODDS), and they were incorporated into nomograms for 1-year, 2-year and 5-year CSS prediction. Calibration plots showed satisfactory results for internal and external validity of the nomogram. Conclusions LNR and LODDS staging methods have better prognostic efficacy than the traditional N staging method in CGA with node metastasis. Moreover, the two values are promising substitutes for N staging in nomogram development when other independent prognostic factors are incorporated.","['Surgery', 'Gastrointestinal Tumours']","['statements Patient', 'Patient consent', 'Ethics approval', 'Anhui Medical', 'Medical College', 'Ethics Committee', 'Ethics', 'College exempted', 'Ethics statements', 'observational nature']",[]

Inflammation is an important contributor to this ongoing risk. Recent studies have shown that the broad-acting anti-inflammatory agent, colchicine, may reduce adverse cardiovascular events in patients post-MI, although the mechanistic basis for this remains unclear. Advances in endovascular arterial wall imaging have allowed detailed characterization of the burden and compositional phenotype of coronary plaque, along with its natural history and responsiveness to treatment. One such example has been the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to demonstrate the plaque-stabilizing effects of statins on both fibrous cap thickness and the size of lipid pools within plaque. Methods The Phase 2, multi-centre, double-blind colchicine for coronary plaque modification in acute coronary syndrome (COCOMO-ACS) study will evaluate the effect of colchicine 0.5 mg daily on coronary plaque features using serial OCT imaging in patients following MI. Recruitment for the trial has been completed with 64 participants with non-ST elevation MI randomized 1:1 to colchicine or placebo in addition to guideline recommended therapies, including high-intensity statins. The primary endpoint is the effect of colchicine on the minimal fibrous cap thickness of non-culprit plaque over an 18-month period. The COCOMO-ACS study will determine whether addition of colchicine 0.5 mg daily to standard post-MI treatment has incremental benefits on high-risk features of coronary artery plaques. If confirmed, this will provide new mechanistic insights into how colchicine may confer clinical benefits in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Studies were identified using an agreed search strategy within the OVID Gateway (this included Pubmed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Collaborative). Studies assessing bleeding complications in patients who were undergoing dental implant placement were selected. The primary outcome was bleeding events in anticoagulated patients undergoing dental implant placement. Secondary outcomes included any complication requiring further intervention. Results We identified 182 studies through screening, and after review of titles and abstracts reduced this to 8 studies. In these studies, 1467 participants received at least 2366 implants. Studies were analysed for quality using the ROBINS-I risk of bias tool. Four studies were retrospective case reviews, and four were prospective reviews, three of which also blinded the operator to anticoagulation status. There was significant heterogeneity between the included studies. Meta-analysis showed an increased risk of bleeding (RR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.25-4.24 p = 0.37 I = 7%) when implants were placed in the presence of anticoagulation however these were not clinically significant haemorrhagic events. Conclusion The continuation of anticoagulants peri-operatively during dental implant surgery does increase the risk of clinically non-significant peri- and post-operative bleeding. Dental implant surgery encompasses a broad spectrum of procedures ranging from minor to more invasive surgery with simple local haemostatic measures mitigating the risk of bleeding. The decision to discontinue anticoagulants prior to dental implant surgery must consider patient and surgical factors with the clinician undertaking a risk-balance assessment.","['Anticoagulation', 'Haemorrhage', 'Mesh Terms, Dental Implant']",[],[]

No evidence of the long-term effectiveness of TTh on renal function is reported to date. Methods In this study, we evaluated the long-term TTh of testosterone undecanoate (TU) administration on renal function parameters in 496 symptomatic hypogonadal men, with T levels ≤350 ng/dL. The treatment group (T-group) consisted of 312 patients and obtained TU 1000 mg for 12 weeks followed by 6-week intervals and for up to 8 years. The remaining 184 hypogonadal men, who opted against TTh, served as a control group (C-group). The two groups were similar in criteria prior to treatment. We evaluated renal function by calculating serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) according to Mayo Clinic guidelines for 8 years. This study obeys the ethical guidelines of German medical association according to Section 15 of the Professional Code, document for AY- Ref. EK/CH/AU signed on Jun 2015. Results During the study period, the T-group exhibited lower levels of urea (47.0 ± 11.8 to 34.0 ± 13.9 mg/dL), uric acid (6.57 ± 1.2 to 5.49 ± 1.5 mg/dL), serum creatinine (0.90 ± 0.10 to 1.12 ± 0.9 mg/dL), and higher-level in GFR (87.0 ± 12.9 to 98.0 ± 8.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), which were significant. Alternatively, the C-group exhibited an increase in their serum creatinine (1.16 ± 0.31 to 1.19 ± 0.58 mg/dL), an increase in uric acid (5.54 ± 1.2 to 5.44 ± 1.7 mg/dL), and a decrease in GFR (92.0 ± 20.1 to 87.0 ± 26.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). A total of 25 deaths (7.8%) was recorded in the T-group, among them 11 (44%) were cardiovascular. On the other hand, 28 patients (15.2%) died in C-group and all deaths (100%) were found to cardiovascular causes. Conclusion The results suggest that long-term TTh could improve renal function in hypogonadal men comparing to slight deterioration observed in patients without intervention. In addition to reduce mortality in cardiovascular patients, almost to the half.","['Men', 'Hypogonadism', 'Renal function', 'Testosterone Therapy']","['Review Board', 'Institutional Review', 'German medical', 'Ethical consideration', 'consideration Institutional', 'ethics committee', 'Ethical approval', 'approval', 'medical association', 'IRB']","['(researchregistry6769)', 'for']"

Methods We tested our DLA built on convolutional neural networks in 14,186 retinographies from our population and 1200 images extracted from MESSIDOR. The retinal images were graded both by the DLA and independently by four retina specialists. Results of the DLA were compared according to accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), distinguishing between identification of any type of DR (any DR) and referable DR (RDR). Results The results of testing the DLA for identifying any DR in our population were: ACC = 99.75, S = 97.92, SP = 99.91, PPV = 98.92, NPV = 99.82, and AUC = 0.983. When detecting RDR, the results were: ACC = 99.66, S = 96.7, SP = 99.92, PPV = 99.07, NPV = 99.71, and AUC = 0.988.

We developed a decision model for population-based  ROS1  testing from a Canadian public healthcare perspective to determine the strategy that optimized detection of true-positive (TP) cases while minimizing costs and turnaround time (TAT). Eight diagnostic strategies were compared, including reflex single gene testing via immunohistochemistry (IHC) screening, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and biomarker-informed ( EGFR/ALK/KRAS  wildtype) testing initiated by pathologists and clinician-initiated strategies. Reflex IHC screening with FISH confirmation of positive cases yielded the best results for TAT, TP detection rate, and cost. IHC screening saved CAD 1,000,000 versus reflex FISH testing. NGS was the costliest reflex strategy. Biomarker-informed testing was cost-efficient but delayed TAT. Clinician-initiated testing was the least costly but resulted in long TAT and missed TP cases, highlighting the importance of reflex testing. Thus, reflex IHC screening for ROS1 with FISH confirmation provides a cost-efficient strategy with short TAT and maximizes the number of TP cases detected.","['Biomarker', 'Cost', 'NSCLC', 'Ros1', 'Reflex Testing', 'IHC']",[],[]

In dogs, this virus may affect the central nervous system (CNS), causing meningoencephalitis, meningomyelitis, radiculitis or any combination of these. Diagnosis of TBE relies on a combination of clinical signs of CNS disease and laboratory findings, including CSF pleocytosis and serum TBEV antibody titers. Exposure to TBEV does not necessarily cause clinical disease, and seroprevalence has been reported as high as 40% in endemic areas. This causes concerns of over-diagnosing TBE in dogs with CNS disease. By examining TBEV antibodies in dogs with and without neurological disease in a TBEV endemic area, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of TBEV antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in dogs. Eighty-nine dogs were included in the study, 56 with neurological disease and 33 neurologically normal control dogs. A positive TBEV CSF and serum IgG antibody titer (> 126 U/mL) was found in 3/89 dogs (3.4%). A positive serum TBEV antibody titer was found in 11 of the 89 dogs (12.4%). None of the control dogs showed a positive CSF antibody titer, whilst two showed positive serum concentrations. A positive CSF IgG antibody titer supports a clinical diagnosis of TBE in patients with acute onset of CNS disease and may help reduce the risk of over-diagnosis.","['Serology', 'Virus', 'Canine', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Meningoencephalomyelitis']",[],[]

Data on patient characteristics, microorganisms detected by bronchoscopy, and subsequent incidences of pneumonia were obtained from electronic medical records. Patients were divided into groups based on the microorganisms isolated from the lower respiratory tract. The cumulative incidence of pneumonia was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and decision tree analysis was performed to analyze the relation between the presence of microorganisms and the occurrence of pneumonia.

Design and Methods   The study was conducted in a clinical chemistry laboratory using the samples and forms received for analysis. Five hundred random samples were analyzed using a predefined set of quality indicators (QIs) over a period of 3 months. The incidence of each preanalytical error was described as a percentage of the total samples analyzed in the study.  Statistical Analysis   Individual QIs were assigned values as 0 and 1 and were used to assess each sample; 0 if the error was present, and 1 if absent. The incidence of each preanalytical error was described as a percentage of the total samples analyzed in the study.  Result   Out of the 500 samples observed, 138 samples were error free, while 21 samples had the maximum number of errors, that is, 6. The error committed most often was the omission of provisional diagnosis being mentioned on the requisition form. No preanalytical error was observed for QIs: selecting the appropriate blood collection vial or storage of sample.  Conclusion   This study confirms that error rate in the preanalytical phase is high and vastly ignored. Errors committed here may be overlooked, given the large number of samples received in the clinical laboratory of a tertiary center. To reduce these errors, the laboratory should provide training to all workers involved in the preanalytical phase.

Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a sensitive and quantitative technique for NIPD. In the present study, the development and evaluation of ddPCR-based assays for common α and β-thalassemia variants amongst the Asian population was described; specifically, Southeast Asian (SEA) deletion, HbE, and 41/42 (-CTTT). SEA is caused by deletion of a 20 kb region surrounding the α-globin gene, whilst HbE and 41/42 (-CTTT) are caused by point mutations on the β-globin gene. Cell-free DNA samples from 46 singleton pregnant women who were carriers of these mutations were isolated and quantified using ddPCR with specially designed probes for each target allele. Allelic copy number calculation and likelihood ratio tests were used to classify fetal genotypes. Classification performances were evaluated against ground truth fetal genotypes obtained from conventional amniocentesis. Copy number variation analysis of SEA deletion accurately classified fetal genotypes in 20 out of 22 cases with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 for detecting Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis. For HbE cases, 10 out of 16 samples were correctly classified, and three were inconclusive. For 41/42 (-CTTT) cases, 2 out of 8 were correctly classified, and four were inconclusive. The correct genotype was not rejected in any inconclusive case and may be resolved with additional ddPCR experiments. These results indicate that ddPCR-based analysis of maternal plasma can become an accurate and effective NIPD for SEA deletion α-(0) thalassemia. Although the performance of ddPCR on HbE and 41/42 (-CTTT) mutations were not sufficient for clinical application, these results may serve as a foundation for future works in this field.","['β-thalassemia', 'α-thalassemia', 'Cell-free Fetal Dna', 'Droplet Digital Pcr', 'Non-invasive Prenatal Test']","['Radjavithi Hospital', 'Institutional Review', 'Review Board', 'participate Samples', 'Ethics approval', 'Written informed', 'Bangkok', 'November', 'approval', 'Hospital']",['59194']

The adverse effects of childhood hearing loss include delayed speech/language development, learning difficulties, and reduced social-emotional well-being. Schoolteachers and early childhood educators are among the first professionals who may suspect hearing loss in their young students, and they are well-placed to initiate referrals to appropriate health services. Given the current efforts to implement Inclusive Education in the Pacific Islands, teachers are also uniquely positioned to positively influence, support, and advocate for a child with hearing loss in their classroom. There are no previous studies on this topic from the Pacific Island region. Methods The study will use a national survey and convenience sampling design. Teachers attending the Annual Teachers Conference in Samoa will be invited to independently and anonymously completed a 23-item questionnaire on childhood hearing loss and hearing services. Questions are in English, with a Samoan translation provided. The participating teachers will be required to respond with ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""unsure,"" and to mark their response on the questionnaire. The questions assess knowledge of biomedical etiology of hearing impairment, knowledge of the adverse impacts of hearing loss on childhood development, knowledge of hearing loss identification and intervention, and attitudes toward children with a hearing impairment.

Material and methods A multispecies biofilm (P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, A. naeslundii, V. parvula and S. oralis) was grown for 14 days on 52 dental implants in an artificial mouth. These implants were divided into three groups according to the applied treatment: 14 negative control (CON), 19 erythritol-chlorhexidine (ERY) and 19 gauze with saline (GAU) samples. Twelve dental implants from the ERY and GAU groups and 8 implants from the CON group were re-incubated for 7 additional days after treatment. The bacterial count was performed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using propidium monoazide (PMA). A descriptive and bivariate analysis of the data was performed.

Methods:  We enrolled 86 AHF patients with (31 pts, AHF/PNM) and without (55 pts, AHF) concomitant PNM. LUS B-lines were evaluated using a combined antero-lateral (AL) and posterior (POST) approach at admission (T0), after 24 h from T0 (T1), after 48 h from T0 (T2) and before discharge (T3). B-lines score was calculated at each time point on AL and POST chest, dividing the number of B-lines by the number of explorable scanning sites. The decongestion rate (DR) was calculated as the difference between the absolute B-lines number at discharge and admission, divided by the number of days of hospitalization. Patients were followed-up and hospital readmission for AHF was considered as adverse outcome.  Results:  At admission, AHF/PNM patients showed no difference in AL B-lines score compared with AHF patients [AHF/PNM: 2.00 (IQR: 1.44-2.94) vs. AHF: 1.65 (IQR: 0.50-2.66),  p  = 0.072], whereas POST B-lines score was higher [AHF/PNM: 3.76 (IQR: 2.70-4.77) vs. AHF = 2.44 (IQR: 1.20-3.60),  p   p  = 0.022] and not POST B-lines score was found to predict adverse events (AHF rehospitalization) after a median follow-up of 96 days (IQR: 30-265) in the overall population.

There is no established method to evaluate the sufficiency of professionals on a regional basis. We aimed to determine the correlation of the number of ID doctors and certified nurses in infection control (CNIC) with the prevalence of representative antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pathogens across the 47 prefectures in Japan using publicly available databases. Methods We determined the number of ID doctors and CNIC registered in each prefecture based on the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and the Japanese Nursing Association websites and calculated their numbers per 100,000 population. Data on representative AMR pathogens were extracted from the Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance database. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to measure statistical associations. Results There was no epidemiologically applicable correlation between the deployment of ID doctors and CNIC and the isolation rates of methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus , vancomycin-resistant  Enterococcus faecium,  cefotaxime- or levofloxacin-resistant  Escherichia coli  and  Klebsiella pneumoinae,  and meropenem-resistant  Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Solely, the isolation rate of levofloxacin-resistant  K. pneumoinae  and the number of CNIC were statistically correlated (correlation coefficient = -0.33;  p  = 0.02), while the isolation rate of cefotaxime-resistant  E. coli  was paradoxically correlated with the number of ID doctors (correlation coefficient = 0.33;  p  = 0.02) .  Conclusions: Our macroscopic analysis using the open database was not a reliable method to evaluate the sufficiency of ID experts across the prefectures in Japan.

Tenapanor, a first-in-class, phosphate absorption inhibitor, is expected to control phosphorus and decrease pill burden because of its small pill size and twice daily dosing regimen. This study evaluated tenapanor effectiveness on reducing the phosphate binder pill burden during a 26-week treatment period in Japanese hemodialysis patients. Methods In this multicenter, open-label, single-arm study, hemodialysis patients whose serum phosphorus level was 3.5 to 7.0 mg/dl received tenapanor 30 mg twice daily orally added to their phosphate binder regimen. The phosphate binder dosage was adjusted to achieve a serum phosphorus level within the baseline range of ±0.5 mg/dl. The primary end point was the percentage of patients who achieved a ≥30% decrease in the number of phosphate binders and tenapanor tablets prescribed daily compared with the number of phosphate binder tablets at baseline. Results Of the 67 patients enrolled, 43 completed the study. At baseline, the mean total number of phosphate binder tablets per day was 14.7, which decreased to 3.0 tablets per day at week 26. The primary end point was achieved in 71.6% of patients ( P   P   Conclusion Tenapanor provided effective phosphorus control and decreased the number of phosphate binder tablets.

We hypothesized that biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are underrepresented relative to conventional DMARDs in existing national EMLs. We aimed to survey the extent to which biologic DMARDs are included in EMLs, to determine country characteristics contributing to their inclusion or absence, and to contrast this with conventional DMARD therapies. Methods We searched 138 national EMLs for 10 conventional and 14 biologic DMARDs used in the treatment of childhood rheumatologic diseases. Via regression modelling, we determined country characteristics accounting for differences in medicine inclusion between national EMLs. Results Eleven countries (7.97%) included all 10 conventional DMARDs, 115 (83.33%) ≥5, and all countries listed at least one. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was associated with the total number of conventional DMARDs included (β 1 1.02 [95% CI 0.39, 1.66]; P = 0.00279). Among biologic DMARDs, 3 countries (2.2%) listed ≥10, 15 (10.9%) listed ≥5, and 47 (34.1%) listed at least one. Ninety-one (65.9%) of countries listed no biologic DMARDs.

Patients and methods This was a prospective cohort study for patients who received Botox intravesical injection. We included patients with neurogenic bladder with detrusor overactivity and symptomatic recurrent UTI. We compared the number of symptomatic UTIs at six months pre- and post-intravesical Botox injection. Patient files were reviewed for diagnosis, vesico-uretric reflux, hydronephrosis, urodynamic findings pre- and post-injection, and dose of Botox used. Patients were followed for the number of symptomatic UTIs post-Botox injection. Results There were 93 patients diagnosed with neurogenic detrusor overactivity and symptomatic recurrent UTI. Patients were categorized into three categories: Group 1 - adults, Group 2 - pediatrics, Group 3 - non-neurogenic neurogenic bladder (Hinman's syndrome). Spina bifida was diagnosed in 22 adults (Group 1) and 32 pediatric patients (Group 2). After receiving Botox injection, 75% of all patients (70) had a significant decrease in number of symptomatic UTIs. Urodynamic tests post-injection showed an improvement in bladder capacity, compliance, and detrusor pressure versus baseline in all three groups. Correlation analysis showed significant correlation between decreased symptomatic UTI post-Botox injection and detrusor pressure post-injection as well as bladder compliance;  p -value=0.01 and  p =0.021, respectively. Conclusion Intravesical Botox injection may decrease incidence of symptomatic UTI in neurogenic detrusor overactivity.

There are plausible pathophysiological and clinical mechanisms suggesting that patients with diabetes are at an increased risk of postoperative complications. When postoperative complications occur in the general population, they increase major adverse events and subsequently increase 1-year mortality. This is likely to be worse in patients with diabetes. There is variation in practice guidelines in different countries in the perioperative management of patients with diabetes undergoing major surgery and whether this may affect postoperative outcome has not been investigated on a large scale. Neither is it known whether different strata of preoperative glycaemic control affects outcome. Methods and analysis A prospective, observational, international, multicentre cohort study, recruiting 5000 patients with diabetes undergoing elective or emergency surgery in at least n=50 centres. Inclusion criteria are any patient with diabetes undergoing surgery under any substantive anaesthetic technique. Exclusion criteria are not being a confirmed diabetic patient and patients with diabetes undergoing procedures under monitored sedation or local anaesthetic infiltration only. Follow-up duration is 30 days after surgery. Primary outcome is days at home at 30 days. Secondary outcomes are Comprehensive Complications Index, Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) score on Day 1 postoperatively, 30-day mortality, length of hospital stay and incidence of specific major adverse events (Myocardial Infarction (MI), Myocardial Injury after Non-cardiac Surgery (MINS), Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), Postoperative Pulmonary Complications (PPC), Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), DVT, surgical site infection, postoperative pulmonary infection). Tertiary outcomes include time to resumption of normal diabetes therapy, incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia, incidence and duration of use of intravenous insulin infusion therapy and change in diabetic management at 30 days. Ethics and dissemination This study will adhere to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (amendment 2013) by the World Medical Association and the ICH-Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines E6(R2).

Methods Analysis of a multicenter research network TriNETX was performed including patients more than 16 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19. Outcomes in COVID-19 positive pwCF were compared with a propensity-matched cohort of people without CF. Results A total of 507,810 patients with COVID-19 were included (422 patients, 0.08% with CF; 507,388 patients, 99.92% without CF. Mean age at COVID-19 diagnosis in CF cohort was 46.6 ± 19.3 years, with female predominance (n = 225, 53.32%). Majority of the participants were Caucasian (n = 309, 73.22%). In the crude, unmatched analysis, mortality, hospitalization, critical care need, mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and composite (combination of intubation and mortality) outcome at 30 days was higher in the pwCF. Following robust propensity matching, pwCF had higher hospitalization rate (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.20-2.04), critical care need (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13-2.79), and acute renal injury (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.07-2.39) as compared to patients without CF. Conclusion People with CF are at risk of poor outcomes with COVID-19.5.2% of these patients died within one month of COVID-19 diagnosis, and more than one in 10 patients required critical care. Therefore, the relatively young median age of cystic fibrosis patients, and lower prevalence of obesity do not protect these patients from severe disease contrary to prior reports.","['Coronavirus', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Covid 19']",[],[]

These survivors experience a wide range of physical limitations and symptoms that negatively affect their health and quality of life. Research is needed to determine the rate of adherence, reasons for non-adherence, and interventions to improve adherence to acute inpatient rehabilitation among patients with cancer.  Objective:  To evaluate the rate of adherence and reasons for non-adherence to acute inpatient rehabilitation in patients with cancer.  Design, Setting, and Participants:  This was a secondary analysis of a retrospective study that assessed medical complications in 165 patients with cancer who had a median length of stay of 11 days (interquartile range of 8-14) in acute inpatient rehabilitation. We reviewed the records of all consecutive patients who underwent acute inpatient rehabilitation from September 1, 2017 through February 28, 2018 at a large academic, quaternary National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Center.  Main Outcomes and Measures:  We calculated the rehabilitation session adherence rate and descriptively summarized the reasons for non-adherence.  Results:  There were 78/165 (47%) patients that had 1 or more incomplete rehabilitation sessions due to medical complications. These patients had a median of 2 (interquartile range of 1-4) incomplete rehabilitation sessions. We noted other reasons for incomplete rehabilitation sessions in 146/165 (89%) patients, who had a median of 3 (interquartile range of 2-4) incomplete rehabilitation sessions. The median total number of days with incomplete rehabilitation sessions in the entire cohort was 2 (interquartile range 1-3).  Conclusion and Relevance:  Among patients with cancer undergoing acute inpatient rehabilitation, the adherence rate to 1-hour long intensive rehabilitation sessions were low due to medical complications and other reasons. This in turn affected compliance with the 3 hours of rehabilitation a day requirement for acute inpatient rehabilitation. Patients with cancer undergoing acute inpatient rehabilitation are medically complex and further research at multiple institutions with larger cohorts may be beneficial in further assessing adherence rates and reasons for non-adherence to improve participation in acute inpatient rehabilitation.","['Neoplasm', 'Rehabilitation', 'Exercise', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Guideline Adherence', 'inpatients']",[],[]

Methods Migraine Buddy is a smartphone application by individuals to record their migraine headache episodes, characteristics, and coping mechanisms. For this study, anonymized self-reported data from 163,176 adult Migraine Buddy users in the United States between January 2020 and May 2020, were analyzed for migraines associated with stress. A stress-related migraine is defined as one in which stress or anxiety was reported as a trigger or symptom. A questionnaire on the impact of COVID-19 on migraine and its management was also completed by 923 users from the United States in the app between April 2020 and May 2020. Results 88% of the Migraine Buddy database extract and 84% of the respondents are female, with a mean age of 36.2 years. The proportion of stress-related migraine attacks peaked at 53% on March 21 to 23, although the number of migraine attacks decreased. This followed the declaration of the COVID-19 national emergency on March 13 and a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Questionnaire respondents felt that the following added more stress: social isolation (22.6%), information overdose (21.2%), access to essentials (food, medication, etc.) (18.7%), and financial concerns (17.8%). To help manage migraine during COVID-19, respondents suggested stress and diet coaching programs and resources (medical articles, etc.) (34.0%), having the option for home delivery of medication (30.6%) and tele-consulting (25.5%). Conclusion Here, we report the change in the proportion of self-reported stress-related migraine in relation to evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its impact of migraine management.

Various initiatives on the African continent include ZaZiBoNa, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) collaborative medicines registration initiative. ZaZiBoNa has resulted in great savings in time and resources; however, identified challenges include lack of clear information regarding the participating countries registration processes and requirements as well as lengthy registration times. The aim of this study, therefore, was to compare the data requirements and review models employed in the assessment of applications for registration, the target timelines for key milestones and the metrics of applications received and approved in 2019 and 2020 by Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.  Methods:  A senior member of the division responsible for issuing marketing authorisations completed an established and validated questionnaire, which standardizes the review process, allowing key milestones, activities and practices of the six regulatory authorities to be identified and compared. The completed questionnaires were validated by the heads of the respective agencies.  Results:  The majority of applications received and approved by all six agencies in 2019 and 2020 were for generics. The mean approval times for generics varied across the countries, with ranges of 218-890 calendar days in 2019 and 158-696 calendar days in 2020. All three types of scientific assessment review models were used by the six agencies and data requirements and extent of scientific assessment were similar for five countries, while one conducted full reviews for new active substances. A large variation was observed in the targets set by the six agencies for the different milestones as well as overall approval times.

One such collaboration is the Southern African Development Community (SADC) medicines registration collaborative initiative, ZaZiBoNa. Countries participate in the initiative by contributing to regulatory reviews and good manufacturing practices inspections. The aim of this study was to review and compare the registration processes of regulatory authorities of Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe to identify strategies for better alignment.  Methods:  A senior member of the division responsible for issuing marketing authorisations completed an established and validated questionnaire, which standardises the review process, allowing key milestones, activities and practices of the six regulatory authorities to be identified and compared. The completed questionnaires were validated by the heads of the respective agencies.  Results:  The six countries vary in population and in the size of their respective regulatory agency and the resources allocated to regulatory reviews. The review processes of the six agencies were similar; however, differences were noted in the milestones recorded; for example, two of the countries did not record the start of the scientific assessment. Additionally, decisions for marketing authorisation were made by an expert committee in four of the countries and by the head of the agency and the Minister of Health in two countries. All six agencies implemented the majority of good review practices; however, the need for improvement in the areas of transparency and communication and quality decision making practices was a common finding for all six countries.  Conclusions:  Participation in the ZaZiBoNa initiative has improved the way in which the six agencies perform regulatory reviews in their countries, highlighting the realisation of one of the key objectives of the initiative, which was building the expert capacity of member countries. Other agencies in the SADC region and beyond can use the results of this study to identify best practices, which in turn, could improve their regulatory performance.","['Constrained Resources', 'Good Review Practices', 'Regulatory Reliance', 'South African Development Community', 'Zazibona']","['Technology ECDA', 'Reference Protocol', 'Protocol number', 'Ethics Statement', 'Science', 'LMS', 'PGR', 'United Kingdom', 'Health', 'Engineering']","['LMS/PGR/UH/04350].', 'LMS/PGR/UH/04350].']"

We investigated various DNA methylation datasets of blood samples with epigenetic aging signatures and performed targeted bisulfite amplicon sequencing. Overall, epigenetic clocks closely correlated with the chronological age of patients, either with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, lymphocytes did not reveal significantly accelerated telomere attrition.

Distance to a health facility influences maternal deaths. We explored women's mobility for maternal health, distances travelled for antenatal care (ANC) and childbirth among hard-to-reach Lake Victoria islands fishing communities (FCs) of Kalangala district, Uganda. Methods A cross sectional survey among 450 consenting women aged 15-49 years, with a prior childbirth was conducted in 6 islands FCs, during January-May 2018. Data was collected on socio-demographics, ANC, birth attendance, and distances travelled from residence to ANC or childbirth during the most recent childbirth. Regression modeling was used to determine factors associated with over 5 km travel distance and mobility for childbirth. Results The majority of women were residing in communities with a government (public) health facility [84.2 %, (379/450)]. Most ANC was at facilities within 5 km distance [72 %, (157/218)], while most women had travelled outside their communities for childbirth [58.9 %, (265/450)]. The longest distance travelled was 257.5 km for ANC and 426 km for childbirth attendance. Travel of over 5 km for childbirth was associated with adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) [AOR = 1.9, 95 % CI (1.1-3.6)], up to five years residency duration [AOR = 1.8, 95 % CI (1.0-3.3)], and absence of a public health facility in the community [AOR = 6.1, 95 % CI (1.4-27.1)]. Women who had stayed in the communities for up to 5 years [AOR = 3.0, 95 % CI (1.3-6.7)], those whose partners had completed at least eight years of formal education [AOR = 2.2, 95 % CI (1.0-4.7)], and those with up to one lifetime birth [AOR = 6.0, 95 % CI (2.0-18.1)] were likely to have moved to away from their communities for childbirth. Conclusions Despite most women who attended ANC doing so within their communities, we observed that majority chose to give birth outside their communities. Longer travel distances were more likely among AGYW, among shorter term community residents and where public health facilities were absent.

We aimed to identify predictive factors for urgent thoracotomy after chest-tube placement for blunt chest trauma in a civilian setting. Methods Polytraumatized patients (Injury Severity Score ≥16) with blunt chest trauma, submitted to a level I trauma centre during a period of 12 years that received at least one chest tube were included. Trauma mechanism, chest-tube output, haemoglobin values, need for cellular blood products, coagulopathies, rib fracture pattern, thoracotomy, and mortality were retrospectively analysed. Results 235 polytraumatized patients were included. Patients that received urgent thoracotomy (UT,  n  = 10) showed a higher mean chest-tube output within 24 h with a median (Mdn) of 3865 (IQR 2423-5156) mL compared to the group with no additional thoracic surgery (NT,  n  = 225) with Mdn 185 (IQR 50-463) mL ( p   p  = 0.786; INR:  p  = 0.215). There was an average number of 7.1(±3.4) rib fractures in UT and 6.7(±4.8) in NT ( p  = 0.649). Conclusions Chest-tube output remains the single most important predictive factor for urgent thoracotomy also after blunt chest trauma. Patients with a chest-tube output of more than 1300 mL within 24 h after trauma should be considered for transfer to a level I trauma centre with standby thoracic surgery.","['Chest injury', 'Blunt Chest Trauma', 'Thoracotomy', 'Polytrauma Management']",[],[]

The exact mechanisms for thyroid morphogenesis remain unclear. In this paper, we report a rare case of right lobe TH associated with Hurthle cell carcinoma. Case presentation A 59 years old woman was admitted with a neck lump increasing in size in the last 20 years. There were no symptoms of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. There was a palpable, painless 5 cm mass in the middle of the neck. Initial thyroid ultrasonography (USG) revealed an enlarged left lobe, with hypoechoic lesion with cystic component and calcification (TIRADS 4). However, the right lobe was non-visualized. Fine needle aspiration biopsy result tendency was a malignancy. Hence, isthmolobectomy was conducted. Pathology result was Hurthle cell carcinoma. On the ninth month, USG revealed fibrotic tissue in the right thyroid bed and bilateral lymphadenopathy. Due to discrepancy, the patient was planned for a neck exploration surgery and a right lobe incision. Intraoperatively, the right thyroid was absent. Intraoperative USG also confirmed no right thyroid lobe. Discussion Thyroid hemiagenesis can be visualized by using USG due to its practicality and cost effectiveness reasons. Follow up evaluations consisted of systematic monitoring of thyroid morphology and hormonal functions should follow the diagnosis of TH. Neck exploration surgery might need to be performed to clarify any discrepancy and confirm the diagnosis. Conclusion TH can be recognized through supporting examination; however, discrepancy may occur.","['Hurthle Cell Carcinoma', 'Thyroid Hemiagenesis', 'Neck Exploration Surgery']","['Ethical approval', 'Ethical', 'approval', 'institution', 'type', 'study', 'require']",[]

Methods The data of imported COVID-19 cases and their close contacts were obtained from National Notifiable Disease Report System of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and field epidemiological investigation reports by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) in Chengdu. The information of general characteristics and laboratory findings of this cluster were collected and summarized. Results One hundred and six (66.67%) of 159 charter flight passengers tested positive for COVID-19 before entry. Through treatment, all 159 people tested negative and meet the requirements of taking flights bound for China before boarding. However, there has been still 36 (22.64%) of them tested positive after entry. The median time from entry to confirmation was 1.0 day (Interquartile Range (IQR): 0-4.3).

However, its incorporation into reimbursement of health insurance benefits poses many challenges, including uncertain evidence and insufficient investment. This paper examines the wide gap between manufacturers, regulatory bodies, and health technology bodies regarding reimbursements for RMs focused cell therapy products. In this mixed-methods study, we first analyzed the sales of RMs approved in South Korea. In addition to exploring beliefs related to the market value of RMs, in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 experts (17 from bio-industries, two from the regulatory body, three from a health technology assessment (HTA) body, and two from the Pharmaceutical Benefit Coverage Assessment Committee [PBCAC]). Lastly, we surveyed PBCAC members about the market value of RMs. In total, 15 of the 20 developed cell therapy products are on the market in South Korea, and amounted to 0.24% of total pharmaceutical expenditures in 2018. We identified a wide gap between stakeholders and regulators regarding the market value and pricing of RMs. The interviewees from the pharmaceutical manufacturer association raised the issue of rising manufacturing costs and proposed a specific pricing policy for RMs. To bridge the gap between approval and reimbursement, stakeholders demand an alternative framework of value-based pricing. Conditional health insurance reimbursement may be an alternative to the traditional process in order to generate evidence of the effects of RMs using ""risk-based"" or ""outcome-based"" approaches.","['Pricing', 'Reimbursement', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Marketing Authorization', 'Conditional Coverage']","['Assessment Service', 'Health Insurance', 'Institution Review', 'Review Board', 'Insurance Review', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Review']",[]

We proposed to break the ""vicious circle"" of ""pain-sphincteric spasm-stenosis-pain"" with the postoperative use of self-mechanical anal dilation.  Methods:  We retrospectively analyzed patients with hemorrhoidal disease presenting with a minimum of piles of three quadrants, treated with radiofrequency hemorrhoidectomy between January 2018 and December 2019. All the patients that at 3 weeks presented sphincteric spasms with painful defecation, were considered. Thirty-nine patients performed the cycle of self-mechanical anal dilation (Group A). This group was 1:1 matched with homogeneous patients from our historical cohort of patients (Group B). The primary endpoint was the pain evaluation, secondary endpoints: WCS, overall satisfaction of the patient, anal sphincter spasm, scarring, and the incidence of postoperative stenosis.  Results:  In Group A mean VAS was 3.25 after 14 days of application and 1.15 at the end of the application. In Group B mean VAS was persistently higher, with a mean VAS of 5 ( p  = 0.000002) and 3.38 ( p  = 0.0000000000009). In Group A we observed an improvement of symptoms at the end, with a good overall satisfaction (Group A 7.4 vs. Group B 5.9;  p  = 0.0000007) and a better mean WCS (Group A WCS 2.8 vs. Group B WCS 4.18;  p  = 0.0001).

However, a literature review suggested that there were limited number studies evaluating the risk factors of polymicrobial PJI. Materials and methods Between 2015 January and 2019 December, a total of 64 polymicrobial PJI patients and 158 monomicrobial PJI patients in a tertiary center were included in this study and corresponding medical records were scrutinized. The diagnosis of PJI was based on 2014 MSIS criteria. Logistic regression was used to identify the association between various variables and polymicrobial PJI and ROC curve was used to identify their efficiency. Results The prevalence of polymicrobial PJI is 28.3% in our cohorts. After adjusting for the presence of sinus, previous and knee infection, isolation of enterococci (OR, 3.025; 95%CI (1.277,7.164) p = 0.012), infection with atypical organisms (OR, 5.032;95%CI: (1.470,17.229) p = 0.01), infection with gram-negative organisms (OR, 2.255; 95%CI (1.011,5.031) p = 0.047), isolation of streptococcus spp. (OR, 6; 95%CI (2.094,17.194) p = 0.001), and infection with CNS (OfR, 2.183;95%CI (1.148,4.152) p = 0.017) were risk factors of polymicrobial PJI compared to monomicrobial PJI. However, knee infection is related to a decreased risk of polymicrobial PJI with an adjusted OR = 0.479 (p = 0.023). Conclusion This study demonstrated that the prevalence of polymicrobial PJI is 28.3% in PJI patients. Moreover, the presence of sinus tract and previous joint revisions were risk factors for identifying different bacterial species in the intraoperative specimens.

Methods We reviewed current status of RSA drugs in South Korea. The number of appraisals and time gap between market approval and reimbursement per RSA drug were considered to quantify improvement of patients' access as they showed how rapidly decisions on reimbursement of RSA drugs were derived. Then, we applied a comparative analysis to determine whether the RSA drugs in South Korea were reimbursed in the UK, Italy, and Australia. Most data for this study were obtained from websites of the governmental department/agencies responsible for appraisal of drug reimbursement in each country. And literatures related to RSAs were investigated as well. Results The eligibility for Korean RSAs had two key components - drugs for cancer and rare diseases and not having other alternative treatments. As of the first half of 2019, there were 39 RSA drugs reimbursed in South Korea, the majority of which were financial-based schemes. Refund and expenditure cap were the representative types (89.7%). After introduction of RSAs, the time gap and number of appraisals were decreased. Based on the indications of RSA drugs, the level of drug coverage in South Korea was found lower than Italy, similar to the UK, and higher than Australia. Conclusions RSAs in South Korea significantly enhanced patients' access to new drugs and led to the alleviation of patients' out-of-pocket expenses. The drug coverage of South Korea had a level comparable to that of other countries. This study provides implications for countries that have a dual mission of containing pharmaceutical expenditure and improving access to new drugs.","['Economic evaluation', 'South Korea', 'Cost-effectiveness', 'Drug Reimbursement', 'Access To New Drugs', 'Risk Sharing Arrangement']",[],[]

The key to evaluating the efficacy of surgery includes the quality of postoperative wound healing and the occurrence of complications, so it is especially important to enhance the postoperative rehabilitation of hemorrhoids. This study investigates the method of postoperative treatment with Kangfuxin solution fumigation bath to explore the role of this method in the efficacy of patients after hemorrhoid PHH surgery and its effect on postoperative complications. It will accumulate some relevant information to improve the efficacy of hemorrhoid surgery and postoperative complications and open new ideas for further postoperative rehabilitation of other diseases in the anal area. A total of 106 patients with hemorrhoids were included in this study, all of whom were treated with PHH surgery. After surgery, they were randomly divided into a control group treated with warm water sitz bath and an observation group treated with Kangfuxin solution fumigation bath, with 53 cases in each group. We observed all patients' postoperative pain, bleeding, and perianal edema on a daily basis after surgery; we recorded the time of wound healing and hospital stay. The maximum anal squeeze pressure (MASP), anal defecation diastole pressure (ADDP), anal resting pressure (ARP), and the length of the high-pressure zone (HPZ) were used as observation indicators to evaluate the anal function of the patients before and after treatment. The results of the evaluation of the efficacy of patients after the treatment period showed that the total effective rate of treatment in the observation group (92.45%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (77.36%). The postoperative recovery showed that the wound healing time, hospitalization time, pain, bleeding, and edema scores at 3 and 5 days after surgery were lower in the observation group than in the control group; MASP and ARP increased in both groups after treatment compared to before treatment, with more increase in the observation group. The results suggest that patients with hemorrhoids after PPH should pay attention to postoperative care and rehabilitation. It also reveals that the application of Kangfuxin solution fumigation treatment has a significant effect, which can effectively reduce the patient's wound healing and hospital stay, while improving the patient's anal function and reducing postoperative complications, and is worthy of clinical promotion and application.",NaN,"['Nanhua Hospital', 'Affiliated Nanhua', 'Ethical Approval', 'ethics committee', 'Hospital', 'Approval', 'Affiliated', 'Nanhua', 'Ethical', 'study']",[]

We sought to clarify the prognostic significance of dipstick proteinuria in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Design A  P rospective m U lticente R  ob S ervational st U dy of pat I en T s with  H eart  F ailure with  p reserved  E jection  F raction (PURSUIT-HFpEF) registry. Participants and setting We assessed 851 discharged-alive patients in the PURSUIT-HFpEF registry who were initially hospitalised due to an acute decompensated HFpEF (EF≥50%) and elevated N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (≥400 ng/L) at Osaka University Hospital and other 30 affiliated hospitals in the Kansai region of Japan. Patients received a urine dipstick test, and were divided into two groups according to the absence or presence of proteinuria. A trace or more of dipstick proteinuria was defined as the presence of proteinuria. Main outcome measures A composite of cardiac death or HF rehospitalisation. Results Median age was 83 years and 473 patients (55.6%) were female. Five hundred and two patients (59%) were proteinuria (-) and 349 patients (41%) were proteinuria (+). The composite endpoint and HF rehospitalisation occurred more often in proteinuria (+) individuals than proteinuria (-) individuals (log-rank p=0.006 and p=0.007, respectively); but cardiac death did not (log-rank p=0.139). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that the presence of proteinuria was associated with the composite endpoint (HR: 1.47, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.01, p=0.016), and HF rehospitalisation (HR: 1.48, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.05, p=0.020), but not with cardiac death (HR: 1.52, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.76, p=0.172). Conclusions Dipstick proteinuria may be a prognostic marker in patients with HFpEF. Evaluation of proteinuria by a urine dipstick test may be a simple but useful method for risk stratification in HFpEF.

Amendment was obtained after the approval of safety of HCQ for the selected subjects according to specific criteria.","Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine were found to have positive results in some non-randomized clinical trials with more benefit in decreasing the viral load of COVID-19. HCQ is a lysosomotropic and lipophilic drug that can penetrate cell membranes, and accumulates in the acidic lysosomes. The high concentration of alkaline HCQ increases the pH in lysosomes from the normal levels of 4.7-4.8 to 6 which leads to inhibition of lysosomes functions and thus, prevents the entry of coronavirus into cells.

Environmental factors are known to play a role in the frequency and severity of VOC. Methods The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between weather changes and VOC in children with SCD. Data on daily temperature, humidity, and wind speed in Brooklyn, New York was collected over one year. Daily census data of children < 20 years of age with SCD presenting with VOC during the study period was retrieved from the Health Information Systems database. Data was analyzed to determine correlations of daily temperature, humidity, and wind speed with the number of VOCs using Pearson correlation co-efficient and time-series statistics. Results The total number of episodes of VOC was 344, with 218 outpatients and 126 inpatients. Total episodes of VOC peaked during January (n=44), while they were lowest in July (n=16). We observed a negative correlation of VOC with temperature (r= -0.05, p=0.04) and no correlation with humidity (r=0.01, p=0.85) was noted. Analysis of wind speed showed a negative correlation with VOC which is not significant. Conclusion No significant correlation was found between changes in humidity or wind speed and VOC.

We sought to define contemporary practice patterns for the diagnosis and treatment of PTA. Study design Cross-sectional survey. Setting The 15-question survey was distributed to members of the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (CSO) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS). Methods An iterative, consensus-based process was used for survey development. Primary outcomes were to determine methods of diagnosis and first-line treatments for PTA. Exploratory, secondary outcomes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models. Results The survey response rate was 12.6% (n = 1176). Most participants were attending staff (86%) in a community hospital setting (60%) and had been in practice for more than 20 years (38%). Most respondents (78%) indicated that at least half of the time, cross-sectional imaging had already been performed before they were consulted. Half of respondents (49%) indicated that they perform incision and drainage of the abscess as first-line treatment, while few (16%) provide medical management alone. In exploratory analysis, participants from the AAO-HNS had higher odds of imaging already being performed before consultation (odds ratio [OR], 11.7; 95% CI, 4.6-29.4) and increased odds of using medical management alone as a first-line treatment (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2) compared to respondents from the CSO. Conclusion There is wide practice variation in the diagnosis and management of acute, uncomplicated PTA among otolaryngologists in Canada and the United States.

Our objective was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of multiple rechallenges. Patients and methods We retrospectively identified 22 mCRPC patients previously treated with docetaxel and/or androgen receptor-targeted agents who received multiple cabazitaxel rechallenges in 9 French centers. Cabazitaxel was initiated at a dose of 25 mg/m 2  q3week. A reduced dose (20 mg/m 2  q3w) or an alternative schedule (mainly 16 mg/m 2  q2w) was increasingly used for subsequent rechallenges. Progression-free survival, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, best clinical response, and grade ≥3 toxicities were collected. Overall survival was calculated from various time points. Results Twenty-two patients with an initial response to cabazitaxel were rechallenged at least twice. The median number of cabazitaxel cycles was 7 at first cabazitaxel treatment, 6 at first rechallenge, and 5 at subsequent rechallenges. Median progression-free survival at first rechallenge was 9.6 months and 5.6 months at second rechallenge. Median overall survival was 50.9 months from the first cabazitaxel dose, 114.9 months from first life-extending therapy initiation in mCRPC, and 105 months from mCRPC diagnosis. There was no cumulative grade ≥3 neuropathy or nail disorder and one case of febrile neutropenia. Conclusion Cabazitaxel multiple rechallenges may be a treatment option without cumulative toxicity in heavily pretreated patients having a good response to first cabazitaxel use and still fit to receive it. Novelty & impact statements Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer can be treated with Cabazitaxel after docetaxel and androgen receptor-targeted agent.

Some of these changes may have been beneficial to perinatal outcomes; however, other factors such as reduced access to face-to-face healthcare may have contributed negatively to antenatal care. The aim of this audit was to evaluate neonatal admissions in the South-West of England during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the previous two years 2018-2019. Anonymised birth and neonatal admission rates from January to December 2020 was obtained and compared to data from 2018 to 2019. The results demonstrate a decreasing in neonatal unit admissions between 2018 and 2020, 9.48% of live births in 2018 (95% CI 9.17, 9.80) to 8.89% (95% CI 8.65, 9.13) in 2020 (p = 0.002).Conclusion: There were no significant differences across gestational groups. It is unclear without nationwide data whether our observed trends, decreased neonatal admissions over the past 3 years, are generalisable and related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research exploring the impact of lockdowns on behaviour change during pregnancy and support services is warranted to understand the implications of pandemics on pregnancy and preterm birth. What is Known: • The COVID-19 lockdown had a series of intended and unintended consequences; some of which may have been beneficial to perinatal outcomes. • Research suggests that preterm births have not significantly changed overall, but they have decreased in high-income countries. What is New: • In our audit, analysing retrospective data of regional birth and neonatal admission from the South-West of England, we observed a decrease in live birth rates between 2018 and 2020. • A reduction in neonatal unit admissions was observed from 2018 to 2020 with no significant differences across gestational groups. The reduction from 2019 to 2020 was smaller than that from 2018 to 2019 implying that the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was not necessarily implicated.","['Birth', 'Neonatology', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Patient Admissions', 'Covid-19']",[],[]

As this was a retrospective study, the need for obtaining informed consent from patients was waived by the Institutional Review Board."," Background Toy slime is popular in Korea, and in parallel, pre-pubertal girls visit hospitals for early pubertal signs. Thus far, numerous studies have investigated the association of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with precocious puberty (PP). However, there is a lack of studies on the clinical manifestations and sex hormones. We aimed to investigate early pubertal development in Korean girls with or without a history of toy slime exposure and determine changes in bone age, Tanner stage, and sex hormones. Methods In this study, 140 girls underwent stimulation tests at Kyungpook National University Children's Hospital Endocrinology Department, during January 2018 and December 2020. Patients were divided into two groups for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test and frequency of exposure to toy slime (EDCs). GnRH stimulation test was conducted after an intravenous injection of 100 µg of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. Slime exposure was defined as Slime ≥ 3 times/week for ≥ 3 months. Results History of slime exposure was found in 14 of 58 and 65 of 82 patients in the central PP (CPP) and non-CPP groups, respectively. Slime-exposed patients had advanced bone age, although their Tanner stage was low. Patients with a history of toy slime exposure were 5.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with non-CPP than patients without slime exposure (p  Conclusions Exposure to toy slime in prepubertal girls may be associated with rapid clinical advancement of pubertal development and bone age, and the patients appear more likely to be diagnosed with non-CPP.","['Sex hormones', 'Precocious puberty', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Gnrha Treatment']","['Chilgok Hospital', 'Kyungpook National', 'National University', 'University Chilgok', 'Institutional Review', 'Review Board', 'Ethical approval', 'approval number', 'Daegu', 'Korea']",['2020-04-029).']

The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors criteria for authorship (ICMJEc) are intended to prevent abuses of authorship and are used by more than 5500 medical journals. However, the binary ICMJEc have not yet been quantified. Aim To develop a numeric scoring rubric for the ICMJEc to corroborate the authenticity of authorship claims. Methods The four ICMJEc were separated into the nine authorship components of conception, design, data acquisition, data analysis, interpretation of data, draft, revision, final approval and accountability. In spring 2021, members of an international association of medical editors rated the importance of each authorship component using an 11-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no importance) to 10 (most important). The median component scores were used to calibrate the pairwise comparisons in an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The AHP priority weights were multiplied against a four-level perceived effort/capability grade to calculate an authorship score. Results Sixty-six decision-making medical editors completed the survey. The components had the median scores/AHP weights: conception 7.5/5.3%; design 8/8.9%; data acquisition 7/3.6%; data analysis 7/3.6%; interpretation of data 8/8.9%; draft 8/8.9%; revision 8/8.9%; final approval 9/20.1%; and accountability 10/31.8%, with Kruskal-Wallis Chi 2  = 65.11, p  Conclusion The editors rated accountability as the most important component of authorship, followed by the final approval of the manuscript; data acquisition had the lowest median importance score for authorship. The scoring rubric (https://tinyurl.com/eyu86y96) transforms the binary tetrad ICMJEc into 9 quantifiable components of authorship, providing a transparent method to objectively assess authorship contributions, determine authorship order and potentially decrease the abuse of authorship. If desired, individual journals can survey their editorial boards and use the AHP method to derive customized weightings for an ICMJEc-based authorship index.","['Survey', 'Ethics', 'authorship', 'Analytic Hierarchy Process', 'Academic Medicine', 'Icmje', 'Medical Editors']","['Hospital REB', 'Approval Michael', 'Michael Garron', 'Garron Hospital', 'Ethics Approval', 'REB', 'Approval', 'Michael', 'Garron', 'Hospital']",[]

Preliminary studies investigated alcohol consumption at the early stages of lockdown, but no longitudinal data regarding its evolution during and after the first lockdown are currently available. Methods We investigated changes in alcohol consumption among a convenience sample of 1,693 French-speaking Belgian adults using a 3-stage longitudinal online survey. All participants reported their consumption at different stages of lockdown: before lockdown onset (retrospectively, T0), at 2 different times during lockdown (T1 and T2), and after lockdown offset (T3). We also measured socio-demographic variables and the harmfulness of drinking patterns before lockdown. Results A mixed model with negative binomial distribution indicated that participants decreased their alcohol consumption after lockdown onset and returned to their initial alcohol consumption after lockdown offset. Younger individuals (18-30 years old) were more likely to decrease their consumption during the lockdown period (T1 and T2) than the periods preceding or following lockdown (T0 and T3), especially if they presented hazardous or problematic drinking patterns before lockdown. We only observed a rebound effect after lockdown offset among young moderate drinkers. All participants kept stable their alcohol consumption during lockdown (T1 and T2). Conclusions Lockdown onset and offset constitute key periods for alcohol consumption changes during the COVID-19 crisis, particularly in youth and in individuals with hazardous or problematic drinking patterns.","['Alcohol', 'Longitudinal study', 'Drinking Patterns', 'Lockdown', 'Covid-19']","['Ethics Participants', 'Participants provided', 'Ethical Committee', 'Research Institute', 'written informed', 'informed consent', 'Psychological Sciences', 'Sciences Research', 'ethical', 'World Medical']",[]

Aim To explore the presentation of PEH, coding of homelessness, and associated health conditions in mainstream primary care general practices in England. Design & setting EMIS electronic database search of medical records was conducted across 48 general practices in a clinical commissioning group (CCG), representing one of the most socioeconomically deprived regions in England, which also lacks a specialist primary healthcare service for PEH. Method Key terms and codes were used to identify PEH, their respective diagnoses across 22 health conditions, and prescribed medications over the past 4 years. Results From a population of approximately 321 000, 43 (0.013%) people were coded as PEH, compared with a homelessness prevalence of 0.5% in the English general population. Mental health conditions were the most prevalent diagnoses among the PEH registrants (56.6%); the recorded prevalence of other common long-term conditions in PEH was lower than the levels observed in PEH registered with specialist homelessness health services. Conclusion In a population with approximately four times higher rate of statutory homelessness, PEH representation in mainstream general practices was under-represented by several folds. As homelessness overlaps with mental health, substance misuse, and long-term health conditions, consistent coding of homelessness in medical records is imperative in order to offer tailored support and prevention actions when patients present for services.","['England', 'Primary Health Care', 'General Practice', 'Homeless Persons', 'Homelessness']",[],[]

The ideal fluid of choice in regard to efficacy and safety remains uncertain. Compared with crystalloid fluid, colloid fluid may result in less positive fluid balance. However, some synthetic colloids are associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). This study compared the effects of succinylated gelatin (4%) (GEL) with compound sodium lactate (CSL) on urinary AKI biomarkers in patients after cardiac surgery. Methods Cardiac surgical patients who required an intravenous fluid bolus of at least 500 mL postoperatively were randomly allocated to receive GEL or CSL as the resuscitation fluid of choice for the subsequent 24 h. Primary outcomes were serial urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C concentrations measured at baseline, 1 h, 5 h and 24 h after enrolment, with higher concentrations indicating greater kidney injury. Secondary biomarker outcomes included urinary clusterin, α1-microglobulin and F 2 -isoprostanes concentrations. Differences in change of biomarker concentration between the two groups over time were compared with mixed-effects regression models. Statistical significance was set at P  Results Forty cardiac surgical patients (n = 20 per group) with similar baseline characteristics were included. There was no significant difference in the median volume of fluid boluses administered over 24 h between the GEL (1250 mL, Q1-Q3 500-1750) and CSL group (1000 mL, Q1-Q3 500-1375) (P = 0.42). There was a significantly greater increase in urinary cystatin C (P  2 -isoprostanes (P = 0.020) concentrations over time in the GEL group, compared to the CSL group. Change in urinary NGAL concentration (P = 0.68) over time was not significantly different between the groups. The results were not modified by adjustment for either urinary osmolality or EuroSCORE II predicted risk of mortality. Conclusions This preliminary randomised controlled trial showed that use of succinylated gelatin (4%) for fluid resuscitation after cardiac surgery was associated with increased biomarker concentrations of renal tubular injury and dysfunction, compared to crystalloid fluid.

Ethics approval was also gained from the University of Southern Queensland which enabled access to students undertaking postgraduate study at this distance-learning university.," Background Nurses have limited time outside of work for continuing professional development. Consequently, strategies need to be explored to enable them to better maintain their competence. This article describes recent research investigating if nursing behaviours in the use of mobile technologies could be leveraged to better facilitate mobile learning. It addresses a gap in the existing literature around how nurses resource their own professional development and learning in the absence of appropriate learning resources in the workplace. Methods The research employed a classic grounded theory methodology which was conducted with 27 registered nurses from Public and Private Hospitals in Queensland and external postgraduate nursing students from Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory enrolled at the University of Southern Queensland. Results The Theory of Economising Learning describes how nurses maintain competence with limited resources. Unfavourable staffing levels and a fast-paced workplace mean that nurses rarely prioritise their professional learning while at work. Instead, it requires the nurse to contribute personal resources including time and money. Though the research revealed nurses were unconcerned about using mobile technologies, they were concerned about maintaining competence with limited resources. To counter this, nurses economised their learning by balancing personal resources against their motivation to maintain competence. The process of economising learning begins and ends with the development of the nurse's personal curriculum in response to what they identify as being the most significant knowledge deficits at work that jeopardise their competence. A learning opportunity that addresses the knowledge deficit is sought. Nurses balance the opportunity to address the deficit against the cost of personal resources, to decide if they will engage with the opportunity and update their personal curriculum accordingly. Conclusions It is suggested that workplaces need to create reasonable expectations within nurses to address knowledge deficits and provide the resources, including time, to allow them to do so without personal cost. It is also necessary for workplaces to moderate the flow of learning opportunities so as not to overwhelm and demotivate the nurses. Currently, nurses use several strategies to optimise their learning using mobile technologies which could be leveraged in the workplace.","['Professional Development', 'Continuing Education', 'Online Learning', 'Nurse Education', 'Mobile Learning']","['considerations Multi-site', 'private hospitals', 'Queensland Health', 'Multi-site ethics', 'Ethical considerations', 'large private', 'ethics approval', 'Hospitals', 'Southern Queensland', 'Queensland']",[]

The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.,"Pathophysiology of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) is complex and still misunderstood. At a time when treatments with disease-modifying potential are being developed, identification of early markers of neurodegeneration is essential. Intracerebral sodium accumulation could be one of them. Indeed, it may be in relation to the mitochondrial dysfunction that early exists in iPD. For the first time, we used brain sodium ( 23 Na) MRI to explore sodium concentration changes that have already been reported to be related to neurodegeneration in other diseases. We prospectively included 10 iPD patients (mean age 52.2 ± 5.9 years-old) with motor symptoms that started  1 H) and  23 Na MRI at 7T. We then extracted quantitative Total Sodium Concentration (TSC) from five regions of interest known to be early impaired in iPD [substantia nigra (SN), putamen, caudate nucleus, pallidum, thalamus] and in one region supposed to be relatively spared in the first stages of the disease [cortical gray matter (neocortex)]. Potential atrophy in these structures was also investigated with  1 H MRI. Relative to healthy subjects, iPD patients showed higher TSC in the SN (43.73 ± 4.64 vs. 37.72 ± 5.62,  p  = 0.006 after Bonferroni correction). A trend of increase in sodium concentrations was found within the pallidum (45.80 ± 4.19 vs. 41.07 ± 4.94,  p  = 0.017), putamen (48.65 ± 4.58 vs. 43.66 ± 5.04,  p  = 0.041) and the cortical gray matter (56.34 ± 3.92 vs. 50.81 ± 5.50,  p  = 0.021). No significant brain atrophy was found in patients compared to controls. Thus, alteration of sodium homeostasis in the SN in the absence of atrophy could be considered as a potential early marker of cellular dysfunction in iPD.","['Sodium', 'Biomarker', 'Neurodegeneration', ""Parkinson's Disease"", 'Ultra High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging']","['Sud Méditerranée', 'Personnes Sud', 'Ethics Statement', 'Protection des', 'des Personnes', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'Méditerranée', 'Statement', 'Comité']",[]

Methods:  A semi-quantitative questionnaire was developed covering the organisation of agency, biosimilar development criteria and marketing authorisation process and sent to seven regulatory agencies covering the BRICS-TM countries. All data was kept anonymous and confidential. Data processing and analysis was carried out; descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data and content analysis was employed to generate themes for qualitative data.  Results:  Out of the seven regulatory agencies included in the study, six representatives provided the responses. The perspectives of these six regulatory agencies varied on a number of aspects relating to the review criteria for biosimilar development and licencing process. The most prevalent model for data assessment is the ""full review"" of a marketing authorisation application. There is lack of a standard approach across the agencies on sourcing of the reference biological product,  in vivo  toxicity studies and confirmatory clinical studies. Most agencies restrict interaction with biosimilar developers and any scientific advice is non-binding. The marketing authorisation approval depends on scientific assessment of the dossier, sample analysis and GMP certification. The agencies do not issue any public assessment report specifying the summary basis of biosimilar approval.  Conclusion:  Regulatory agencies across the six emerging economies are steadily improving the regulatory mechanism in the area of biosimilars. However, there remains scope for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes by encouraging open and transparent interaction with developers, adopting a flexible approach toward accepting advanced analytical data in lieu of clinical studies and enhancing regulatory reliance amongst agencies.

TAS is a novel pragmatic concept for axillary surgery de-escalation that combines palpation-guided removal of suspicious nodes with the sentinel procedure and, optionally, imaging-guided localization. Pre-specified study endpoints quantified surgical extent and reduction of tumor load. Results A total of 296 patients were included at 28 sites in four European countries, 125 (42.2%) of whom underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and 71 (24.0%) achieved nodal pathologic complete response. Axillary metastases were detectable only by imaging in 145 (49.0%) patients. They were palpable in 151 (51.0%) patients, of whom 63 underwent NACT and 21 had residual palpable disease after NACT. TAS removed the biopsied and clipped node in 279 (94.3%) patients. In 225 patients with nodal disease at the time of surgery, TAS removed a median of five (IQR 3-7) nodes, two (IQR 1-4) of which were positive. Of these 225 patients, 100 underwent ALND after TAS, which removed a median of 14 (IQR 10-17) additional nodes and revealed additional positive nodes in 70/100 (70%) of patients. False-negative rate of TAS in patients who underwent subsequent ALND was 2.6%. Conclusions TAS selectively reduced the tumor load in the axilla and remained much less radical than ALND.","['Breast cancer', 'Axillary Dissection', 'Breast Surgery', 'Axillary Staging', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Procedure']",[],[]

Mucormycosis is an uncommon infection; however, there have been isolated sporadic tiny outbreaks around the world. With the substantial increase in COVID-19 cases in India, there is a parallel increase in the number of cases of Mucormycosis. A few reports raising unusual concomitant mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients have raised a possible association between the two diseases.

Periodontal disease causes both systemic inflammation and local inflammation of the oral cavity. Systemic inflammation is a major cause of cerebral aneurysms. The aim of our study was to determine whether the presence of periodontal disease is related to the occurrence of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in a nationwide population-based cohort.  Materials and Methods:  We analyzed data on demographics, previous medical history, and laboratory test results of 209,620 participants from the Korean National Health Insurance System-Health Screening Cohort. The presence of periodontal disease and oral hygiene parameters, including the number of lost teeth, tooth brushing frequency per day, dental visits for any reason, and expert teeth scaling, were investigated. The occurrences of unruptured cerebral aneurysms (I67.1) were defined according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases Related Health Problems-10.  Results:  The mean age of the participants was 53.7 ± 8.7 years, and 59.4% were male. Periodontal disease was found in 20.9% of the participants. A total of 2160 (1.0%) cases of unruptured cerebral aneurysms developed after 10.3 years of median follow up. In multivariate analysis, the presence of periodontal disease was significantly associated with an increased risk of unruptured cerebral aneurysms (hazard ratio: 1.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-1.34,  p   Conclusion:  The presence of periodontal disease could be associated with the occurrence of unruptured cerebral aneurysms. It should be noted that when periodontal diseases are present, the risk of aneurysms is increased in the future.TRANSLATE with x EnglishArabicHebrewPolishBulgarianHindiPortugueseCatalanHmong DawRomanianChinese SimplifiedHungarianRussianChinese TraditionalIndonesianSlovakCzechItalianSlovenianDanishJapaneseSpanishDutchKlingonSwedishEnglishKoreanThaiEstonianLatvianTurkishFinnishLithuanianUkrainianFrenchMalayUrduGermanMalteseVietnameseGreekNorwegianWelshHaitian CreolePersian// TRANSLATE with COPY THE URL BELOW Back EMBED THE SNIPPET BELOW IN YOUR SITE Enable collaborative features and customize widget: Bing Webmaster PortalBack//.","['Longitudinal study', 'periodontal disease', 'Oral Hygiene', 'Unruptured Cerebral Aneurysm']",[],[]

Three main explanations for this variability have been described in the literature: (1) the drinking behavior of animals, (2) the drug concentration in water, and (3) the inter-individual variability in the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. This article assesses the relative importance of these three sources of exposure variability for doxycycline and amoxicillin using pharmacokinetic simulations and by observing watering behavior, and analyzes the consequences of this exposure variability. The water consumption behavior was by far the most important factor as it led to a variation in exposures of up to a factor of 7 between piglets. The second most influential factor was the drug concentration in the drinking water with variations ranging from -43.3% to +48.7% at the beginning and the end of the pipeline. Finally, the between-individual variation in PK parameters depends on the drug, but had a low impact on exposure variability. In the most variable case (doxycycline), the mean ratio between the 10% less exposed and the 10% most exposed piglets varied from 3.7 without PK parameters variability to 6 with PK variability. For both drugs, this study also showed that only a small percentage of the piglets (36%) could be considered as well exposed in case of infection by  Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae  or  Pasteurella multocida . There may be some existing technical ways to reduce this important variability. However, their cost and ease of implementation merit examination.","['Antibiotics', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'Variability', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Exposure Response']",[],[]

However, data on risk indicators for urinary tract infections are limited and outdated. The research is a secondary analysis. The study was a prospective multicenter cohort study of low-risk pregnant women. Logistic regression was used to identify risk indicators for urinary tract infections. The incidence of urinary tract infections was 9.4%. Multivariate logistic regression showed that a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and the presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in the present pregnancy were associated with urinary tract infections (resp. OR 3.14, 95%CI 1.40-7.02 and OR 1.96 95%CI 1.27-3.03). Women with a urinary tract infection were at increased risk of preterm birth compared to women without a urinary tract infection (12 vs. 5.1%; adjusted HR 2.5 95%CI 1.8-3.5).

However, histopathological and laboratory studies suggest that autoimmunity may not be the main pathogenic driver. We analyzed gene expression both in cell lines of nasal mucosa exposed to cocaine and in CIMDL patients to determine whether genetic predisposition might cause such lesions, which are observed in a minority of cocaine abusers. Materials and methods The genetic expression profile of nasal mucosa exposed to cocaine was analyzed. Rare variants of expressed genes were searched in patients with CIMDL using exome sequencing and bio-informatics. Results We identified 462 genes that were induced by cocaine, mainly related to apoptosis and autophagy in response to oxidative stress. Under the hypothesis that genes linked to the phenotype are also induced by cocaine itself, a rare variants burden test was performed to select genes that were significantly enriched in rare mutations. Next, 11 cocaine abusers with CIMDL and no other relevant medical comorbidities underwent exome sequencing, and 12 genes that were significantly enriched in the burden test and present in at least 10 patients were identified. An in-depth analysis of these genes revealed their involvement in apoptosis, tissue homeostasis, autophagy, and response to oxidative stress. Conclusions Oxidative stress and rare genetic alterations in the response to reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, autophagy, and tissue regeneration are plausible drivers of damage affecting nasal mucosa exposed to cocaine crystals and, consequently, the pathogenic mechanism behind CIMDL.","['Cocaine', 'Chronic disease', 'Paranasal Sinus Disease', 'Cimdl', 'Craniofacial Region']",[],[]

The partial replacement of underdeveloped parts of the valve and saving of well-developed may have advantages versus replacing the whole valve in terms of durability and patient outgrowth of the prosthesis. Case presentation This report describes a case of the PV reconstruction by allograft replacement of an underdeveloped anterior leaflet in an adolescent patient who previously corrected pulmonary stenosis during the first year of her life. The normal anatomy of the right and left leaflets was revealed. The rudimental anterior leaflet determined the annular restenosis. The monocusp with the related supporting aortic wall was sewn instead of the anterior leaflet. The Z-score of the pulmonary annulus changed from minus 3, 9 before to +0.8 after the procedure. The excellent function of the PV was observed in 1-year follow-up. Discussion Valve deterioration over time will have a less negative impact on the function when it occurs in a limited area. The annular dilatation becomes unlikely if the annulus predominantly consists of natural tissues. The procedural effectiveness allows the transcatheter valve-in-valve therapy in case of late dysfunction. The expected feature of the procedure described is that the growth of the PV remains possible. Conclusion If allograft replacement of the PV is scheduled and allograft is available, the partial replacement may be superior to replacement of the whole valve in terms of durability and patient outgrowth of the prosthesis.","['Congenital heart disease', 'Allograft', 'Case Report', 'Pulmonary Valve Restenosis', 'Pulmonary Valve Reconstruction']","['Ethical approval', 'Ethical', 'institution', 'approval', 'study', 'exempt', 'ethnical']",[]

However, the mechanism by which ferroptosis modulates acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of ferroptosis-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in AML and establish a corresponding prognostic model. Methods RNA-sequencing data and clinicopathological characteristics were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and ferroptosis-related genes were obtained from the FerrDb database. The ""limma"" R package, Cox regression, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used to determine the ferroptosis-related lncRNA signature with the lowest Akaike information criteria (AIC). The risk score of ferroptosis-related lncRNAs was calculated and patients with AML were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on the median risk score. The Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression were used to evaluate the prognostic value of the risk score. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were performed to explore the biological functions of the ferroptosis-related lncRNAs.

The World Health Organization (WHO) states that effective documentation of drowning is required to describe drowning frequency and to underpin effective drowning prevention intervention, thus improving the quality of data describing drowning frequency represents a key initiative. The water incident database (WAID) has been used to document UK fatal and non-fatal water-based incidents since 2009. WAID has not undergone a systematic evaluation of its data or data collection procedures to establish if the database meets the WHO requirements. The present study investigated the characteristics of UK fatal drowning incidents and audited current WAID data capture procedures. Methods Data for the fatal drowning cases recorded between 2012 and 2019 were reviewed. Descriptive data were generated 1) to describe fatal drownings in the UK's WAID in this period; 2) a sub-set of drownings were audited i) for completeness of data entry and, based on source documents, ii) for quality of data entry; 3) these processes were used to make recommendations for onward revisions to WAID. Results A total of 5051 fatalities were recorded between 2012 and 2019. Drowning was most frequent amongst males aged 35 to 60 years (n = 1346), whilst suspected accidents and suicides accounted for 44 and 35% of fatalities. Suicide by drowning was at a peak in the most recent year of data analysed (i.e., 2019; 279 cases) highlighting an urgent need for targeted intervention. Audit part 2i) indicated that 16% of all fields were incomplete, thus indicating potential redundancy, duplication, or the need for onward review. Audit part 2ii) indicated high levels of agreement (80 ± 12%) between audited cases and the 'true' WAID entries. Conclusions This study confirms WAID as a rigorous, transparent and effective means of documenting UK drownings thereby meeting WHO requirements for data quality; yet future improvements are recommended. Such findings allow researchers and policy makers to use WAID to further investigate UK drowning with a view to improving public safety measures and drowning prevention interventions.

EMMPRIN induces a metastatic phenotype by triggering the production of matrix metalloproteinase proteins (MMPs) such as MMP1 and MMP2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in cancer cells and the surrounding stromal cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and role of EMMPRIN in osteosarcoma. Methods The level of EMMPRIN expression was evaluated using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 6 tumor-derived osteosarcoma cell lines and compared with that in normal osteoblasts. To study the prognostic significance of EMMPRIN expression, immunohistochemistry was carried out in prechemotherapy biopsies of 54 patients. siRNA knockdown of EMMPRIN in SaOS-2 cells was conducted to explore the role of EMMPRIN. To study the role of EMMPRIN in tumor-stromal interaction in MMP production and invasion, co-culture of SaOS-2 cells with osteoblasts and fibroblasts was performed. Osteosarcoma 143B cells were injected into the tail vein of BALB/c mice and lung metastasis was analyzed. Results EMMRIN mRNA expression was significantly higher in 5 of 6 (83%) tumor-derived cells than in MG63 cells. 90% of specimens (50/54) stained positive for EMMPRIN by immunohistochemistry, and higher expression of EMMPRIN was associated with shorter metastasis-free survival (p = 0.023). Co-culture of SaOS-2 with osteoblasts resulted in increased production of pro-MMP2 and VEGF expression, which was inhibited by EMMPRIN-targeting siRNA. siRNA knockdown of EMMPRIN resulted in decreased invasion. EMMPRIN shRNA-transfected 143B cells showed decreased lung metastasis in vivo. Conclusions Our data suggest that EMMPRIN acts as a mediator of osteosarcoma metastasis by regulating MMP and VEGF production in cancer cells as well as stromal cells.

The cumulative 1-year incidence of all-cause death was significantly higher in the nonhome discharge group than in the home discharge group. The nonhome discharge group compared with the nonhome discharge group was associated with a higher adjusted risk for all-cause death (hazard ratio, 1.66;  P <0.001). Conclusions The discharge destination of patients with acute decompensated heart failure is influenced by factors such as prehospital social background, age, body mass index, low self-care ability, events during hospitalization (worsening heart failure, stroke, etc), functional decline, and length of hospital stay; moreover, the prognosis of nonhome discharge patients is worse than that of home discharge patients.

However, a lack of reliable and streamlined POCUS assessment tools with demonstrated validity remains a significant barrier to widespread clinical integration. The ultrasound competency assessment tool (UCAT) was derived to be a simple, entrustment-based competency assessment tool applicable to multiple POCUS applications. When used to assess a FAST, the UCAT demonstrated high internal consistency and moderate-to-excellent inter-rater reliability. The objective of this study was to validate the UCAT for assessment of a four-view transthoracic cardiac POCUS. Results Twenty-two trainees performed a four-view transthoracic cardiac POCUS in a simulated environment while being assessed by two observers. When used to assess a four-view cardiac POCUS the UCAT retained its high internal consistency ([Formula: see text] and moderate-to-excellent inter-rater reliability (ICCs = 0.61-0.91; p's ≤ 0.01) across all domains. The regression analysis suggestion that level of training, previous number of focused cardiac ultrasound, previous number of total scans, self-rated entrustment, and intent to pursue certification statistically significantly predicted UCAT entrustment scores [F (5,16) = 4.06, p = 0.01; R 2  = 0.56]. Conclusion This study confirms the UCAT is a valid assessment tool for four-view transthoracic cardiac POCUS. The findings from this work and previous studies on the UCAT demonstrate the utility and flexibility of the UCAT tool across multiple POCUS applications and present a promising way forward for POCUS competency assessment.","['Assessment', 'Medical education', 'Cardiac Ultrasound', 'Focused Echocardiography', 'Competency-based Medical Education', 'Pocus']",[],[]

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) requires long-duration multidisciplinary treatment. Teleconsultation and shared care are suggested solutions to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. However, these may be challenging to implement among patients who come from the lower economic strata. We report the disastrous impact of the pandemic on the care of EOC by comparing patients who were treated during the pandemic with those treated in the previous year. We collected the following data from newly diagnosed patients with EOC: time from diagnosis to treatment, time for completion of planned chemotherapy, and proportion of patients completing various components of therapy (surgery and chemotherapy). Patients treated between January 2019 and September 2019 (Group 1: Pre-covid) were compared with those treated between January 2020 and December 2020 (Group 2: During covid pandemic). A total of 82 patients were registered [Group 1: 43(51%) Group 2: 39(49)]. The median time from diagnosis to start of treatment was longer in group 2 when compared to group 1 [31(23-58) days versus 17(11-30) days (p = 0.03)]. The proportion of patients who had surgery in group 2 was lower in comparison to group 1 [33(77%) versus 21(54%) (p = 0.02)].

Maternal mortality ratio remains high in Cameroon (782 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births). Extant literature suggest a positive association between women empowerment indicators and maternal healthcare utilisation in general. In Cameroon, this association has not received scholarly attention. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the association between women empowerment indicators and quality ANC in Cameroon. Methods Data of 4615 women of reproductive age were analysed from the women's file of the 2018 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey. Quality ANC (measured by six indicators) was the outcome of interest. Binary Logistic Regression was conducted. All results of the Binary Logistic Regression analysis were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All analyses were done using Stata version 14. Results In all, 13.5% of the respondents received quality ANC. Women with low knowledge level (aOR = 0.66, CI 0.45, 0.98) had a lesser likelihood of receiving quality ANC compared to those with medium knowledge level. Women who highly approved wife beating (aOR = 0.54, CI 0.35, 0.83) had lesser odds of receiving quality ANC compared to those with low approval of wife beating. Conclusion The study has pointed to the need for multifaceted approaches aimed at enhancing the knowledge base of women. The Ministry of Public Health should collaborate and intensify female's reproductive health education. The study suggests that women advocacy and maternal healthcare interventions in Cameroon must strive to identify women who approve of wife beating and motivate them to disapprove all forms of violence.","['Pregnancy', 'Quality', 'Cameroon', 'Women', 'Reproductive Health', 'Antenatal']","['study benefited', 'DHS Program', 'Ethics approval', 'DHS', 'Institut Nationale', 'Human Services', 'ethical', 'National Institute', 'ethical standards', 'Ethics']",[]

In this study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of MT for distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions using the CatchView Mini (CVM; Balt, Montmorency, France).  Methods:  This was a prospective single-center analysis of patients with a single MCA-M2 occlusion treated with the CVM device. Consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled from October 2018 to March 2020. Efficacy outcomes included successful recanalization [modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) 2b/3], procedure times, and number of device passes. Clinical outcomes included National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score (NIHSS) at discharge, 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) and safety outcomes included hemorrhagic complications, and 90-day mortality.  Results:  A total of 45 patients (mean age: 74.0 ± 12.6; 53.3% [24/45] female) were included in the study. Upon admission, 33.3% (15/45) of patients were mRS 3-5; and mean NIHSS was 13.2 ± 4.2 Mean time from symptom onset to final angiography was 250.0 ± 83.4 min with a mean intervention duration of 34.0 ± 12.6 min. The mean number of device passes was 1.8 ± 1.5 final mTICI 2b/3 was achieved in 91.1% (41/45) of patients. Eight hemorrhagic complications (17.8%, 8/34) occurred, none of which were symptomatic. At 90-days, 57.8% (26/45) patients were functionally independent and the rate of mortality was 15.6% (7/45).

In many andrology laboratories, semen analysis is primarily centered on analyzing basic parameters (sperm count, motility, and viability). We examined the role of cytomorphological analysis on Papanicolaou (PAP)-stained smears in the work up of male infertility, with special reference to leukocytospermia and assessed the morphological features of sperms in these cases.  Materials and Methods  All cases signed out as ""leukocytospermia"" between November 2017 and January 2018 were evaluated. Cases showing pus cells (≥ 1/5hpf) on cytosmear evaluation were also analyzed. Parameters obtained on modified Neubauer's chamber, wet mount preparations, and autoanalyzer SQA-IIC-P (Medical Electronic Systems, Israel) were tabulated. PAP-stained smears were examined to assess morphological defects and other findings, if any.  Results  Out of 348 semen samples, 6 (1.72%) were diagnosed as leukocytospermia, all displaying pus cells on cytomorphological evaluation. Five cases having white blood cells  9  /L were analyzed, which displayed the presence of pus cells (≥ 1/5 hpf) on cytosmear preparations (1.43%). Nine cases (81.8%) showed reduced motile sperm concentration, functional sperm concentration, and sperm motility index. Morphological evaluation of the PAP-stained smears showed mid-piece defects in 18.1% cases.  Conclusion  Diligent cytomorphological evaluation of semen is essential to diagnose leukocytospermia, assess morphological defects, and serve as a quality control measure.","['Semen', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Infertility', 'Leucocytospermia']",[],[]

Because the use of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics may reduce the likelihood of undetected medication gaps, initiating an LAI medication may affect resource utilization and costs. The LAI aripiprazole lauroxil (AL) was approved in the United States (US) in 2015 for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.

The co-administration of a local anaesthetic and corticosteroid aims to reduce pain after the injection, although no studies have directly compared this with using corticosteroid alone. The aim is to determine whether pain experienced during the 24 h after a corticosteroid injection to the hand and wrist is no worse than (not inferior to) the pain experienced after a corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection. Methods A single-site, patient- and assessor-blinded, non-inferiority randomised control trial recording pain visual analogue scale (VAS) scores in patients with a clinical diagnosis of trigger finger, de Quervains tenosynovitis or carpal tunnel syndrome, treated with a 1-ml triamcinolone (40 mg/1 ml) injection co-administered with or without 1 ml of 1% lidocaine. The primary aim is to investigate a difference in pain VAS scores at 1 h after the injection using a mean change score. A 95% power calculation was made using a minimally clinical important difference of 20 mm as the clinically admissible margin of non-inferiority and an assumed standard deviation of 25 mm, from previous studies. Including a 20% fall out rate, 100 patients are required. Discussion Patients with a clinical diagnosis of trigger finger, de Quervains and carpal tunnel syndrome, are over the age 18 years old and who are able to give written informed consent will be included. Patients will be excluded if they have had previous surgery or corticosteroid injection for the condition being treated at the site considered for injection. Patients will be electronically randomised and injections delivered during their clinic appointment. Pain is assessed using a 100-mm VAS score taken, before and at the time of injection and at 5 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 24 h after the injection.

Evidence suggests that increased distress during ICU stay increases risk of PICS-F, resulting in difficulty returning to their normal lives after the ICU experience. Effective interventions to improve PICS-F are currently lacking. In the present trial, we hypothesised that information provision using ICU-specific Virtual Reality for Family members/relatives (ICU-VR-F) may improve understanding of the ICU and subsequently improve psychological well-being and quality of life in relatives of patients admitted to the ICU. Methods and analysis This multicentre, clustered randomised controlled trial will be conducted from January to December 2021 in the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We aim to include adult relatives of 160 ICU patients with an expected ICU length of stay over 72 hours. Participants will be randomised clustered per patient in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention or control group. Participants allocated to the intervention group will receive ICU-VR-F, an information video that can be watched in VR, while the control group will receive usual care. Initiation of ICU-VR-F will be during their hospital visit unless participants cannot visit the hospital due to COVID-19 regulations, then VR can be watched digitally at home. The primary objective is to study the effect of ICU-VR-F on psychological well-being and quality of life up to 6 months after the patients' ICU discharge. The secondary outcome is the degree of understanding of ICU treatment and ICU modalities. Ethics and dissemination The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, approved the study and local approval was obtained from each participating centre (NL73670.078.20).

The duration of obtaining genetic test results is varies. The demand to learn the diagnosis of a possible untreatable illness involves a struggle between uncertainty and a lifetime chronic disease. The current uncertainty of their child's condition and the long wait for a diagnosis may increase the parents' anxiety level and cause difficulties in the continuation of diagnostic procedures in some families. This study aimed to investigate the prediagnosis and postdiagnosis anxiety levels of parents who have a child with a rare genetic disease. Method The parents in this study, mothers or fathers, admitted their children to the Bezmialem Vakıf University Medical Genetics Clinic due to a suspected rare genetic disease (n = 40). Researchers created ""The Sociodemographic Questionnaire"" and used it to analyze the parents' sociodemographic status. In addition, they used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to determine the anxiety levels of the parents. Results The state anxiety levels of parents decreased significantly after learning the diagnosis. However, there was no statistically significant decrease observed in trait anxiety levels. Conclusion Data from this study revealed that informing parents about their child's disease and properly explaining to them the expected difficulties might help to reduce their anxiety levels.

We aim to understand patent challenges and identify the factors that are associated with successful patent challengers under the patent linkage system in South Korea. Methods We constructed a novel dataset that combined information on manufacturers with detailed data about their patent challenges after introduction of the patent linkage system. Based on the number of successful patent challenges, manufacturers were categorized into non-challengers, passive challengers, and aggressive challengers. Then, two types of logistic models were applied to identify the factors associated with successful and aggressive challengers. Findings Only 39 active ingredients were challenged by 77 manufacturers from March 2015 to December 2019. Of 171 manufacturers, 94 (55 %) were non-challengers, 58 (34 %) were passive challengers who had succeeded in fewer than 4 patent challenges, and 19 (11 %) were aggressive challengers who had succeeded in 4 or more patent challenges. Higher sales, more employees, and a greater number of reimbursed drugs were associated with being a patent challenger, while a greater number of reimbursed drugs was associated with being an aggressive challenger. Conclusion Some manufacturers utilize patent challenges to strengthen their product portfolios in the market. However, under the patent linkage system, the frequency of patent challenges is limited in South Korea compared to the United States.

Accordingly, we conducted this study to provide an updated account of physician deaths in South Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze and compare the different characteristics associated with physician mortality amongst the countries of the region. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study by using published news reports on the websites of news agencies from 9 selected countries in South Asia. Our study included only those physicians and doctors who died after contracting COVID-19 from their respective workplaces. All available data about the country of origin, type of, sex, age, medical or surgical specialty, and date of death were included. Results The total number of physician deaths reported due to COVID-19 in our study was 170, with half (87/170, 51%) of the deaths reported from Iran. Male physician deaths were reported to be 145 (145/170 = 85%). Internal Medicine (58.43%) was the most severely affected sub-specialty. The highest physician mortality rate in the general population recorded in Afghanistan (27/1000 deaths). General physicians from India [OR = 11.00(95% CI = 1.06-114.08), p = 0.045] and public sector medical practitioners from Pakistan [aOR = 4.52 (95% CI = 1.18-17.33), p = 0.028] were showing significant mortality when compared with other regions in multivariate logistic regression. Conclusion An increased number of physician deaths, owing to COVID-19, has been shown in South Asia. This could be due to decreased personal protective equipment and the poor health care management systems of the countries in the region to combat the pandemic. Future studies should provide detailed information of characteristics associated with physician mortalities along with the main complications arising due to the virus.",NaN,[],[]

They also experience fear of acute hyperglycemia that can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis as well as chronic complication including diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy. No previous research was conducted in Saudi Arabia to assess diabetes distress among adolescents and youth with T1D. This study aimed to assess diabetes distress in adolescents and youth with T1D and its relation to clinical characteristics, glycemic control and diabetes co-morbidities. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted on 158 patients at King Abdulaziz University Hospital and Dr. Erfan and Bagedo General Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Data about participants’ characters, episodes of DKA, last HbA1c level, diabetes co-morbidities were collected. Diabetes distress (DD) was assessed by the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) and Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) scores. Results The prevalence of diabetes distress among our population of adolescents with T1D was 24.1%. The mean scores of PAID and DDS were 43.56 ± 13.84 and 2.22 ± 1.05, respectively. Patients with suboptimal HbA1c had significantly higher mean PAID and DDS scores. There is also a significant positive correlation between HbA1c level and number of ketoacidosis episodes. A highly significant positive correlation was found between PAID and DDS scores. Conclusion This study found that participants with uncontrolled HbA1c had significantly higher mean PAID and DDS scores with a significant positive correlation between the last HbA1c measured level and number of ketoacidosis attacks and PAID and DDS scores. Future studies on larger samples are needed to implement interventions to minimize the burden of diabetes distress among adolescents with T1D.","['Glycemic control', 'Adolescents', 'Distress', 'Hba1c', 'Saudi', 'Type 1 Diabetes (T1d)', 'Dds', 'Paid']",[],[]

All participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study.," Background The number of adults aged over 65 years is rapidly increasing in several Southeast Asian countries. Muscle mass decreases with age, leading to sarcopenia. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether differences exist in the body composition and physical strength, according to ethnicity, among community-dwelling Japanese and Thai older adults living in Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. Methods A survey was conducted in February and March 2019. Japanese and Thai adults aged ≥ 60 years living in Chiang Mai Province were recruited through community clubs. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire that enabled collection of data on age, sex, educational background, marital status, annual income, current medical conditions, smoking and alcohol consumption, and exercise habits. Measurements were collected on height, weight, body composition, blood pressure, hand grip, and walking speed for 6 m. Body composition was measured using a standing-posture 8-electrode multifrequency bioimpedance analysis analyzer. Hand grip of each hand was measured with the patient in the standing position using a digital grip dynamometer. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with skeletal muscle mass index (SMI). Results Of the total 119 participants, 47 were Japanese (26 men, 21 women) and 72 were Thai (16 men, 56 women). The prevalence of a low SMI was 3/26 (12%), 1/21 (5%), 6/16 (38%), and 5/56 (9%) among Japanese men, Japanese women, Thai men, and Thai women, respectively. The prevalence of low muscle strength was 2/26 (8%), 2/21 (10%), 3/16 (19%), and 13/56 (23%) among Japanese men, Japanese women, Thai men, and Thai women, respectively. There were significant differences between ethnic groups in body mass index for both sexes, percentage body fat in women, SMI in men, and average grip strength in men. Ethnic group, sex, age, and body mass index were independent predictors of SMI.

Recent research proposes that differences in social mixing by sex could alter infection patterns in TB. We examine evidence for two mechanisms by which social-mixing could increase men's contact rates with TB cases. First, men could be positioned in social networks such that they contact more people or social groups. Second, preferential mixing by sex could prime men to have more exposure to TB cases. Methods We compared the networks of male and female TB cases and healthy matched controls living in Kampala, Uganda. Specifically, we estimated their positions in social networks (network distance to TB cases, degree, betweenness, and closeness) and assortativity patterns (mixing with adult men, women, and children inside and outside the household). Results The observed network consisted of 11,840 individuals. There were few differences in estimates of node position by sex. We found distinct mixing patterns by sex and TB disease status including that TB cases have proportionally more adult male contacts and fewer contacts with children. Conclusions This analysis used a network approach to study how social mixing patterns are associated with TB disease. Understanding these mechanisms may have implications for designing targeted intervention strategies in high-burden populations.","['Tuberculosis', 'Social Network', 'Contact Patterns', 'Male-bias']","['Review Board', 'Public Health', 'Georgia Institutional', 'Institutional Review', 'Higher Degrees', 'Degrees Research', 'Uganda National', 'National Council', 'Makerere University', 'University School']",[]

We aimed to evaluate outcomes with subjective clinical scores and imaging modalities after repair of isolated anterior horn tears, at 24 months’ follow-up. Methods Records of all patients that opted for surgical repair of isolated, anterior horn tears of the medial and lateral meniscus were retrospectively reviewed, between 2016 and 2018. All patients were treated with arthroscopic outside-in technique by the same surgeon. Preoperative and postoperative clinical files were accessed to recover records of preoperative symptomatology, patient-reported scores [International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) rating, Lysholm score and Tegner activity level], preoperative and postoperative MRI data and time from injury to surgery. Results Mean age of eight patients was 25.25 years (range 18-37 years). Diagnostic preoperative MRI revealed isolated anterior horn tear of the lateral meniscus and medial meniscus in five patients and an isolated anterior horn tear of the medial meniscus in three patients. Mean time from injury to surgical repair was 23.75 days (range 7-43). We considered seven out of eight repairs to be successfully healed. At 24 months’ follow-up: Mean Lysholm score was 92.25 (range 89-95), Tegner activity scale score was 6.5 (range 5-8) and IKDC score was 91.78 (range 87.8-94.4).

However, the key assumption justifying this practice, that comprehensive genomic profiling could lead to effective anticancer therapies and improve patient outcomes, remains unproved. Methods Comprehensive genomic profiling was prospectively applied in 1564 advanced NSCLC patients to identify potentially actionable genomic alterations. Patients were assigned to genotype-matched targeted therapies or nonmatched therapies based on the profiling results. Its utility in directing treatments was determined by the proportion of patients receiving genotype-matched targeted therapies and the proportion of patients being enrolled into genotype-matched clinical trials. Its impacts on patient outcomes were assessed by comparing progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who received a genotype-matched and nonmatched therapy. Results From October 2016 to October 2019, tumor genomic profiles were established in 1166 patients, leading to a matched targeted therapy in 37.7% (n = 440) and a genotype-matched trial enrollment in 20.9% of patients (n = 244). Potentially actionable alterations were detected in 781 patients (67.0%). For these patients, a genomic profiling-directed matched therapy significantly improved PFS (9.0 months vs 4.9 months, P  Conclusions Comprehensive genomic profiling is of clinical utility in assisting treatment selection, facilitating clinical trial enrollment, and improving patient outcomes in advanced NSCLC. However, for patients carrying alterations without standard-of-care targeted drugs, the interpretation of genomic profiling results should be careful given the low likelihood of benefit from the investigational or off-label use of targeted therapies in this population in the current treatment landscape.

Adherence to inhaled therapy, therefore, provides an important process measure to understand the success of care and can be used as a quality indicator. Defining adherence is problematic, however, since the number of prescribed treatments varies considerably between PwCF. The problem is less pronounced among those with  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (PA), for whom at least three daily doses of nebulized therapy should be prescribed and who thus constitute a more homogeneous group. The UK CF Registry provides routine data on PA status, but data are only available 12 months after collection. In this study, we aim to prospectively identify contemporary PA status from historic registry data. Method UK CF Registry data from 2011 to 2015 for PwCF aged ≥16 was used to determine a pragmatic prediction rule for identifying contemporary PA status using historic registry data. Accuracy of three different prediction rules was assessed using the positive predictive value (PPV). The number and proportion of adults predicted to have PA infection were determined overall and per center for the selected prediction rule. Known characteristics linked to PA status were explored to ensure the robustness of the prediction rule. Results Having CF Registry defined chronic PA status in the two previous years is the selected definition to predict a patient will have PA infection within the current year (population-level PPV = 96%-97%, centre level PPV = 85%-100%). This approach provides a subset of data between 1852 and 1872 patients overall and a range of 8 to 279 patients per center. Conclusion Historic registry data can be used to contemporaneously identify a subgroup of patients with chronic PA. Since this patient group has a narrower treatment schedule, this can facilitate a better benchmarking of adherence across centers.","['Adherence', 'Process', 'Quality improvement', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Outcome']","['Health Service', 'Huntingdon Research', 'STATEMENT National', 'National Health', 'Trust Steering', 'research ethics', 'Steering Committee', 'Registry data', 'ETHICS STATEMENT', 'Ethics Committee']",[]

In 2016 multidisciplinary care measures were developed for all local health districts across NSW. The aim of this study was to identify system-level changes and quality improvement activities across the NSW cancer system linked to reporting on these measures. Methods Focus group discussions were used to generate a synergy of ideas from key stakeholders. An exploratory descriptive approach was used within the ontological position of Framework Analysis, the analysis method chosen for this research study, sitting most closely within pragmatism. The use of Framework Analysis in the analytic strategy is because it is well-suited to addressing policy issues and maintaining specific focus within a wider dataset. Results Two focus groups were held with a total of 18 purposively selected participants. Four primary themes emerged: value of electronic documentation; role clarity; relationships; and future development of measures. Key findings included that the reporting of performance measures has expedited the development of electronic documentation and data extraction from the multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT), identified barriers and facilitators to MDT data collection and supported MDT improvement activities across NSW. Conclusions The findings of this study have highlighted that MDTs and their meetings across NSW are harnessing technological advancements to support and further develop their MDTs, as well as the challenges of implementing new processes within the MDTM. This study adds a unique contribution to knowledge of how the reporting of measures can assist in understanding variation in the development and implementation of multidisciplinary teams, as well as highlighting future programs of work to decrease variation in multidisciplinary team meetings and quality improvement activities.","['Cancer', 'Quality improvement', 'Multidisciplinary Teams', 'Key Performance Indicators', 'System Improvement']",[],[]

We describe our experience implementing an early neurorehabilitation protocol for patients with COVID-19-associated DoC in the intensive care unit (ICU) and evaluate factors associated with recovery. Methods During the initial COVID-19 surge in New York City between March 10 and May 20, 2020, faced with a disproportionately high number of ICU patients with prolonged unresponsiveness, we developed and implemented an early neurorehabilitation protocol, applying standard practices from brain injury rehabilitation care to the ICU setting. Twenty-one patients with delayed recovery of consciousness after severe COVID-19 participated in a pilot early neurorehabilitation program that included serial Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) assessments, multimodal treatment, and access to clinicians specializing in brain injury medicine. We retrospectively compared clinical features of patients who did and did not recover to the minimally conscious state (MCS) or better, defined as a CRS-R total score (TS) ≥ 8, before discharge. We additionally examined factors associated with best CRS-R TS, last CRS-R TS, hospital length of stay, and time on mechanical ventilation. Results Patients underwent CRS-R assessments a median of six (interquartile range [IQR] 3-10) times before discharge, beginning a median of 48 days (IQR 40-55) from admission. Twelve (57%) patients recovered to MCS after a median of 8 days (IQR 2-14) off continuous sedation; they had lower body mass index (p = 0.009), lower peak serum C-reactive protein levels (p = 0.023), higher minimum arterial partial pressure of oxygen (p = 0.028), and earlier fentanyl discontinuation (p = 0.018). CRS-R scores fluctuated over time, and the best CRS-R TS was significantly higher than the last CRS-R TS (median 8 [IQR 5-23] vs. 5 [IQR 3-18], p = 0.002). Earlier fentanyl (p = 0.001) and neuromuscular blockade (p = 0.015) discontinuation correlated with a higher last CRS-R TS. Conclusions More than half of our cohort of patients with prolonged unresponsiveness following severe COVID-19 recovered to MCS or better before hospital discharge, achieving a clinical benchmark known to have relatively favorable long-term prognostic implications in DoC of other etiologies. Hypoxia, systemic inflammation, sedation, and neuromuscular blockade may impact diagnostic assessment and prognosis, and fluctuations in level of consciousness make serial assessments essential. Early neurorehabilitation of these patients in the ICU can be accomplished but is associated with unique challenges. Further research should evaluate factors associated with longer-term neurologic recovery and benefits of early rehabilitation in patients with severe COVID-19.","['Coma', 'Unconsciousness', 'Covid-19', 'Sars-cov-2', 'Early Neurological Rehabilitation']",[],[]

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of mifepristone with misoprostol treatment on the efficacy of patients with missed abortion (MA) and the safety of this drug regimen. 95 patients with MA treated in our hospital from February 2019 to April 2021 were collected as the subjects of this study, and the patients were divided into the control and the research groups according to different treatment modalities. Among them, 46 cases in the control group were treated by diethylstilbestrol combined with oxytocin and 49 cases in the research group were treated by mifepristone combined with misoprostol, and both groups underwent curettage after medication. The rates of complete abortion, time of embryo expulsion, time of operation, intraoperative bleeding, time of postoperative vaginal bleeding, amount of vaginal bleeding, rate of one-time curettage, the levels of serum estradiol (E2), progesterone (P),  β -chorionic gonadotropin ( β -hCG), and interleukin-18 (IL-18), and the incidence of adverse effects in the two groups were examined and compared. Alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (Scr) were used as indicators to evaluate the safety of the drug. The results showed that the rates of complete abortion and one-time curettage were significantly higher in the study group than in the control group, while the time of embryo expulsion, operation time, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative vaginal bleeding time, and vaginal bleeding were significantly lower than in the control group. The serum E2, P, and  β -hCG levels before curettage in both groups were significantly higher, and IL-18 levels were significantly lower than those at the time of admission, with E2, P, and  β -hCG levels increasing more and IL-18 levels decreasing more in the research group. After drug treatment, no abnormal changes in liver and kidney functions were observed in both groups, and the incidence of adverse reactions was at a similar and lower level in both groups. This shows that mifepristone with misoprostol is a safer and more effective drug regimen for the treatment of MA, which can regulate the levels of serum sex hormones and inflammatory factors in the body, promote the shedding of placental tissue, and create conditions for improving the rate of curettage.",NaN,"['Health Hospital', 'Ethics Committee', 'Zhuji Maternal', 'Child Health', 'Ethical Approval', 'Hospital', 'Approval', 'Ethics', 'Committee', 'Zhuji']",[]

Previous studies support an association between peri-implantitis and periodontal pathogen. Thus, we investigated the bacterial flora of peri-implantitis patients in comparison to those of healthy implant and periodontitis patients. Materials and methods In total, 70 patients visiting Tokyo Dental College Chiba Hospital were divided into four groups: healthy, periodontitis, healthy implant, and peri-implantitis. For each group, the following five periodontal pathogens were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Prevotella intermedia. Results The average copy number of total bacteria was significantly higher in the periodontitis group than in the other groups. P. gingivalis was detected in the periodontitis and peri-implantitis groups at levels as high as 18.92% and 12.29%, respectively, and P. intermedia was found in the peri-implantitis group at a rate of 2.06%. Nevertheless, periodontal pathogens were generally detected at lower levels in the peri-implantitis group than in the periodontitis group. Conclusion We found lower bacterial counts in the peri-implantitis group relative to the periodontitis group. Our results suggest that the peri-implant tissue is less resistant to bacteria, so even a small number of bacteria can be a risk factor for peri-implantitis and the causative agent of peri-implantitis can be bacteria other than periodontal pathogen.","['Microbiology', 'Diagnosis', 'Clinical research', 'Peri-implantitis']",[],[]

Methods This prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of acute exposure that air pollution have on reproductive outcomes in different moments of the IVF process. Women undergoing IVF living in Barcelona were recruited. Individual air pollution exposures were modelled at their home address 15 and 3 days before embryo transfer (15D and 3D, respectively), the same day of transfer (D0), and 7 days after (D7). The pollutants modelled were: PM 2.5  [particulate matter (PM) ≤2.5 μm], PM coarse  (PM between 2.5 and 10μm), PM 10  (PM≤10 μm), PM 2.5  abs, and NO 2  and NOx. Outcomes were analyzed using multi-level regression models, with adjustment for co-pollutants and confouding factors. Two sensitivity analyses were performed. First, the model was adjusted for subacute exposure (received 15 days before ET). The second analysis was based on the first transfer performed on each patient aiming to exclude patients who failed previous transfers. Results One hundred ninety-four women were recruited, contributing with data for 486 embryo transfers. Acute and subacute exposure to PMs showed a tendency in increasing miscarriage rate and reducing clinical pregnancy rate, although results were not statistically significant. The first sensitivity analysis, showed a significant risk of miscarriage for PM 2.5  exposure on 3D after adjusting for subacute exposure, and an increased risk of achieving no pregnancy for PM 2.5 , PM coarse  and PM 10  on 3D. The second sensitivity analysis showed a significant risk of miscarriage for PM 2.5  exposure on 3D, and a significant risk of achieving no pregnancy for PM2.5, PM coarse  and PM10 particularly on 3D. No association was observed for nitrogen dioxides on reproductive outcomes. Conclusions Exposure to particulate matter has a negative impact on reproductive outcomes in IVF patients. Subacute exposure seems to increase the harmful effect of the acute exposure on miscarriage and pregnancy rates.

This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and multicenter clinical trial. 360 postoperative patients with stage IIa-IIIc colorectal cancer will be randomly assigned into placebo-control group, intervention group I, and intervention group II, taking the mimetic granules of YWF as placebo, HGWD granules and DSD granules, respectively. All subjects will receive oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen at the same time. EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 will be used to assess the degree of OIPN as the primary outcome measure. The grades of OIPN, quality of life, chemotherapeutic efficacy, and the number of completed chemotherapy cycles are selected as the secondary outcome measures.  Discussion . Based on the condition of no recognized effective drugs in preventing OIPN, evidence-based medical study will be conducted for seeking a breakthrough in the field of Chinese herb medicine.

Characterizing the role of the mutation activities is of importance to understand how the evolution of pathogen shapes the epidemiological outcomes at population scale. Methods We developed a statistical framework to reconstruct variant-specific reproduction numbers and estimate transmission advantage associated with the mutation activities marked by single substitution empirically. Using likelihood-based approach, the model is exemplified with the COVID-19 surveillance data from January 1 to June 30, 2020 in California, USA. We explore the potential of this framework to generate early warning signals for detecting transmission advantage on a real-time basis. Results The modelling framework in this study links together the mutation activity at molecular scale and COVID-19 transmissibility at population scale. We find a significant transmission advantage of COVID-19 associated with the D614G substitution, which increases the infectivity by 54% (95%CI: 36, 72). For the early alarming potentials, the analytical framework is demonstrated to detect this transmission advantage, before the mutation reaches dominance, on a real-time basis.

No empirical evidence of this effect however has been gathered in people living with dementia. This study aims to identify the causes and effects of COVID-19-related deconditioning in people living with dementia. Methods This is a longitudinal phenomenological qualitative study. Participants living with dementia, their caregivers and therapists involved in the Promoting Activity, Independence and Stability in Early Dementia (PrAISED) process evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic were qualitatively interviewed at two time points: the baseline 2 months after the national lockdown was imposed in England (i.e., May 2020), the follow up 2 months after the first set (i.e. July 2020). The data were analysed through deductive thematic analysis. Results Twenty-four participants living with dementia, 19 caregivers and 15 therapists took part in the study. Two themes were identified: Causes of deconditioning in people living with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and effects of deconditioning in people living with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic. A self-reinforcing pattern was common, whereby lockdown made the person apathetic, demotivated, socially disengaged, and frailer. This reduced activity levels, which in turn reinforced the effects of deconditioning over time. Without external supporters, most participants lacked the motivation / cognitive abilities to keep active. Provided the proper infrastructure and support, some participants could use tele-rehabilitation to combat deconditioning. Conclusion The added risks and effects of deconditioning on people with dementia require considerable efforts from policy makers and clinicians to ensure that they initiate and maintain physical activity in prolonged periods of social distancing.

Case presentation A 32-year-old woman presented in her third trimester of gestation at 30 weeks feeling pain and uterine contractions. Clinical findings and investigations Ultrasound examination showed multiple pregnancies with four alive intrauterine pregnancies, but quintuplets could not be ruled out. Fetal heart activities were present, and the amniotic fluid was normal in amount. Interventions and outcome Extensive preparations made included four sets of ventilators. We did an emergency cesarean section under spinal anesthesia: five alive infants, three boys and two girls delivered in cephalic and breech presentations. Conclusions Quintuplet pregnancy is rare but poses relevant clinical problems to both the obstetrician and the neonatologist. Relevance and impact The takeaway lesson from this case would be that Pregnancy with multiples is considered a high-risk pregnancy; with more complications observed as the number of fetuses increases, their effective follow-up requires early diagnosis with regular monitoring.

Low-to-medium risk novel medical devices can be reviewed under the De Novo umbrella before they can proceed to market, and this process can be fairly cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming. An alternate faster and less-expensive pathway to going to market is the 510(k) pathway. In this approach, if the device can be shown to be substantially equivalent in safety and effectiveness to a pre-existing FDA-approved marketed device (or ""predicates""), it can be cleared to market. Due to the possibility of daisy-chaining predicate devices, it can very quickly be difficult to unravel the logic and justification of how a particular medical device's equivalence was established. From patients' perspective, this minimizes transparency in the process. From a vendor perspective, it can be difficult to determine the right predicate that applies to their device. Methods We map the connectivity of various predicates in the medical device field by applying text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques on data publicly made available by the FDA 78000 device summaries were scraped from the US FDA 510(k) database, and a total of 2,721 devices cleared by the 510(k) regulatory pathway in 2020 were used as a specific case study to map the genealogy of medical devices cleared by the FDA. Cosine similarity was used to gauge the degree of substantial equivalence between two medical devices by evaluating their device descriptions and indications for use. Recalls and complaints for predicate devices were extracted from the FDA's Total Product Life Cycle database using html scraping and web page optical character recognition to determine the similarity between class 1 recalled devices (the most severe form of device recall) and other substantially equivalent devices. A specific product code was used to illustrate the mapping of the genealogy from a De Novo device. Results and discussion The ancestral tree for the medical devices cleared in 2020 is vast and sparse, with a large number of devices having only 1-2 predicates. Evaluation of substantial equivalence data from 2003-2020 shows that the standard for substantial equivalence has not changed significantly. Studying the recalls and complaints, shows that the insulin infusion pump had the highest number of complaints, yet none of the recalled devices bore significant degree of text similarity to currently marketed devices. The mapping from the De Novo device case study was used to develop an ancestry map from the recalled predicate (recalled due to design flaws) to current substantially equivalent products in the market.

An algorithm-based digital recommendation system (DRS) for healthcare services was developed within the context of the telemedicine research project ATMoSPHÄRE. The plausibility of the DRS was tested and the results used to examine if, and to what degree, the DRS provides useful assistance to GPs. Methods The plausibility of the recommendations of the DRS were tested with the Delphi procedure (n = 8) and Interviews (n = 4) in collaboration with the GPs. They proposed services and assistive products they considered appropriate for two multi-morbid patients. Furthermore, GPs had to report whether, and to what degree they deemed the algorithm-generated recommendations appropriate. Significant quantitative differences between the GPs', and the algorithm-generated, recommendations were evaluated with paired-samples-Wilcoxon-test. Results The first Delphi round revealed a high variability regarding the amount and character of services recommended by the physicians (1 to 10 recommendations, mean = 5.6, sd = 2.8). These professional recommendations converged after consideration of the algorithm-generated recommendations. The number of algorithm-generated recommendations which were judged as appropriate ranged between 7 and 17 of a total of 20 (mean = 11.9, sd = 2.5). The interviews revealed that the additional algorithm-generated recommendations which were judged appropriate contained mainly social care services. Conlusion The DRS provides GPs with additional appropriate recommendations for the need-based care of patients, which may not have been previously considered. It can therefore be assessed as a helpful complement in the primary care of multi-morbid patients.","['Decision support system', 'Primary Care', 'Telemedicine', 'Ehealth', 'Multimorbidity', 'Recommender System']",[],[]

Study design Periapical radiographic images of 34 single-rooted teeth-19 with VRF, and 15 without VRF were acquired using two digital systems-Digora Toto, and Digora Optime, and exported into four different file formats-TIFF, BMP, PNG, and JPEG, totaling 272 radiographs. The radiographs were assessed by five examiners for the detection of VRF, using a 5-point scale (1-definitely absent; 2-probably absent; 3-uncertain; 4-probably present; 5-definitely present). Diagnostic values of area under the ROC curve, specificity, and sensitivity for the diagnosis of VRF were calculated. The results were compared by two-way Analysis of Variance with post hoc Tukey's test. The intra- and inter-examiner agreements were measured by the Kappa test. The significance level was set at 5% for all analyses. Results The values of intra-examiner agreement varied from moderate (0.56) to almost perfect (0.81), while the values of inter-examiner agreement varied from fair (0.29) to moderate (0.60). The image file format did not influence the diagnostic values for VRF for any of the radiographic systems tested (p > 0.05). Digora Toto had significantly greater values of area under the ROC curve than Digora Optime for all file formats (p = 0.001). Conclusion The image file format of periapical radiographs does not influence the diagnosis of VRF, regardless of the digital radiography system.","['Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dental Digital Radiography', 'Tooth Fractures']",[],[]

In this nationwide study, we compared OS before and after the implementation of ICI and found that 3-year OS tripled from 6% to 18%. Patients receiving ICI had a lower OS than demonstrated in RCTs, except for patients with performance status (PS) 0. More than a fifth of the patients progressed early within the first six ICI cycles. Adverse prognostic factors were PS ≥ 1 and metastases to the bone and liver.  Abstract  Background The selection of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment remains challenging. This real-world study aimed to compare the overall survival (OS) before and after the implementation of ICIs, to identify OS prognostic factors, and to assess treatment data in first-line (1L) ICI-treated patients without epidermal growth factor receptor mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation. Methods Data from the Danish NSCLC population initiated with 1L palliative antineoplastic treatment from 1 January 2013 to 1 October 2018, were extracted from the Danish Lung Cancer Registry (DLCR). Long-term survival and median OS pre- and post-approval of 1L ICI were compared. From electronic health records, additional clinical and treatment data were obtained for ICI-treated patients from 1 March 2017 to 1 October 2018. Results The OS was significantly improved in the DLCR post-approval cohort (n = 2055) compared to the pre-approval cohort (n = 1658). The 3-year OS rates were 18% (95% CI 15.6–20.0) and 6% (95% CI 5.1–7.4), respectively. On multivariable Cox regression, bone (HR = 1.63) and liver metastases (HR = 1.47), performance status (PS) 1 (HR = 1.86), and PS ≥ 2 (HR = 2.19) were significantly associated with poor OS in ICI-treated patients. Conclusion OS significantly improved in patients with advanced NSCLC after ICI implementation in Denmark. In ICI-treated patients, PS ≥ 1, and bone and liver metastases were associated with a worse prognosis.","['Non-small cell lung cancer', 'Cancer Immunotherapy', 'Overall Survival', 'First-line Treatment', 'advanced lung cancer', 'Anti-pd-1', 'Clinical Prognostic Factors', 'Danish Registry', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors', 'Real-world Evidence']",[],[]

Ethics Statement and Data Collection The study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology and we obtained Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the conduct of this study. Furthermore, at each of the eleven participating schools, we obtained agreement from the principals before we conducted the survey, given that all of the participating students were in a young age group and that most of them were remote from their parents or guardians. Moreover, before paper-and-pencil questionnaires were distributed, all students in selected classes were told that they could quit the survey whenever they wanted. One well-trained investigator collected the data in each class within one class time (40 min). The confidentiality and anonymity were stressed before students began to answer the questionnaires. They were told that none of their parents, teachers, friends and classmates would know any related information. The class teachers were absent from the classroom during the survey. All materials were anonymous and in Chinese.","To understand the prevalence of and factors associated with club drug use among Chinese secondary vocational students, a nationally representative survey was conducted. The multistage cluster sampling strategy was employed to select participants. A total of 9469 students from eleven secondary vocational schools in five cities completed self-reported questionnaires, which included information on club drug use, sociodemographic variables, individual factors, as well as peer and family related factors. The data were separately analyzed with Poisson regression models for female and male students. The overall lifetime prevalence of club drug use was 2.7% (258/9469), and male students had higher prevalence than female students (3.5% vs. 1.9%, p < 0.001). Female and male students shared four risk factors (i.e., having ever smoked, perceiving social benefit expectancies, peer drug using and perceiving peer’s approval of drug use) and one protective factor (i.e., having medium or high levels of refusal skills) for club drug use. Moreover, family drug using and having a part-time job were two additionally independent risk factors for club drug use among male students. These findings indicate that the problem of club drug use among Chinese secondary vocational students is worthy of attention. The prevention of club drug use should address multiple risks and protective factors on individual, peer and family levels.","['China', 'Prevalence', 'Associated Factors', 'Club Drug Use', 'Secondary Vocational Students']","['Medical College', 'Tongji Medical', 'Huazhong University', 'Review Board', 'Medical Ethics', 'Institutional Review', 'Ethics Statement', 'Ethics Committee', 'Data Collection', 'obtained Institutional']",[]

The injection of ADRCs have been tried clinically for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of intra-articular transplantation of human ADRCs on OA progression in mice and the effect of ADRCs on macrophage polarization. In in vivo experiments, BALB/c-nu mice with knee OA received intra-articular transplantation of either phosphate buffered-saline or human ADRCs. OA progression was evaluated histologically and significantly attenuated in the ADRC group at both four and eight weeks postoperatively. The expression of OA-related proteins in the cartilage and macrophage-associated markers in the synovium were examined by immunohistochemistry. The numbers of MMP-13-, ADAMTS-5-, IL-1β-, IL-6- and iNOS-positive cells significantly decreased, and type II collagen- and CD206-positive cells were more frequently detected in the ADRC group compared with that in the control group. In vitro co-culture experiments showed that ADRCs induced macrophage polarization toward M2. The results of this study suggest that the intra-articular transplantation of human ADRCs could attenuate OA progression possibly by reducing catabolic factors in chondrocytes and modulating macrophage polarization.","['Macrophage', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Stromal Vascular Fraction', 'Adipose-derived Regenerative Cells']",[],[]

Biological stimulation of non-unions includes application of recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). However, rhBMP-2 use continues to be a matter of controversy as literature shows scarce evidence for treatment effectiveness. Questions: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of rhBMP-2 treatment on long bone non-unions measuring union rate and time to union. Furthermore, we assess risk factors for treatment failure. Methods and patients: A total of 91 patients with non-unions of long bones were treated with rhBMP-2 (n = 72) or standard care without BMP (n = 19) at our institution. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, nicotine consumption, and complications were recorded. Bone healing was assessed by plane X-rays and clinical examination. Patients were followed up with for 24 months. Results: Overall, there was significantly faster bone healing after rhBMP-2 application compared to the no-BMP group (p < 0.001; HR = 2.78; 95% CI 1.4–5.6). Union rates differed significantly between rhBMP-2 compared to the no-BMP group (89% vs. 47%; p < 0.001). At the humerus, there was neither a significantly higher union rate in the rhBMP-2 (83%) compared to the no-BMP group (50%) (p = 0.26; n = 12) nor a faster bone healing with a median time of 9 months in both groups (HR = 2.01; 95% CI 0.49–8.61; p = 0.315). The 33 femora treated using rhBMP-2 healed significantly faster than 9 femora in the no-BMP group (HR = 2.93; 95% CI 1.00–8.4; p = 0.023) with significant differences in union rate with 85% and 44%, respectively (p = 0.022). Regarding tibia non-unions, 25 out of 27 (93%) healed with a median of 9 months after rhBMP-2 application with no significant difference in the no-BMP group (33%) in time to union (p = 0.097) but a significantly higher union rate (p = 0.039). There was no effect of comorbidities, age, sex, soft tissue damage, or nicotine use on time to union, union rate, or secondary interventions. Conclusion: Consistent with the literature, overall, significantly higher union rates with reduced time to union were achieved after rhBMP-2 application. Femoral and tibial non-unions in particular seem to profit from rhBMP-2 application.","['Fracture', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein', 'Pseudarthrosis', 'Bone Healing', 'Long Bone Non-Union']",[],[]
