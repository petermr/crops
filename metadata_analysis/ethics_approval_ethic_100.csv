We estimated that 14-20% of the Libyan population have been exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the risk of spread of COVID-19 infections during the coming months is high, and a considerable number of Libyans, particularly the elderly and people with chronic diseases, should be protected against COVID-19 infection.

Many differences in academic performance have been associated with the sex of the student.  Objectives : This study aims to understand the impact of absenteeism on the final grades earned by full-time medical laboratory sciences undergraduate students and whether this is affected by sex. Academic performance was analyzed using students' final grades from two consecutive semesters (January to April and September to December 2019). The differences between male (n = 43) and female (n = 72) students were evaluated by Pearson's correlation. During the semester, all teaching and assessment methods were standardized across both course sections to avoid confounding effects derived from the teaching method. Academic performance was assessed both objectively (multiple-choice questions) and subjectively (short essay questions). The mean scores of male and female students during two semesters were significantly different (p = 0.0180). To correlate marks with absenteeism, the correlation coefficient (r) was negative, which indicates an inverse correlation between absence rate and scores. Interestingly, a statistically significant correlation between absenteeism and final grades was found in the male sample population (p = 0.0011 for the first semester; p = 0.0255 for the second semester) that was not observed for their female counterparts (p = 0.2041; p = 0.1537). The results indicate that academic performance among women is not solely dependent on class attendance but likely involves other factors such as self-learning, and group discussion. The mean scores of female medical sciences students were significantly higher than the male students for two consecutive semesters. Male overall scores seem to be conditional on the instructor's explanation. This sex-based variation in academic performance revealed by taking absenteeism rate into account warrant further investigation.","['Sex', 'Grade', 'Absenteeism', 'Academic Performance', 'Self-learning']","['King Khalid', 'Khalid University', 'University Ethics', 'Ethics Committee', 'approval number', 'sensitive data', 'personal information', 'Ethics approval', 'ECM', 'Ethical Committee']","['ECM#2020-183–(HAPO-06-B-001),', 'ECM#2020-183–(HAPO-06-B-001)']",NaN

Because no studies have investigated COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, this study investigated similarities and differences between demographic data during the COVID-19 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective trend analysis was performed to assess demographic data of all laboratory-confirmed MERS and COVID-19 cases.

This proportion of male COVID-19 patients was similar to that of male MERS patients, which also affected male patients more frequently than female patients. The number of COVID-19-positive Saudi cases was lower than that of non-Saudi cases, which were in contrast to that of MERS; COVID-19 appeared to be remarkably similar to MERS with respect to recovered cases. However, the numbers of critical and dead COVID-19 patients have been much lower than those of MERS patients. The largest proportion of COVID-19 and MERS cases (44.05% and 40.8%, respectively) were recorded in the Western region.

Such effects have been demonstrated across a number of applied settings, including forensic and clinical contexts. Previous research, however, has not quantified the cost of such suboptimal decisions. We assessed the magnitude of the negative consequences of decision fatigue in the finance sector. Using 26 501 credit loan applications evaluated by credit officers of a major bank, we show that in this real-life financial risk-taking context credit loan approvals across the course of a day decreased during midday compared with early or later in the workday, reflecting a preference for the default option. To quantify the economic loss associated with such decision variability, we then modelled the bank's additional credit collection if all decisions had been made during early morning levels of approval. This would have resulted in $509 023 extra revenue for the bank, for one month. Thus, we provide further evidence that is consistent with a pattern of decision fatigue, and that it can have a substantial negative impact in the finance sector that warrants considerations to counteract it.","['Decision Making', 'risk', 'Finance', 'Ego Depletion', 'Decision Fatigue']","['data analysis', 'authors confirm', 'ethical guidelines', 'archival data', 'University', 'Cambridge', 'Ethics', 'analysis', 'authors', 'confirm']",[],NaN

Objective To estimate the volume of patients required to achieve a first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a new anticancer drug or biologic therapy. Design, setting, and participants This cohort study included a random sample of prelicense oncology drugs and biologics with a trial site in the United States that were launched into clinical efficacy testing between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010. Drugs and biologics were identified using ClinicalTrials.gov registration records. Total patient enrollment was captured over an 8-year span, and each intervention was classified based on whether it received FDA approval and was deemed as having intermediate or substantial value according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework (ASCO-VF) score. Secondarily, the association between patient numbers and intervention characteristics was tested. Data were analyzed in February 2020. Main outcomes and measure The prespecified primary outcome was the number of patients enrolled in prelicense trials per FDA approval. Results A total of 120 drugs and biologics were included in our study, with 84 (70.0%) targeted agents, 20 (16.7%) immunotherapies, and 71 (59.2%) novel agents. A total of 13 drugs and biologics (10.8%; 95% CI, 5.3%-16.8%) in our sample gained FDA approval within 8 years, of which 1 (7.7%) was deemed of intermediate value and 3 (23.1%) were deemed of substantial value using ASCO-VF scoring. Overall, 158 810 patients were enrolled in 1335 trials testing these drugs and biologics, 47 913 (30.2%) in trials that led to FDA approval and 110 897 (69.8%) in trials that did not.

Drug developers must receive a designation before they are eligible for the economic incentives of the Orphan Drug Act in the United States. We created a database of all orphan drugs designated between 1983 and 2019 that included numerous drug characteristics, including therapeutic area. In addition, we constructed a ""broad disease"" categorization of designations as an alternative to therapeutic area, based on disease etiology and age of onset rather than organ system. By looking at the pattern of orphan drug designations over the past four decades, this analysis studied the impact of the evolving rare disease drug development landscape and considers the future of rare disease therapies over the coming decades. Results Between 1983 and 2019, a total of 5099 drugs and biologics received orphan drug designation. Designations more than doubled between the 1980s and 1990s, almost doubled between the 1990s and 2000s, and almost tripled in number between the 2000s and 2010s. The top three therapeutic areas represented in the orphan drug designations were: oncology (1910, 37%), neurology (674, 13%), and infectious diseases (436, 9%). The broad disease categorization found that the proportion of designations for pediatric-onset diseases has increased in the most recent decade to 27%. Conclusions Analysis of the last four decades of orphan drug designation indicates seismic shifts have occurred in the rare disease drug development space. The number of designations granted more than quadrupled between the 1990s and 2010s. While these substantial increases led to growth in the absolute number of designations within all therapeutic areas (bar one) and broad disease categories, the relative proportions have seen considerable change over time. In the most recent decade, there have been notable increases in the proportion of drugs in oncology, pediatric-onset diseases, and neurologic disorders. The dramatic rise in overall orphan designations over the past four decades suggests we may continue to see an upward trajectory in designations leading to an increased number of approvals for drugs and biologics designed specifically for diagnosing, preventing, and treating rare diseases in the coming decades.","['Oncology', 'Pediatric', 'Orphan Drug Act', 'Rare Disease', 'Orphan Drugs', 'Us Food And Drug Administration', 'Orphan Drug Designation']",[],[],NaN

Objective To identify and characterize high-risk devices with pediatric age indications derived from PMA statements. Design, setting, and participants In this cross-sectional study of PMA statements, those statements containing the words indicated or intended for medical devices listed in the FDA PMA database as of February 2020 were retrieved. Age indications were manually annotated in these approval statements via PubAnnotation. Based on the PMA identification from the PMA statements, device metadata including product codes, regulation numbers, advisory panels, and approval dates were queried. Main outcomes and measures The main outcome was discernment of the distribution of devices indicated for the pediatric population (neonate, infant, child, and adolescent). Secondary measures included outlining the clinical specialties, device types, and lag time between the initial approval date and the first date of an approval statement with a pediatric indication for generic device categories. Results A total of 297 documents for 149 unique devices were analyzed. Based on the manual age annotations, 102 devices with a pediatric indication, 10 with a neonate age indication, 32 with an infant age indication, 60 with a child age indication, and 94 with an adolescent age indication were identified. For indications for patients from age 17 to 18 years, the number of devices available nearly doubled from 42 devices to 81 devices. Although more than half of the surveyed devices had a pediatric age indication, many were available only for a limited range of the pediatric population (age 18-21 years). For indications for patients from age 0 to 17 years, the mean (SD) number of clinical specialties at each age was 7.27 (1.4), and 12 clinical specialties were represented from ages 18 to 21 years. Conclusions and relevance In this cross-sectional study on device PMA statements, a gap was identified in both quantity and diversity of high-risk devices indicated for the pediatric population.

It also looks at whether various factors explain the time between patent application to New Drug Submission (NDS) and compares Canadian and American times. Drugs approved between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2018 are examined. Design Descriptive study. Data sources Websites from Health Canada, Food and Drug Administration, Merck Index, United States Patent and Trademark Office, WHO and previously published articles. Interventions None. Primary and secondary outcomes The primary outcomes are time to market, time from patent application to NDS (pre-NDS time), review time, time from approval to availability (postapproval time) and factors that may influence the pre-NDS time. The secondary outcome is a comparison of Canadian and American review times and times between patent application and approval. Results There were 113 drugs available for analysis. The median time to market was 11.80 years (IQR 9.40-14.05). The component median times were pre-NDS 10 years (IQR 8.05-12.80), review time 0.96 years (IQR 0.75-1.15) and postapproval time 0.15 years (IQR 0.08-0.28). Less than 8% of the pre-NDS time was explained by the factors that were analysed in a multiple linear regression equation. There was no statistically significant difference between Canadian and American pre-NDS times. Conclusion Once a drug reaches the market, companies have a median of 8.2 years before the patent expires and generics can reach the market.

Design Cross-sectional descriptive analysis. Setting and participants Novel drugs and biologics Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 2016 and 2017 and their company sponsors. Main outcome measures Using established Good Pharma Scorecard (GPS) measures, companies and products were evaluated on their clinical trial registration, results dissemination and FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA) implementation; companies were ranked using these measures and a multicomponent data sharing measure. Associations between company transparency scores with company size (large vs non-large), location (US vs non-US) and sponsored product type (drug vs biologic) were also examined. Results 26% of products (16/62) had publicly available results for all clinical trials supporting their FDA approval and 67% (39/58) had public results for trials in patients by 6 months after their FDA approval; 58% (32/55) were FDAAA compliant. Large companies were significantly more transparent than non-large companies (overall median transparency score of 95% (IQR 91-100) vs 59% (IQR 41-70), p Conclusions It was feasible to apply the GPS transparency measures and ranking tool to non-large companies and biologics. Large companies are significantly more transparent than non-large companies, driven by better data sharing procedures and implementation of FDAAA trial reporting requirements. Greater research transparency is needed, particularly among non-large companies, to maximise the benefits of research for patient care and scientific innovation.","['Clinical Trials', 'Health Policy', 'Ethics (See Medical Ethics)']","['statements Patient', 'Patient consent', 'Ethics statements', 'Patient', 'Ethics', 'required', 'statements', 'consent', 'publication']",[],NaN

Protocol number for the same is aLMS/PGR/UH/03332(1)."," Background Biosimilars are expected to emerge as a rapidly growing segment of the biopharmaceutical industry. However, the biosimilar industry faces multiple challenges and obstacles in developing and marketing these complex products. Divergent regulatory framework in emerging countries adds to repetitive trials and increased cost of biosimilar development, delaying the approval process. Due to such roadblocks, healthcare systems and patients are yet to realize the full benefits of biosimilars. Objectives The aim of this exploratory study was to specifically identify the challenges faced by the industry in emerging countries including Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Turkey and Mexico (BRICS-TM), pertaining to biosimilar development and the regulatory approval process. In particular, this study aims to understand the perceptions of industry on the barriers faced by them in terms of complexity, costs for biosimilar development and time-to-market for biosimilar product. Methods A semi-quantitative questionnaire was designed based on secondary research. A total of 93 industry personnel and representatives from 14 trade associations from the BRICS-TM countries with 15-year minimum experience were identified and invited to take part in the study and participate in interviews, which were recorded verbatim. Data processing and analysis was carried out; descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data and content analysis was employed to generate themes for qualitative data. Results Of the 107 biopharmaceutical industry and trade association representatives invited to participate in the study, respondents from 33 biopharmaceutical companies agreed to take part and underwent the interviews. The industry personnel perceived biosimilar guidelines and approval processes as being protracted and in a state of evolution. The absence of an abridged approval pathway limited effectiveness of the regulatory process. The biggest hurdles in the development of biosimilar dossiers were the sourcing of the reference biological product and expectations around confirmatory clinical trials by the agencies. The non-comprehensive implementation of a stepwise approach resulting in unnecessary toxicity studies was also reported as a major challenge. The authors recommend further primary research with BRICS-TM regulatory agencies in order to propose a simplified pathway for development and approval. Conclusions Lack of standardized biosimilar development criteria and regulatory convergence across BRICS-TM agencies has led to challenges in multi-country development programmes for these medicines, in turn impacting the ability of industry to launch newer and more affordable biosimilars.",NaN,"['Technology ECDA', 'Ethics Approval', 'Science', 'Health', 'Engineering', 'ECDA', 'University', 'Hertfordshire', 'Approval', 'Technology']",['for'],NaN

In the study, a mixed research design, which nests qualitative data into quantitative, was used. In addition to the scales and sociodemographic form, the Draw-a-Person test was also used to better understand children's inner world. According to the findings, there is a significant relationship between gaming disorder and narcissism and happiness levels in children. Accordingly, as narcissism increases in children, the gaming disorder level increases, and happiness decreases. We also found a mediation effect in the impact of narcissism on happiness through gaming disorder. According to the results, we think that the problem is not caused by the individual but by society. For a solution, we recommend making more macro-level social work interventions within the framework of system theory instead of the current medical model in combating gaming disorder.","['Happiness', 'Narcissism', 'Compensation Theory', 'Gaming Disorder']",[],[],NaN

First, we set the following three parameters to observe cases: (i) the FDA regulatory reforms, (ii) early application of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), to both research and clinical settings, and (iii) accumulation of open data. Then, we performed a comparative analysis of MSK-IMPACT with FoundationOne CDx and Oncomine Dx Target Test, both of which were FDA-approved tumor profiling tests launched in 2017. As a result, we found that MSK-IMPACT secures neutrality as a non-profit organization, achieves the active incorporation of basic research results, and performs superiorly in clinical operations, such as patient enrollment. On the contrary, we confirmed that FoundationOne CDx was the most prominent case in terms of the number of new drugs and expanded indications approved in which the FDA's expedited approval programs were considerably utilized. Consequently, to uncover the full potential of MSK-IMPACT, it is suggested that more intersectoral collaborative activities between various healthcare stakeholders, in particular, pharmaceutical companies, for driving clinical development must be carried out based on an organizational framework that facilitates collaboration.","['Open Data', 'Next-generation Sequencing (Ngs)', 'New Drug Development', 'Regulatory Reform', 'Tumor Profiling Test']",[],[],NaN

Ethics approval Approval for this study has been obtained from the IRB of Kyushu University Hospital (Approval No. 2020–767).," Introduction Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a vascular proliferative disorder that occurs in preterm infants. Existing treatments are only indicated in severe ROP cases due to the high invasiveness and the potential risk of irreversible side effects. We previously elucidated that ripasudil, a selective inhibitor of the Rho-associated protein kinase, has the ability to inhibit abnormal retinal neovascularisation in animal models. In addition, ripasudil eye drops (Glanatec ophthalmic solution 0.4%) have been already used for the treatment of glaucoma. Since eye drop therapy is less invasive, early intervention for ROP is possible. The purpose of this phase I/II trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ripasudil eye drops for preterm infants with ROP. Methods and analysis This is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm phase I/II trial. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ripasudil as much as possible, ripasudil will be administered to all enrolled preterm infants with zone I/II, stage 1, or worse ROP. The safety and efficacy of ripasudil in treated patients will be assessed in comparison to a historical control group. Because this is the first trial of ripasudil in preterm infants, a dose-escalation study (once daily for 1 week, then two times per day for 2 weeks) will be conducted in phase I. After obtaining approval from the independent data and safety monitoring board to continue the trial after the completion of phase I, phase II will be conducted. In phase II, ripasudil eye drops will be administered two times per day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint in phase II is also safety. Efficacy and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated as secondary endpoints. Ethics and dissemination This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each of the participating centres.

Objective To better understand the early impact of emicizumab on our patients at the University of Colorado Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center (UCHTC), we evaluated adverse reactions, factor prophylaxis overlap, and bleeding rates after starting emicizumab through a quality improvement project. Patients/methods A retrospective chart review and structured phone interview were conducted from June to September 2019 for all patients who had started emicizumab at the UCHTC. Data about emicizumab dosing, reactions, bleeding events, and bleeding treatment were collected in 68 children and adults (aged 0.55-79.8 years, on emicizumab a median 213 days; range, 51-1229 days) with hemophilia A (35.3% with past or current inhibitor). Results Adverse reactions were primarily skin reactions, with no anaphylactic reactions or thrombosis. Bleeding events, defined as pain or swelling treated with factor or supportive measures, demonstrated wide variability, with 25 of 68 experiencing zero bleeds and 5 of 68 experiencing >8 bleeds per year. The most prevalent bleed type was traumatic musculoskeletal bleeding. Bleeding events occurred more often in the first 10 weeks after starting emicizumab, but no time period was without bleeding events. The majority of patients were prescribed every-week or every-2-week dosing, but some had alternative dosing frequency.

The part of the study that uses anonymized data from the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare did not require ethical approval (2017/5:1).," Objective The consequences of a low autopsy rate are not considered in determining the cause of death. Method We have analyzed the Cause of Death Register of the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare since it started 1969 to and including 2016 to visualize the decline in the frequency of clinical autopsies over time and evaluated the effect on the quality of the cause of death diagnoses. Results Over the five decades studied, the frequency of clinical autopsies declined from almost 40% to less than 5%. The rate of decline was not even. Political decisions and changes of healthcare organization in Sweden affected the slope of decline of autopsies superimposed on a linear decline over time reflecting changes in clinical routines. A request of clinical autopsies was highly dependent on the level of care at the time of death, with the lowest number of requests for persons who died in nursing homes. The age at the time of death was a major factor affecting the number of autopsies, resulting in an autopsy rate of less than 1% in the ages where most persons die. Although men were autopsied more often than women, a gender-specific difference was not seen after correction for the age of death. We also found a higher rate of unspecific and irrelevant diagnosis in the cases not autopsied and we know from earlier studies by us and other authors that the cause of death diagnoses were missed in between 30% and 50% of the cases not autopsied. Conclusion The decline in the clinical autopsy rate reduced the value of the death certificate register. An increase in the number of autopsies performed will improve the understanding of disease and cause of death, as well as to better inform next of kin.","['Autopsy', 'Cause of death', 'Gender Differences', 'Forensic Autopsy', 'Age Dependence', 'Autopsy And Level Of Care', 'Death Certificate Errors', 'Clinical Autopsy']","['Stockholm approved', 'Regional Ethical', 'Ethical Board', 'Swedish Board', 'ethical approval', 'Regional', 'Stockholm', '208-31', 'Board', 'require ethical']",[],NaN

In Mozambique, a public state of emergency was declared at the end of March 2020. This has limited people's movements and reduced public services, leading to a decrease in the number of people accessing health care facilities. An implementation research project, The Alert Community for a Prepared Hospital, has been promoting access to maternal and child health care, in Natikiri, Nampula, for the last four years. Nampula has the second highest incidence of Covid-19. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic Government restrictions on access to maternal and child healthcare services. We compared health centres in Nampula city with healthcare centres in our research catchment area. We wanted to see if our previous research interventions have led to a more resilient response from the community. Methods Mixed-methods research, descriptive, cross-sectional, retrospective, using a review of patient visit documentation. We compared maternal and child health care unit statistical indicators from March-May 2019 to the same time-period in 2020. We tested for significant changes in access to maternal and child health services, using KrushKall Wallis, One-way Anova and mean and standard deviation tests. We compared interviews with health professionals, traditional birth attendants and patients in the two areas. We gathered data from a comparable city health centre and the main city referral hospital. The Marrere health centre and Marrere General Hospital were the two Alert Community for a Prepared Hospital intervention sites. Results Comparing 2019 quantitative maternal health services access indicators with those from 2020, showed decreases in most important indicators: family planning visits and elective C-sections dropped 28%; first antenatal visit occurring in the first trimester dropped 26%; hospital deliveries dropped a statistically significant 4% (p = 0.046), while home deliveries rose 74%; children vaccinated down 20%.

Material and methods Our study employed a projective quantitative research design. SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis was used to map ARS internal competencies towards external contexts, and potential opportunities and risks in the robotic market. The ARS purchase and procedural costs were evaluated in two different scenarios. Results In the first scenario, setting the purchase cost of the Avatera at around $1.3-1.5 million, a total $400 procedural cost reduction compared to the RAS performed with the da Vinci Xi can be calculated. In the second scenario, with a purchase cos of the ARS of $700.000-800.000 and considering a 5-year period with an annual ARS volume of 500 procedures, only an additional $300 will be attributed to the robot itself. Our projections revealed that for an effective competition the purchase cost of ARS should range between $700.000 and $800.000 during the initial phase of market entry. The marketing strategy of the ARS should be oriented towards countries without any robotic system in operational use, followed by countries where the competition intensity in the marketplace is low. Conclusion The introduction of new robotic systems will greatly affect and reshape the market of robotic surgery. The ARS has all the technical capacity ensuring the performance of high-quality surgical procedures.

Results During the study period, the T-group exhibited lower levels of urea (47.0 ± 11.8 to 34.0 ± 13.9 mg/dL), uric acid (6.57 ± 1.2 to 5.49 ± 1.5 mg/dL), serum creatinine (0.90 ± 0.10 to 1.12 ± 0.9 mg/dL), and higher-level in GFR (87.0 ± 12.9 to 98.0 ± 8.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), which were significant. Alternatively, the C-group exhibited an increase in their serum creatinine (1.16 ± 0.31 to 1.19 ± 0.58 mg/dL), an increase in uric acid (5.54 ± 1.2 to 5.44 ± 1.7 mg/dL), and a decrease in GFR (92.0 ± 20.1 to 87.0 ± 26.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). A total of 25 deaths (7.8%) was recorded in the T-group, among them 11 (44%) were cardiovascular. On the other hand, 28 patients (15.2%) died in C-group and all deaths (100%) were found to cardiovascular causes. Conclusion The results suggest that long-term TTh could improve renal function in hypogonadal men comparing to slight deterioration observed in patients without intervention. In addition to reduce mortality in cardiovascular patients, almost to the half.","['Men', 'Hypogonadism', 'Renal function', 'Testosterone Therapy']","['Review Board', 'Institutional Review', 'German medical', 'Ethical consideration', 'consideration Institutional', 'ethics committee', 'Ethical approval', 'approval', 'medical association', 'IRB']","['(researchregistry6769)', 'for']",NaN

Methods We tested our DLA built on convolutional neural networks in 14,186 retinographies from our population and 1200 images extracted from MESSIDOR. The retinal images were graded both by the DLA and independently by four retina specialists. Results of the DLA were compared according to accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (S), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), distinguishing between identification of any type of DR (any DR) and referable DR (RDR). Results The results of testing the DLA for identifying any DR in our population were: ACC = 99.75, S = 97.92, SP = 99.91, PPV = 98.92, NPV = 99.82, and AUC = 0.983. When detecting RDR, the results were: ACC = 99.66, S = 96.7, SP = 99.92, PPV = 99.07, NPV = 99.71, and AUC = 0.988. The results of testing the DLA for identifying any DR with MESSIDOR were: ACC = 94.79, S = 97.32, SP = 94.57, PPV = 60.93, NPV = 99.75, and AUC = 0.959. When detecting RDR, the results were: ACC = 98.78, S = 94.64, SP = 99.14, PPV = 90.54, NPV = 99.53, and AUC = 0.968.

Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a sensitive and quantitative technique for NIPD. In the present study, the development and evaluation of ddPCR-based assays for common α and β-thalassemia variants amongst the Asian population was described; specifically, Southeast Asian (SEA) deletion, HbE, and 41/42 (-CTTT). SEA is caused by deletion of a 20 kb region surrounding the α-globin gene, whilst HbE and 41/42 (-CTTT) are caused by point mutations on the β-globin gene. Cell-free DNA samples from 46 singleton pregnant women who were carriers of these mutations were isolated and quantified using ddPCR with specially designed probes for each target allele. Allelic copy number calculation and likelihood ratio tests were used to classify fetal genotypes. Classification performances were evaluated against ground truth fetal genotypes obtained from conventional amniocentesis. Copy number variation analysis of SEA deletion accurately classified fetal genotypes in 20 out of 22 cases with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 for detecting Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis. For HbE cases, 10 out of 16 samples were correctly classified, and three were inconclusive. For 41/42 (-CTTT) cases, 2 out of 8 were correctly classified, and four were inconclusive. The correct genotype was not rejected in any inconclusive case and may be resolved with additional ddPCR experiments. These results indicate that ddPCR-based analysis of maternal plasma can become an accurate and effective NIPD for SEA deletion α-(0) thalassemia. Although the performance of ddPCR on HbE and 41/42 (-CTTT) mutations were not sufficient for clinical application, these results may serve as a foundation for future works in this field.","['β-thalassemia', 'α-thalassemia', 'Cell-free Fetal Dna', 'Droplet Digital Pcr', 'Non-invasive Prenatal Test']","['Radjavithi Hospital', 'Institutional Review', 'Review Board', 'participate Samples', 'Ethics approval', 'Written informed', 'Bangkok', 'November', 'approval', 'Hospital']",['59194'],NaN

A random effect meta-analysis compared the efficacy of preemptive analgesia compared to placebo through pooled OR and 95%CI. The interpretation of results followed the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach together with the magnitude of the effect according to GRADE guidelines. Results Four studies were included in the review and three were incorporated into the meta-analysis. All studies demonstrated that preemptive analgesia contributed to a significant improvement in the postoperative pain control. However, the overall pooled standard mean difference (SMD) showed that preemptive analgesia had small effects compared to placebo in reducing pain (SMD: -0.45; IC: -0.83; -0.08) with low certainty of the evidence. Our meta-analysis showed that the magnitude of the effect was bigger six to eight hours after the surgery (large effect), compared to the time of one to two hours after the surgery (small effect).

Methods:  We enrolled 86 AHF patients with (31 pts, AHF/PNM) and without (55 pts, AHF) concomitant PNM. LUS B-lines were evaluated using a combined antero-lateral (AL) and posterior (POST) approach at admission (T0), after 24 h from T0 (T1), after 48 h from T0 (T2) and before discharge (T3). B-lines score was calculated at each time point on AL and POST chest, dividing the number of B-lines by the number of explorable scanning sites. The decongestion rate (DR) was calculated as the difference between the absolute B-lines number at discharge and admission, divided by the number of days of hospitalization. Patients were followed-up and hospital readmission for AHF was considered as adverse outcome.  Results:  At admission, AHF/PNM patients showed no difference in AL B-lines score compared with AHF patients [AHF/PNM: 2.00 (IQR: 1.44-2.94) vs. AHF: 1.65 (IQR: 0.50-2.66),  p  = 0.072], whereas POST B-lines score was higher [AHF/PNM: 3.76 (IQR: 2.70-4.77) vs. AHF = 2.44 (IQR: 1.20-3.60),  p   p  = 0.022] and not POST B-lines score was found to predict adverse events (AHF rehospitalization) after a median follow-up of 96 days (IQR: 30-265) in the overall population.

We aimed to survey the extent to which biologic DMARDs are included in EMLs, to determine country characteristics contributing to their inclusion or absence, and to contrast this with conventional DMARD therapies. Methods We searched 138 national EMLs for 10 conventional and 14 biologic DMARDs used in the treatment of childhood rheumatologic diseases. Via regression modelling, we determined country characteristics accounting for differences in medicine inclusion between national EMLs. Results Eleven countries (7.97%) included all 10 conventional DMARDs, 115 (83.33%) ≥5, and all countries listed at least one.

Patients and methods This was a prospective cohort study for patients who received Botox intravesical injection. We included patients with neurogenic bladder with detrusor overactivity and symptomatic recurrent UTI. We compared the number of symptomatic UTIs at six months pre- and post-intravesical Botox injection. Patient files were reviewed for diagnosis, vesico-uretric reflux, hydronephrosis, urodynamic findings pre- and post-injection, and dose of Botox used. Patients were followed for the number of symptomatic UTIs post-Botox injection. Results There were 93 patients diagnosed with neurogenic detrusor overactivity and symptomatic recurrent UTI. Patients were categorized into three categories: Group 1 - adults, Group 2 - pediatrics, Group 3 - non-neurogenic neurogenic bladder (Hinman's syndrome). Spina bifida was diagnosed in 22 adults (Group 1) and 32 pediatric patients (Group 2). After receiving Botox injection, 75% of all patients (70) had a significant decrease in number of symptomatic UTIs. Urodynamic tests post-injection showed an improvement in bladder capacity, compliance, and detrusor pressure versus baseline in all three groups. Correlation analysis showed significant correlation between decreased symptomatic UTI post-Botox injection and detrusor pressure post-injection as well as bladder compliance;  p -value=0.01 and  p =0.021, respectively. Conclusion Intravesical Botox injection may decrease incidence of symptomatic UTI in neurogenic detrusor overactivity.

There are plausible pathophysiological and clinical mechanisms suggesting that patients with diabetes are at an increased risk of postoperative complications. When postoperative complications occur in the general population, they increase major adverse events and subsequently increase 1-year mortality. This is likely to be worse in patients with diabetes. There is variation in practice guidelines in different countries in the perioperative management of patients with diabetes undergoing major surgery and whether this may affect postoperative outcome has not been investigated on a large scale. Neither is it known whether different strata of preoperative glycaemic control affects outcome. Methods and analysis A prospective, observational, international, multicentre cohort study, recruiting 5000 patients with diabetes undergoing elective or emergency surgery in at least n=50 centres. Inclusion criteria are any patient with diabetes undergoing surgery under any substantive anaesthetic technique. Exclusion criteria are not being a confirmed diabetic patient and patients with diabetes undergoing procedures under monitored sedation or local anaesthetic infiltration only. Follow-up duration is 30 days after surgery. Primary outcome is days at home at 30 days. Secondary outcomes are Comprehensive Complications Index, Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) score on Day 1 postoperatively, 30-day mortality, length of hospital stay and incidence of specific major adverse events (Myocardial Infarction (MI), Myocardial Injury after Non-cardiac Surgery (MINS), Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), Postoperative Pulmonary Complications (PPC), Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), DVT, surgical site infection, postoperative pulmonary infection). Tertiary outcomes include time to resumption of normal diabetes therapy, incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia, incidence and duration of use of intravenous insulin infusion therapy and change in diabetic management at 30 days.

Contributing factors are late presentation, delays within the healthcare system, and decreased availability of resources. We aimed to characterize the capacity and geographic location of healthcare facilities in the country and calculate the proportion of the population with access to breast cancer care. Methods A facility-based assessment tool was administered to secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities and private medical centers and clinics in The Gambia. GPS coordinates were obtained, and proximity of service availability and population analysis were performed. Distance thresholds of 10, 20, and 45 km were chosen to determine access to screening, pathologic diagnosis, and surgical management. An additional population analysis was performed to observe the potential impact of targeted development of resources for breast cancer care. Results All 102 secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities and private medical centers and clinics in The Gambia were included. Breast cancer screening is mainly performed through clinical breast examination and is available in 52 facilities. Seven facilities provide pathologic diagnosis and surgical management of breast cancer. The proportion of the Gambian population with access to screening, pathologic diagnosis, and surgical management is 72, 53, and 62%, respectively. A hypothetical targeted expansion of resources would increase the covered population to 95, 62, and 84%.

Methods:  A senior member of the division responsible for issuing marketing authorisations completed an established and validated questionnaire, which standardises the review process, allowing key milestones, activities and practices of the six regulatory authorities to be identified and compared. The completed questionnaires were validated by the heads of the respective agencies.  Results:  The six countries vary in population and in the size of their respective regulatory agency and the resources allocated to regulatory reviews. The review processes of the six agencies were similar; however, differences were noted in the milestones recorded; for example, two of the countries did not record the start of the scientific assessment. Additionally, decisions for marketing authorisation were made by an expert committee in four of the countries and by the head of the agency and the Minister of Health in two countries. All six agencies implemented the majority of good review practices; however, the need for improvement in the areas of transparency and communication and quality decision making practices was a common finding for all six countries.  Conclusions:  Participation in the ZaZiBoNa initiative has improved the way in which the six agencies perform regulatory reviews in their countries, highlighting the realisation of one of the key objectives of the initiative, which was building the expert capacity of member countries.

The exact mechanisms for thyroid morphogenesis remain unclear. In this paper, we report a rare case of right lobe TH associated with Hurthle cell carcinoma. Case presentation A 59 years old woman was admitted with a neck lump increasing in size in the last 20 years. There were no symptoms of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. There was a palpable, painless 5 cm mass in the middle of the neck. Initial thyroid ultrasonography (USG) revealed an enlarged left lobe, with hypoechoic lesion with cystic component and calcification (TIRADS 4). However, the right lobe was non-visualized. Fine needle aspiration biopsy result tendency was a malignancy. Hence, isthmolobectomy was conducted. Pathology result was Hurthle cell carcinoma. On the ninth month, USG revealed fibrotic tissue in the right thyroid bed and bilateral lymphadenopathy. Due to discrepancy, the patient was planned for a neck exploration surgery and a right lobe incision. Intraoperatively, the right thyroid was absent. Intraoperative USG also confirmed no right thyroid lobe. Discussion Thyroid hemiagenesis can be visualized by using USG due to its practicality and cost effectiveness reasons. Follow up evaluations consisted of systematic monitoring of thyroid morphology and hormonal functions should follow the diagnosis of TH. Neck exploration surgery might need to be performed to clarify any discrepancy and confirm the diagnosis. Conclusion TH can be recognized through supporting examination; however, discrepancy may occur.","['Hurthle Cell Carcinoma', 'Thyroid Hemiagenesis', 'Neck Exploration Surgery']","['Ethical approval', 'Ethical', 'approval', 'institution', 'type', 'study', 'require']",[],NaN

However, its incorporation into reimbursement of health insurance benefits poses many challenges, including uncertain evidence and insufficient investment. This paper examines the wide gap between manufacturers, regulatory bodies, and health technology bodies regarding reimbursements for RMs focused cell therapy products. In this mixed-methods study, we first analyzed the sales of RMs approved in South Korea. In addition to exploring beliefs related to the market value of RMs, in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 experts (17 from bio-industries, two from the regulatory body, three from a health technology assessment (HTA) body, and two from the Pharmaceutical Benefit Coverage Assessment Committee [PBCAC]). Lastly, we surveyed PBCAC members about the market value of RMs. In total, 15 of the 20 developed cell therapy products are on the market in South Korea, and amounted to 0.24% of total pharmaceutical expenditures in 2018. We identified a wide gap between stakeholders and regulators regarding the market value and pricing of RMs. The interviewees from the pharmaceutical manufacturer association raised the issue of rising manufacturing costs and proposed a specific pricing policy for RMs. To bridge the gap between approval and reimbursement, stakeholders demand an alternative framework of value-based pricing. Conditional health insurance reimbursement may be an alternative to the traditional process in order to generate evidence of the effects of RMs using ""risk-based"" or ""outcome-based"" approaches.","['Pricing', 'Reimbursement', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Marketing Authorization', 'Conditional Coverage']","['Assessment Service', 'Health Insurance', 'Institution Review', 'Review Board', 'Insurance Review', 'Ethics Statement', 'studies involving', 'involving human', 'human participants', 'Review']",[],NaN

Risk sharing arrangements (RSAs) could manage the risk based on both financial impact and the health outcome of new drugs if reimbursed. To improve patients' access to new drugs under uncertainties, many developed countries have adopted RSAs. In this study, we aimed to understand the effects of RSAs in South Korea on patients' access. Methods We reviewed current status of RSA drugs in South Korea. The number of appraisals and time gap between market approval and reimbursement per RSA drug were considered to quantify improvement of patients' access as they showed how rapidly decisions on reimbursement of RSA drugs were derived. Then, we applied a comparative analysis to determine whether the RSA drugs in South Korea were reimbursed in the UK, Italy, and Australia. Most data for this study were obtained from websites of the governmental department/agencies responsible for appraisal of drug reimbursement in each country. And literatures related to RSAs were investigated as well. Results The eligibility for Korean RSAs had two key components - drugs for cancer and rare diseases and not having other alternative treatments. As of the first half of 2019, there were 39 RSA drugs reimbursed in South Korea, the majority of which were financial-based schemes. Refund and expenditure cap were the representative types (89.7%). After introduction of RSAs, the time gap and number of appraisals were decreased. Based on the indications of RSA drugs, the level of drug coverage in South Korea was found lower than Italy, similar to the UK, and higher than Australia. Conclusions RSAs in South Korea significantly enhanced patients' access to new drugs and led to the alleviation of patients' out-of-pocket expenses. The drug coverage of South Korea had a level comparable to that of other countries. This study provides implications for countries that have a dual mission of containing pharmaceutical expenditure and improving access to new drugs.","['Economic evaluation', 'South Korea', 'Cost-effectiveness', 'Drug Reimbursement', 'Access To New Drugs', 'Risk Sharing Arrangement']",[],[],NaN

Participants and setting We assessed 851 discharged-alive patients in the PURSUIT-HFpEF registry who were initially hospitalised due to an acute decompensated HFpEF (EF≥50%) and elevated N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (≥400 ng/L) at Osaka University Hospital and other 30 affiliated hospitals in the Kansai region of Japan. Patients received a urine dipstick test, and were divided into two groups according to the absence or presence of proteinuria. A trace or more of dipstick proteinuria was defined as the presence of proteinuria. Main outcome measures A composite of cardiac death or HF rehospitalisation. Results Median age was 83 years and 473 patients (55.6%) were female. Five hundred and two patients (59%) were proteinuria (-) and 349 patients (41%) were proteinuria (+). The composite endpoint and HF rehospitalisation occurred more often in proteinuria (+) individuals than proteinuria (-) individuals (log-rank p=0.006 and p=0.007, respectively); but cardiac death did not (log-rank p=0.139). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that the presence of proteinuria was associated with the composite endpoint (HR: 1.47, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.01, p=0.016), and HF rehospitalisation (HR: 1.48, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.05, p=0.020), but not with cardiac death (HR: 1.52, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.76, p=0.172).

Materials and methods A retrospective descriptive study of all patients referred to the Ministry of Social Development for visual disability from January 2014 to December 2019 was performed. Information recorded were age, gender, the cause of the visual impairment, and visual acuity in the better eye. If a patient had multiple ophthalmic diseases, the untreatable disease causing visual impairment was recorded. Patients were considered to have visual impairment according to World Health Organization criteria. Results A total of 484 Bahraini patients were included in the study. The mean age was 57.3 years of age ranging from 3 to 100 years; 63% of the total cases were males.

Some of these changes may have been beneficial to perinatal outcomes; however, other factors such as reduced access to face-to-face healthcare may have contributed negatively to antenatal care. The aim of this audit was to evaluate neonatal admissions in the South-West of England during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the previous two years 2018-2019. Anonymised birth and neonatal admission rates from January to December 2020 was obtained and compared to data from 2018 to 2019. The results demonstrate a decreasing in neonatal unit admissions between 2018 and 2020, 9.48% of live births in 2018 (95% CI 9.17, 9.80) to 8.89% (95% CI 8.65, 9.13) in 2020 (p = 0.002).Conclusion: There were no significant differences across gestational groups. It is unclear without nationwide data whether our observed trends, decreased neonatal admissions over the past 3 years, are generalisable and related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research exploring the impact of lockdowns on behaviour change during pregnancy and support services is warranted to understand the implications of pandemics on pregnancy and preterm birth. What is Known: • The COVID-19 lockdown had a series of intended and unintended consequences; some of which may have been beneficial to perinatal outcomes. • Research suggests that preterm births have not significantly changed overall, but they have decreased in high-income countries. What is New: • In our audit, analysing retrospective data of regional birth and neonatal admission from the South-West of England, we observed a decrease in live birth rates between 2018 and 2020. • A reduction in neonatal unit admissions was observed from 2018 to 2020 with no significant differences across gestational groups. The reduction from 2019 to 2020 was smaller than that from 2018 to 2019 implying that the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was not necessarily implicated.","['Birth', 'Neonatology', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Patient Admissions', 'Covid-19']",[],[],NaN

Methods:  A semi-quantitative questionnaire was developed covering the organisation of agency, biosimilar development criteria and marketing authorisation process and sent to seven regulatory agencies covering the BRICS-TM countries. All data was kept anonymous and confidential. Data processing and analysis was carried out; descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data and content analysis was employed to generate themes for qualitative data.  Results:  Out of the seven regulatory agencies included in the study, six representatives provided the responses. The perspectives of these six regulatory agencies varied on a number of aspects relating to the review criteria for biosimilar development and licencing process. The most prevalent model for data assessment is the ""full review"" of a marketing authorisation application. There is lack of a standard approach across the agencies on sourcing of the reference biological product,  in vivo  toxicity studies and confirmatory clinical studies. Most agencies restrict interaction with biosimilar developers and any scientific advice is non-binding. The marketing authorisation approval depends on scientific assessment of the dossier, sample analysis and GMP certification. The agencies do not issue any public assessment report specifying the summary basis of biosimilar approval.  Conclusion:  Regulatory agencies across the six emerging economies are steadily improving the regulatory mechanism in the area of biosimilars. However, there remains scope for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes by encouraging open and transparent interaction with developers, adopting a flexible approach toward accepting advanced analytical data in lieu of clinical studies and enhancing regulatory reliance amongst agencies.

The aim of this study was to quantify the extent of tumor load reduction achieved by TAS. Methods International multicenter prospective study embedded in a randomized trial. TAS is a novel pragmatic concept for axillary surgery de-escalation that combines palpation-guided removal of suspicious nodes with the sentinel procedure and, optionally, imaging-guided localization. Pre-specified study endpoints quantified surgical extent and reduction of tumor load. Results A total of 296 patients were included at 28 sites in four European countries, 125 (42.2%) of whom underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and 71 (24.0%) achieved nodal pathologic complete response. Axillary metastases were detectable only by imaging in 145 (49.0%) patients. They were palpable in 151 (51.0%) patients, of whom 63 underwent NACT and 21 had residual palpable disease after NACT. TAS removed the biopsied and clipped node in 279 (94.3%) patients. In 225 patients with nodal disease at the time of surgery, TAS removed a median of five (IQR 3-7) nodes, two (IQR 1-4) of which were positive. Of these 225 patients, 100 underwent ALND after TAS, which removed a median of 14 (IQR 10-17) additional nodes and revealed additional positive nodes in 70/100 (70%) of patients. False-negative rate of TAS in patients who underwent subsequent ALND was 2.6%.

However, data on risk indicators for urinary tract infections are limited and outdated. The research is a secondary analysis. The study was a prospective multicenter cohort study of low-risk pregnant women. Logistic regression was used to identify risk indicators for urinary tract infections. The incidence of urinary tract infections was 9.4%. Multivariate logistic regression showed that a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and the presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in the present pregnancy were associated with urinary tract infections (resp. OR 3.14, 95%CI 1.40-7.02 and OR 1.96 95%CI 1.27-3.03). Women with a urinary tract infection were at increased risk of preterm birth compared to women without a urinary tract infection (12 vs. 5.1%; adjusted HR 2.5 95%CI 1.8-3.5). This increased risk was not found in women with the identified risk indicators (resp. 5.3% vs. 5.1%, adjusted HR 0.35 95%CI 0.00-420 and adjusted HR 1.5 95CI% 0.59-3.9). In conclusion, in low-risk pregnant women, risk indicators for urinary tract infections are: a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and the presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. The risk of preterm birth is increased in women with a urinary tract infection in this pregnancy. However, women with recurrent urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria this pregnancy appear not to be at increased risk of preterm birth.","['Urinary tract infections', 'Preterm Birth', 'Asymptomatic Bacteriuria', 'Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections', 'Risk Indicators']","['ASB study', 'Approval', 'approval number', 'ASB', 'Medical Centre', 'Academic Medical', 'Netherlands', 'ASB cohort', 'Ethical Approval', 'number MEC']","['MEC', '13.64,']",NaN

The Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA), specifically the Medical Devices General Office (GGTPS), has been reviewing regulatory guidelines and procedures and simplifying approvals for medical devices.  Methods  Using public records, we present the Brazilian health regulatory scenario during the first four months of the pandemic (between December 31, 2019, and April 30, 2020).  Results  The ANVISA-GGTPS has been making efforts to increase the availability of medical devices for use by healthcare professionals and patients. It has simplified the rigorous regulatory system, as rising COVID-19 cases lead to a shortage of the availability of them.  Conclusion  The challenges to overcome shortages raises a pertinent question about how governments, with their respective regulatory authorities, productive supply chains, and Industry 4.0 components, will guarantee the availability of medical goods and maintain the fast flow of the goods in a flexible way, while meeting the standards of quality, safety, and effectiveness.","['Medical devices', 'Healthcare Worker', 'Regulatory Agency', 'Anvisa', 'Sars–cov–2']",[],[],NaN

Methods and Results Of 4056 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure in the KCHF (Kyoto Congestive Heart Failure) registry, we analyzed 3460 patients hospitalized from their homes and discharged alive. There were 3009 and 451 patients who were discharged to home and nonhome, respectively. We investigated the factors associated with nonhome discharge and compared the outcomes between home discharge and nonhome discharge. Factors independently and positively associated with nonhome discharge were age ≥80 years (odds ratio [OR],1.76; 95% CI,1.28-2.42), body mass index ≤22 kg/m 2  (OR,1.49; 95% CI,1.12-1.97), poor medication adherence (OR, 2.08; 95% CI,1.49-2.88), worsening heart failure (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.46-2.82), stroke during hospitalization (OR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.75-8.00), functional decline (OR, 12.24; 95% CI, 8.74-17.14), and length of hospital stay >16 days (OR, 4.14; 95% CI, 3.01-5.69), while those negatively associated were diabetes mellitus (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.94), cohabitants (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46-0.85), and ambulatory state before admission (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.18-0.36). The cumulative 1-year incidence of all-cause death was significantly higher in the nonhome discharge group than in the home discharge group. The nonhome discharge group compared with the nonhome discharge group was associated with a higher adjusted risk for all-cause death (hazard ratio, 1.66;  P <0.001). Conclusions The discharge destination of patients with acute decompensated heart failure is influenced by factors such as prehospital social background, age, body mass index, low self-care ability, events during hospitalization (worsening heart failure, stroke, etc), functional decline, and length of hospital stay; moreover, the prognosis of nonhome discharge patients is worse than that of home discharge patients.

However, these may be challenging to implement among patients who come from the lower economic strata. We report the disastrous impact of the pandemic on the care of EOC by comparing patients who were treated during the pandemic with those treated in the previous year. We collected the following data from newly diagnosed patients with EOC: time from diagnosis to treatment, time for completion of planned chemotherapy, and proportion of patients completing various components of therapy (surgery and chemotherapy). Patients treated between January 2019 and September 2019 (Group 1: Pre-covid) were compared with those treated between January 2020 and December 2020 (Group 2: During covid pandemic). A total of 82 patients were registered [Group 1: 43(51%) Group 2: 39(49)]. The median time from diagnosis to start of treatment was longer in group 2 when compared to group 1 [31(23-58) days versus 17(11-30) days (p = 0.03)].

We aim to understand patent challenges and identify the factors that are associated with successful patent challengers under the patent linkage system in South Korea. Methods We constructed a novel dataset that combined information on manufacturers with detailed data about their patent challenges after introduction of the patent linkage system. Based on the number of successful patent challenges, manufacturers were categorized into non-challengers, passive challengers, and aggressive challengers. Then, two types of logistic models were applied to identify the factors associated with successful and aggressive challengers. Findings Only 39 active ingredients were challenged by 77 manufacturers from March 2015 to December 2019. Of 171 manufacturers, 94 (55 %) were non-challengers, 58 (34 %) were passive challengers who had succeeded in fewer than 4 patent challenges, and 19 (11 %) were aggressive challengers who had succeeded in 4 or more patent challenges. Higher sales, more employees, and a greater number of reimbursed drugs were associated with being a patent challenger, while a greater number of reimbursed drugs was associated with being an aggressive challenger. Conclusion Some manufacturers utilize patent challenges to strengthen their product portfolios in the market. However, under the patent linkage system, the frequency of patent challenges is limited in South Korea compared to the United States.

Accordingly, we conducted this study to provide an updated account of physician deaths in South Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze and compare the different characteristics associated with physician mortality amongst the countries of the region. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study by using published news reports on the websites of news agencies from 9 selected countries in South Asia. Our study included only those physicians and doctors who died after contracting COVID-19 from their respective workplaces. All available data about the country of origin, type of, sex, age, medical or surgical specialty, and date of death were included. Results The total number of physician deaths reported due to COVID-19 in our study was 170, with half (87/170, 51%) of the deaths reported from Iran. Male physician deaths were reported to be 145 (145/170 = 85%). Internal Medicine (58.43%) was the most severely affected sub-specialty. The highest physician mortality rate in the general population recorded in Afghanistan (27/1000 deaths).

They also experience fear of acute hyperglycemia that can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis as well as chronic complication including diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy. No previous research was conducted in Saudi Arabia to assess diabetes distress among adolescents and youth with T1D. This study aimed to assess diabetes distress in adolescents and youth with T1D and its relation to clinical characteristics, glycemic control and diabetes co-morbidities. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted on 158 patients at King Abdulaziz University Hospital and Dr. Erfan and Bagedo General Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Data about participants’ characters, episodes of DKA, last HbA1c level, diabetes co-morbidities were collected. Diabetes distress (DD) was assessed by the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) and Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) scores. Results The prevalence of diabetes distress among our population of adolescents with T1D was 24.1%. The mean scores of PAID and DDS were 43.56 ± 13.84 and 2.22 ± 1.05, respectively. Patients with suboptimal HbA1c had significantly higher mean PAID and DDS scores. There is also a significant positive correlation between HbA1c level and number of ketoacidosis episodes. A highly significant positive correlation was found between PAID and DDS scores. Conclusion This study found that participants with uncontrolled HbA1c had significantly higher mean PAID and DDS scores with a significant positive correlation between the last HbA1c measured level and number of ketoacidosis attacks and PAID and DDS scores. Future studies on larger samples are needed to implement interventions to minimize the burden of diabetes distress among adolescents with T1D.","['Glycemic control', 'Adolescents', 'Distress', 'Hba1c', 'Saudi', 'Type 1 Diabetes (T1d)', 'Dds', 'Paid']",[],[],NaN

Recent research proposes that differences in social mixing by sex could alter infection patterns in TB. We examine evidence for two mechanisms by which social-mixing could increase men's contact rates with TB cases. First, men could be positioned in social networks such that they contact more people or social groups. Second, preferential mixing by sex could prime men to have more exposure to TB cases. Methods We compared the networks of male and female TB cases and healthy matched controls living in Kampala, Uganda. Specifically, we estimated their positions in social networks (network distance to TB cases, degree, betweenness, and closeness) and assortativity patterns (mixing with adult men, women, and children inside and outside the household). Results The observed network consisted of 11,840 individuals. There were few differences in estimates of node position by sex. We found distinct mixing patterns by sex and TB disease status including that TB cases have proportionally more adult male contacts and fewer contacts with children. Conclusions This analysis used a network approach to study how social mixing patterns are associated with TB disease. Understanding these mechanisms may have implications for designing targeted intervention strategies in high-burden populations.","['Tuberculosis', 'Social Network', 'Contact Patterns', 'Male-bias']","['Review Board', 'Public Health', 'Georgia Institutional', 'Institutional Review', 'Higher Degrees', 'Degrees Research', 'Uganda National', 'National Council', 'Makerere University', 'University School']",[],NaN

Twelve (57%) patients recovered to MCS after a median of 8 days (IQR 2-14) off continuous sedation; they had lower body mass index (p = 0.009), lower peak serum C-reactive protein levels (p = 0.023), higher minimum arterial partial pressure of oxygen (p = 0.028), and earlier fentanyl discontinuation (p = 0.018). CRS-R scores fluctuated over time, and the best CRS-R TS was significantly higher than the last CRS-R TS (median 8 [IQR 5-23] vs. 5 [IQR 3-18], p = 0.002). Earlier fentanyl (p = 0.001) and neuromuscular blockade (p = 0.015) discontinuation correlated with a higher last CRS-R TS. Conclusions More than half of our cohort of patients with prolonged unresponsiveness following severe COVID-19 recovered to MCS or better before hospital discharge, achieving a clinical benchmark known to have relatively favorable long-term prognostic implications in DoC of other etiologies. Hypoxia, systemic inflammation, sedation, and neuromuscular blockade may impact diagnostic assessment and prognosis, and fluctuations in level of consciousness make serial assessments essential. Early neurorehabilitation of these patients in the ICU can be accomplished but is associated with unique challenges. Further research should evaluate factors associated with longer-term neurologic recovery and benefits of early rehabilitation in patients with severe COVID-19.","['Coma', 'Unconsciousness', 'Covid-19', 'Sars-cov-2', 'Early Neurological Rehabilitation']",[],[],NaN

We collected data from 35 patients with diabetes and no DR who had OCTA obtained. An additional control group of 35 eyes from 35 healthy subjects was included for comparison. OCTA volume data were processed with a previously presented algorithm in order to obtain the 3D vascular volume and 3D perfusion density. In order to weigh the contribution of different plexuses' impairment to volume rendered vascular perfusion, OCTA en face images were binarized in order to obtain two-dimensional (2D) perfusion density metrics. Mean ± SD age was 27.2 ± 10.2 years [range 19-64 years] in the diabetic group and 31.0 ± 11.4 years [range 19-61 years] in the control group (p = 0.145). The 3D vascular volume was 0.27 ± 0.05 mm 3  in the diabetic group and 0.29 ± 0.04 mm 3  in the control group (p = 0.020). The 3D perfusion density was 9.3 ± 1.6% and 10.3 ± 1.6% in diabetic patients and controls, respectively (p = 0.005). Using a 2D visualization, the perfusion density was lower in diabetic patients, but only at the deep vascular complex (DVC) level (38.9 ± 3.7% in diabetes and 41.0 ± 3.1% in controls, p = 0.001), while no differences were detected at the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) level (34.4 ± 3.1% and 34.3 ± 3.8% in the diabetic and healthy subjects, respectively, p = 0.899).

Previous studies support an association between peri-implantitis and periodontal pathogen. Thus, we investigated the bacterial flora of peri-implantitis patients in comparison to those of healthy implant and periodontitis patients. Materials and methods In total, 70 patients visiting Tokyo Dental College Chiba Hospital were divided into four groups: healthy, periodontitis, healthy implant, and peri-implantitis. For each group, the following five periodontal pathogens were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Prevotella intermedia. Results The average copy number of total bacteria was significantly higher in the periodontitis group than in the other groups. P. gingivalis was detected in the periodontitis and peri-implantitis groups at levels as high as 18.92% and 12.29%, respectively, and P. intermedia was found in the peri-implantitis group at a rate of 2.06%. Nevertheless, periodontal pathogens were generally detected at lower levels in the peri-implantitis group than in the periodontitis group. Conclusion We found lower bacterial counts in the peri-implantitis group relative to the periodontitis group. Our results suggest that the peri-implant tissue is less resistant to bacteria, so even a small number of bacteria can be a risk factor for peri-implantitis and the causative agent of peri-implantitis can be bacteria other than periodontal pathogen.","['Microbiology', 'Diagnosis', 'Clinical research', 'Peri-implantitis']",[],[],NaN

Methods This prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of acute exposure that air pollution have on reproductive outcomes in different moments of the IVF process. Women undergoing IVF living in Barcelona were recruited. Individual air pollution exposures were modelled at their home address 15 and 3 days before embryo transfer (15D and 3D, respectively), the same day of transfer (D0), and 7 days after (D7). The pollutants modelled were: PM 2.5  [particulate matter (PM) ≤2.5 μm], PM coarse  (PM between 2.5 and 10μm), PM 10  (PM≤10 μm), PM 2.5  abs, and NO 2  and NOx. Outcomes were analyzed using multi-level regression models, with adjustment for co-pollutants and confouding factors. Two sensitivity analyses were performed. First, the model was adjusted for subacute exposure (received 15 days before ET). The second analysis was based on the first transfer performed on each patient aiming to exclude patients who failed previous transfers. Results One hundred ninety-four women were recruited, contributing with data for 486 embryo transfers. Acute and subacute exposure to PMs showed a tendency in increasing miscarriage rate and reducing clinical pregnancy rate, although results were not statistically significant. The first sensitivity analysis, showed a significant risk of miscarriage for PM 2.5  exposure on 3D after adjusting for subacute exposure, and an increased risk of achieving no pregnancy for PM 2.5 , PM coarse  and PM 10  on 3D. The second sensitivity analysis showed a significant risk of miscarriage for PM 2.5  exposure on 3D, and a significant risk of achieving no pregnancy for PM2.5, PM coarse  and PM10 particularly on 3D. No association was observed for nitrogen dioxides on reproductive outcomes. Conclusions Exposure to particulate matter has a negative impact on reproductive outcomes in IVF patients. Subacute exposure seems to increase the harmful effect of the acute exposure on miscarriage and pregnancy rates. Nitrogen dioxides do not modify significantly the reproductive success.","['Pregnancy', 'Fertility', 'Nitrogen dioxide', 'particulate matter', 'Miscarriage', 'Pm10', 'Pm2.5', 'No2', 'Acute Exposure']","['Salut Mar', 'Clinical Research', 'Research Ethical', 'Ethical Committee', 'Ethics approval', 'approval Ethics', 'Barcelona', 'Spain', 'Mar', 'Ethics']",['2013/5249/I)'],NaN

Characterizing the role of the mutation activities is of importance to understand how the evolution of pathogen shapes the epidemiological outcomes at population scale. Methods We developed a statistical framework to reconstruct variant-specific reproduction numbers and estimate transmission advantage associated with the mutation activities marked by single substitution empirically. Using likelihood-based approach, the model is exemplified with the COVID-19 surveillance data from January 1 to June 30, 2020 in California, USA. We explore the potential of this framework to generate early warning signals for detecting transmission advantage on a real-time basis. Results The modelling framework in this study links together the mutation activity at molecular scale and COVID-19 transmissibility at population scale. We find a significant transmission advantage of COVID-19 associated with the D614G substitution, which increases the infectivity by 54% (95%CI: 36, 72). For the early alarming potentials, the analytical framework is demonstrated to detect this transmission advantage, before the mutation reaches dominance, on a real-time basis. Conclusions We reported an evidence of transmission advantage associated with D614G substitution, and highlighted the real-time estimating potentials of modelling framework.","['Mutation', 'Real-time Estimation', 'Statistical Modelling', 'Transmission Advantage', 'Covid-19']",[],[],NaN

No empirical evidence of this effect however has been gathered in people living with dementia. This study aims to identify the causes and effects of COVID-19-related deconditioning in people living with dementia. Methods This is a longitudinal phenomenological qualitative study. Participants living with dementia, their caregivers and therapists involved in the Promoting Activity, Independence and Stability in Early Dementia (PrAISED) process evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic were qualitatively interviewed at two time points: the baseline 2 months after the national lockdown was imposed in England (i.e., May 2020), the follow up 2 months after the first set (i.e. July 2020). The data were analysed through deductive thematic analysis. Results Twenty-four participants living with dementia, 19 caregivers and 15 therapists took part in the study. Two themes were identified: Causes of deconditioning in people living with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and effects of deconditioning in people living with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic. A self-reinforcing pattern was common, whereby lockdown made the person apathetic, demotivated, socially disengaged, and frailer. This reduced activity levels, which in turn reinforced the effects of deconditioning over time. Without external supporters, most participants lacked the motivation / cognitive abilities to keep active. Provided the proper infrastructure and support, some participants could use tele-rehabilitation to combat deconditioning. Conclusion The added risks and effects of deconditioning on people with dementia require considerable efforts from policy makers and clinicians to ensure that they initiate and maintain physical activity in prolonged periods of social distancing. Delivering rehabilitation in the same way as before the pandemic might not be feasible or sustainable and innovative approaches must be found. Digital support for this population has shown promising results but remains a challenge.

As compared with singleton pregnancies, quintuplets are associated with high rates of obstetric complications and significant prenatal morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, here we reported the first case of spontaneous quintuplet pregnancy faced by a practicing clinician in an underdeveloped country (Somalia) with a Successful outcome. Case presentation A 32-year-old woman presented in her third trimester of gestation at 30 weeks feeling pain and uterine contractions. Clinical findings and investigations Ultrasound examination showed multiple pregnancies with four alive intrauterine pregnancies, but quintuplets could not be ruled out. Fetal heart activities were present, and the amniotic fluid was normal in amount. Interventions and outcome Extensive preparations made included four sets of ventilators. We did an emergency cesarean section under spinal anesthesia: five alive infants, three boys and two girls delivered in cephalic and breech presentations. Conclusions Quintuplet pregnancy is rare but poses relevant clinical problems to both the obstetrician and the neonatologist. Relevance and impact The takeaway lesson from this case would be that Pregnancy with multiples is considered a high-risk pregnancy; with more complications observed as the number of fetuses increases, their effective follow-up requires early diagnosis with regular monitoring. Through this case, we would like to highlight the urgent need to focus on the delivery of women's health care services in Somalia, along with the need to recognize the importance of receiving antenatal care in the community so that the burden of thousands of lives that are lost each year could be reduced.

In this nationwide study, we compared OS before and after the implementation of ICI and found that 3-year OS tripled from 6% to 18%. Patients receiving ICI had a lower OS than demonstrated in RCTs, except for patients with performance status (PS) 0. More than a fifth of the patients progressed early within the first six ICI cycles. Adverse prognostic factors were PS ≥ 1 and metastases to the bone and liver.  Abstract  Background The selection of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment remains challenging. This real-world study aimed to compare the overall survival (OS) before and after the implementation of ICIs, to identify OS prognostic factors, and to assess treatment data in first-line (1L) ICI-treated patients without epidermal growth factor receptor mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation. Methods Data from the Danish NSCLC population initiated with 1L palliative antineoplastic treatment from 1 January 2013 to 1 October 2018, were extracted from the Danish Lung Cancer Registry (DLCR). Long-term survival and median OS pre- and post-approval of 1L ICI were compared. From electronic health records, additional clinical and treatment data were obtained for ICI-treated patients from 1 March 2017 to 1 October 2018. Results The OS was significantly improved in the DLCR post-approval cohort (n = 2055) compared to the pre-approval cohort (n = 1658). The 3-year OS rates were 18% (95% CI 15.6–20.0) and 6% (95% CI 5.1–7.4), respectively. On multivariable Cox regression, bone (HR = 1.63) and liver metastases (HR = 1.47), performance status (PS) 1 (HR = 1.86), and PS ≥ 2 (HR = 2.19) were significantly associated with poor OS in ICI-treated patients. Conclusion OS significantly improved in patients with advanced NSCLC after ICI implementation in Denmark. In ICI-treated patients, PS ≥ 1, and bone and liver metastases were associated with a worse prognosis.","['Non-small cell lung cancer', 'Cancer Immunotherapy', 'Overall Survival', 'First-line Treatment', 'advanced lung cancer', 'Anti-pd-1', 'Clinical Prognostic Factors', 'Danish Registry', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors', 'Real-world Evidence']",[],[],NaN

Biological stimulation of non-unions includes application of recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). However, rhBMP-2 use continues to be a matter of controversy as literature shows scarce evidence for treatment effectiveness. Questions: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of rhBMP-2 treatment on long bone non-unions measuring union rate and time to union. Furthermore, we assess risk factors for treatment failure. Methods and patients: A total of 91 patients with non-unions of long bones were treated with rhBMP-2 (n = 72) or standard care without BMP (n = 19) at our institution. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, nicotine consumption, and complications were recorded. Bone healing was assessed by plane X-rays and clinical examination. Patients were followed up with for 24 months. Results: Overall, there was significantly faster bone healing after rhBMP-2 application compared to the no-BMP group (p < 0.001; HR = 2.78; 95% CI 1.4–5.6). Union rates differed significantly between rhBMP-2 compared to the no-BMP group (89% vs. 47%; p < 0.001). At the humerus, there was neither a significantly higher union rate in the rhBMP-2 (83%) compared to the no-BMP group (50%) (p = 0.26; n = 12) nor a faster bone healing with a median time of 9 months in both groups (HR = 2.01; 95% CI 0.49–8.61; p = 0.315). The 33 femora treated using rhBMP-2 healed significantly faster than 9 femora in the no-BMP group (HR = 2.93; 95% CI 1.00–8.4; p = 0.023) with significant differences in union rate with 85% and 44%, respectively (p = 0.022). Regarding tibia non-unions, 25 out of 27 (93%) healed with a median of 9 months after rhBMP-2 application with no significant difference in the no-BMP group (33%) in time to union (p = 0.097) but a significantly higher union rate (p = 0.039). There was no effect of comorbidities, age, sex, soft tissue damage, or nicotine use on time to union, union rate, or secondary interventions. Conclusion: Consistent with the literature, overall, significantly higher union rates with reduced time to union were achieved after rhBMP-2 application.
