In stevia (<i>Stevia rebaudiana</i>), it is important to assess whether nitrogen forms can influence the synthesis of the high-value terpene metabolites-steviol glycosides (SGs), together with the underlying mechanisms. Field and pot experiments were performed where stevia plants were fertilized with either NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> nutrition to the same level of nitrogen. Physiological measurements suggested that nitrogen forms had no significant impact on biomass and the total nitrogen content of stevia leaves, but NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-enhanced leaf SGs contents.
