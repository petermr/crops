However, little is known about the molecular and genetic resources of this long-lived conifer. Herein, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four organs of <i>P. chienii</i> using the PacBio Isoform Sequencing and Illumina RNA Sequencing platforms.

We then comprehensively annotated these unigenes. The number of organ-specific expressed unigenes ranged from 4393 in leaf to 9124 in strobilus, suggesting their special roles in physiological processes, organ development, and adaptability in the different four organs. A total of 16,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the four organs and clustered into six subclusters.
