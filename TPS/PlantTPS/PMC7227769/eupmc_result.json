The mutualistic symbiont is associated with the woodwasp, assisting the damage process and providing nutrition for its insect partners. Colonization and growth of <i>A. areolatum</i> have essential impacts on the development and spread of <i>S. noctilio</i>, though the mechanism of interaction between the two has been poorly described. In this study, the first genome of this symbiotic fungus was sequenced, assembled, and annotated. The assembled <i>A. areolatum</i> genome was 57.5\u2009Mb (54.51% GC content) with 15,611 protein-coding genes. We identified 580 <u>c</u>arbohydrate-<u>a</u>ctive en<u>zymes</u> (CAZymes), 661 genes associated with pathogen-host interactions, and 318 genes encoding transport proteins in total. The genome annotation revealed 10 terpene/phytoene synthases responsible for terpenoid biosynthesis, which could be classified into three clades. Terpene synthase gene clusters in clade II were conserved well across Russulales. In this cluster, genes encoding <u>m</u>evalonate <u>k</u>inase (MK), EGR12 (COG1557), and nonplant terpene cyclases (cd00687) were the known biosynthesis and regulatory genes. Genome sequence analysis of this fungus would prove the possibility of <i>A. areolatum</i> volatiles affecting the host selection of <i>S. noctilio</i> on a molecular basis. We further clarified that <i>A. areolatum</i> was a strict obligate symbiotic fungus. The wasps might protect the fungus before it was introduced into a suitable host substrate by oviposition, while the fungus would provide <i>S. noctilio</i> with a suitable environment and nutrients for the larval growth.
