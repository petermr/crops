Since its extracts have an astringent effect on human tissues, B. striata is widely used for hemostasis and healing. Recently, some other beneficial effects have also been uncovered, such as antioxidation, antiinflammation, antifibrotic, and immunomodulatory activities. As a key step towards a thorough understanding on the medicinal ingredient production in B. striata, deciphering the regulatory codes of the metabolic pathways becomes a major task. <h4>Results</h4> In this study, three organs (roots, tubers and leaves) of B. striata were analyzed by integrating transcriptome sequencing and untargeted metabolic profiling data. Five different metabolic pathways, involved in polysaccharide, sterol, flavonoid, terpenoid and alkaloid biosynthesis, were investigated respectively. For each pathway, the expression patterns of the enzyme-coding genes and the accumulation levels of the metabolic intermediates were presented in an organ-specific way. Furthermore, the relationships between enzyme activities and the levels of the related metabolites were partially inferred. Within the biosynthetic pathways of polysaccharides and flavonoids, long-range phytochemical transportation was proposed for certain metabolic intermediates and/or the enzymes. <h4>Conclusions</h4> The data presented by this work could strengthen the molecular basis for further studies on breeding and medicinal uses of B. striata. <h4>Supplementary Information</h4> The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12870-021-03288-9.", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Undetermined", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Metabolic pathways", "Bletilla striata", "Gene Expression", "Organ-specific", "Transcriptome Assembly", "Long-range Transportation"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "PubMedCentral", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8559373/?tool=EBI"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "PubMedCentral", "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8559373/pdf/?tool=EBI"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8559373"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8559373?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "N", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "gen"}, "dateOfCreation": "2021-11-06", "firstIndexDate": "2021-11-06", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-11-06", "dateOfRevision": "2021-11-06", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-01-01", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-01-01"}, "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> Bletilla striata is one of the important species belonging to the Bletilla genus of Orchidaceae.
