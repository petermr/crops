The olive tree, and its fruits and leaves, are known as a source of nutraceuticals since they are rich in biophenols. However, there is still a serious lack of data about biophenolic distribution in olive stems and roots under Mn fertilisation. In this context, our study aimed to examine the effects of Mn fertilisation on the biophenolic profile in the leaves, stems, and roots of the 'Istarska bjelica' olive cultivar. The experiment was set up in a greenhouse, during a period of five months, as a random block design consisting of three treatments with varying Mn concentrations in full-strength Hoagland's nutrient solution (0.2 \u00b5M Mn, 12 \u00b5M Mn, and 24 \u00b5M Mn). The obtained results indicate that the amount of Mn in the examined olive plant tissues was significantly higher under 12 \u00b5M Mn and 24 \u00b5M Mn treatments compared to that of the 0.2 \u00b5M Mn treatment. While the concentration of biophenols varied in roots depending on the compound in question, a strong positive impact of the increased Mn concentration in nutrient solution (12 \u00b5M Mn and 24 \u00b5M Mn) on the concentrations of the main biophenolic compounds was observed in stems. The concentration of oleuropein in leaves almost doubled at 24 \u00b5M Mn, with the highest Mn concentration, as compared to the 0.2 \u00b5M Mn treatment.
