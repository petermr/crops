Fresh leaves of <i>Cinnamomum</i> trees, e.g., <i>C. burmannii</i> and <i>C. camphor</i>, are the main sources from which D-borneol is extracted by steam distillation, yet with low yields. Insufficient supply of D-borneol has hampered its clinical use and production of patent remedies for a long time. Biological synthesis of D-borneol offers an additional approach; however, mechanisms of D-borneol biosynthesis remain mostly unresolved. Hence, it is important and necessary to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of D-borneol.<h4>Results</h4>Comparative analysis on the gene expression patterns of different D-borneol production <i>C. burmannii</i> samples facilitates elucidation on the underlying biosynthetic pathway of D-borneol. Herein, we collected three different chemotypes of <i>C. burmannii</i>, which harbor different contents of D-borneol.A total of 100,218 unigenes with an N50 of 1,128 bp were assembled de novo using Trinity from a total of 21.21 Gb clean bases. We used BLASTx analysis against several public databases to annotate 45,485 unigenes (45.38%) to at least one database, among which 82 unigenes were assigned to terpenoid biosynthesis pathways by KEGG annotation. In addition, we defined 8,860 unigenes as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), among which 13 DEGs were associated with terpenoid biosynthesis pathways. One 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and two monoterpene synthase, designated as <i>CbDXS9</i>, <i>CbTPS2</i> and <i>CbTPS3</i>, were up-regulated in the high-borneol group compared to the low-borneol and borneol-free groups, and might be vital to biosynthesis of D-borneol in <i>C. burmannii.</i> In addition, we identified one WRKY, two BHLH, one AP2/ERF and three MYB candidate genes, which exhibited the same expression patterns as <i>CbTPS2</i> and <i>CbTPS3</i>, suggesting that these transcription factors might potentially regulate D-borneol biosynthesis. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR was conducted to detect the actual expression level of those candidate genes related to the D-borneol biosynthesis pathway, and the result showed that the expression patterns of the candidate genes related to D-borneol biosynthesis were basically consistent with those revealed by transcriptome analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We used transcriptome sequencing to analyze three different chemotypes of <i>C. burmannii</i>, identifying three candidate structural genes (one DXS, two monoterpene synthases) and seven potential transcription factor candidates (one WRKY, two BHLH, one AP2/ERF and three MYB) involved in D-borneol biosynthesis.
