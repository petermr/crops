During the process of vernalization and flower bud differentiation, sugar massively accumulated in the bulb, which influenced the bulb development. However, the details of sugar genes' regulation mechanism for these processes were not fully understood. Here, morphological physiology, transcriptomes and gene engineering technology were used to explore this physiological change. Seventy-two genes of 25 kinds of sugar metabolism-related genes were annotated after re-analyzing transcriptome data of Oriental hybrid lily 'Sorbonne' bulbs, which were generated on Hiseq Illumina 2000.

Combining gene expression pattern with gene co-expression network, five genes (Contig5669, Contig13319, Contig7715, Contig1420 and Contig87292) were considered to be the most potential signals, and the sucrose transporter gene (<i>SUT</i>) was the focus of this study.
