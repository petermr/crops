In this paper, the differences in the contents and compositions of terpenoids among three chemotypes were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Furthermore, the differential expression of gene transcripts in the leaf tissues of the three C. porrectum chemotypes were analyzed through a comparison of full-length transcriptomes and expression profiles. The essential oil of the three C. porrectum chemotypes leaves was mainly composed of monoterpenes. In the full-length transcriptome of C. porrectum, 104,062 transcripts with 306,337,921 total bp, an average length of 2944 bp, and an N50 length of 5449 bp, were obtained and 94025 transcripts were annotated. In the eucalyptol and linalool chemotype, the camphor and eucalyptol chemotype, and the camphor and linalool chemotype comparison groups, 21, 22 and 18 terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes were identified respectively. Three monoterpene synthase genes, CpTPS3, CpTPS5 and CpTPS9, were upregulated in the eucalyptol chemotype compared to the linalool chemotype and camphor chemotype. CpTPS1 was upregulated in the camphor chemotype compared to the linalool chemotype and the eucalyptol chemotype. CpTPS4 was upregulated in the linalool chemotype compared to the camphor chemotype and the eucalyptol chemotype. Different unigenes had different expression levels among the three chemotypes, but the unigene expression levels of the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4phosphate (MEP) pathway were generally higher than those of the mevalonate acid (MVA) pathway.
