Our understanding of the developmental process of GTs is limited, and no single plant species serves as a unique model. Here, we review the genetic mechanisms of GT initiation and development and provide a summary of the biosynthetic pathways of GT-specialized metabolites in nonmodel plant species, especially horticultural crops. We discuss the morphology and classification of GT types. Moreover, we highlight technological advancements in methods employed for investigating GTs. Understanding the molecular basis of GT development and specialized metabolites not only offers useful avenues for research in plant breeding that will lead to the improved production of desirable metabolites, but also provides insights for plant epidermal development research.", "affiliation": "Engineering Research Center of the Ministry of Education for Horticultural Crops Breeding and Propagation, College of Horticulture, China Agricultural University, 100193, Beijing, P.
