To provide new insights into the onset of the roots-beneficial microorganisms interplay, we characterised the transcriptomes expressed in tomato roots at 24, 48 and 72\u2009h post inoculation with the beneficial fungus <i>Trichoderma harzianum</i> T22 and analysed the epigenetic and post-trascriptional regulation mechanisms. We detected 1243 tomato transcripts that were differentially expressed between <i>Trichoderma</i>-interacting and control roots and 83 <i>T. harzianum</i> transcripts that were differentially expressed between the three experimental time points. Interaction with <i>Trichoderma</i> triggered a transcriptional response mainly ascribable to signal recognition and transduction, stress response, transcriptional regulation and transport. In tomato roots, salicylic acid, and not jasmonate, appears to have a prominent role in orchestrating the interplay with this beneficial strain. Differential regulation of many nutrient transporter genes indicated a strong effect on plant nutrition processes, which, together with the possible modifications in root architecture triggered by ethylene/indole-3-acetic acid signalling at 72\u2009h post inoculation may concur to the well-described growth-promotion ability of this strain. Alongside, <i>T. harzianum</i>-induced defence priming and stress tolerance may be mediated by the induction of reactive oxygen species, detoxification and defence genes. A deeper insight into gene expression and regulation control provided first evidences for the involvement of cytosine methylation and alternative splicing mechanisms in the plant-<i>Trichoderma</i> interaction.
