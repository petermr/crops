In Phalaenopsis bellina (Orchidaceae), the major floral scent components are monoterpenoids. Previously, we determined that expression of GERANYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (PbGDPS) is highly correlated with monoterpene biosynthesis in Phalaenosis orchids. Here, we found that both cis- and trans-regulation were present on the GDPS promoters, with trans-regulation playing a key role. To investigate the regulation of biosynthesis of floral scent, we compared the transcriptomic data of two Phalaenopsis orchids with contrasting scent phenotypes. Eight transcription factors (TFs) that exhibited sequential elevation in abundance through floral development in P. bellina were identified, and their transcript levels were higher in the scented orchid than the scentless one.
