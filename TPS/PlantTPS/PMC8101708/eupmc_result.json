Its flowers could be used as health care tea for its aroma flavor and medicinal value. Most recent studies demonstrated that terpenoids are the main components of the aromatic compounds in the flowers, but the biosynthesis of terpenoids is poorly understood in <i>D. officinale</i>. In the experiment, the flowers from two cultivars of <i>D. officinale</i> with different smells were collected. The transcriptome analysis and combined volatile terpenoids determination were performed to identify the genes related to the biosynthesis of the terpenoids.
