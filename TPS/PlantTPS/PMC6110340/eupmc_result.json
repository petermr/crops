This study explored the role of the TPS22 gene in Se tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana.<h4>Methods</h4>Arabidopsis wild type and XVE mutant seeds were grown on half-strength MS media containing Na2SeO3 for screening of the Se-tolerant mutant tps22. The XVE T-DNA-tagged genomic sequence in tps22 was identified by TAIL-PCR. The TPS22 gene was transformed into the mutant tps22 and wild type plants using the flower infiltration method. Wild type, tps22 mutant and transgenic seedlings were cultivated on vertical plates for phenotype analysis, physiological index measurement and gene expression analysis.<h4>Key results</h4>We identified an Arabidopsis Se-tolerant mutant tps22 from the XVE pool lines, and cloned the gene which encodes the terpenoid synthase (TPS22). TPS22 was downregulated by Se stress, and loss-of-function of TPS22 resulted in decreased Se accumulation and enhanced Se tolerance; by contrast, overexpression of TPS22 showed similar traits to the wild type under Se stress. Further analysis revealed that TPS22 mediated Se tolerance through reduction of Se uptake and activation of metabolism detoxification, which decreased transcription of high-affinity transporters PHT1;1, PHT1;8 and PHT1;9 and significantly increased transcription of selenocysteine methyltransferase (SMT), respectively. Moreover, loss-of-function of TPS22 resulted in reduced cytokinin level and repression of cytokinin signalling components AHK3 and AHK4, and upregulation of ARR3, ARR15 and ARR16. Exogenous cytokinin increased transcription of PHT1;1, PHT2;1 and SMT and decreased Se tolerance of the tps22 mutant. In addition, enhanced Se resistance of the tps22 mutant was associated with glutathione (GSH).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Se stress downregulated TPS22, which reduced endogenous cytokinin level, and then affected the key factors of Se uptake and metabolism detoxification.
