It is a Level 3 protected species, and is one of the 42 national key protected wild species of animals and plants in China. However, the genetics and molecular biology of C. officinalis are poorly understood, which has hindered research on the molecular mechanism of its metabolism and utilization. Hence, enriching its genomic data and information is very important. In recent years, the fast-growing technology of next generation sequencing has provided an effective path to gain genomic information from nonmodel species. This study is the first to explore the leaf and fruit tissue transcriptome of C. officinalis using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. A total of 57,954,134 and 60,971,652 clean reads from leaf and fruit were acquired, respectively (GenBank number SRP115440). The pooled reads from all two libraries were assembled into 56,392 unigenes with an average length 856 bp. Among these, 41,146 unigenes matched with sequences in the NCBI nonredundant protein database. The Gene Ontology database assigned 24,336 unigenes with biological process (83.26%), cellular components (53.58%), and molecular function (83.93%). In addition, 10,808 unigenes were assigned a KOG functional classification by the KOG database. Searching against the KEGG pathway database indicated that 18,435 unigenes were mapped to 371 KEGG pathways. Moreover, the edgeR database identified 4,585 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 1,392 were up-regulated and 3,193 were down-regulated in fruit tissue compared with leaf tissue. Finally, we explored 581 transcription factors with 50 transcription factor gene families. Most DEGs and transcription factors were related to terpene biosynthesis and secondary metabolic regulation. This study not only represented the first de novo transcriptomic analysis of C. officinalis but also provided fundamental information on its genes and biosynthetic pathway.
