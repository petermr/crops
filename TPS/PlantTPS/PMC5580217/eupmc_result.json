There are reports devoted to comparative transcriptome study on fiber cell initiation and elongation in tetraploid cultivated cotton. However, in the present investigation, comparative transcriptome study was made in diploid cultivated cotton using isogenic fuzzy-lintless (Fl) and normal fuzzy linted (FL) lines belong to Gossypium arboreum, diploid species at two stages, 0 and 10 dpa (days post anthesis), using Affymetrix cotton GeneChip genome array.<h4>Result</h4>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis uncovered the occurrence of few fibre cell initials in the Fl line as compared to many in Normal FL at -2 and 0 dpa. However, at 10 dpa there were no fibre cells found elongated in Fl but many elongated cells were found in FL line. Up-regulation of transcription factors, AP2-EREBP, C2H2, C3H, HB and WRKY was observed at 0 dpa whereas in 10 dpa transcription factors, AP2-EREBP, AUX/IAA, bHLH, C2H2, C3H, HB, MYB, NAC, Orphans, PLATZ and WRKY were found down regulated in Fl line. These transcription factors were mainly involved in metabolic pathways such as phytohormone signaling, energy metabolism of cell, fatty acid metabolism, secondary metabolism and other signaling pathways and are related directly or indirectly in fiber development. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to check fold up or down-regulation of these genes and transcription factors (TFs) down regulated in mutants as compared to normal at 0 and 10 dpa.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study elucidates that the up-regulation of transcription factors like AP2-EREBP, C2H2, C3H, HB, WRKY and phytohormone signaling genes at 0 dpa and their down-regulation at the 10 dpa might have constrain the fibre elongation in fuzzy-lintless line.
