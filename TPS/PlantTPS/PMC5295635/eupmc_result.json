survival, and accordingly, plants have evolved sophisticated defence systems. Maize is cultivated as a staple crop worldwide, and insect feeding causes large production losses. Despite its importance in agriculture, little is known about how maize reacts to insect herbivory. Taking advantage of advances in sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, we studied the response of maize to mechanical wounding and simulated Mythimna separata (a specialist insect) herbivory by applying its oral secretions (OS) to wounds. In comparison to the responses induced by mechanical wounding, OS elicited larger and longer-lasting changes in the maize transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and phytohormones. Specifically, many genes, proteins and metabolites were uniquely induced or repressed by OS. Nearly 290 transcription factor genes from 39 families were involved in OS-induced responses, and among these, more transcription factor genes were specifically regulated by OS than by wounding. This study provides a large-scale omics dataset for understanding maize response to chewing insects and highlights the essential role of OS in plant-insect interactions.", "affiliation": "Department of Economic Plants and Biotechnology, Yunnan Key Laboratory for Wild Plant Resources, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650201, China.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "293926", "agency": "European Research Council", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "XDB11050200", "agency": "Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "2012HA016", "agency": "Yunnan Recruitment Program of Experts in Sciences", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Animals"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Moths", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "PH", "qualifierName": "physiology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Zea mays", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Proteome"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Transcription Factors", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Transcriptome"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Herbivory"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Proteome", "Transcriptome", "metabolome", "phytohormones"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": [{"name": "Plant Growth Regulators", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "Transcription Factors", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "Proteome", "registryNumber": "0"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.12735"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5295635"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5295635?pdf=render"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.12735"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "N", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "16", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "authMan": "Y", "epmcAuthMan": "Y", "nihAuthMan": "N", "manuscriptId": "EMS70578", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2017-12-19", "dateOfCreation": "2016-03-19", "firstIndexDate": "2016-03-19", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-10-15", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-05-05", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-05-05"}, "abstract": "Attack from insect herbivores poses a major threat to plant survival, and accordingly, plants have evolved sophisticated defence systems.
