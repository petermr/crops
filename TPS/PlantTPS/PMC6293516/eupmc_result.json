Carotenoid-related research has mostly focused on model species, and there is a lack of data on the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in U. prolifera that is the main species leading to green tide, a harmful plague of floating green algae.<h4>Results</h4>The carotenoid content of U. prolifera samples, that is the main species leading to green tide, a harmful plague of floating green algae at different temperatures revealed that its terpenoid was highest in the samples subjected to high temperature at 28\u2009\u00b0C (H), followed by the samples subjected to low temperature at 12\u2009\u00b0C (L). Its terpenoid was lowest in the samples subjected to medium temperature at 20\u2009\u00b0C (M). We conducted transcriptome sequencing (148.5 million raw reads and 49,676 unigenes in total) of samples that were subjected to different temperatures to study the carotenoid biosynthesis of U. prolifera. There were 1125-3164 significant differentially expressed genes between L, M and H incubation temperatures, of which 11-672 genes were upregulated and 453-3102 genes were downregulated. A total of 3164 genes were significantly differentially expressed between H and M, of which 62 genes were upregulated and 3102 genes were downregulated. A total of 2669 significant differentially expressed genes were observed between L and H, of which 11 genes were upregulated and 2658 genes were downregulated. A total of 13 genes were identified to be involved in carotenoid biosynthesis in U. prolifera, and the expression levels of the majority were highest at H and lowest at M of incubation temperature. Both the carotenoid concentrations and the expression of the analysed genes were lowest in the normal temperature group, while low temperature and high temperature seemed to activate the biosynthesis of carotenoids in U. prolifera.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, transcriptome sequencing provided critical information for understanding the accumulation of carotenoids and will serve as an important reference for the study of other metabolic pathways in U. prolifera.", "affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, College of Biology and Basic Medical Sciences, Soochow University, No. 199 Renai Road, SIP, Suzhou, 215123, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "2016YFC1402102", "agency": "National Key R&D Program of China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "2016YFC1402104", "agency": "National Key R&D Program of China", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "41276134", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Ulva", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "CL", "qualifierName": "classification", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "GE", "qualifierName": "genetics", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Carotenoids", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "AN", "qualifierName": "analysis", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "BI", "qualifierName": "biosynthesis", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Chlorophyll", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "AN", "qualifierName": "analysis", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "RNA, Plant", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "IP", "qualifierName": "isolation & purification", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "ME", "qualifierName": "metabolism", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, RNA"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Chlorophyll A", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "AN", "qualifierName": "analysis", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Green algae", "gene ontology", "Qrt-pcr", "Temperature Response", "Biological Pathway"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": [{"name": "Carotenoids", "registryNumber": "36-88-4"}, {"name": "Chlorophyll", "registryNumber": "1406-65-1"}, {"name": "RNA, Plant", "registryNumber": "0"}, {"name": "chlorophyll a", "registryNumber": "YF5Q9EJC8Y"}, {"name": "chlorophyll b", "registryNumber": "5712ZB110R"}]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-5337-y"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6293516"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6293516?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "2", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "gen"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2019-03-14", "dateOfCreation": "2018-12-15", "firstIndexDate": "2018-12-21", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2020-02-25", "electronicPublicationDate": "2018-12-13", "firstPublicationDate": "2018-12-13"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6293516", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Carotenoids are widely distributed in plants and algae, and their biosynthesis has attracted widespread interest.
