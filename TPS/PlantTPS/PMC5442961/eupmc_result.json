An age-related resistance (ARR) to this pathogen was previously observed in fruit of cultivar 'Vlaspik' and shown to be associated with the peel. Young fruits are highly susceptible, but develop resistance at ~10-12 days post pollination (dpp). Peels from resistant (16\u2009dpp) versus susceptible (8\u2009dpp) age fruit are enriched with genes associated with defense, and methanolic extracts from resistant age peels inhibit pathogen growth. Here we compared developing fruits from 'Vlaspik' with those of 'Gy14', a line that does not exhibit ARR. Transcriptomic analysis of peels of the two lines at 8 and 16\u2009dpp identified 80 genes that were developmentally upregulated in resistant 'Vlaspik' 16\u2009dpp versus 8\u2009dpp, but not in susceptible 'Gy14' at 16\u2009dpp. A large number of these genes are annotated to be associated with defense and/or specialized metabolism, including four putative resistance (R) genes, and numerous genes involved in flavonoid and terpenoid synthesis and decoration. Untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed on extracts from 8 and 16\u2009dpp 'Vlaspik' and 'Gy14' fruit peels using Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography and Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. Multivariate analysis of the metabolomes identified 113 ions uniquely abundant in resistant 'Vlaspik' 16\u2009dpp peel extracts.
