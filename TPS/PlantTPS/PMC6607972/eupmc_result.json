These insect-transmissible geminiviruses cause significant crop losses across continents and pose a serious threat to food security. Under the control of promoters generally located within the intergenic region, their genomes encode five to eight ORFs from overlapping viral transcripts. Most proteins encoded by geminiviruses perform multiple functions, such as suppressing defense responses, hijacking ubiquitin-proteasomal pathways, altering hormonal responses, manipulating cell cycle regulation, and exploiting protein-signaling cascades. Geminiviruses establish complex but coordinated interactions with several host elements to spread and facilitate successful infection cycles. Consequently, plants have evolved several multilayered defense strategies against geminivirus infection and distribution. Recent studies on the evasion of host-mediated resistance factors by various geminivirus proteins through novel mechanisms have provided new insights into the development of antiviral strategies against geminiviruses.
