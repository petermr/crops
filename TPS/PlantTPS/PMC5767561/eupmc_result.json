This study presents the first significant production of caryophyllene and caryolan-1-ol by an engineered E. coli with heterologous expression of mevalonate pathway genes with a caryophyllene synthase and a caryolan-1-ol synthase. By optimizing metabolic flux and fermentation parameters, the engineered strains yielded 449\u00a0mg/L of total terpene, including 406\u00a0mg/L sesquiterpene with 100\u00a0mg/L caryophyllene and 10\u00a0mg/L caryolan-1-ol. Furthermore, a marine microalgae hydrolysate was used as the sole carbon source for the production of caryophyllene and other terpene compounds.

The highest yields achieved on the biomass basis were 48\u00a0mg total terpene/g algae and 10\u00a0mg caryophyllene/g algae and the caryophyllene yield is approximately ten times higher than that from plant tissues by solvent extraction.
