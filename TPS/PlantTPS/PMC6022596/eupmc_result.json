This raises the question of whether these marine angiosperms followed the same adaptation pathway to allow them to live and reproduce under the hostile marine conditions. To compare the basis of marine adaptation between seagrass lineages, we generated genomic data for Halophila ovalis and compared this with recently published genomes for two members of Zosteraceae, as well as genomes of five non-marine plant species (Arabidopsis, Oryza sativa, Phoenix dactylifera, Musa acuminata, and Spirodela polyrhiza).
