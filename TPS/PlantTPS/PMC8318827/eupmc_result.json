Here, we report a reference genome of <i>R. glutinosa</i> using Nanopore technology, Illumina and Hi-C sequencing. The assembly genome is 2.49\u00a0Gb long with a scaffold N50 length of 70\u00a0Mb and high heterozygosity (2%). Since <i>R. glutinosa</i> is an autotetraploid (4n\u00a0=\u00a056), the difference between each set of chromosomes is very small, and it is difficult to distinguish the two sets of chromosomes using Hi-C. Hence, only one set of the genome size was mounted to the chromosome level. Scaffolds covering 52.61% of the assembled genome were anchored on 14 pseudochromosomes. Over 67% of the genome consists of repetitive sequences dominated by <i>Copia</i> long terminal repeats and 48,475 protein-coding genes were predicted. Phylogenetic analysis corroborates the placement of <i>R. glutinosa</i> in the Orobanchaceae family.

Comparative genomics analysis demonstrated expansion of the UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases and terpene synthase gene families, known to be involved in terpenoid biosynthesis and diversification.
