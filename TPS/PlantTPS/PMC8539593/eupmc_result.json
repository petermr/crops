For the first time, the expression patterns of \u03b3-terpinene synthase (TPS2), CYP71D178, and CYP71D180 genes and the amount of phenolics compounds were evaluated in T. migricus and T. daenensis after different methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatments. The highest thymol and carvacrol contents were observed in T. migricus (86.27%) and T. daenensis (17.87%) at MeJA 100 \u00b5M, which was consistent with the expression patterns of the three investigated genes. All species treated showed high total phenolic and flavonoid content compared to control plants for which the highest amounts were observed in T. vulgaris treated with 100 \u00b5M and 10 \u00b5M MeJA. Furthermore, in the 100 \u00b5M MeJA treatment, the relative expression of TPS2 and CYP71D178 in T. migricus increased 7.47 and 9.86-fold compared with the control, respectively. The highest level of CYP71D180 transcripts (5.15-fold) was also observed for T. daenensis treated.
