In order to explore the mechanism underlying the different fragrances, the floral scents of <i>Lilium</i> 'Sibeia', with a strong fragrance, and <i>Lilium</i> 'Novano', with a very faint fragrance, were collected <i>in vivo</i> using a dynamic headspace technique. These scents were identified using automated thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (ATD-GC/MS) at different flowering stages. We used RNA-Seq technique to determine the petal transcriptome at the full-bloom stage and analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to investigate the molecular mechanism of floral scent biosynthesis. The results showed that a significantly higher amount of <i>Lilium</i> 'Siberia' floral scent was released compared with <i>Lilium</i> 'Novano'. Moreover, monoterpenes played a dominant role in the floral scent of <i>Lilium</i> 'Siberia'; therefore, it is believed that the different emissions of monoterpenes mainly contributed to the difference in the floral scent between the two <i>Lilium</i> genotypes. Transcriptome sequencing analysis indicated that ~29.24 Gb of raw data were generated and assembled into 124,233 unigenes, of which 35,749 unigenes were annotated.
