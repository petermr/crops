known for its very sweet steviol glycosides (SGs) consisting of a common tetracyclic diterpenoid steviol backbone and a variable glycone. Steviol glycosides are 150-300 times sweeter than sucrose and are used as natural zero-calorie sweeteners. However, the most promising compounds are biosynthesized in small amounts. Based on Illumina, PacBio, and Hi-C sequencing, we constructed a chromosome-level assembly of Stevia covering 1416\u2009Mb with a contig N50 value of 616.85\u2009kb and a scaffold N50 value of 106.55\u2009Mb. More than four-fifths of the Stevia genome consisted of repetitive elements. We annotated 44,143 high-confidence protein-coding genes in the high-quality genome. Genome evolution analysis suggested that Stevia and sunflower diverged ~29.4 million years ago (Mya), shortly after the whole-genome duplication (WGD) event (WGD-2, ~32.1 Mya) that occurred in their common ancestor. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the expanded genes in Stevia were mainly enriched for biosynthesis of specialized metabolites, especially biosynthesis of terpenoid backbones, and for further oxidation and glycosylation of these compounds. We further identified all candidate genes involved in SG biosynthesis. Collectively, our current findings on the Stevia reference genome will be very helpful for dissecting the evolutionary history of Stevia and for discovering novel genes contributing to SG biosynthesis and other important agronomic traits in future breeding programs.", "affiliation": "Institute of Botany, Jiangsu Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences/Jiangsu Provincial Platform for Conservation and Utilization of Agricultural Germplasm, Nanjing, 210014, Jiangsu, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "31601371", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "31701497", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "BK20160600", "agency": "Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation)", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "BK20180312", "agency": "Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation)", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41438-021-00565-4"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8166950"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8166950?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "1", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "go"}, "dateOfCreation": "2021-06-01", "firstIndexDate": "2021-06-02", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-06-09", "dateOfRevision": "2021-06-08", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-06-01", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-06-01"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8166950", "abstract": "Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni) is well known for its very sweet steviol glycosides (SGs) consisting of a common tetracyclic diterpenoid steviol backbone and a variable glycone.
