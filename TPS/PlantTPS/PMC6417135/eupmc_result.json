It is abundant in juice of some mandarins (e.g. Citrus reticulata Blanco cv. Fortune), however, it is undetectable in others (e.g. C. reticulata Blanco cv. Murcott), We have discovered that the Murcott mandarin Cstps1 gene expression is severely reduced. A previous genetic mapping study using an F1 population of Fortune \u00d7 Murcott found that the segregation of valencene production in fruit exhibited a Mendelian inheritance ratio of 1:1. There was only one dominant locus associated with valencene content detected on the mandarin genetic map. The goal of this study was to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the valencene deficiency observed in some citrus hybrids.<h4>Results</h4>There was a clear relationship between presence or absence of the valencene synthase gene (Cstps1) expression, and presence or absence of valencene among randomly selected mandarin hybrids. Cloning the coding regions of Cstps1 from Fortune and Murcott mandarin, and aligning with previous reported Valencia orange Cstps1 sequence, showed that they both exhibited extremely high similarity with the known Cstps1. By further cloning and analyzing the promoter region of Cstps1 from Valencia, Fortune and Murcott, a 12-nucleotide deletion at approximately -\u2009270\u2009bp from the Cstps1 coding region was only found in Murcott. Three binary vectors, designated as p1380-FortP-GUSin, p1380-MurcP-GUSin and p1380-MurcP(+\u200912)-GUSin, were developed for promoter activity analysis. Transient over-expression of Fortune Cstps1 promoter in sweet orange showed notable GUS activity, but the Murcott Cstps1 promoter did not. In addition, by re-inserting the 12-nucleotide fragment, the activity of the Murcott Cstps1 promoter was mostly recovered.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The deficiency of valencene production in some mandarins is probably due to a 12-nucleotide deletion in the promoter region of the Cstps1, which could be a crucial switch of Cstps1 transcription.
