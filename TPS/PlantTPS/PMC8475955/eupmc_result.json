The essential oil of <i>Cinnamomum camphora</i>, which is rich in monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other aromatic compounds, has a wide range of pharmacological activities and has therefore attracted considerable interest. However, the <i>TIDS</i> gene family, and its relationship to the camphor tree (<i>C. camphora</i> L. Presl.), has not yet been characterized. In this study, we identified 10 <i>TIDS</i> genes in the genome of the <i>C. camphora</i> borneol chemotype that were unevenly distributed on chromosomes. Synteny analysis revealed that the <i>TIDS</i> gene family in this species likely expanded through segmental duplication events. Furthermore, cis-element analyses demonstrated that <i>C. camphora</i> TIDS (CcTIDS) genes can respond to multiple abiotic stresses. Finally, functional characterization of eight putative short-chain TIDS proteins revealed that CcTIDS3 and CcTIDS9 exhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) activity, while CcTIDS1 and CcTIDS2 encode geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases (GGPPS). Although, CcTIDS8 and CcTIDS10 were found to be catalytically inactive alone, they were able to bind to each other to form a heterodimeric functional geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) <i>in vitro</i>, and this interaction was confirmed using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that the <i>CcTIDS3</i>, <i>CcTIDS8</i>, <i>CcTIDS9</i>, and <i>CcTIDS10</i> genes were found to be more active in <i>C. camphora</i> roots as compared to stems and leaves, which were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
