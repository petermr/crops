products due to its anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing properties. (-)-\u03b1-Bisabolol is currently manufactured mainly by steam-distillation of the essential oils extracted from the Brazilian candeia tree that is under threat because its natural habitat is constantly shrinking. Therefore, microbial production of (-)-\u03b1-bisabolol plays a key role in the development of its sustainable production from renewable feedstock.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we created an Escherichia coli strain producing (-)-\u03b1-bisabolol at high titer and developed an in situ extraction method of (-)-\u03b1-bisabolol, using natural vegetable oils. We expressed a recently identified (-)-\u03b1-bisabolol synthase isolated from German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) (titer: 3\u00a0mg/L), converted the acetyl-CoA to mevalonate, using the biosynthetic mevalonate pathway (12.8\u00a0mg/L), and overexpressed farnesyl diphosphate synthase to efficiently supply the (-)-\u03b1-bisabolol precursor farnesyl diphosphate. Combinatorial expression of the exogenous mevalonate pathway and farnesyl diphosphate synthase enabled a dramatic increase in (-)-\u03b1-bisabolol production in the shake flask culture (80\u00a0mg/L) and 5\u00a0L bioreactor culture (342\u00a0mg/L) of engineered E. coli harboring (-)-\u03b1-bisabolol synthase. Fed-batch fermentation using a 50\u00a0L fermenter was conducted after optimizing culture conditions, resulting in efficient (-)-\u03b1-bisabolol production with a titer of 9.1\u00a0g/L. Moreover, a green, downstream extraction process using vegetable oils was developed for in situ extraction of (-)-\u03b1-bisabolol during fermentation and showed high yield recovery (>98%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The engineered E. coli strains and economically viable extraction process developed in this study will serve as promising platforms for further development of microbial production of (-)-\u03b1-bisabolol at large scale.", "affiliation": "Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "2011-0031944", "agency": "The Intelligent Synthetic Biology Center", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "KRIBB Research Initiative Program", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "NRF-2010-0029087", "agency": "National Research Foundation of Korea", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["In situ extraction", "Escherichia Coli", "Farnesyl Diphosphate Synthase", "Mevalonate Pathway", "Vegetable Oils", "(\u2212)-\u0391-bisabolol", "(\u2212)-\u0391-bisabolol Synthase"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-016-0588-2"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5101696"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5101696?pdf=render"}]}, "commentCorrectionList": {"commentCorrection": {"id": "28143533", "source": "MED", "reference": "Microb Cell Fact. 2017 Jan 31;16(1):19", "type": "Erratum in", "orderIn": "1"}}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "14", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "gen"}, "dateOfCompletion": "2017-03-29", "dateOfCreation": "2016-11-10", "firstIndexDate": "2016-11-11", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2018-11-13", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-11-08", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-11-08"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5101696", "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>(-)-\u03b1-Bisabolol, also known as levomenol, is an unsaturated sesquiterpene alcohol that has mainly been used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products due to its anti-inflammatory and skin-soothing properties.
