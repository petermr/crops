However, maize cultivars differ strongly in their ability to produce the defense signal. To further understand the agroecological role and underlying genetic mechanisms for variation in terpene emission among maize cultivars, we studied the production of an important signaling component (<i>E</i>)-caryophyllene in a South American maize landrace Braz1006 possessing stemborer <i>Chilo partellus</i> egg inducible defense trait, in comparison with the European maize line Delprim and North American inbred line B73. The (<i>E)</i><b>-</b>caryophyllene production level and transcript abundance of TPS23, terpene synthase responsible for (<i>E)</i><b>-</b>caryophyllene formation, were compared between Braz1006, Delprim, and B73 after mimicked herbivory. Braz1006-TPS23 was heterologously expressed in <i>E.\u00a0coli</i>, and amino acid sequences were determined. Furthermore, electrophysiological and behavioral responses of a key parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia sesamiae</i> to <i>C</i>.\u00a0<i>partellus</i> egg-induced Braz1006 volatiles were determined using coupled gas chromatography electroantennography and olfactometer bioassay studies.
