Floral scent is a key component of pollinator attraction, and its chemistry modulates both pollinator behaviour and the formation of plant-pollinator networks. The neotropical orchid genus Gongora exhibits specialized pollinator associations with male orchid bees (Euglossini). Male bees visit orchid flowers to collect volatile chemical compounds that they store in hind-leg pouches to use subsequently during courtship display. Hence, Gongora floral scent compounds simultaneously serve as signalling molecules and pollinator rewards. Furthermore, because floral scent acts as the predominant reproductive isolating barrier among lineages, it has been hypothesized that chemical traits are highly species specific. A comparative analysis of intra- and inter-specific variation of floral scent chemistry was conducted to investigate the evolutionary patterns across the genus. \u2022<h4>Methods</h4>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyse the floral scent of 78 individuals belonging to 28 different species of Gongora from two of the three major lineages sampled across the neotropical region. Multidimensional scaling and indicator value analyses were implemented to investigate the patterns of chemical diversity within and among taxonomic groups at various geographic scales. Additionally, pollinator observations were conducted on a sympatric community of Gongora orchids exhibiting distinct floral scent phenotypes. \u2022<h4>Key results</h4>A total of 83 floral volatiles, mainly terpenes and aromatic compounds, were detected. Many of the identified compounds are common across diverse angiosperm families (e.g. cineole, eugenol, \u03b2-ocimene, \u03b2-pinene and terpinen-4-ol), while others are relatively rare outside euglossine bee-pollinated orchid lineages. Additionally, 29 volatiles were identified that are known to attract and elicit collection behaviour in male bees. Floral scent traits were less variable within species than between species, and the analysis revealed exceptional levels of cryptic diversity. Gongora species were divided into 15 fragrance groups based on shared compounds. Fragrance groups indicate that floral scent variation is not predicted by taxonomic rank or biogeographic region. \u2022<h4>Conclusions</h4>Gongora orchids emit a diverse array of scent molecules that are largely species specific, and closely related taxa exhibit qualitatively and quantitatively divergent chemical profiles. It is shown that within a community, Gongora scent chemotypes are correlated with near non-overlapping bee pollinator assemblies. The results lend support to the hypothesis that floral scent traits regulate the architecture of bee pollinator associations. Thus, Gongora provides unique opportunities to examine the interplay between floral traits and pollinator specialization in plant-pollinator mutualisms.", "affiliation": "Biology Department, University of Toronto Mississauga, 3359 Mississauga Road North, Mississauga, ON L5L 1C6, Canada Department of Evolution and Ecology, University of California, Davis, 1 Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, USA.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "research-article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Animals"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Bees"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Orchidaceae", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "PH", "qualifierName": "physiology", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}, {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Flowers", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": [{"abbreviation": "PH", "qualifierName": "physiology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}, {"abbreviation": "CH", "qualifierName": "chemistry", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}]}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Costa Rica"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Colombia"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Pollination"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "AN", "qualifierName": "analysis", "majorTopic_YN": "Y"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Biological Evolution"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Odorants", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "AN", "qualifierName": "analysis", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Floral Scent", "Euglossa", "Euglossine Bees", "Orchid Genus Gongora", "Plant\u2013pollinator Mutualism"]}, "chemicalList": {"chemical": {"name": "Volatile Organic Compounds", "registryNumber": "0"}}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcw072"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4934395"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4934395?pdf=render"}]}, "commentCorrectionList": {"commentCorrection": {"id": "27385771", "source": "MED", "reference": "Ann Bot. 2016 Jul;118(1):89-91", "type": "Comment in", "orderIn": "1"}}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "8", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2017-08-16", "dateOfCreation": "2016-06-01", "firstIndexDate": "2016-06-01", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-10", "dateOfRevision": "2019-01-11", "electronicPublicationDate": "2016-05-30", "firstPublicationDate": "2016-05-30"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4934395", "abstract": "<h4>Unlabelled</h4>\u2022<h4>Background and aims</h4>Animal-pollinated angiosperms have evolved a variety of signalling mechanisms to attract pollinators.
