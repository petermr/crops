Apiaceae family that is widely cultivated and consumed because it contains necessary nutrients and multiple biologically active ingredients, such as apigenin and terpenoids. Here, we report the genome sequence of celery based on the use of HiSeq 2000 sequencing technology to obtain 600.8\u2009Gb of data, achieving ~189-fold genome coverage, from 68 sequencing libraries with different insert sizes ranging from 180\u2009bp to 10\u2009kb in length. The assembled genome has a total sequence length of 2.21\u2009Gb and consists of 34,277 predicted genes. Repetitive DNA sequences represent 68.88% of the genome sequences, and LTR retrotransposons are the main components of the repetitive sequences. Evolutionary analysis showed that a recent whole-genome duplication event may have occurred in celery, which could have contributed to its large genome size. The genome sequence of celery allowed us to identify agronomically important genes involved in disease resistance, flavonoid biosynthesis, terpenoid metabolism, and other important cellular processes. The comparative analysis of apigenin biosynthesis genes among species might explain the high apigenin content of celery. The whole-genome sequences of celery have been deposited at CeleryDB (http://apiaceae.njau.edu.cn/celerydb). The availability of the celery genome data advances our knowledge of the genetic evolution of celery and will contribute to further biological research and breeding in celery as well as other Apiaceae plants.", "affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Key Laboratory of Biology and Germplasm Enhancement of Horticultural Crops in East China, College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, 1 Weigang, Nanjing, 210095 China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"grantId": "CX(18)2007", "agency": "Jiangsu Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Fund", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "NCET-11-0670", "agency": "Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "31272175", "agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["DNA sequencing", "Genome evolution"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41438-019-0235-2"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6944684"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6944684?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "7", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "Y", "tmAccessionTypeList": {"accessionType": "pfam"}, "dateOfCreation": "2020-01-15", "firstIndexDate": "2020-01-17", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-07-11", "dateOfRevision": "2021-06-05", "electronicPublicationDate": "2020-01-06", "firstPublicationDate": "2020-01-06"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6944684", "abstract": "Celery (<i>Apium graveolens</i> L.) is a vegetable crop in the Apiaceae family that is widely cultivated and consumed because it contains necessary nutrients and multiple biologically active ingredients, such as apigenin and terpenoids.
