        <span class="abst" title="For a better understanding terpenoid volatile production in Camellia sinensis, global terpenoid synthase gene (TPS) transcription analysis was conducted based on transcriptomic data combined with terpenoid metabolic profiling under different abiotic stress conditions. Totally 80 TPS-like genes were identified. Twenty-three CsTPS genes possessed a complete coding sequence and most likely were functional. The remaining 57 in the currently available database lack essential gene structure or full-length transcripts. Distinct tempo-spatial expression patterns of CsTPS genes were found in tea plants. 17 genes were substantially expressed in all the tested organs with a few exceptions. The other 17 were predominantly expressed in leaves whereas additional eight were primarily expressed in flowers. Under the treatments of cold acclimation, salt and polyethylene glycol, CsTPS67, -69 and -71 were all suppressed and the inhibited expression of many others were found in multiple stress treatments. However, methyl jasmonate resulted in the enhanced expression of the majority of CsTPS genes. These transcription data were largely validated using qPCR. Moreover, volatile terpenoid profiling with leaves, flowers and stress-treated plants revealed a general association between the abundances of mono- and sesqui-terpenoids and some CsTPS genes. These results provide vital information for future studies on CsTPS regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis.">

Here we investigated the composition and biosynthesis of floral scent in 'Kaiser', a fragrant cultivar of &lt;i&gt;C. florida&lt;/i&gt; that has sterile flowers. Volatile profiling revealed that flowers of 'Kaiser' emit more than 20 compounds, with monoterpenes being most abundant. Among the three floral organs, namely sepals, transformed-petals, and ovaries, ovaries had the highest rates of total volatile emission. To determine the molecular mechanism underlying floral scent biosynthesis in 'Kaiser', we sequenced a flower transcriptome and searched the transcriptome for terpene synthase genes (&lt;i&gt;TPSs&lt;/i&gt;), which are key genes for terpene biosynthesis. Among the &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes identified, three were putative intact full-length genes and were designated &lt;i&gt;CfTPS1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CfTPS2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;CfTPS3&lt;/i&gt;. Phylogenetic analysis placed &lt;i&gt;CfTPS1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CfTPS2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;CfTPS3&lt;/i&gt; to the &lt;i&gt;TPS-g&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TPS-b&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;TPS-a&lt;/i&gt; subfamily, respectively. Through in vitro enzyme assays with &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;-expressed recombinant proteins, both &lt;i&gt;CfTPS1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CfTPS2&lt;/i&gt; were demonstrated to catalyze the conversion of geranyl diphosphate to linalool, the most abundant constituent of &lt;i&gt;C. florida&lt;/i&gt; floral scent. In addition, &lt;i&gt;CfTPS1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CfTPS2&lt;/i&gt; produced the sesquiterpene nerolidol from (&lt;i&gt;E,E&lt;/i&gt;)-farnesyl diphosphate. &lt;i&gt;CfTPS3&lt;/i&gt; showed sesquiterpene synthase activity and produced multiple products &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. All three &lt;i&gt;CfTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes showed higher levels of expression in sepals than those in transformed-petals and ovaries. Our results show that despite being sterile, the flowers of 'Kaiser' have normal mechanisms for floral scent biosynthesis that make the flowers fragrant.">

D. carota tissues produce an essential oil that is rich in volatile terpenes and plays a major role in carrot aroma and flavor. Although terpene composition represents a critical quality attribute of carrots, little is known about the biosynthesis of terpenes in this crop. Here, we functionally characterized 19 terpene synthase (TPS) genes in an orange carrot (genotype DH1) and compared tissue-specific expression profiles and in vitro products of their recombinant proteins with volatile terpene profiles from DH1 and four other colored carrot genotypes. In addition to the previously reported (E)-β-caryophyllene synthase (DcTPS01), we biochemically characterized several TPS proteins with direct correlations to major compounds of carrot flavor and aroma including germacrene D (DcTPS7/11), γ-terpinene (DcTPS30) and α-terpinolene (DcTPS03). Random forest analysis of volatiles from colored carrot cultivars identified nine terpenes that were clearly distinct among the cultivars and likely contribute to differences in sensory quality. Correlation of TPS gene expression and terpene metabolite profiles supported the function of DcTPS01 and DcTPS03 in these cultivars. Our findings provide a roadmap for future breeding efforts to enhance carrot flavor and aroma.">

        <span class="abst" title="Volatile compounds are considered to be essential for the flavor and aroma quality of grapes. Thidiazuron (TDZ) is a commonly used growth regulator in grape cultivation that stimulates larger berries and prevents fruit drop. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of TDZ on the production of aroma volatiles and to identify the key genes involved in the terpene biosynthesis pathways that are affected by this compound. Treatment with TDZ had a negative effect on the concentration of volatile compounds, especially on monoterpenes, which likely impacts the sensory characteristics of the fruit. The expression analysis of genes related to the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathways confirmed that treatment with TDZ negatively regulated the key genes &lt;i&gt;DXS1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DXS3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DXR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HDR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;VvPNGer&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;VvPNlinNer1&lt;/i&gt;. Specifically, the expression levels of the aforementioned genes were down-regulated in almost all berry development stages in the TDZ-treated samples. The novel results from the present study can be used to aid in the development of food products which maintain the flavor quality and sensory characteristics of grape. Furthermore, these findings can provide the theoretical basis that can help to optimize the utilization of TDZ for the field production of grapes at a commercial scale.">

The structural diversity of terpenes found in nature is mainly determined by terpene synthases (TPS). TPS enzymes accept ubiquitous prenyl diphosphates as substrates and convert them into the various terpene skeletons by catalyzing a carbocation-driven reaction. Based on their sequence similarity, terpene synthases from land plants can be divided into different subfamilies, TPS-a to TPS-h. In this study, we aimed to understand the evolution and functional diversification of the TPS-a subfamily in the Poaceae (the grass family), a plant family that contains important crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum. Sequence comparisons showed that aside from one clade shared with other monocot plants, the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily consists of five well-defined clades I-V, the common ancestor of which probably originated very early in the evolution of the grasses. A survey of the TPS literature and the characterization of representative TPS enzymes from clades I-III revealed clade-specific substrate and product specificities. The enzymes in both clade I and II function as sesquiterpene synthases with clade I enzymes catalyzing initial C10-C1 or C11-C1 ring closures and clade II enzymes catalyzing C6-C1 closures. The enzymes of clade III mainly act as monoterpene synthases, forming cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes. The reconstruction and characterization of clade ancestors demonstrated that the differences among clades I-III were already present in their ancestors. However, the ancestors generally catalyzed simpler reactions with less double-bond isomerization and fewer cyclization steps. Overall, our data indicate an early origin of key enzymatic features of TPS-a enzymes in the Poaceae, and the development of more complex reactions over the course of evolution.">

By integrating the &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; genome and transcriptional data, 34 &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were found in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;.

Distinct tempospatial expression profiles of &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were observed in 10 organs of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;. Most &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were predominantly expressed in flowers, followed by roots and stems. Expression of the majority of &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes was enhanced following exposure to cold and osmotic stresses. Recombinant DoTPS10 protein, located in chloroplasts, uniquely converted geranyl diphosphate to linalool in vitro. The &lt;i&gt;DoTPS10&lt;/i&gt; gene, which resulted in linalool formation, was highly expressed during all flower developmental stages. Methyl jasmonate significantly up-regulated &lt;i&gt;DoTPS10&lt;/i&gt; expression and linalool accumulation. These results simultaneously provide valuable insight into understanding the roles of the TPS family and lay a basis for further studies on the regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis by &lt;i&gt;DoTPS&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;.">

        <span class="abst" title="Terpene synthases (TPSs) and trans-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDSs) are among the core enzymes for creating the enormous diversity of terpenoids. Despite having no sequence homology, TPSs and IDSs share a conserved &quot;α terpenoid synthase fold&quot; and a trinuclear metal cluster for catalysis, implying a common ancestry with TPSs hypothesized to evolve from IDSs anciently. Here we report on the identification and functional characterization of novel IDS-like TPSs (ILTPSs) in fungi that evolved from IDS relatively recently, indicating recurrent evolution of TPSs from IDSs. Through large-scale bioinformatic analyses of fungal IDSs, putative ILTPSs that belong to the geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS) family of IDSs were identified in three species of Melampsora. Among the GGDPS family of the two Melampsora species experimentally characterized, one enzyme was verified to be bona fide GGDPS and all others were demonstrated to function as TPSs. Melampsora ILTPSs displayed kinetic parameters similar to those of classic TPSs. Key residues underlying the determination of GGDPS versus ILTPS activity and functional divergence of ILTPSs were identified. Phylogenetic analysis implies a recent origination of these ILTPSs from a GGDPS progenitor in fungi, after the split of Melampsora from other genera within the class of Pucciniomycetes. For the poplar leaf rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina, the transcripts of its ILTPS genes were detected in infected poplar leaves, suggesting possible involvement of these recently evolved ILTPS genes in the infection process. This study reveals the recurrent evolution of TPSs from IDSs since their ancient occurrence and points to the possibility of a wide distribution of ILTPS genes in three domains of life.">

        <span class="abst" title="Spearmint produces and stores large amounts of monoterpenes, mainly limonene and carvone, in glandular trichomes and is the major natural source of these compounds. Towards producing heterologous monoterpenes in spearmint, we first reduced the flux into the native limonene pathway by knocking down the expression of limonene synthase (&lt;i&gt;MsLS&lt;/i&gt;) by RNAi method. The &lt;i&gt;MsLS&lt;/i&gt; RNAi lines exhibited a huge reduction in the synthesis of limonene and carvone. Detailed GC-MS and LC-MS analysis revealed that &lt;i&gt;MsLS&lt;/i&gt; RNAi plants also showed an increase in sesquiterpene, phytosterols, fatty acids, flavonoids, and phenolic metabolites, suggesting an interaction between the MEP, MVA shikimate and fatty acid pathways in spearmint. Three different heterologous monoterpene synthases namely, linalool synthase and myrcene synthase from &lt;i&gt;Picea abies&lt;/i&gt; and geraniol synthase from &lt;i&gt;Cananga odorata&lt;/i&gt; were cloned and introduced independently into the &lt;i&gt;MsLS&lt;/i&gt; RNAi mutant background. The expression of these heterologous terpene synthases resulted mainly in production of monoterpene derivatives. Of all the introduced monoterpenes geraniol showed the maximum number of derivatives. Our results provide new insights into MEP pathway interactions and regulation and reveals the existence of mechanisms for complex metabolism of monoterpenes in spearmint.">

The monophagous beetle Agasicles hygrophila uses a volatile (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonanetriene (DMNT) to recognize its host plant Alternanthera philoxeroides. Alternanthera philoxeroides releases DMNT in response to A. hygrophila attack and nerolidol synthase (NES) is a key enzyme in DMNT biosynthesis; however, the effect of A. hygrophila on NES expression remains unclear. In this study, the A. philoxeroides transcriptome was sequenced and six putative NES genes belonging to the terpene synthase-g family were characterized. The expression of these NES genes was assayed at different times following A. hygrophila contact, feeding or mechanical wounding. Results showed that A. hygrophila contact and feeding induced NES expression more rapidly and more intensely than mechanical wounding alone. This may account for a large release of DMNT following A. hygrophila feeding in a previous study and subsequently facilitate A. hygrophila to find host plants. Our research provides a powerful genetic platform for studying invasive plants and lays the foundation for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between A. philoxeroides and its specialist A. hygrophila.">

In this study, three potential geraniol synthases were mined from the &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; genome. DoGES1, which was localized in chloroplasts, was characterized as a geraniol synthase. &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in flowers, especially in petals. &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; transcript levels were high in the budding stage of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; flowers at 11:00 a.m. DoGES1 catalyzed geraniol in vitro, and transient expression of &lt;i&gt;DoGES1&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; leaves resulted in the accumulation of geraniol in vivo. These findings on DoGES1 advance our understanding of geraniol biosynthesis in orchids, and lay the basis for genetic modification of floral scent in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; or in other ornamental orchids.">

Consequently, a myriad of mechanisms has evolved to engage organisms in different types of interactions.

The emission of VTs provides a way for plants to communicate with the environment, including neighboring plants, beneficiaries (e.g., pollinators, seed dispersers), predators, parasitoids, and herbivores, by sending enticing or deterring signals. Understanding terpenoid distribution, biogenesis, and function provides an opportunity for the design and implementation of effective and efficient environmental calamity and pest management strategies.

Here we analyzed the extracts of Stevia leaves, flowers, stems, and roots by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and putatively identified a total of 69 volatile organic compounds, most of which were terpenoids with considerably varied quantities among the four tissues of Stevia. Using Stevia transcriptomes, we identified and functionally characterized five terpene synthases (TPSs) that produced major mono- and sesquiterpenoids in Stevia. Transcript levels of these Stevia &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt;s and levels of corresponding terpenoids correlated well in Stevia tissues. Particularly, the root-specific SrTPS4 and SrTPS5 catalyzed the formation of γ-curcumene/zingiberene/β-sesquiphellandrene and α-longipinene/β-himachalene/himachalol as multifunctional sesqui-TPSs, respectively. Most of the &lt;i&gt;SrTPSs&lt;/i&gt; were highly responsive to various environmental stresses in a tissue-specific manner.

The relative scent intensity of &quot;Shiny Gold&quot; was approximately 16% higher in full-bloomed flower when compared to the yellow bud stage, while tissue-specifically, tepals showed higher intensity in electronic-nose (e-nose) analysis. E-nose analysis also showed that the scent intensity of &quot;Shiny Gold&quot; was higher and lower than &quot;10C3-424&quot; and &quot;10C3-894&quot;, respectively, and was similar to &quot;Yvonne&quot;. These results correlated to those of the olfactory tests. In total, 19 volatile compounds, including linalool, β-ocimene, D-limonene, trans-β-ionone were detected in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Among these, linalool was the major volatile compound, accounting for 38.7% in &quot;Shiny Gold&quot;. Linalool synthase and &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; gene expression corresponded to the scent intensity of the four cultivars, with the lowest expression in the &quot;10C3-424&quot;. &lt;i&gt;TPS 2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TPS 3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TPS 5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TPS 6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TPS 8&lt;/i&gt; were highly expressed in both bud and flower in &quot;Shiny Gold&quot;, while the expression of &lt;i&gt;TPS 4&lt;/i&gt; was lower, relative to other &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes in both the flowering stages.

The present study investigates a carrot terpene synthase gene cluster on chromosome 4 associated with volatile monoterpene production. Two carrot mutants, yellow and cola, which are contrasting in the content of low molecular weight terpenes, were crossed to develop an F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mapping population. The mapping analysis revealed overlapping QTLs on chromosome 4 for sabinene, α-thujene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, terpinen-4-ol and 4-carene. The genomic region of this locus includes a cluster of five terpene synthase genes (DcTPS04, DcTPS26, DcTPS27, DcTPS54 and DcTPS55). DcTPS04 and DcTPS54 displayed genotype- and tissue-specific variation in gene expression. Based on the QTL mapping results and the gene expression patterns, DcTPS04 and DcTPS54 were selected for functional characterization. In vitro enzyme assays showed that DcTPS54 is a single-product enzyme catalysing the formation of sabinene, whereas DcTPS04 is a multiple-product terpene synthase producing α-terpineol as a major product and four additional products including sabinene, β-limonene, β-pinene and myrcene. Furthermore, we developed a functional molecular marker that could discriminate carrot genotypes with different sabinene content in a set of 85 accessions.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Tansy plants (Tanacetum vulgare L.) are known for their high intraspecific chemical variation, especially of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from the terpenoid compound group. These VOCs are closely involved in plant-insect interactions and, when profiled, can be used to classify plants into groups known as chemotypes. Tansy chemotypes have been shown to influence plant-aphid interactions, however, to date no information is available on the response of different tansy chemotypes to simultaneous herbivory by more than one insect species.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Using a multi-cuvette system, we investigated the responses of five tansy chemotypes to feeding by sucking and/or chewing herbivores (aphids and caterpillars; Metopeurum fuscoviride Stroyan and Spodoptera littoralis Boisduval). Herbivory by caterpillars following aphid infestation led to a plant chemotype-specific change in the patterns of terpenoids stored in trichome hairs and in VOC emissions. The transcriptomic analysis of a plant chemotype represents the first de novo assembly of a transcriptome in tansy and demonstrates priming effects of aphids on a subsequent herbivory. Overall, we show that the five chemotypes do not react in the same way to the two herbivores. As expected, we found that caterpillar feeding increased VOC emissions, however, a priori aphid infestation only led to a further increase in VOC emissions for some chemotypes.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;We were able to show that different chemotypes respond to the double herbivore attack in different ways, and that pre-treatment with aphids had a priming effect on plants when they were subsequently exposed to a chewing herbivore. If neighbouring chemotypes in a field population react differently to herbivory/dual herbivory, this could possibly have effects from the individual level to the group level. Individuals of some chemotypes may respond more efficiently to herbivory stress than others, and in a group environment these &quot;louder&quot; chemotypes may affect the local insect community, including the natural enemies of herbivores, and other neighbouring plants.">

Floral VOCs are often involved in defense and pollinator attraction. These interactions often change rapidly over time, so a quick response to those changes is required. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, which regulate both genes and transcription factors, might trigger adaptive responses to these evolutionary pressures as well as regulating the rhythmic emission of VOCs through circadian clock regulation. In addition, transgenerational epigenetic effects and whole genome polyploidy could modify the generation of VOCs' profiles of offspring, contributing to long-term evolutionary shifts. In this article, we review the available knowledge about the mechanisms that may act as epigenetic regulators of the main VOC biosynthetic pathways, and their importance in plant evolution.">

        <span class="abst" title="Passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims) is an economically valuable fruit that is cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Here, we report an ~1341.7 Mb chromosome-scale genome assembly of passion fruit, with 98.91% (~1327.18 Mb) of the assembly assigned to nine pseudochromosomes. The genome includes 23,171 protein-coding genes, and most of the assembled sequences are repetitive sequences, with long-terminal repeats (LTRs) being the most abundant. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that passion fruit diverged after Brassicaceae and before Euphorbiaceae. Ks analysis showed that two whole-genome duplication events occurred in passion fruit at 65 MYA and 12 MYA, which may have contributed to its large genome size. An integrated analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data showed that 'alpha-linolenic acid metabolism', 'metabolic pathways', and 'secondary metabolic pathways' were the main pathways involved in the synthesis of important volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in passion fruit, and this analysis identified some candidate genes, including GDP-fucose Transporter 1-like, Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 33, protein NETWORKED 4B isoform X1, and Golgin Subfamily A member 6-like protein 22. In addition, we identified 13 important gene families in fatty acid pathways and eight important gene families in terpene pathways. Gene family analysis showed that the ACX, ADH, ALDH, and HPL gene families, especially ACX13/14/15/20, ADH13/26/33, ALDH1/4/21, and HPL4/6, were the key genes for ester synthesis, while the TPS gene family, especially PeTPS2/3/4/24, was the key gene family for terpene synthesis. This work provides insights into genome evolution and flavor trait biology and offers valuable resources for the improved cultivation of passion fruit.">

The terpene (E)-β-ocimene is a common component of floral scent and is also used by the butterfly Heliconius melpomene as an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone. While the biosynthesis of terpenes has been described in plants and microorganisms, few terpene synthases (TPSs) have been identified in insects. Here, we study the recent divergence of 2 species, H. melpomene and Heliconius cydno, which differ in the presence of (E)-β-ocimene; combining linkage mapping, gene expression, and functional analyses, we identify 2 novel TPSs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one, HmelOS, is able to synthesise (E)-β-ocimene in vitro. We find no evidence for TPS activity in HcydOS (HmelOS ortholog of H. cydno), suggesting that the loss of (E)-β-ocimene in this species is the result of coding, not regulatory, differences. The TPS enzymes we discovered are unrelated to previously described plant and insect TPSs, demonstrating that chemical convergence has independent evolutionary origins.">

The goal of this study was to investigate the biochemical functions of SmMTPSLs. Here, eight full-length &lt;i&gt;SmMTPSL&lt;/i&gt; genes (&lt;i&gt;SmMTPSL5, -15, -19, -23, -33, -37, -46,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;-47)&lt;/i&gt; were functionally characterized from &lt;i&gt;S. moellendorffii&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli-&lt;/i&gt;expressed recombinant SmMTPSLs were tested for monoterpenes synthase and sesquiterpenes synthase activities. These enzymatic products were typical monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that have been previous shown to be generated by typical plant TPSs when provided with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrates. Meanwhile, &lt;i&gt;SmMTPSL23&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;-33&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;-37&lt;/i&gt; were up-regulated when induced by alamethicin (ALA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), suggesting a role for these genes in plants response to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, this study pointed out that the terpenoids products of SmMTPSL23, -33, and -37 have an antibacterial effect on &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt; pv. &lt;i&gt;tomato&lt;/i&gt; DC3000 and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;.

However, differences in aroma components and relevant biosynthesis genes have not been systematically investigated in green and red prickly ash. Here, through the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), differentially abundant metabolites, and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways, we characterize the different aroma components of green and red prickly ash fruits and identify key genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify 41 terpenoids from green prickly ash and 61 terpenoids from red prickly ash. Piperitone was the most abundant terpenoid in green prickly ash fruit, whereas limonene was most abundant in red prickly ash. Intergroup correlation analysis and redundancy analysis showed that &lt;i&gt;HDS2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MVK2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;MVD&lt;/i&gt; are key genes for terpenoid synthesis in green prickly ash, whereas &lt;i&gt;FDPS2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FDPS3&lt;/i&gt; play an important role in the terpenoid synthesis of red prickly ash. In summary, differences in the composition and content of terpenoids are the main factors that cause differences in the aromas of green and red prickly ash, and these differences reflect contrasting expression patterns of terpenoid synthesis genes.">

To better understand the genetic basis of the terpenoid diversity in lavender, we present a high-quality reference genome for the Chinese lavender cultivar &quot;Jingxun 2&quot; using PacBio and Hi-C technologies to anchor the 894.50 Mb genome assembly into 27 pseudochromosomes. In addition to the γ triplication event, lavender underwent two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) during the Eocene-Oligocene (29.6 MYA) and Miocene-Pliocene (6.9 MYA) transitions. As a result of tandem duplications and lineage-specific WGDs, gene families related to terpenoid biosynthesis in lavender are substantially expanded compared to those of five other species in Lamiaceae. Many terpenoid biosynthesis transcripts are abundant in glandular trichomes. We further integrated the contents of ecologically functional terpenoids and coexpressed terpenoid biosynthetic genes to construct terpenoid-gene networks. Typical gene clusters, including TPS-TPS, TPS-CYP450, and TPS-BAHD, linked with compounds that primarily function as attractants or repellents, were identified by their similar patterns of change during flower development or in response to methyl jasmonate. Comprehensive analysis of the genetic basis of the production of volatiles in lavender could serve as a foundation for future research into lavender evolution, phytochemistry, and ecology.">

Tomato plants have evolved broad defense mechanisms regulated by the expression of defense genes, phytohormones, and secondary metabolites present constitutively and/or induced upon infestation. Although tomato defense mechanisms have been studied for more than three decades, only a few studies have compared domesticated cultivars' natural mite resistance at the molecular level. The main goal of our research was to reveal the molecular differences between two tomato cultivars with similar physical (trichome morphology and density) and agronomic traits (fruit size, shape, color, cluster architecture), but with contrasting TSSM susceptibility. A net house experiment indicated a mite-resistance difference between the cultivars, and a climate-controlled performance and oviposition bioassay supported these findings. A transcriptome analysis of the two cultivars after 3 days of TSSM infestation, revealed changes in the genes associated with primary and secondary metabolism, including salicylic acid and volatile biosynthesis (volatile benzenoid ester and monoterpenes). The &lt;i&gt;Terpene synthase&lt;/i&gt; genes, &lt;i&gt;TPS5, TPS7&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;TPS19/20&lt;/i&gt;, encoding enzymes that synthesize the monoterpenes linalool, β-myrcene, limonene, and β-phellandrene were highly expressed in the resistant cultivar. The volatile profile of these cultivars upon mite infestation for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days, revealed substantial differences in monoterpenoid and phenylpropanoid volatiles, results consistent with the transcriptomic data. Comparing the metabolic changes that occurred in each cultivar and upon mite-infestation indicated that monoterpenes are the main metabolites that differ between cultivars (constitutive levels), while only minor changes occurred upon TSSM attack. To test the effect of these volatile variations on mites, we subjected both the TSSM and its corresponding predator, &lt;i&gt;Phytoseiulus persimilis&lt;/i&gt;, to an olfactory choice bioassay. The predator mites were only significantly attracted to the TSSM pre-infested resistant cultivar and not to the susceptible cultivar, while the TSSM itself showed no preference. Overall, our findings revealed the contribution of constitutive and inducible levels of volatiles on mite performance. This study highlights monoterpenoids' function in plant resistance to pests and may inform the development of new resistant tomato cultivars.">

Corn leaf aphid [CLA; Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch)] is an economically important pest of maize and several other monocot crops. In addition to feeding damage, CLA acts as a vector for viruses that cause devastating diseases in maize. We have shown previously that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical plant breeding, provides heightened resistance to CLA. However, the transcriptomic variation conferring CLA resistance to Mp708 has not been investigated.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, we contrasted the defense responses of the resistant Mp708 genotype to those of the susceptible Tx601 genotype at the transcriptomic (mRNA-seq) and volatile blend levels. Our results suggest that there was a greater transcriptomic remodeling in Mp708 plants in response to CLA infestation compared to the Tx601 plants. These transcriptomic signatures indicated an activation of hormonal pathways, and regulation of sesquiterpenes and terpenoid synthases in a constitutive and inducible manner. Transcriptomic analysis also revealed that the resistant Mp708 genotype possessed distinct regulation of ethylene and jasmonic acid pathways before and after aphid infestation. Finally, our results also highlight the significance of constitutive production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Mp708 and Tx601 plants that may contribute to maize direct and/or indirect defense responses.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This study provided further insights to understand the role of defense signaling networks in Mp708's resistance to CLA.">

These abiotic factors govern the synthesis and degradation of primary (sugars, amino acids, organic acids, etc.) and secondary (phenolic and volatile flavor compounds and their precursors) metabolites directly, via the regulation of their biosynthetic pathways, or indirectly, via their effects on vine physiology and phenology. Several hundred secondary metabolites have been identified in the grape berry. Their biosynthesis and degradation have been characterized and have been shown to occur during different developmental stages of the berry. The understanding of how the different abiotic factors modulate secondary metabolism and thus berry quality is of crucial importance for breeders and growers to develop plant material and viticultural practices to maintain high-quality fruit and wine production in the context of global warming. Here, we review the main secondary metabolites of the grape berry, their biosynthesis, and how their accumulation and degradation is influenced by abiotic factors. The first part of the review provides an update on structure, biosynthesis, and degradation of phenolic compounds (flavonoids and non-flavonoids) and major aroma compounds (terpenes, thiols, methoxypyrazines, and C13 norisoprenoids). The second part gives an update on the influence of abiotic factors, such as water availability, temperature, radiation, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, on berry secondary metabolism. At the end of the paper, we raise some critical questions regarding intracluster berry heterogeneity and dilution effects and how the sampling strategy can impact the outcome of studies on the grapevine berry response to abiotic factors.">

Species of the monocotyledonous family Arecaceae (palms) are among the highest plant emitters, but to date no &lt;i&gt;IspS&lt;/i&gt; gene from this family has been identified. Here, we screened with PTR-ToF-MS 18 genera of the Arecaceae for isoprene emission and found that the majority of the sampled species emits isoprene. Putative &lt;i&gt;IspS&lt;/i&gt; genes from six different genera were sequenced and three of them were functionally characterized by heterologous overexpression in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, demonstrating that they encode functional IspS genes. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Arabidopsis demonstrated the functional relevance of a novel IspS diagnostic tetrad from Arecaceae, whose most variable amino acids could not preserve catalytic function when substituted by a putatively dicotyledonous-specific tetrad. In particular, mutation of threonine 479 likely impairs the open-closed transition of the enzyme by altering the network of hydrogen bonds between helices H1α, H, and I. These results shed new light on the evolution of IspS in monocots, suggesting that isoprene emission is an ancestral trait within the Arecaceae family. The identification of IspS from Arecaceae provides promising novel enzymes for the production of isoprene in heterologous systems and allows the screening and selection of commercially relevant palm varieties with lower environmental impact.">

However, there is a lack of systematic identification and study of TPS in &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; plants. In this work, we genome-widely identified and analyzed the &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; gene family in &lt;i&gt;Mentha longifolia&lt;/i&gt;, a model plant for functional genomic research in the genus &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 63 &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified in the &lt;i&gt;M. longifolia&lt;/i&gt; genome sequence assembly, which could be divided into six subfamilies. The &lt;i&gt;TPS-b&lt;/i&gt; subfamily had the largest number of genes, which might be related to the abundant monoterpenoids in &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; plants. The &lt;i&gt;TPS-e&lt;/i&gt; subfamily had 18 members and showed a significant species-specific expansion compared with other sequenced Lamiaceae plant species. The 63 &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes could be mapped to nine scaffolds of the &lt;i&gt;M. longifolia&lt;/i&gt; genome sequence assembly and the distribution of these genes is uneven. Tandem duplicates and fragment duplicates contributed greatly to the increase in the number of &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt; genes in &lt;i&gt;M. longifolia&lt;/i&gt;. The conserved motifs (RR(X)8W, NSE/DTE, RXR, and DDXXD) were analyzed in &lt;i&gt;M. longifolia&lt;/i&gt; TPSs, and significant differentiation was found between different subfamilies. Adaptive evolution analysis showed that &lt;i&gt;M. longifolia TPSs&lt;/i&gt; were subjected to purifying selection after the species-specific expansion, and some amino acid residues under positive selection were identified. Furthermore, we also cloned and analyzed the catalytic activity of a single terpene synthase, &lt;i&gt;MlongTPS29&lt;/i&gt;, which belongs to the &lt;i&gt;TPS-b&lt;/i&gt; subfamily. &lt;i&gt;MlongTPS29&lt;/i&gt; could encode a limonene synthase and catalyze the biosynthesis of limonene, an important precursor of essential oils from the genus &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt;. This study provides useful information for the biosynthesis of terpenoids in the genus &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt;.">

Although several chromosome-level tea plant genomes have been published, they collapsed the two haplotypes and ignored a large number of allelic variations that may underlie important biological functions in this species. Here, we present a phased chromosome-scale assembly for an elite oolong tea cultivar, &quot;Huangdan&quot;, that is well known for its high levels of aroma. Based on the two sets of haplotype genome data, we identified numerous genetic variations and a substantial proportion of allelic imbalance related to important traits, including aroma- and stress-related alleles. Comparative genomics revealed extensive structural variations as well as expansion of some gene families, such as terpene synthases (TPSs), that likely contribute to the high-aroma characteristics of the backbone parent, underlying the molecular basis for the biosynthesis of aroma-related chemicals in oolong tea. Our results uncovered the genetic basis of special features of this oolong tea cultivar, providing fundamental genomic resources to study evolution and domestication for the economically important tea crop.">

The whole-organism reconfiguration of aroma formation from the precursor to storage is poorly understood. In this study, we performed iTRAQ proteomic analysis and identified 337, 246, and 413 differentially expressed proteins in tea leaves primed with MeJA for 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h, respectively. Furthermore, a total of 266 nonvolatile and 100 volatile differential metabolites were identified by utilizing MS-based metabolomics. A novel approach that incorporated the integration of extended self-organizing map-based dimensionality was applied. The vivid time-scale changes tracing physiological responses in MeJA-primed tea leaves are marked in these maps. Jasmonates responded quickly to the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway in tea leaves, while hydroxyl and glycosyl jasmonates were biosynthesized simultaneously on a massive scale to compensate for the exhausted defense. The levels of α-linolenic acid, geranyl diphosphate, farnesyl diphosphate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and phenylalanine, which are crucial aroma precursors, were found to be significantly changed in MeJA-primed tea leaves. Green leaf volatiles, volatile terpenoids, and volatile phenylpropanoids/benzenoids were spontaneously biosynthesized from responding precursors and subsequently converted to their corresponding glycosidic forms, which can be stably stored in tea leaves. This study elucidated the physiological response of tea leaves primed with exogenous methyl jasmonate and revealed the molecular basis of source and sink changes on tea aroma biosynthesis and catabolism in response to exogenous stimuli. The results significantly enhance our comprehensive understanding of tea plant responses to exogenous treatment and will lead to the development of promising biotechnologies to improve fresh tea leaf quality.">

Its flowers could be used as health care tea for its aroma flavor and medicinal value. Most recent studies demonstrated that terpenoids are the main components of the aromatic compounds in the flowers, but the biosynthesis of terpenoids is poorly understood in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;. In the experiment, the flowers from two cultivars of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; with different smells were collected. The transcriptome analysis and combined volatile terpenoids determination were performed to identify the genes related to the biosynthesis of the terpenoids. The results showed that the different products of volatile terpenoids are α-thujene, linalool, α-terpineol, α-phellandrene, γ-muurolene, α-patchoulene, and δ-elemene in two cultivar flowers. The transcriptome analysis detected 25,484 genes in the flowers. And 18,650 differentially expressed genes were identified between the two cultivars. Of these genes, 253 genes were mapped to the terpenoid metabolism pathway. Among these genes, 13 terpene synthase (TPS) genes may have correlations with AP2/ERF, WRKY, MYB, bHLH, and bZIP transcription factors by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The transcription factors have regulatory effects on TPS genes. These results may provide ideas for the terpenoid biosynthesis and regulatory network of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; flowers.">

Corymbia is grown for timber, pulp and paper, and essential oils in Australia, South Africa, Asia, and Brazil, maintaining a high-growth rate under marginal conditions due to drought, poor-quality soil, and biotic stresses. To dissect the genetic basis of these desirable traits, we sequenced and assembled the 408 Mb genome of Corymbia citriodora, anchored into eleven chromosomes. Comparative analysis with Eucalyptus grandis reveals high synteny, although the two diverged approximately 60 million years ago and have different genome sizes (408 vs 641 Mb), with few large intra-chromosomal rearrangements. C. citriodora shares an ancient whole-genome duplication event with E. grandis but has undergone tandem gene family expansions related to terpene biosynthesis, innate pathogen resistance, and leaf wax formation, enabling their successful adaptation to biotic/abiotic stresses and arid conditions of the Australian continent.">

'Ruixue' apples were selected from a cross between 'Pink Lady' and 'Fuji', a later ripening yellow new cultivar. However, there is little known about the content and composition of aroma compounds in 'Ruixue' apples or the genetic characters of 'Ruixue' and its parents. In addition, the metabolic pathways for biosynthesis of aroma volatiles and aroma-related genes remain poorly understood.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Volatile aroma compounds were putatively identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our results show that the profile of volatile compounds changes with ripening. Aldehydes were the dominant volatile compounds in early fruit development, with alcohols and esters increasing dramatically during maturation. On the basis of a heatmap dendrogram, these aroma compounds clustered into seven groups. In ripe fruit, esters and terpenoids were the main aroma volatiles in ripening fruit of 'Pink Lady' and 'Fuji' apples, and they included butyl 2-methylbutanoate; propanoic acid, hexyl ester; propanoic acid, hexyl ester; hexanoic acid, hexyl ester; acetic acid, hexyl ester and (Z, E)-α-farnesene. Interestingly, aldehydes and terpenoids were the dominant volatile aroma compounds in ripening fruit of 'Ruixue', and they mainly included hexanal; 2-hexenal; octanal; (E)-2-octenal; nonanal and (Z, E)-α-farnesene. By comparing the transcriptome profiles of 'Ruixue' and its parents fruits during development, we identified a large number of aroma-related genes related to the fatty acid, isoleucine and sesquiterpenoid metabolism pathways and transcription factors that may volatile regulate biosynthesis.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our initial study facilitates a better understanding of the volatile compounds that affect fruit flavour as well as the mechanisms underlying differences in flavour between 'Ruixue' and its parents.">

Under low-light treatment, significant reductions in peltate glandular trichome densities were observed. GC-MS analysis showed dramatically reduced essential oil and menthol contents. Light affected the peltate glandular trichomes' development and essential oil yield production. However, the underlying mechanisms of this regulation were elusive. To identify the critical genes during light-regulated changes in oil content, following a 24 h darkness treatment and a 24 h recovery light treatment, leaves were collected for transcriptome analysis. A total of 95,579 unigenes were obtained, with an average length of 754 bp. About 56.58% of the unigenes were annotated using four public protein databases: 10,977 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be involved in the light signaling pathway and monoterpene synthesis pathway. Most of the TPs showed a similar expression pattern: downregulation after darkness treatment and upregulation after the return of light. In addition, the genes involved in the light signal transduction pathway were analyzed. A series of responsive transcription factors (TFs) were identified and could be used in metabolic engineering as an effective strategy for increasing essential oil yields.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Anthurium&lt;/i&gt; is an important ornamental crop in the world market and its floral scent can enhance its ornamental value. To date, studies of the components and formation mechanism of the floral scent of &lt;i&gt;Anthurium&lt;/i&gt; are relatively few. In this study, the scent profiles of two &lt;i&gt;Anthurium&lt;/i&gt; varieties were measured by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). There were 32 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified in &lt;i&gt;Anthurium&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;i&gt;Mystral'&lt;/i&gt;, and the most abundant compound was eucalyptol (57.5%). Extremely small amounts of VOCs were detected in &lt;i&gt;Anthurium&lt;/i&gt; 'Alabama'. Compared with &lt;i&gt;A.&lt;/i&gt; 'Alabama', most genes related to floral scent synthesis exhibited a higher expression in &lt;i&gt;A.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Mystral'&lt;/i&gt;, including &lt;i&gt;AaDXS, AaDXR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AaMDS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AaHDS, AaTPS, AaDAHPS,&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;AaADT2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AaPAL1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;AaPAL2.&lt;/i&gt; In order to produce new varieties of &lt;i&gt;Anthurium&lt;/i&gt; with fragrance, 454 progenies of two crossbred combinations of &lt;i&gt;A.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;'&lt;i&gt;Mystral&lt;/i&gt;' and &lt;i&gt;A.&lt;/i&gt; 'Alabama' were obtained. Four F1 generation plants with different floral scent intensities were selected for further study. The major components of floral scent in the progenies were similar to that of the parental &lt;i&gt;A.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Mystral'&lt;/i&gt; plant. The expression patterns of genes related to floral scent synthesis were consistent with the relative contents of different types of VOCs. This study revealed the profiles of volatile compounds and associated gene expression in two &lt;i&gt;Anthurium&lt;/i&gt; cultivars and their F1 hybrids, which provided a basis for the floral scent inheritance of &lt;i&gt;Anthurium andraeanum&lt;/i&gt;.">

This has been the driving force for embracing sustainable agriculture. Plant secondary metabolites offer promising alternatives for protecting plants against microbes, feeding herbivores, and weeds. Terpenes are the largest among PSMs and have been extensively studied for their potential as antimicrobial, insecticidal, and weed control agents. They also attract natural enemies of pests and beneficial insects, such as pollinators and dispersers. However, most of these research findings are shelved and fail to pass beyond the laboratory and greenhouse stages. This review provides an overview of terpenes, types, biosynthesis, and their roles in protecting plants against microbial pathogens, insect pests, and weeds to rekindle the debate on using terpenes for the development of environmentally friendly biopesticides and herbicides.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Plants have evolved physical-chemical defense to prevent/diminish damage by their enemies. Chemical defense involves the synthesis' pathways of specialized toxic, repellent, or anti-nutritive metabolites to herbivores. Molecular evolutionary studies have revealed the origin of new genes, acquisition and functional diversification along time in different plant lineages.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Using bioinformatic tools we analyze gene divergence of tropane alkaloids (TAs) and terpene synthases (TPSs) in &lt;i&gt;Datura stramonium&lt;/i&gt; and other species of Solanaceae; compared gene and amino acids sequence of TAs and TPSs on genomes, cDNA and proteins sequences of Viridiplantae. We analyzed two recently assembled genomes of &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; (Ticumán and Teotihuacán), transcriptomes of &lt;i&gt;Datura metel&lt;/i&gt; and genomes of other Solanaceae. Hence, we analyzed variation of TAs and TPSs to infer genes involved in plant defense and plant responses before stress. We analyzed protein modeling and molecular docking to predict interactions between H6H and ligand; we translated the sequences (Teo19488, Tic8550 and Tic8549) obtained from the two genomes of &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; by using Swiss-Model and Ramachandran plot and MolProbity structure validation of Teo19488 protein model.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;For TAs, we detected an expansion event in the tropinone reductase II (TRII) and the ratio synonymous/non-synonymous substitutions indicate positive selection. In contrast, a contraction event and negative selection was detected in tropinone reductase I (TRI). In Hy-oscyamine 6 b-hydroxylase (H6H), enzyme involved in the production of tropane alkaloids atropine and scopolamine, the synonymous/non-synonymous substitution ratio in its dominion indicates positive selection. For terpenes (TPS), we found 18 DsTPS in &lt;i&gt;D. stramomiun&lt;/i&gt; and seven in &lt;i&gt;D. metel&lt;/i&gt;; evolutionary analyses detected positive selection in TPS10.1 and TPS10.2 of &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D. metel&lt;/i&gt;. Comparison of copies of TPSs in &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; detected variation among them in the binding site. Duplication events and differentiation of TAs and TPSs of &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt;, as compared to other Solanaceae, suggest their possible involvement on adaptive evolution of defense to herbivores. Protein modeling and docking show that the three protein structures obtained of DsH6H from Teo19488, Tic-8550 and Tic8549 maintain the same interactions and the union site of 2OG-FeII_Oxy with the Hy-o ligand as in 6TTM of &lt;i&gt;D. metel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our results indicate differences in the number of gene copies involved in the synthesis of tropane alkaloids, between the genomes of &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; from two Mexican populations. More copies of genes related to the synthesis of tropane alkaloids (TRI, TRII, H6H, PMT) are found in &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; as compared to Viridiplantae. Likewise, for terpene synthases (TPS), TPS-10 is duplicated in &lt;i&gt;D. stramonium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D. metel&lt;/i&gt;. Further studies should be directed to experimentally assess gain (overexpression) or loss (silencing) of function of duplicated genes.">

In contrast, the gene was not functional in the BPH-susceptible rice variety KDML105 (KD). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region and in exon 5 of the gene and a seven amino acid deletion in the deduced protein sequence are suggested as factors that negatively regulate the function of the gene. Sequence analysis of the promoter region and expression analysis of the &lt;i&gt;OsSTPS2&lt;/i&gt; gene in several rice genotypes revealed the correlation of SNPs of the ATHB-1, SBE1, and P-factor with the expression of the gene. Genomic and complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence analysis at exon 5 of the gene showed that the 21 bp deletion naturally occurred in several rice genotypes. The antixenosis of the BPH feeding preference (AFP) of rice varieties differed in the seven amino acid deletion lesion of the gene, suggesting that the seven amino acid deletion negatively controls the antixenosis mechanism during BPH infestation. Analysis of the plant volatile compounds released after BPH infestation suggested that E-β-farnesene (EBF) is the major product of the &lt;i&gt;OsSTPS2&lt;/i&gt; gene.">

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenoids are a large and diverse class of plant metabolites that also includes volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes which are involved in biotic interactions of plants. Due to the limited natural availability of these terpenes and the tight regulation of their biosynthesis, there is strong interest to introduce or enhance their production in crop plants by metabolic engineering for agricultural, pharmaceutical and industrial applications. While engineering of monoterpenes has been quite successful, expression of sesquiterpene synthases in engineered plants frequently resulted in production of only minor amounts of sesquiterpenes. To identify bottlenecks for sesquiterpene engineering in plants, we have used two nearly identical terpene synthases, snapdragon (&lt;i&gt;Antirrhinum majus&lt;/i&gt;) nerolidol/linalool synthase-1 and -2 (AmNES/LIS-1/-2), that are localized in the cytosol and plastids, respectively. Since these two bifunctional terpene synthases have very similar catalytic properties with geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), their expression in target tissues allows indirect determination of the availability of these substrates in both subcellular compartments. Both terpene synthases were expressed under control of the ripening specific &lt;i&gt;PG&lt;/i&gt; promoter in tomato fruits, which are characterized by a highly active terpenoid metabolism providing precursors for carotenoid biosynthesis. As &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-2&lt;/i&gt; fruits produced the monoterpene linalool, &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-1&lt;/i&gt; fruits were found to exclusively produce the sesquiterpene nerolidol. While nerolidol emission in &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-1&lt;/i&gt; fruits was 60- to 584-fold lower compared to linalool emission in &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-2&lt;/i&gt; fruits, accumulation of nerolidol-glucosides in &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-1&lt;/i&gt; fruits was 4- to 14-fold lower than that of linalool-glucosides in &lt;i&gt;AmNES/LIS-2&lt;/i&gt; fruits. These results suggest that only a relatively small pool of FPP is available for sesquiterpene formation in the cytosol. To potentially overcome limitations in sesquiterpene production, we transiently co-expressed the key pathway-enzymes hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), as well as the regulator isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK). While HMGR and IPK expression increased metabolic flux toward nerolidol formation 5.7- and 2.9-fold, respectively, DXS expression only resulted in a 2.5-fold increase.">

Nevertheless, the possible gene-regulatory roles of transcription factors (TFs) in &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt;'s monoterpenoid biosynthesis remained unknown. Here, a joint analysis of the transcriptome and terpenoid metabolome of &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt; induced by mechanical damage (MD) was used to comprehensively explore the interaction between TFs and terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes that might participate in monoterpene biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis detected 14 monoterpenes and seven sesquiterpenes. All but two monoterpenes underwent a significantly increased accumulation after the MD treatment. RNA sequencing data revealed that 10 TPS, 82 MYB, 70 AP2/ERF, 38 BHLH, 31 WRKY, and 29 bZIP unigenes responded to the MD treatment. A correlation analysis revealed that three monoterpene synthase genes (CcTPS1, CcTPS3, CcTPS4) highly correlated with multiple monoterpenes, namely D-borneol, camphor, and bornyl acetate, which could be responsible for monoterpenoid biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, five WRKY, 15 MYB, 10 ERF/AP2, five bZIP, and two BHLH genes had strong, positive correlations with &lt;i&gt;CcTPS1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;CcTPS4&lt;/i&gt;, judging by their high coefficient values (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0.8). The bioinformatics results were verified by quantitative real-time PCR.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This study provides insight into the genes involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of monoterpene in &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt; and thus provides a pool of candidate genes for future mechanistic analyses of how monoterpenes accumulate in &lt;i&gt;BCC&lt;/i&gt;.">

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenoids are the largest class of plant secondary metabolites and are one of the major emitted volatile compounds released to the atmosphere. They have functions of attracting pollinators or defense function, insecticidal properties, and are even used as pharmaceutical agents. Because of the importance of terpenoids, an increasing number of plants are required to investigate the function and evolution of terpene synthases (&lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt;s) that are the key enzymes in terpenoids biosynthesis. Orchidacea, containing more than 800 genera and 28,000 species, is one of the largest and most diverse families of flowering plants, and is widely distributed. Here, the diversification of the &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt;s evolution in Orchidaceae is revealed. A characterization and phylogeny of &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt;s from four different species with whole genome sequences is available. Phylogenetic analysis of orchid &lt;i&gt;TPS&lt;/i&gt;s indicates these genes are divided into &lt;i&gt;TPS-a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;-b&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;-e/f,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; subfamilies, and their duplicated copies are increased in derived orchid species compared to that in the early divergence orchid, &lt;i&gt;A. shenzhenica&lt;/i&gt;. The large increase of both &lt;i&gt;TPS-a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TPS-b&lt;/i&gt; copies can probably be attributed to the pro-duction of different volatile compounds for attracting pollinators or generating chemical defenses in derived orchid lineages; while the duplications of &lt;i&gt;TPS-g&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TPS-e/f&lt;/i&gt; copies occurred in a species-dependent manner.">

Recently, sequencing of several orchid genomes has greatly improved our understanding of the genetic basis of orchid biology. To date, however, most sequenced genomes are from the Epidendroideae subfamily. To better elucidate orchid evolution, greater attention should be paid to other orchid lineages, especially basal lineages such as Apostasioideae.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Here, we present a genome sequence of Apostasia ramifera, a terrestrial orchid species from the Apostasioideae subfamily. The genomes of A. ramifera and other orchids were compared to explore the genetic basis underlying orchid species richness. Genome-based population dynamics revealed a continuous decrease in population size over the last 100 000 years in all studied orchids, although the epiphytic orchids generally showed larger effective population size than the terrestrial orchids over most of that period. We also found more genes of the terpene synthase gene family, resistant gene family, and LOX1/LOX5 homologs in the epiphytic orchids.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This study provides new insights into the adaptive evolution of orchids. The A. ramifera genome sequence reported here should be a helpful resource for future research on orchid biology.">

Recent studies have shown that endophytic fungi are also able to produce volatiles and this raises the question of whether these fungal volatiles influence plant-insect interactions. Here, we qualitatively investigated the volatiles released from 13 endophytic fungal species isolated from leaves of mature black poplar (&lt;i&gt;Populus nigra&lt;/i&gt;) trees. The volatile blends of these endophytes grown on agar medium consist of typical fungal compounds, including aliphatic alcohols, ketones and esters, the aromatic alcohol 2-phenylethanol and various sesquiterpenes. Some of the compounds were previously reported as constituents of the poplar volatile blend&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; For one endophyte, a species of &lt;i&gt;Cladosporium&lt;/i&gt;, we isolated and characterized two sesquiterpene synthases that can produce a number of mono- and sesquiterpenes like (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-ocimene and (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-caryophyllene, compounds that are dominant components of the herbivore-induced volatile bouquet of black poplar trees. As several of the fungus-derived volatiles like 2-phenylethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and the sesquiterpene (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-β-caryophyllene, are known to play a role in direct and indirect plant defense, the emission of volatiles from endophytic microbial species should be considered in future studies investigating tree-insect interactions.">

Biosynthesis and emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the atmosphere facilitate the olfactory cues and ensure successful pollination. &lt;i&gt;Phalaenopsis bellina&lt;/i&gt; is a scented orchid with monoterpenes as major VOCs, comprising linalool, geraniol, and their derivatives. Comparative transcriptomics analysis identified four &lt;i&gt;terpene synthase-b&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TPS-b&lt;/i&gt;) genes and two &lt;i&gt;TPS-e/f&lt;/i&gt; genes with differential gene expression between scented and scentless &lt;i&gt;Phalaenopsis&lt;/i&gt; species. Here, we confirmed their differential expression between scented and scentless &lt;i&gt;Phalaenopsis&lt;/i&gt; orchids and excluded one &lt;i&gt;TPS-b&lt;/i&gt; candidate. We analyzed the temporal and spatial expression and functionally characterized these &lt;i&gt;TPSs&lt;/i&gt;. Both &lt;i&gt;TPS-b&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TPS-e/f&lt;/i&gt; genes showed an increased expression on blooming day or 3 days post-anthesis (D + 3) before the optimal emission of floral scent on D + 5, with especially high expression of &lt;i&gt;PbTPS5&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PbTPS10&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;TPS-b&lt;/i&gt; genes are expressed exclusively in reproductive organs, whereas the &lt;i&gt;TPS-e/f&lt;/i&gt; genes are expressed in both reproductive and vegetative organs. &lt;i&gt;In planta&lt;/i&gt; functional characterization of both &lt;i&gt;PbTPS5&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PbTPS10&lt;/i&gt; in tobacco and scentless &lt;i&gt;Phalaenopsis&lt;/i&gt; plants did not produce terpenoids. Further ectopic expression in scented &lt;i&gt;Phalaenopsis&lt;/i&gt; cultivar &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; I-Hsin Venus showed that linalool was the main product, with &lt;i&gt;PbTPS10&lt;/i&gt; displaying 3-fold higher activity than &lt;i&gt;PbTPS5.&lt;/i&gt; On &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; enzyme assay with purified recombinant TPS-b proteins ectopically expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, geraniol was the product catalyzed by &lt;i&gt;PbTPS5&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PbTPS9&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PbTPS3&lt;/i&gt; was a linalool/(β)-cis-ocimene synthase and &lt;i&gt;PbTPS4&lt;/i&gt; a linalool synthase. In conclusion, both &lt;i&gt;TPS-b&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;TPS-e/f&lt;/i&gt; enzymes orchestrated floral monoterpene biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;P. bellina&lt;/i&gt;.">

        <span class="abst" title="The isoprenoids play important ecological and physiological roles in plants. They also have a tremendous impact on human lives as food additives, medicines, and industrial raw materials, among others. Though some isoprenoids are highly abundant in nature, plants produce many at extremely low levels. Glandular trichomes (GT), which cover the aerial parts of more than 25% of vascular plants, have been considered as natural biofactories for the mass production of rare industrially important isoprenoids. In several plant genera (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Lavandula&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt;), GTs produce and store large quantities of the low molecular weight isoprenoids, in particular mono- and sesquiterpenes, as essential oil constituents. Within each trichome, a group of secretory cells is specialized to strongly and specifically express isoprenoid biosynthetic genes, and to synthesize and deposit copious amounts of terpenoids into the trichome's storage reservoir. Despite the abundance of certain metabolites in essential oils and defensive resins, plants, particularly those lacking glandular trichomes, accumulate small quantities of many of the biologically active and industrially important isoprenoids. Therefore, there is a pressing need for technologies to enable the mass production of such metabolites, and to help meet the ever-increasing demand for plant-based bioproducts, including medicines and renewable materials. Considerable contemporary research has focused on engineering isoprenoid metabolism in GTs, with the goal of utilizing them as natural biofactories for the production of valuable phytochemicals. In this review, we summarize recent advances related to the engineering of isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways in glandular trichomes.">

However, the regulatory mechanism of the correlation of fragrant components and color patterns is less clear. We simultaneously used one way to address how floral color and fragrant formation in different tissues are generated during the development of an individual plant by transcriptome-based weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A spatiotemporal pattern variation of flavonols/carotenoids/chlorophyll pigmentation and benzenoid/phenylpropanoid/ monoterpene fragrant components between the tepal and corona in the flower tissues of &lt;i&gt;Narcissus tazetta&lt;/i&gt;, was exhibited. Several candidate transcription factors: MYB12, MYB1, AP2-ERF, bZIP, NAC, MYB, C2C2, C2H2 and GRAS are shown to be associated with metabolite flux, the phenylpropanoid pathway to the production of flavonols/anthocyanin, as well as related to one branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway to the benzenoid/phenylpropanoid component in the tepal and the metabolite flux between the monoterpene and carotenoids biosynthesis pathway in coronas.

        <span class="abst" title="Auxin, an important plant hormone, induces the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites by modulating the expression of auxin-responsive genes. In the ornamental plant &lt;i&gt;Hedychium coronarium&lt;/i&gt;, linalool and methyl benzoate are biosynthesized by the terpene synthase (TPS) HcTPS5 and the benzoic/salicylic acid methyltransferase (BSMT) HcBSMT2, respectively. However, the transcriptional regulation of this process remains unclear. Here, we identified and functionally characterized the R2R3-MYB transcription factors HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 in regulating the biosynthesis of these floral aroma compounds. &lt;i&gt;HcMYB1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HcMYB2&lt;/i&gt; are specifically expressed in flowers, their expression is correlated with the emission of volatile compounds in flowers, and is induced by auxin. Moreover, HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 interact with the &lt;i&gt;HcBSMT2&lt;/i&gt; promoter region. HcMYB2 activates the expression of the linalool synthase gene &lt;i&gt;HcTPS5&lt;/i&gt;. In flowers with &lt;i&gt;HcMYB1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;HcMYB2&lt;/i&gt; silenced, the levels of floral scent compounds were significantly reduced, and &lt;i&gt;HcBSMT2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HcTPS5&lt;/i&gt; were downregulated compared with the wild type. Moreover, HcMYB1 form protein-protein interaction with key scent-related HcIAA4 protein to regulate floral aroma production. Taken together, these results indicate that HcMYB1 and HcMYB2 play crucial roles in regulating the formation of scent compounds in &lt;i&gt;Hedychium coronarium (H. coronarium)&lt;/i&gt; flowers in response to auxin signaling.">

Bud mutation fruits also matured 10 days earlier than Chardonnay and have higher carotenoid, sugar, and acidic compound contents. Furthermore, the gene expression was examined in the biosynthetic pathways of two ripening-associated hormones, abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA), which significantly increased in bud mutation compared with the Chardonnay fruit. The synthesis and metabolism of amino acids, terpenes, fatty acids, volatile components, and specialized metabolites significantly increased in bud mutation. Therefore, in comparison with Chardonnay, bud mutation is considered a highly aroma-producing grape variety for an improvement in the beverage industry.">

        <span class="abst" title="Gene families involved in specialised metabolism play a key role in a myriad of ecophysiological and biochemical functions. The &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; sesquiterpene synthases represent the largest subfamily of grapevine terpene synthase (&lt;i&gt;VviTPS&lt;/i&gt;) genes and are important volatile metabolites for wine flavour and aroma, as well as ecophysiological interactions. The functional characterisation of &lt;i&gt;VviTPS&lt;/i&gt; genes is complicated by a reliance on a single reference genome that greatly underrepresents this large gene family, exacerbated by extensive duplications and paralogy. The recent release of multiple phased diploid grapevine genomes, as well as extensive whole-genome resequencing efforts, provide a wealth of new sequence information that can be utilised to overcome the limitations of the reference genome. A large cluster of sesquiterpene synthases, localised to chromosome 18, was explored by means of comparative sequence analyses using the publicly available grapevine reference genome, three PacBio phased diploid genomes and whole-genome resequencing data from multiple genotypes. Two genes, &lt;i&gt;VviTPS04&lt;/i&gt; and -&lt;i&gt;10&lt;/i&gt;, were identified as putative paralogues and/or allelic variants. Subsequent gene isolation from multiple grapevine genotypes and characterisation by means of a heterologous in planta expression and volatile analysis resulted in the identification of genotype-specific structural variations and polymorphisms that impact the gene function. These results present novel insight into how grapevine domestication likely shaped the &lt;i&gt;VviTPS&lt;/i&gt; landscape to result in genotype-specific functions.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Timing is everything when it comes to the fitness outcome of a plant's ecological interactions, and accurate timing is particularly relevant for interactions with herbivores or mutualists that are based on ephemeral emissions of volatile organic compounds. Previous studies of the wild tobacco N. attenuata have found associations between the diurnal timing of volatile emissions, and daytime predation of herbivores by their natural enemies.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Here, we investigated the role of light in regulating two biosynthetic groups of volatiles, terpenoids and green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which dominate the herbivore-induced bouquet of N. attenuata. Light deprivation strongly suppressed terpenoid emissions while enhancing GLV emissions, albeit with a time lag. Silencing the expression of photoreceptor genes did not alter terpenoid emission rhythms, but silencing expression of the phytochrome gene, NaPhyB1, disordered the emission of the GLV (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. External abscisic acid (ABA) treatments increased stomatal resistance, but did not truncate the emission of terpenoid volatiles (recovered in the headspace). However, ABA treatment enhanced GLV emissions and leaf internal pools (recovered from tissue), and reduced internal linalool pools. In contrast to the pattern of diurnal terpenoid emissions and nocturnal GLV emissions, transcripts of herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) biosynthetic genes peaked during the day. The promotor regions of these genes were populated with various cis-acting regulatory elements involved in light-, stress-, phytohormone- and circadian regulation.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This research provides insights into the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of HIPV bouquets, a mechanistic complexity which rivals the functional complexity of HIPVs, which includes repelling herbivores, calling for body guards, and attracting pollinators.">

The result revealed that the bornyl acetate and borneol contents were higher in &lt;i&gt;A. villosum&lt;/i&gt; than in &lt;i&gt;A. longiligulare&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, six terpenoid synthase genes (&lt;i&gt;AlTPS1-AlTPS6&lt;/i&gt;) were screened from the transcriptome of &lt;i&gt;A. longiligulare&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;AlTPS2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AlTPS3&lt;/i&gt; were found to share 98 and 83% identity with &lt;i&gt;AvTPS2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AvBPPS&lt;/i&gt; (bornyl diphosphate synthase) from &lt;i&gt;A. villosum&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. BPPS is the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of borneol and bornyl acetate. Biochemical assays improved that AlTPS2 had an identical function to AvTPS2 as linalool synthase; however, AlTPS3 produced camphene as the major product and bornyl diphosphate (BPP) as the secondary product, whereas AvBPPS produced BPP as its major product. There was only one different amino acid between AlTPS3 (A496) and AvBPPS (G495) in their conserved motifs, and the site-directed mutation of A496G in DTE motif of AlTPS3 changed the major product from camphene to BPP. Molecular docking suggests that A496G mutation narrows the camphene-binding pocket and decreases the BPP-binding energy, thus increases the product BPP selectivity of enzyme. In addition, the expression level of &lt;i&gt;AvBPPS&lt;/i&gt; was significantly higher than that of &lt;i&gt;AlTPS3&lt;/i&gt; in seeds, which was consistent with the related-metabolites contents. This study provides insight into the TPS-related molecular bases for the biosynthesis and accumulation differences of the bioactive terpenoids between &lt;i&gt;A. villosum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. longiligulare&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;BPPS&lt;/i&gt;, the key gene involved in the biosynthesis of the active compound, was identified as a target gene that could be applied for the quality-related identification and breeding of &lt;i&gt;Fructus Amomi&lt;/i&gt;.">
