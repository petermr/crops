Isoprenoids are hydrocarbon-based compounds with different carbon chain lengths and diverse chemical structures, similar to petroleum. Thus, isoprenoid alcohols such as isopentenol (C<sub>5</sub>), geraniol (C<sub>10</sub>), and farnesol (C<sub>15</sub>) have been considered to be ideal biofuel candidates. NudB, a native phosphatase of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, is reported to dephosphorylate isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) into isopentenol. However, no attention has been paid to its promiscuous activity toward longer chain length (C<sub>10</sub>-C<sub>15</sub>) prenyl diphosphates.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, the promiscuous activity of NudB toward geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) was applied for the production of isoprenoid alcohol mixtures, including isopentenol, geraniol, and farnesol, and their derivatives. <i>E. coli</i> was engineered to produce a mixture of C<sub>5</sub> and C<sub>15</sub> alcohols by overexpressing NudB (dihydroneopterin triphosphate diphosphohydrolase) and IspA (FPP synthase) along with a heterologous MVA pathway, which resulted in a total of up to 1652\u00a0mg/L mixture of C<sub>5</sub> and C<sub>15</sub> alcohols and their derivatives. The production was further increased to 2027\u00a0mg/L by overexpression of another endogenous phosphatase, AphA, in addition to NudB.
