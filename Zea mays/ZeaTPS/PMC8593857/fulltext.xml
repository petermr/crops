</p><p id="Par4">The aim of this work was to evaluate the response of various species and provenances of <italic>Juglans</italic> to the anthracnose agent <italic>Gnomonia leptostyla.</italic> The research was carried out in the 15-year-old experimental plantation Cesurni Farm (CRA) near Tivoli, Rome, during the 2014 vegetative seasons, characterized by a high anthracnose incidence. The considered material consisted of four <italic>Juglans</italic> species originated from USA, i.e. <italic>J. cinerea</italic> (8 genotypes), <italic>J. microcarpa</italic> (18), <italic>J. sieboldiana</italic> (16) and <italic>J. nigra</italic> (66) and of <italic>J. regia</italic> plants of different provenances, from France (27), Russia (16), Israel (28), Iran (9), northern Italy (32), central Italy (36), southern Italy (42). Both the average number of necrosis spots and the percentage of leaf necrotic area were useful tools to evaluate disease susceptibility. <italic>J. cinerea</italic> and <italic>J. sieboldiana</italic> showed only small (2-4 mm diameter) necrotic spots, while the other species exhibited necroses larger than 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, with stronger severity (in descending order) on <italic>J. regia, J. nigra</italic> and <italic>J. microcarpa</italic> and, among <italic>J. regia,</italic> for the provenances from France, Russia, Italy, Israel and Iran. <italic>J. cinerea, J. sieboldiana, J. microcarpa, J. nigra,</italic> resulted more resistant to anthracnose than <italic>J. regia</italic>. Among <italic>J. regia,</italic> the genotypes of French origin were discreetly resistant, those from Russia and Israel were tendentially susceptible, those from Iran were very susceptible, whereas the genotypes from Italy ranged from very susceptible to moderately resistant. These results represent an important starting point for the selection and genetic improvement of walnut for fruit and wood production.</p><p id="Par5"><bold>Wheat associated microbial community changes due to the activity of</bold>

</p><p id="Par12">Grapevine nursery industry produces millions of bench-grafted vines starting from the growth of rootstock mother vines. With few exceptions, rootstocks shoots are usually sprawled on the ground, an inexpensive method that may favor infections by trunk disease pathogens, compromising the quality of the propagation material.&#x000a0;More rarely, trellis systems are applied to rootstock mother vines to improve the functional leaf area and its exposure to the sunlight. Different trellis system therefore influences the canopy microclimate: this and the lack of contact with the soil occurring by trellising rootstock mother vines may positively shape the dynamics of the epiphytic and endophytic microbial communities. Through a DNA metabarcoding approach, this study investigated the impact of two trellising methods (a trellis system with a transpiring fabric applied to protect sprawled rootstocks from the soil) compared to the traditional sprawled rootstocks (two cultivars: Kober 5 BB and 110 Richter), on the resident fungal and bacterial communities, with a specific focus on wood pathogens. Beta diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities, including epiphytic and endophytic communities, resulted to be affected by the temporal distribution of the rootstock microbiome. Such diversity was more evident when comparing a trellised rootstock (cv. Kober 5 BB) with the same plant material sprawled on the ground. The results show that the sprawling shoots, compared to vertical-positioned shoots, are more exposed to soilborne microorganisms and pathogens as a consequence of the contact with the inoculum in the soil and the higher temperatures and humidity.</p><p id="Par13">

</p><p id="Par17">Grapevine grafting has become an essential practice in viticulture and over the years various bench grafting techniques have evolved to mechanize the nursery process and to increase the yield in number of viable cuttings. Bench grafting is a fundamental nursery practice that affects the quality of propagation material also in young decline associated to grapevine trunk diseases, and has been recently reported to influence leaf symptoms development associated to diseases of Esca complex. The present study aimed to investigate how three bench grafting methods (omega graft as mechanical technique, whip and tongue graft as manual technique and full cleft graft as semi-mechanical technique) can influence these phenomena, comparing their effect on anatomical development of the grafting point and on functionality of vascular tissue, also considering two factors: cultivar (Cabernet Sauvignon, Glera and Teroldego) and scion/rootstock diameter (thin and large). Light microscopy observations on the anatomical evolution were correlated with the grafting methods and the investigated varieties. Significant differences between cultivars and/or graft type were also detected in terms of necrotic area on the grafted tissues. Statistical analysis of the grapevine vessels suggested differences in xylem parameters between cultivars while graft type had no have significant effects. On the other hand, the intrinsic growth rate was significantly affected by the graft type. The results confirm the potential incidence of lesions and dysfunctionalities correlated with the grafting method applied, which can potentially induce grafted vine declines in vineyard as a result of the necrotic area detected on the grafted tissues.</p><p id="Par18">

The investigation was made on acorns and on <italic>Quercus</italic> seedlings grown in a forest nursery. The analysis aims to determine pathogens that can potentially infect seedlings and eventually cause plant death. Fungal detection by molecular tools was performed with two approaches: 1) by culture-dependent fungal profiling followed by Sanger sequencing and 2) by culture-independent fungal profiling using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT). In both cases, we sequenced the ITS region of ribosomal DNA. Both methods have proven effective, however, culture-independent methodology proved more advantageous; in fact, using culture independent approach, we were able to identify a larger variety of microorganism putatively involved in the oak decline syndrome. Using culture-dependent approach, several saprophytic fungal species were isolated <italic>in vitro</italic> and subsequently, characterized by ITS sequencing (Sanger).&#x000a0;Nanopore ITS sequencing identified a broader variety of fungal species, with few associated to the oak decline such as <italic>Diplodia corticola</italic> and <italic>Discula quercina</italic>.

</p><p id="Par27"><italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> (FG) is the main causal agent of <italic>Fusarium</italic> head blight (FHB) of wheat. However, recently, another pathogen, <italic>Fusarium avenaceum</italic> (FA), has increased its relevance worldwide. FG biosynthesizes deoxynivalenol (DON), while FA is an enniatin (ENNs) producer. DON is a well-known mycotoxin but little is known about the activity of ENNs on wheat tissues and on fungal competition. For this reason, the present study aims to explore the effect of enniatin B (ENB), and its association with DON, on bread wheat and on <italic>Fusarium</italic> development. Pure ENB, DON and ENB&#x02009;+&#x02009;DON (10&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were applied to bread wheat (cv. A416) seeds, seedlings and leaves to test their impact on germination, shoot/root growth, plant cell death (PCD) induction (trypan blue staining and malondialdehyde, MDA, accumulation methods) and pigmentation. In addition, pure ENB, DON and ENB&#x02009;+&#x02009;DON (10, 50 and 100&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were used to assess the <italic>in vitro</italic> effect on FG and FA growth. A synergistic effect of the two compounds in the reduction of seed germination and shoot/root development was observed. ENB alone induced the highest MDA accumulation in shoot/root. Conversely, DON, at the tested concentration, did not increase MDA. ENB showed also a higher &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; effect on pigments in comparison to DON. Starting from 50&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ENB inhibited FG development, while DON promoted FA growth. A synergistic effect was also observed in the reduction of FA/FG development.

</p><p id="Par32">Application of bacterial biocontrol agents (BBCAs) represents a promising strategy for the sustainable management of soil-borne pathogens. Nonetheless, their efficacy in field is often inconsistent. This might be due to their difficulty to adapt and integrate within indigenous soil microbial communities. In fact, the establishment of interspecific interactions based on diffusible communication signals (DCSs) produced by the rhizosphere microbiota continuously shapes gene expression of BBCA species, enhancing or hindering their establishment in the rhizosphere. To shed light on the aspects determining rhizosphere competence of BBCAs, we investigated the response of the model BBCA <italic>Lysobacter capsici</italic> AZ78 (AZ78) to most common rhizosphere DCSs. Functional experiments aimed at assessing changes in AZ78 cell growth and <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial activity upon exposure to DCSs were carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> using a growth medium mimicking rhizosphere conditions. Results showed that DCSs did not impair AZ78 cell growth whereas indole and glyoxylic acid influenced AZ78 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory activity against soil-borne pathogens. Gene expression profiling of AZ78 was carried out by high throughput RNA-Seq. Results revealed that nearly 21% of all AZ78 genes was modulated by DCSs. 13-methyltetradecanoic acid, glyoxylic acid, and 2,3-butanedione up-regulated genes related to motility and stress tolerance. Indole down-regulated genes related to motility and antibiosis. These findings suggest that manipulating DCSs levels in the rhizosphere could provide efficient means to favour persistence and biocontrol activity of BBCAs in the rhizosphere. Further investigations will be dedicated to the selection of helper-bacterial-strains producing positive signals to obtain functional microbial consortia for field application.</p><p id="Par33">

</p><p id="Par37">Microbial based biopesticides have been recognized as a sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides in agriculture. However, environmental factors may negatively impact their viability and limit their efficacy in the field. Moreover, they must survive and thrive within resident soil microbial communities. Nowadays, the use of synthetic microbial consortia is considered as a sound strategy for overcoming these constraints. Herein, we describe a method for designing bacterial consortia with biocontrol activity. A collection of bacterial isolates was preliminary screened <italic>in vitro</italic> for their ability to coexist with <italic>Lysobacter capsici</italic> AZ78 (AZ78), a Gram-negative bacterium able to control several phytopathogenic microorganisms. Each strain was tested for enhancement of AZ78 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory activity against <italic>Pythium ultimum</italic>. Results showed that some strains belonging to the genera <italic>Ensifer</italic>, <italic>Lysobacter, Stenotrophomonas,</italic> and <italic>Variovorax</italic> particularly enhanced AZ78 biocontrol activity. Strains were also evaluated for their ability to decrease the susceptibility of AZ78 to desiccation and UV light. All the binary combinations showed that extracellular metabolites of <italic>Ensifer</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> and <italic>Lysobacter</italic> spp. enhanced, both, AZ78 resistance to UV light and desiccation. Furthermore, combinations of AZ78 and helper bacterial strains (HBS) were evaluated for their ability to enhance biocontrol activity against <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>radicis-lycopersici in planta.</italic> All tested consortia were effective in suppressing Fusarium crown and root rot of tomato <italic>in planta</italic>.

</p><p id="Par42">Proper management of <italic>Phytophthora capsici</italic> in pepper cultivation is extremely important, since Phytophthora blight is the main disease of this crop worldwide. In the past, the main strategy adopted was the use of fungicides, causing, in some cases, the development of <italic>P. capsici</italic> resistant strains. In this work three different treatments selected from previous studies (potassium phosphite, calcium oxide and a water suspension from <italic>Trichoderma</italic> sp. TW2 enriched compost) were tested to prove their ability to activate the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in pepper against <italic>P. capsici</italic>; acibenzolar-s-methyl was used as positive control. Two independent growth chamber pot experiments were performed, spatially dividing the site of treatments application (as radical drench) and the site of inoculation (as agar plug on the third leaf). Leaf lesions were measured, showing a significant reduction on all treated plants compared to the untreated control. To further confirm this hypothesis, the expression levels of three SAR key genes (<italic>CaPBR1</italic>, <italic>CaPO1</italic> and <italic>CaDEF1</italic>) were evaluated though RT-Real Time PCR at the three end-point times: T0, T6 and T24. A significant increase of target genes expression was observed in one end-point time in each treated plant.

</p><p id="Par47">Phytoplasmas are strictly dependent on sieve-element resources, thus insight about the fine interaction established with the different sieve-element components are useful in the comprehension of their biology. Sieve elements are living cells in which many organelles (i.e. the nucleus, the ribosomes, the tonoplast, and the Golgi system) are missing, while the plasma membrane remains intact and delimits a narrow parietal cytoplasm, containing smooth endoplasmic reticulum stacks, mitochondria, small plastids and cytoskeleton components. Sieve elements also contain a number of structural proteins and specific sugar membrane transporters and enzymes whose function has to be clarified in relation to phytoplasma infection. In phytoplasma-infected Arabidopsis, sieve-plate plugging by the filamentous sieve element occlusion-related (SEOR) proteins as well as callose accumulation around the sieve pores, under the control of Callose synthase 7 (AtCALS7), have been interpreted as mechanical responses to limit pathogen spread. In addition, synaptotagmins (SYTs) have been described as proteins responsible of the regulation of the host secretion- and endocytic activities in response to different stresses but, even more, in the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity as well as in the movement of pathogens, such as viruses. We report that the above cited proteins, a part their specific local function, are involved, at a different level, in the defense signaling to establish systemic responses to phytoplasma infection, by interfering with defense-related phytohormonal pathways (AtSEOR2 protein), by regulating sugar movement at both symplasmic and apoplasmic level (AtCALS7), and by influencing protein regulation and lipid trafficking at the infection site (SYTA-1 protein).</p><p id="Par48"><bold>Management of bacterial wilt disease of tomato and potato: genetic variability of</bold>

</p><p id="Par51"><italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> (Rs), the causal agent of tomato southern bacterial wilt and of potato brown rot, affects more than 250 plant species and it is included in the EPPO list of quarantine pathogens (QP). On tomato, the disease is characterized by a general wilting of the plant due to the colonization of its vascular system. Rs is a species complex with a high genetic variability and, based on the host plants, is currently divided into 5 races. In Emilia-Romagna Region (Northern Italy), during the last 15 years, Rs presence has been detected in potatoes, tomatoes and in superficial waters in nearby cultivated areas. Twenty-seven Rs strains (belonging to races 1 and 3) were characterised by Rep-PCR (BOX, ERIC, REP). The binary matrices from PCR profiles were used for UPGMA analysis in single or concatenated way. PD 2762 Rs and DISTAL 9081 <italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> pv. <italic>vitians</italic> strains were used as race 3 reference and as outgroup, respectively. From the concatenated profiles, the 27 Rs strains were divided in the two macro-groups of races 3 and 1 with a 15% similarity. The 6 strains race 3 were subdivided in 2 groups with a 50% similarity and 5 of them were more similar to each other than the PD 2762 strain. The 21 strains race 1 were subdivided into 4 groups with more than 60% similarity. The high degree of genetic variability particularly among the strains of race 1 (isolated in Parma and Ferrara provinces) suggests the presence of different haplotypes probably due to the movement of non-symptomatic infected material.</p><p id="Par52"><bold><italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic></bold>

</p><p id="Par55">Chitin represents the main fibrillary component of the fungal cell wall. During plant infection, chitin apposition is counteracted by host chitinases. A chitinase class IV is constitutively contained in grapevine berries and it is expressed in leaves following <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> infection. Early, during fungal growth, the fungus proteolytically removes the chitin-binding domain (CBD). The chitinase without the CBD shows a reduction of activity by about 50% and louses the detrimental effects on conidia germination and fungal growth. Protease inhibition assays provided evidence that metalloprotease activity is involved in the chitinase cleavage. To ascertain whether the native and cleaved chitinase can differently affect the expression of genes involved in <italic>B. cinerea</italic> cell wall modeling, we analyzed by qPCR the expression of five fungal chitin synthase (<italic>Chs</italic>) and four chitin deacetylase (<italic>Cda</italic>) genes. Only one <italic>Chs</italic> gene decreased its expression in presence of the native chitinase. In conclusion, the removal of the CBD by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> proteases appears as a mechanism preserving fungal growth from plant chitinase activity.

</p><p id="Par69">Fungi <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. are widely used as biocontrol agents and plant growth promoters. It has been showed that tomato plants treated with <italic>Trichoderma harzianum</italic> (T22) activate their systemic defence responses by modulating the symptoms of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Also, feeding behaviour of aphids is altered when they feed on a CMV infected plant. The virus enhances the plant attractivity but reduces its quality as host, promoting the subsequent dispersion of aphids towards healthy plants and, consequently, its diffusion. However, there is no information on the influence of <italic>T. harzianum</italic> on the aphid attractiveness towards virus-infected plants, nor on the virus transmission through the behavioural changes of the vectors.</p><p id="Par70">In the present study, we investigated the effects of T22 in tomato plants (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> var.

For this purpose, aphid behaviour was observed in a choice test including tomato plants treated with T22 and then infected by CMV, strain Fny. Although preliminary, the results seem to indicate that T22, by reducing CMV infection in tomato plants, is able to modify the feeding behaviour of <italic>M. persicae</italic> because of the host quality enhancement in terms of changes in some produced volatile components. If confirmed, this research represents an important advancement in the knowledge of the biological control induced by T22 against CMV in tomato plants, not only as systemic resistance elicitor, but also by the control of aphid transmission.</p><p id="Par71"><bold>The role of CRZ1 transcription factor in</bold>

Several researchers have investigated cropping operations&#x02019; role in mycotoxin contamination, but these findings were unuseful for their use in predictive modelling. Till now, two weather-based mechanistic models were developed, AFLA-maize and FER-maize, predicting aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) and fumonisins (FBs), respectively. In this study, a machine learning (ML) approach was considered, which included the output of these models and cropping system data as the input variables. In northern Italy, over the years 2005&#x02013;2018, the occurrence of AFB<sub>1</sub> and FBs was recorded in 30&#x02013;50 georeferenced maize fields per year; the cropping system data were also collected for all the fields. Two deep neural networks (DNN) models were trained to predict, at harvest, maize fields contaminated above the legal limit with AFB<sub>1</sub> and FBs. Both models reached an accuracy&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;75% demonstrating the ML approach added value with respect to classical statistical approaches (i.e. simple or multiple linear regression models). The predictive performance improved around&#x02009;+&#x02009;25%, compared with that obtained for AFLA-maize and FER-maize, having been &#x02248;52% for both models.

</p><p id="Par90">The Life Green Grapes project arises from the need to find alternative approaches all along the grapevine production chain &#x02013; from the nursery to wine and table grape production&#x02014;to reduce the amount of fungicides, in particular to control downy mildew. To this end, the use of DSS has been associated with defense support products included in the category of fertilizers that activate the defense responses of the plant. In wine-grape vineyards the results obtained after three years of trials confirmed the importance and effectiveness of these products in reducing the impact of the disease in years not particularly favorable to the development of the pathogen, as occurred in 2019, when the incidence of the disease did not show statistically significant differences between the IPM treatments (3%) and the treatments with the use of defense support products (3.5%). When using DSS, it was possible to decide appropriately both the type of product and the most suitable time for its application, based on the expected pathogen pressure, guaranteeing a 50% reduction in fungicides. On the other hand, when favorable weather conditions for the pathogen persist for several days, the use of defense support products alone &#x02013; as to be expected&#x02014;was not sufficient to control the disease. A correct interpretation of the forecasting model associated with the correct use of plant support products under a high disease pressure alternated or coupled with synthetic fungicides, can guarantee the reduction of them in line with the European directives on the sustainable use of plant protection products.</p><p id="Par91">

</p><p id="Par95"><italic>Xylophilus</italic> is a genus of the <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> comprising only one species that circumscribes a taxon of xylematic bacteria causing bacterial blight of grapevine: <italic>X. ampelinus</italic>. An existing evidence from metagenomic analyses on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves and roots suggests, however, that the phytobiome may be the reservoir for an almost unexplored yet large diversity laying within the boundaries of this genus. Recently, we obtained discrepant results when testing grapevines with the two molecular diagnostic protocols for <italic>X. ampelinus</italic> recognized by EPPO. In fact, we evidenced samples collected from asymptomatic rooted grafted plants which resulted positive only with the PCR protocol targeting the ITS region. The incongruity between the results according to the two solid and well-validated protocols prompted us to start this ongoing study aimed at unraveling the identity of the cross-reacting microorganisms.</p><p id="Par96">With the help of the QuantPrime web service, we developed primer pairs for all the recognized ORFs of the genome of <italic>X. ampelinus</italic> strain CECT 7646<sup>&#x000a0;T</sup> (assembly GCA_003217575.1).

The sequence analysis of the amplicons obtained from the grapevine nucleic acids extracts that were positive only with the ITS protocol, shed light on the diversity of the grapevine microbiota related to the genus <italic>Xylophilus</italic>.

</p><p id="Par101"><italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> causes diseases on a wide range of agronomically important crops. Because the prevailing opinion on this bacterium was that it displays a certain host specificity, strains of the <italic>P. syringae</italic> complex had been divided into more than 50 pathovars. Considerable research effort has been invested in understanding how <italic>P. syringae</italic> repertoire of virulence effectors, mainly involved in plant immunity suppression, determines the range of plants that a strain can infect. Recently, we showed that the incapacity of <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>actinidiae</italic> to induce ETI in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Col-0 is mostly due to its incapability to inject effectors rather than to the absence of a recognized effector.</p><p id="Par102">In this light, here we report results from the comparison of the capacity of different <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains, belonging to different phylogroups and carrying the same plasmid-borne avirulence gene, to induce an ETI in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> Col-0. We show that the response induced by <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000 is rather unique in consistently triggering high levels of ETI across a range of temperatures. The other strains induced ETI at different intensities and the response was influenced by temperature. Curiously, even strains that were quasi-clones did not behave identically. This highlights the necessity to study bacterial virulence in a broader set of strains and supports the hypothesis that the presence/absence of effectors is likely not sufficient to predict the outcome of plant-bacteria interactions. Virulence seems to rely more on the capacity of the bacterium to inject its effectors, with temperature playing a decisive role.</p><p id="Par103">

Plant pathogens alone are responsible for an estimated 20% losses in our major crops, corresponding roughly to the predicted global population increase for the next 3 decades. Cultural practices such as irrigation, crop rotation, fertilisers etc and spraying with chemical agents represent the major means for disease control. Disease resistance in the host plant is arguably the most effective and sustainable means of disease control, however, &#x02019;natural&#x02019; resistance, obtained by screening within the crop plant species or its close relatives, is unavailable for many diseases. Effective disease resistance has been achieved through genetic engineering using a number of strategies. Historically, the first strategy used single genes encoding antimicrobial proteins such as chitinase. These early studies gave partial resistance but several recent studies have apparently yielded high levels of resistance, even under field conditions. Other approaches exploit our increasingly detailed knowledge of signal transduction and plant immunity. Currently the most promising approaches fall under the headline &#x0201c;New Genomic Technologies&#x0201d; (NGT) where host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) and gene editing of susceptibility genes by, e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 are most promising, though, no resistant varieties have been released based on NGT.</p><p id="Par107">Biological control is another and, in Europe at least, less controversial approach to disease control. Biological control in the strict sense represents the use of antagonistic microbes to combat the pathogen and as such represents a potentially sustainable approach. Over recent years, biological control has progressed to the stage where a number of products are on the market, and our knowledge of mode action improves continually. Four major modes of action are recognised: competition, antibiosis, hyperparasitism and induced resistance. A weakness of biological control lies in its vulnerability to environmental factors. The endobiome is thought to be a potential source of novel BCAs since once inside, they are likely to be less vulnerable to external environmental influence. Our studies with endophytes to control Fusarium Head Blight (caused by <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>) and Septoria leaf blotch (caused by <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic>) have given several promising potential BCAs which were isolated using an ecological approach: where they are present in asymptomatic tissues where there was considerable inoculum pressure.

Two different CAPs were used for PAW production, evaluating their effectiveness as a possible mean to control plant diseases. Grapevines infected with yellows associated with the presence of phytoplasmas were treated evaluating qualitative and quantitative yield parameters, phytoplasma presence, and gene expression. The results show the capability of PAW to enhance plant defence mechanisms and, as demonstrated in the field trials, confirmed its ability to improve the health status of the treated plants. Quantitative (q)RT-PCR analyses allowed to determine the transcription level of genes involved in the plant defence response (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, pal) and in the plant phytoalexin metabolism of PAW-treated materials. The number of symptomatic grapevine plants in vineyards was significantly reduced by the treatments. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional molecular analyses highlighted the PAW ability to enhance the expression of genes encoding the main enzymes involved in the phytoalexin biosynthetic pathway (flavonoids and stilbenes). The PAW ability to enhance some of the plant defence mechanisms also improving the health status of the treated plants was therefore experimentally demonstrated. After three years of trials the overall results demonstrated the possible use of PAW to reduce the disease severity, induce plant resistance both in open field and greenhouse, improving plant healthy status and grapevine yield production.</p><p id="Par124">

</p><p id="Par133">Crop pathogen management is a priority for sustainable agriculture development. Indeed, the large use of pesticides is threatening both human and environmental health, while simultaneously, pushing antimicrobial resistance occurrence. Moreover, synthetic compounds suffer from low biodegradability leading to their accumulation into soil and freshwater. This led to many restrictions regarding the application of available products, including copper, that make difficult the management of plant diseases. Among the different practices included in integrated pest management, the biological control, usually referred to the use of organisms to influence the activities of a plant pathogen, has been extended to the use of natural biomolecules in the control of plant diseases. However, natural molecule application suffers from their poor persistence in the field or penetration into plant tissues. Our objective is thus the development and application of innovative nanocompounds based on nanoemulsions to convey essential oils (EOs), as an alternative to the use of traditional treatments. Indeed, most EOs display a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, thanks to their diverse combinations of terpenoids, phenols and volatile components. Despite their application in food industry and the well-recognized antimicrobial activity against plant pathogens, little is known about their efficacy in a poorly controlled environment such as open fields. We are thus currently investigating the possibility of using EOs as natural crop protection agents, focusing on the improvement of EO solubility in water and stability in a natural environment, through their specific nanoformulation, to enhance their bioavailability and efficacy in a real agricultural context.</p><p id="Par134"><bold><italic>In silico</italic></bold>

The analysis was performed with the antiSMASH pipeline which integrates tools such as NCBI BLAST&#x02009;+&#x02009;, HMMer 3, Muscle 3, FastTree, PySVG, JQuery SVG, ClusterFinder and ClusterBLAST that allow the identification of clusters of genes of secondary metabolites and their comparison with those already identified and characterized experimentally. The results obtained show that some pathways are highly conserved among the various species (e.g. fragin, aryl polyenes, fengycin, etc.), others averagely conserved (e.g. ornibactin, thanamycin, nunapeptin) and others are not very frequent (e. g. bicornutin, rhizomide), with percentages of similarity extremely variable, with respect to the known clusters.

</p><p id="Par149">During 2019 and 2020, repeated field surveys were carried out in hazelnut orchards located in the Viterbo province, in Lazio region (Italy). Dry rot of buds, desiccation of twigs, and necrosis of leaf lamina were diffusely observed on hazelnut trees, particularly on cv. Nocchione. As result of fungal isolation from symptomatic tissues, one morphotype was persistently obtained from the margin of lesions of collected samples. The analysis of morphological features of the fungus grown on malt extract agar (MEA), potato dextrose agar (PDA), corn meal agar (CMA) and oatmeal agar (OA), provided for the attribution to the species <italic>Monostichella coryli</italic>. This initial identification was molecularly confirmed by sequencing the partial large subunit rDNA, the internal transcribed spacer region and partial beta-tubulin region and blasting the sequences in the NCBI database. Pathogenicity tests proved that the fungus is able to multiply and systematically invade artificially inoculated hazelnut tissues and incite disease symptoms on both Nocchione and Tonda Gentile Romana cultivars. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays demonstrated that environmental conditions, such as temperature and relative humidity influence growth rate, sporulation and conidial germination and allowed the definition of mathematical functions describing optimal, suboptimal and critical condition for these biological facets.

An outdoor pilot and an indoor study using potted privet both showed that fewer plant deaths occurred when <italic>A. gallica</italic> had colonised a pot 6&#x000a0;months before <italic>A. mellea</italic> was added compared to <italic>A. mellea</italic> attack on its own. Additionally, endophytic <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. isolates have been collected from plants that had escaped infection in RHS Garden Wisley and inoculated into experimental strawberry and privet plants to assess their ability to protect plants from <italic>A. mellea</italic> attack.

However, such compounds accumulate in soil and water, posing an effective risk for the environment. For such reasons, they must be replaced by innovative and eco-sustainable formulations, such as natural derived compounds with antimicrobial properties, and employment of nanotechnologies to optimize their functions by functionalize them with plant-derived nano-carriers (cellulose nanocrystals and starch).

</p><p id="Par170">Fusarium head blight (FHB) is considered a major threat to wheat and is managed by the application of fungicides at anthesis. However, fungicides are applied when FHB symptoms are clearly visible, by when it is too late to control FHB. For this reason, farmers often perform repeated fungicide treatments that cause a waste of money and pose significant risks to the environment and non-target organisms. We used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal infrared (TIR) and red&#x02013;green&#x02013;blue (RGB) imaging for FHB detection in <italic>T. turgidum</italic> under natural field conditions. TIR and RGB data coupled with ground-based measurements such as spike&#x02019;s temperature, photosynthetic efficiency and molecular identification of FHB pathogens, detected FHB at anthesis half-way. Moreover, in greenhouse experiments the transcripts of the key genes involved in stomatal closure were mostly up-regulated in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>-inoculated plants, demonstrating that the physiological mechanism behind the spike&#x02019;s temperature increase and photosynthetic efficiency decrease could be attributed to the closure of the guard cells in response to <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. In addition, preliminary analysis revealed a differential regulation of genes between drought-stressed and <italic>F. graminearum</italic>-inoculated plants, suggesting that there might be a possibility to discriminate between water stress and FHB infection. This study shows the potential of UAV-based TIR and RGB imaging for field phenotyping of wheat in response to environmental stresses. This is anticipated to have enormous promise for the detection of FHB disease and tremendous implications for optimizing the application of fungicides, since global food crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.</p><p id="Par171"><bold>Biocontrol of soil born forest pathogens with local</bold>

</p><p id="Par180">Phytoplasmas are plant pathogenic bacteria that cause diseases and severe economic losses to crops worldwide. Phytoplasmas are transmitted by Hemipteran insect species to the phloem of host plants, and they multiply in both hosts. As these unculturable bacteria are wall-less, the involvement of different cell membrane proteins in promoting pathogen internalization within the host cell has been hypothesized. Here we present the results on the interactome of the immunodominant membrane protein (Imp) of Flavescence dor&#x000e9;e phytoplasma (FDp) with insect vector proteins. FDp is a grapevine quarantine pest and a major threat to European viticulture. Affinity chromatography and pull-down procedures combined with mass spectrometry were employed to identify host proteins interacting with synthetic Imp C-terminus domains of two FDp strains (16SrV-C and &#x02013;D). The leafhopper species <italic>Scaphoideus titanus</italic>, the FDp natural vector, and <italic>Euscelidius variegatus</italic>, the laboratory vector, were the hosts of this study. Interacting protein fractions were trypsin-digested before being analysed by mass spectrometry and identified by bioinformatic analyses. Five <italic>E. variegatus</italic> proteins interacting with Imp were further characterized, by measuring expression of the corresponding transcripts in different insect tissues as well as in healthy vs. infected insects. RNA interference was exploited to silence these five gene and evaluate the effects on phytoplasma acquisition. As the control of phytoplasma diseases is based on insecticides to reduce vector populations, this work is an initial step to identify key stages of FDp transmission specificity and vector infection, as potential targets to disrupt FD epidemiological cycle.</p><p id="Par181">

</p><p id="Par184">The agro-food chain represents one of the production sectors most responsible for the release of industrial wastes creating problems as pollutants in water and soil, the emission of greenhouse gases, with potential risks to human and environment health. The disposal of such wastes constitutes an economic cost to producers. However, agri-food by-products can be an economic resource when converted to new products, useful in a multitude of manufacturing sectors, with additional social and environmental benefits. The aim of this work was the development of a microbial biotechnological process to reduce the phytotoxicity of by-products produced from the extraction of food oils from rapeseed (RS) and sunflower (SF), using them as substrates to produce cultures of the plant beneficial fungi, <italic>Trichoderma harzianum</italic> and <italic>T. asperellum</italic>, for applications as soil admendments and biostimulants in diverse plant cultivation systems. <italic>In vivo</italic> assays were conducted on tomato plants to evaluate the effect on plant growth after soil integrations with the oil by-products, after pretreatments in Solid State Fermentation (SSF) with three different <italic>Trichoderma</italic> strains. The culturing of <italic>Trichoderma</italic> on the oil by-products, contributed to the bioremediation of SF or RS by decreasing the phytotoxicity effects when they were added to the soil at high concentrations. Furthermore, the SSF of SF and RS wastes with <italic>Trichoderma</italic> treatments enhanced the positive effects on plant epigeal-hypogeal growth and development in comparison to treatments receiving only the by-products or the fungal applications; the combination of SF or RS with <italic>Trichoderma</italic> strain T22 were found to be the most effective biostimulant treatments. The by-products also favored the colonization and persistence of <italic>Trichoderma</italic> in the soil, thus enhancing and prolonging its effects on the plant. The use of beneficial microorganisms is a promising method to recycle agro-food wastes, contributing to the green economy and environmental sustainability.</p><p id="Par185">

Although the difference in fumonisins production, the pathogenicity tests on maize stalk did not show any difference in infection levels. Additionally, using knock-out mutant in <italic>FUM1</italic> gene did not show any compromised virulence in stalk rot assay. To better understand <italic>Fv</italic> virulence, the genome of <italic>Fv</italic>10027 was sequenced and assembled. Comparative genomics between <italic>Fv</italic>7600 and <italic>Fv</italic>10027 showed a difference in genome size of about 1.4&#x000a0;Mb despite 99% nucleotide identity. Genome assembly of <italic>Fv</italic>10027 showed that two mini-chromosomes of about 1&#x000a0;Mb and 750&#x000a0;Kb were unique to <italic>Fv</italic>10027 while a mini-chromosome of about 400&#x000a0;Kb to <italic>Fv</italic>7600. To determine the presence of these mini chromosomes in the Italian <italic>Fv</italic> population, 24 strains, sampled in the Po valley, were sequenced; presence/absence analysis showed that only three <italic>Fv</italic> strains had those chromosomes. The analysis of <italic>Fv</italic>10027 dispensable chromosomes showed an enrichment of secreted proteins and a higher level of repetitive elements. Intriguingly, BLAST analysis on the <italic>Fv</italic>10027 proteome showed that proteins codified on mini chromosomes have the best identity to <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> proteins located at dispensable chr3 and chr6.

</p><p id="Par204"><italic>Venturia inaequalis</italic> (Cooke) G. Winter is known to be responsible for apple scab, a very harmful disease reported in almost all apple-growing regions worldwide. Apple industry constitutes an important cornerstone for the economy of Trentino (northern Italy). As the demand for a reduction of chemical treatments in agriculture is increasing, the development of resistant cultivars plays a crucial role. During the late summer of 2018 and 2019, atypical symptoms of apple scab were observed on a resistant cultivar carrying the <italic>Vf</italic> resistance gene to <italic>V. inaequalis</italic>. Symptoms were observed in a commercial orchard in Adige Valley. To identify the pathogen involved in this symptomatology, small pieces of brownish suberose patches (collected from fruits) and dusty patches (collected from leaf tissue) were plated on potato dextrose agar. DNA was extracted from mycelia originated from monoconidial cultures and the ITS region was amplified using the primer Vasp (5&#x02032;&#x02010;GTCTGAGAAACAAGTAATAG&#x02010;3&#x02032;), specific for <italic>Venturia asperata</italic> Samuels &#x00026; Sivan., in combination with ITS4. Amplicons of the expected size were generated, gel purified, and sequenced (MT459450 and MT459451). A BLAST search was performed in the NCBI database and one isolate showed 100% of identity with <italic>V. asperata</italic>. These data suggest that, besides <italic>V. inaequalis</italic>, another species of <italic>Venturia</italic> may occur in Trentino region, confirming what has already been reported in France, Emilia Romagna and Piedmont. The presence of <italic>V. asperata</italic>, which causes a minor disease so far, might represent an emerging problem on apple tree. Epidemiological studies on a wider scale could improve the knowledge of this Ascomycetes, leading to specific control strategies aimed reducing fruit losses especially in sustainable and organic orchards, where treatments against apple scab are usually reduced.</p><p id="Par205"><bold><italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic></bold>

</p><p id="Par208"><italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (<italic>Fo</italic>) is a soil dwelling fungal ascomycete and the causal agent of wilt disease in a large number of economically important crops. A crucial step for plant infection relies on hyphal-mediated penetration of epidermal root cells. In order to identify if chemical or physical stimuli trigger <italic>Fo</italic> invasive growth we characterized <italic>Fo</italic> penetration using different nutrient sources, plate orientations or cellulose-based poreless membranes (cellophane) or chemically inert membranes of known pore size (nylon; 0.45&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m and 0.22&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m).

Interestingly, we observed that while <italic>Mpk1</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>Hog1</italic>&#x00394; knock-out mutants did not show differential growth and penetration compared to the wt strain, the <italic>Fmk1</italic>&#x00394; MAPK mutant poorly penetrated through 0.22&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m pores and failed to penetrate poreless membranes, suggesting that the FMK1 MAPK pathway might be involved in hyphal differentiation. <italic>Fo</italic> invasion was not altered on cellophane membranes in a <italic>Clr1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, lacking a major cellulase regulator, or on membranes laid on both poor or rich media. Moreover, <italic>Fo</italic> could efficiently penetrate artificial membranes irrespective of plate orientation (upright, vertical or upside-down position).

</p><p id="Par216"><italic>Phytophthora</italic> is considered an important pathogen on walnut, on which it causes severe losses. Several <italic>Phytophthora</italic> spp. are known to attack walnut, causing root and collar rot followed by die-back, among these <italic>Phytophthora cinnamomi</italic> is considered the most virulent and widespread in southern Europe. Accurate pathogen identification has critical implications for control and host management. For tree cultivation, for which diagnosis in plant is usually tardive, pathogen identification in soil could be very useful for an early detection since this could allow control of primary sources of infection. A series of different protocols has been set up for identification of Phytophthoras in soil at different levels: from generic identification to specific identification and quantification. A first PCR-based method has been set up for identification of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> spp. in soils of walnut orchards: studies have been performed on different depths and distances from walnut tree for the most significant conditions for soil sampling. Another method was used to identify different species of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> present in soil, based on nested-PCR. In soil of walnut orchards in northern Italy, this method confirm the predominant presence of <italic>Phytophthora cinnamomi</italic>. Finally, a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method has been set up for direct detection and quantification of <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic> on plant tissue, and soil samples. This method allows the detection of <italic>P. cinnamomi</italic> in soil prior to plantation/cultivation to prevent future damage.

The reduced expression level of <italic>PvDCL1</italic> and <italic>PvDCL2</italic> transcripts in infected leaves, treated with <italic>PvDCL1/2</italic> dsRNA, was an indication of an active RNA interference mechanism inside the pathogen to compromise its virulence. Besides the protective property, the <italic>PvDCL1/2</italic> dsRNA also exhibited a curative role by reducing the disease progress rate of already established infection. Our data provide a promising future for <italic>PvDCL1/2</italic> dsRNA as a new generation of RNA-based resistant plants or RNA-based agrochemical for the management of downy mildew disease in grapevine.</p><p id="Par222">

</p><p id="Par226">Rice blast, caused by <italic>Pyricularia oryzae</italic>, is one of the most important rice diseases worldwide. Each year it causes globally 30% yield losses, threatening thus global food security. Rice blast management relies heavily on fungicides, however, due to more and more restrictive legislation and increasing problems with fungicide resistance, a very limited spectrum of chemical control means is available. Therefore, there is an urgent need to search for and develop new efficient control strategies.</p><p id="Par227">Biological control is nowadays well accepted alternative to control plant pathogens in agriculture and among different biological control agents (BCA), <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. have been among the most successful microorganisms in disease management. Here, two strains of <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp., BCA20 and BCA21, were isolated as plate contaminants inhibiting fungal growth. Their activity was tested by dual-culture assay against 15 strains of <italic>Pyricularia oryzae</italic>. BCA20 showed overall higher activity, it inhibited the radial growth of the tested strains on average by 85% and the mycelium growth area by almost 52%. The activity of BCA21 was approximately 20% lower than that of BCA20. The multi-locus gene identification based on eight genes (16S, ilvD, glpF, pta, purH, pycA, rpoD and tpiA) identified BCA20 as <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and BCA21 as <italic>B. halotolerans</italic>. The activity of the two strains on the germination and growth of rice plants as well as their biocontrol activity <italic>in vivo</italic> is being investigated.</p><p id="Par228">

</p><p id="Par231">Several families and genera of fungal plant pathogens, such as Botryosphaeriaceae and <italic>Colletotrichum</italic>, encompass species behaving as saprobes, endophytes or latent pathogens and shifting to a pathogenic lifestyle when environmental conditions are favorable or the host-plant is stressed, which often occurs as a consequence of traumatic events or extreme weather conditions. Usually, these fungi are generalist pathogens and can be regarded as opportunistic yet aggressive invaders. In particular, for the Botryosphaeriaceae, it was demonstrated they produce an arsenal of non host-specific phytotoxins which act as virulence factors. It is expected that the frequency and severity of diseases, caused by these fungi, will increase as a consequence of climate change and several evidence confirmed this trend. Two case-studies are here reported which exemplify well this type of plant diseases, bot gummosis and twig and shoot dieback of citrus, whose causal agents in southern Italy were identified as <italic>Neofusicoccum parvum</italic> and <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> spp., respectively.</p><p id="Par232"><bold>The good, the bad and the ugly: how volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by</bold>

</p><p id="Par235"><italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. are among the most widespread soil microorganisms and have been widely used as biological control agents against phytopathogens. <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. are known to produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that play crucial roles in the inter-kingdom communications and biological control mechanisms. Several studies highlighted the importance of <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. as an alternative strategy against grapevine pathogens, but no information is available on the possible biological control mechanisms mediated by <italic>Trichoderma</italic> VOCs against grapevine downy mildew (caused by <italic>Plasmopara viticola</italic>). The aim of this study was to characterize VOCs produced by three <italic>Trichoderma</italic> strains and to investigate their effects against grapevine downy mildew. VOCs produced by <italic>Trichoderma asperellum</italic> T34, <italic>T. harzianum</italic> T39, and <italic>T. atroviride</italic> SC1 reduced downy mildew symptoms on grapevine leaf disks. A head space&#x02013;solid phase microextraction gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry analysis revealed 31 VOCs in two independent experiments, including alkenes, ketones, pyrones, furanes and terpenes. Five reduced downy mildew symptoms on grapevine leaf disks. In particular, 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one and 2-pentylfuran increased the accumulation of callose and enhanced the modulation of defense-related genes after <italic>P. viticola</italic> inoculation, indicating an induction of grapevine defense mechanisms. Moreover, one 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one activated the hypersensitive response after <italic>P. viticola</italic> inoculation to reinforce the grapevine defense reaction. These results indicate that <italic>Trichoderma</italic> VOCs can induce grapevine resistance and these molecules will be further characterized to better clarify the mode of action against grapevine downy mildew.</p><p id="Par236">

On artificially inoculated fruit, infections of these pathogens were almost completely inhibited on citrus, apples, olives and grape, respectively. The most effective extracts (B1, B5 and B9) also exhibited a curative activity and reduced the incidence of rots caused by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> on tomatoes and by <italic>Monilinia fructigena</italic> on apricots, when applied 6 and 24&#x000a0;h after inoculation of the pathogens. Furthermore, a significant reduction of rots caused by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> on tomatoes and <italic>M. fructigena</italic> on apricots was achieved on artificially inoculated fruits without a direct contact between extracts and pathogens, indicating the activation of defence responses in treated host tissues. In both host/pathogen combinations rots were completely inhibited by extracts at 12&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml dry matter when applied 12 and 24&#x000a0;h before the pathogen but a significant reduction of rots was also achieved by inoculating the pathogen immediately after the extract (0&#x000a0;h), suggesting a very quick host response. Finally, extracts significantly reduced natural rots under semi-commercial conditions on both olives and sweet cherries. Although further investigations are needed to evaluate the composition and safety of tested extracts their high efficacy, direct antifungal activity, induction of resistance, and both preventive and curative activity are important features suggesting a possible implementation as natural preparations to control postharvest diseases.</p><p id="Par240"><bold>First detection of</bold>

</p><p id="Par243">The quality of Sicilian olive oils is worldwide recognized. This region produces about 16% of the Italian production of olive oil. Anthracnose, caused by species of <italic>Colletotrichum</italic>, is considered the most serious worldwide olive fruit disease and compromises oil quality. Anthracnose has been sporadically detected in Sicily; however, the climatic changes and new agronomic practices are increasing this disease's risk. In each olive-growing region control measures depend on identifying the species of <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> and the resistance of local cultivars to the pathogen. During 2018 and 2019, 137 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> strains were isolated on rotten fruits from olive trees grown in the International Olive Germplasm Collection (IOGC) of Villa Zagaria (Enna). The isolates were morphologically separated into two species complexes: <italic>C. acutatum</italic> or <italic>C. gloeosporioide</italic>s. Subsequently, eight isolates were phylogenetically identified as <italic>C. acutatum</italic> (P77, P185, B13-16, 105B, 177B, 237&#x02013;5), <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> (C2.1) and <italic>C. cigarro</italic> (Perg6B) using a multilocus analysis approach (loci ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and TUB2). In fruit pathogenicity assays, the three <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> species caused the typical fruit rot symptoms in 11 Sicilian cultivars, although there were significant differences among species, cultivars, and their interaction. Overall, the virulence of the pathogen species was <italic>C. acutatum</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;<italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;<italic>C. cigarro.</italic> Cultivar response under field conditions showed that the disease severity and fruit-rot incidence were positively correlated.

In this study, the efficacy of alternative products was evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic>, in growth chamber, in open field and in postharvest at cold and ambient temperature. Mineral fertilizers, basic substances, plant extracts and biological control agents were able to inhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> the mycelial growth with variable efficacy. Products, evaluated in growth chamber trials on citrus fruit, significantly reduced disease incidence and severity, but showed lower efficacy than copper. Two mineral fertilizers, one citrus essential oil and chitosan were tested in open field on oranges cultivar Tarocco Scir&#x000e8;. Products, applied 3 times, were as effective as copper in reducing disease incidence, and chitosan gave the best results showing to be more effective than copper. Healthy fruits were collected after the second and third field treatment and stored 20&#x000a0;days at 6&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 10&#x000a0;days at 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

Although under high disease pressure conditions, field applications of alternative products significantly reduced the incidence of citrus anthracnose in pre-harvest and post-harvest. On the whole, tested products can represent a good alternative to copper compounds in the view of the future limitation on its use.</p><p id="Par249">

</p><p id="Par257">Plants produce and emit a large variety of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that play multiple roles including interactions with other organisms. The role of emitted VOCs in insect-plant interaction is widely studied, whereas information on VOCs role in plant-pathogen interaction is more elusive. We measured changes in volatilome and proteome in two different bean (<italic>Phaseoulus vulgaris</italic> L.) genotypes, the susceptible Negro San Luis (NSL) and the moderately resistant Flor de Junio Marcela (FJM), infected by the anthracnose agent <italic>Colletotrichum lindemuthianum</italic>, an hemibiotrophic fungus and a major bean pathogen damaging leaves, stems and pods. Our results confirm the high susceptibility of NSL and a good resistance of FJM to <italic>C. lindemuthianum</italic> strain 1088, and indicate differences at both proteome and volatilome levels between the two genotypes, before and after the infection, and possibly different strategies of defence. The moderately resistant genotype contrasted pathogen invasion mainly by maintaining epidermal and cell wall structure and, probably, by reducing stomatal gas-exchanges. The susceptible genotype did not limit early stages of pathogen infection. Rather, this genotype activated a wide range of defensive biochemical responses, involving release of VOCs and induction of hypersensitivity, as indicated by enhanced synthesis of Green Leaf Volatiles (GLVs) and salicylic acid. Proteomic investigation provided a general framework for these evidences, whereas observed changes in the volatilome suggested that VOCs may principally represent stress markers rather than defensive compounds per se.</p><p id="Par258">

To this scope, plant roots were dipped into a <italic>For</italic> conidial suspension (10<sup>6</sup> conidia mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and disease incidence (DI), disease severity (DSI) and the pathogen quantification (qPCR) were assessed on plants 5, 10 and 15&#x000a0;days post infection (dpi). At the end of the experiment, the total number of infected plants resulted symptomatic (DI&#x02009;=&#x02009;100%) with DSI average&#x02009;=&#x02009;80%. Due to the disease, a slight reflectance decrease in the near-infrared region (700&#x02013;1,000&#x000a0;nm) at 5 dpi and a dramatic decline along the 400&#x02013;1,000&#x000a0;nm range in the next time-points, were observed. Consistently with the phenotypic and hyperspectral observations, a scaling up of pathogen DNA was detected over time. Hyperspectral dataset, consisting of 27,000 pixel-observations randomly sampled on healthy and infected plants at different infection stages, was equally split between calibration and testing. Then, it was submitted to the ML algorithm Extreme Gradient Bosting. High predictive performance in discriminating healthy from infected individuals was found, providing non-invasive detection of the infection. Interestingly, on the bases of few most informative bands from the 5 dpi dataset, the predictive model was able to early detect the disease, allowing timely curative treatments.</p><p id="Par268">

Commercial cultivars are susceptible to a number of pathogenic microorganisms that cause diseases, affecting grape and wine quality. One of the most important diseases in <italic>V. vinifera</italic> is the downy mildew, caused by <italic>Plasmopara viticola</italic>, the control of which currently requires the repeated application of chemicals. In some cases, unsuitable agricultural practices result in level of pesticide residues in or on grapes at the moment of harvest higher than the level authorized by regulation. Even the use of the permitted formulations containing copper-based compounds causes several negative effects on the environment and have resulted in copper level increase in vineyard soil and grape berry, thus affecting wine quality. The development and use of novel natural compounds in vineyard to control pathogens can address many environmental and social concerns and offer innovative and economically viable opportunities for growers, consumers, policymakers in the entire wine system. In the frame of the EU Life project Plants4Plants, Landlab srl developed a natural extract, obtained directly from plants, which showed a significant efficacy in protecting tomato, potato and grapevine plants in the field.

CVEV, first described in Spain, is reported in several citrus growing areas of Asia, America and Australia and it is considered as a quarantine pest in several Mediterranean and American countries. A high-throughput sequencing-based study of the virome associated with citrus trees in the Campania region (southern Italy) allowed the identification of this virus, for the first time in Italy, in a non-symptomatic <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> tree. The full-genome sequence of the CVEV Italian isolate was determined and the sequence variability of the infecting virus population characterized. Phylogenetic relationships according with their geographic origin were observed between the currently sequenced CVEV isolates. The presence of CVEV was further confirmed by RT-PCR and by graft-transmission to indicator plants. A field survey revealed the presence of CVEV in different areas of Campania region, mainly in lemon trees, and allowed the identification of kumquat (<italic>C. japonica</italic>) as a novel natural host of the virus. Symptoms of VE and WG reported to be induced by CVEV in some citrus species were not observed in the surveyed plants, opening a relevant question of the role of symptomless hosts in the epidemiology of the virus. This point is even more relevant if the transmission of the virus mediated by aphids in a persistent manner is taken into consideration.</p><p id="Par281">

</p><p id="Par284">Citrus concave gum-associated virus (CCGaV) is the type member of the genus <italic>Coguvirus</italic> (family <italic>Phleboviridae</italic>). This negative-stranded RNA virus with a bipartite genome, first identified in citrus trees in southern Italy, was closely associated with concave gum, a citrus virus-like disease. In 2018, CCGaV has been reported in apple trees, in a germplasm collection in USA and in a field in Brazil, respectively. The association of CCGaV with symptoms in apple trees remains unclear, as well as the questions about the virus variability, prevalence and distribution, both in field and in vegetative propagation material. To conclusively answer to these questions, fast, reliable and cost-effective detection methods are needed. We previously proposed methods based on RT-PCR to detect CCGaV. Here, data on sensitivity, specificity and reliability of serological tests (double-antibody-sandwich assay, DAS-ELISA, and direct tissue blot immunoassay, DTBIA), performed using a polyclonal antibody against a fragment of the CCGaV nucleocapsid protein, are presented. Field surveys, carried out comparing serological and molecular assays, further validated DAS-ELISA tests for both citrus and apple trees and DTBIA for citrus trees, thus showing that they could be used for further implementing citrus and apple certification programs. This study also allowed identifying CCGaV in several apple cultivars in Italy for the first time. The full length genomic sequence of one CCGaV apple isolate was determined by high-throughput sequencing and the sequence variability of the proteins encoded by several apple and citrus CCGaV isolates was investigated, providing an overview on the phylogenetic relationships between the viral isolates.</p><p id="Par285">

</p><p id="Par288">Concepts about the plant-pathogen interactions and coevolution have overwhelmingly focused on an arms race at scales of time that are not always well specified. Microorganisms have co-existed with plants since plants have colonized landmasses over 450 million years ago &#x02013; and even earlier. However, little research on plant-microbe interactions has addressed that scale of time. If we took a long-term evolutionary perspective of the life history of plant pathogens into account, what new insight could we have for managing plant health? In this talk I will explore these questions. Firstly, I will present a short reminder of the main evolutionary events of life on Earth that led up to the colonization of landmasses by plants. Then I will address the questions of the progress of plant microbe interactions - if they have evolved towards more intimate or more peripheral interactions and if this has involved a loss or gain of functions. I will highlight the major biological outcomes of plant-microbe interactions including the origin of roots, creation of soil, access to habitats and recalcitrant nutrients, and genetic diversification of plants. To illustrate the insights into epidemiology, emergence and management of plant disease procured from a long-term evolutionary perspective I will present 3 cases: 1) The emergence of several important diseases in the Myrtaceae family suggests how phylogenetic signals in the host range of pathogens and their closest relatives could help establish precautions when expanding the range of crops. 2) The time of divergence and host range of <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> suggest that life history across the full evolutionary age of a pathogen can orient strategies for anticipating its emergence, giving a greater window of time to intervene with prophylactic measures rather than eradication. 3) The evolutionary age of traits that shape the basic ecology of pathogens, such as ice nucleation activity in <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, can explain the inherent adaptability and ubiquity of a pathogen and orient surveillance toward habitats to which it has been linked for much longer than its association with agriculture. I conclude by proposing that &#x0201c;arms race&#x0201d; might not be the most useful framework for understanding the molecular evolution of plant-pathogen interactions and that &#x0201c;diplomacy&#x0201d; might be a more robust concept.</p><p id="Par289"><bold>The barley immune receptor</bold>

</p><p id="Par297">Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) are cysteins-rich peptides ubiquitous in plant kingdom. They play multiple roles as hormone signals and recently their involvement in host&#x02013;pathogen crosstalk as negative regulator of immunity in Arabidopsis has also been recognized. In addition, RALF homologue peptides are secreted by different fungal pathogens as effectors during early stages of infections. The aim of this work was to characterize RALF genes as susceptibility factors during plant pathogen interaction in strawberry. For this, the genomic organization of the RALF gene families in the octoploid and diploid strawberries were described, identifying 13 member in <italic>Fragaria vesca</italic> (FvRALF) and 50 members in <italic>F</italic>. x <italic>ananassa</italic> (FaRALF). The changes in expression of fruit FaRALF genes was investigated upon infection with <italic>Colletotrichum acutatum</italic> and <italic>Botrytis&#x000a0;cinerea </italic> showing that, among RALF genes expressed in fruit, FaRALF3 was the only one upregulated by fungal infection in the ripe stage. A role of FaRALF3 as susceptibility gene was then assessed trough <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transient FaRALF3 overexpression and silencing in fruits, revealing that FaRALF3 expression promotes fungal growth and hyphae penetration in host tissues. In silico analysis was used to identify distinct pathogen inducible elements upstream of the FaRALF3 gene. Agroinfiltration of strawberry fruit with deletion constructs of the FaRALF3 promoter identified a 5&#x02019; region required for FaRALF3 expression in fruit, but failed to identify a region responsible for fungal induced expression. Furthermore, FaRALF3 and strawberry receptor FERONIA (FaMRLK47) were heterologously expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in order to purify active proteins forms and study RALF-FERONIA interaction in strawberry.</p><p id="Par298">

During the last three years, stem rust symptoms were reported also in Tuscany, initially only on some cultivars with low incidence and low severity, but in 2021 all the cultivars monitored showed stem rust symptoms with an incidence ranging from 25 to 100%. For this reason we started a collaboration with the RustWatch project, a consortium of researchers and plant pathologists led by the Global Rust Reference Center at Aarhus University in Denmark, to contribute setting up an early-warning system of wheat rusts by monitoring and sampling wheat cvs to provide a better understanding of the epidemic and determine the rust races present in the different countries and regions respectively. For this purpose some cvs were sown both in Tuscany and Sicily 1) to follow the appearance of rust symptoms in different climatic and soil conditions, 2) to evaluate the perspectives of an early warning system coordinated between Sicily and Tuscany, and 3) to assess the races present on the same cvs in so different region.</p><p id="Par303">

</p><p id="Par318">Esca is recognized by many authors as a complex of diseases. In the field, vines older than 3&#x000a0;years can show the typical foliar symptoms, characterized by chloro-necrotic interveinal discoloration, which in older vines is usually associated with white rot, in Europe mainly caused by <italic>Fomitiporia mediterranea</italic>. Trunk surgery, i.e. the removal of rotten tissue by a precision chainsaw, has been recently confirmed to be able to reduce the appearance of foliar symptoms in vines affected by Esca proper (foliar symptoms&#x02009;+&#x02009;white rot). Metagenomic studies on microbiome changes following trunk surgery showed that <italic>F. mediterranea</italic> was the only species significantly reduced in the remaining sound tissue following removal of the decayed tissue. Based on this observation an in-depth study was developed on the wood degradation mechanisms implemented by the fungus that could also be shared by other fungi associated with the foliar symptoms in young vines without wood rot. With the aim of shedding light on these mechanisms, several <italic>F. mediterranea</italic> strains have been studied for their enzymatic activity such as laccase, manganese peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase also relating them to laccase and manganese peroxidase gene expression. Analysis of the residual polymers by acid digestion of degraded wood and a SEM analysis of the wood samples supported the data on enzymatic activity.</p><p id="Par319">

</p><p id="Par322">Plants interact with a plethora of microbes both aboveground and belowground. The totality of these microbes and their activities are referred to as plant microbiome. Many of these microbes can provide the plants with benefits such as nutrient uptake, growth promotion and disease resistance. An imbalance in microbial load and composition along the plant, known as dysbiosis, can result in pathogen proliferation and disease. Plants can modulate their microbiome through the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, such as coumarins. Production of coumarins relies on the activity of the root specific transcription factor MYB72 that is also indispensable for the onset of induced systemic resistance (ISR). Another component of ISR, BGLU42 is important for coumarin exudation in the rhizosphere where a beneficial microbiome is assembled. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing BGLU42 display a constitutive ISR phenotype. Therefore, coumarins seem to have a role both in roots but also in leaves where ISR is expressed. Here, we aim to study their role in the bidirectional communication between roots and shoots and in shaping the phyllosphere microbiome during ISR (microbiome-root-shoot axis). Our preliminary results show that coumarins are not produced only in roots but also in leaves of plants colonized by beneficial rhizobacteria. It is possible therefore that presence or absence of coumarins in the leaves could affect microbiome assembly and the resistance output of ISR. Therefore, our goal is to study the role of coumarins as signaling molecules during ISR and their involvement in preventing dysbiosis by modulating the microbial homeostasis in the phyllosphere.</p><p id="Par323">

</p><p id="Par341">The outcome of host&#x02013;pathogen interactions is assumed to be largely dictated by offensive or defensive capabilities of both players. A huge effort has been made to provide advances in the study of bacterial host specificity and virulence through the comparative analysis of bacterial genomes and, in plant-<italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> interactions, several virulence factors contributing to early bacterial pathogenicity have been studied in great details, including the type III secretion system (T3SS), which requires an activating signal before it can be competent for the secretion of virulence effectors, in particular plant signal(s) and multiple physiological and environmental factors. However, the scenario seems more complexed since we recently demonstrated that different biovars of the kiwifruit pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>actinidiae</italic> (Psa) display a different transcriptional responsiveness in apoplast-like medium, directly correlated to biovar aggressiveness. The further transcriptome profiling of Psa biovar 3 (Psa3) incubated in minimal medium showed the enhancement of TTSS-related gene expression in presence of kiwifruit or tomato leaf extracts after only 1&#x000a0;h, suggesting that the interaction with host plants anticipates TTSS stimulation. In accordance with the necessity of phytopathogenic bacteria to overcome TTSS restriction by plant basal defenses, we showed that TTSS enhancement by plant extracts allows Psa3 to induce TTSS activity <italic>in planta</italic>, as revealed by the induction of a temperature-dependent hypersensitive response in the non-host plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col-0. Overall, our results indicate that in the plant-bacteria arms race, one fundamental parameter governing interaction outcome is likely the timing of bacterial virulence vs. plant defense induction.</p><p id="Par342"><bold><italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic></bold>

</p><p id="Par357">Olive knot disease, caused by <italic>Pseudomonas savastanoi</italic> pv. <italic>savastanoi,</italic> is one of the most damaging disease to olive trees. The epidemiological cycle of the bacterium is characterized by a saprophytic phase on olive tree phylloplane, from which it can be disseminated at short distances by splashing rain, windblown aerosols, insects and agronomic practices. However, the mechanisms of pathogen spread and the subsequent appearance of the symptoms on olive trees is poorly understood yet. To date, no olive cultivars have been proved to be completely resistant to olive knot, and only few olive cultivars have been investigated for their susceptibility to this disease. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of olive knot disease on the accessions of the field collection of Mirto Crosia (Cosenza province, Italy), where 458 olive cultivars and 138 accessions are grown on 9&#x000a0;ha. Field monitoring was conducted on four consecutive years on all cultivars of the collection. The incidence of olive knot was visually assessed with an ordinal disease scale quantifying the intensity of tubercles, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (tubercles widespread on the entire plant of an undetectable extension). Preliminary results indicated that most susceptible cultivars were 'Gentile dell'Aquila', 'Moresca', and 'Giarraffa', whereas &#x02018;Coratina&#x02019;, &#x02018;Nocellara etnea&#x02019; and &#x02018;FS17&#x02019; did not show any symptoms of olive knot throughout the assessment period.</p><p id="Par358">

</p><p id="Par362"><italic>Scaphoideus titanus</italic> Ball is an ampelophagous leafhopper (Cicadellidae: Deltocephalinae), mainly known as the vector of the Flavescence dor&#x000e9;e (FD) phytoplasma throughout most viticultural European countries. Considering its efficient ability to sustain FD epidemics and spread, an experimental design was set up to investigate differences in its probing behavior, putatively ascribed to different grapevine varieties. In order to reach this aim, the Electrical Penetration Graphs (EPG) technique was applied. EPG permits a fine description of leaf-hidden probing behavior of sap-sucking insects, enabling a fine dissection of the nutrition of these herbivorous insects. Three grapevine cultivars were selected for their evident differential susceptibility to FD: Barbera as FD-highly susceptible, Brachetto and Moscato as FD-poorly susceptible. Results showed significant differences in the duration of the overall phloem sap ingestion, with a considerable fraction of time spent in phloem nutrition on Barbera. Interestingly, no main differences were highlighted in the phases previous to the reach of the phloem. Moreover, phloematic salivation events were less frequent but numerically higher in Barbera. These results suggest a preference for Barbera, and pair with Barbera higher susceptibility to FD. As Barbera was found as the most suitable cultivar, <italic>S. titanus</italic> Moscato-related probing behavior showed the most disturbed profile. In particular, less durable phloem ingestions and more frequent salivations may suggest the presence of antixenotic compounds that actively interfere with <italic>S. titanus</italic> nutrition. The implications of the results could lead to a focused resistance to the leafhopper, opening more sustainable ways for these pest limitations.</p><p id="Par363">

</p><p id="Par366">Flavescence dor&#x000e9;e (FD) is a quarantine disease of grapevines caused by a phytoplasma representing one of the most serious limiting factors to viticulture in many European areas. So far, as no genes involved in resistance to FD have been yet identified, the management of FD is based exclusively on preventive control strategies, such as mandatory insecticide treatments and replacement of infected plants with certified plant material. The knowledge of plant defense mechanism response to phytoplasma infection would help identify new sustainable strategies for FD control. To this goal, in the present work, the model system&#x000a0;<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>/FD phytoplasma/<italic>Euscelidius variegatus</italic> have been used to identify the plant metabolic pathways altered by phytoplasma infection. A set of genes involved in defense to FD phytoplasma was identified, and their role was further investigated by using knockout mutants in a reverse genetics approach.</p><p id="Par367">Several&#x000a0;<italic>A. thaliana</italic>&#x000a0;mutants, defective for genes putatively involved in response to FD, were infected to investigate the role of different metabolic pathways in resistance / tolerance to phytoplasma infection. Infection and phytoplasma multiplication rates were measured in comparison with wild type plants. Identifying genes involved in the susceptibility to infection in a model system represents a preliminary step for the characterization of genes potentially involved in the resistance to FD in grapevine.</p><p id="Par368">

</p><p id="Par371">This study aimed to investigate the potentialities of the application of a mixture made of a natural biostimulant and a fungicide at a reduced dose for the managing of post-harvest citrus green mold by <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic>. The natural biostimulant is a new formula based on seaweed (<italic>Ascophyllum nodosum</italic>) extract and plant (alfalfa and sugarcane) derivatives, while the fungicide is an Imazalil formula. The following aspects related to the application of the mixture were investigated: (i) the fruit-resistance to citrus green mold induced by post-harvest fruit treatments; (ii) the differential expression of resistance genes (&#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase-, peroxidase- and PAL-encoding genes) in fruits; (iii) the <italic>in vivo</italic> post-infectional activity in the control of citrus green mold. The residue of fungicide in peel of mixture-treated citrus fruits was also evaluated.</p><p id="Par372">Results indicated that the mixture provided the best effectiveness in terms of both induction of resistance and post-infectional antifungal activity with as a significant reduction of both incidence and severity of green mold. The expression of defense-related genes also suggested that the mixture was able to elicit a long-lasting resistance. Finally, the residual concentration of Imazalil in peel of fruits treated with mixture was far below the limit established by EU and, quite surprisingly, significantly lower than the residual concentration in fruits treated with the fungicide alone. This study provides new insight into the genetic mechanisms of disease resistance induction in citrus fruit by biostimulants and also offers new perspectives for the improvement of postharvest management strategies of citrus green mold.</p><p id="Par373">

</p><p id="Par376">The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) is responsible for developing and maintaining an internationally agreed system of hierarchical classification of viruses and naming of taxa, available to the scientific community through a website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://talk.ictvonline.org">https://talk.ictvonline.org</ext-link>) and published reports/papers.</p><p id="Par377">The taxonomic framework has been adapted over the years to reflect current knowledge on the evolution of global virosphere. The ICTV now allows the classification of viruses known only from genomic data. The expansion of taxonomic ranks beyond orders allows studies on evolutionary connections of viruses. In other biological taxonomies, species naming follows a Latinized binomial format first introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, consisting of two italicized words indicating the genus and the species epithet (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>). In contrast, viral species names did not follow a uniform format, except for a requirement to be italicized and to have the first letter of the first word capitalized. Embracing the need for a standardized format, a binomial nomenclature for virus species was ratified by the ICTV in 2021. Thus, a virus species name will consist of two italicized words, the first one being the genus name and the second one consisting of a "free-form" species epithet, composed using the standard Latin-script English alphabet containing 26 letters and/or Arabic numbers. Linnaean-style, Latinized virus species are permitted, but not mandated. Importantly, this change in nomenclature will apply to virus species only. Common virus names will not be affected and will remain unchanged.</p><p id="Par378"><bold>Survey on the persistence of</bold>

</p><p id="Par381"><italic>Plenodomus tracheiphilus</italic> is the causal agent of the most destructive lemon disease. The importance and frequency of root infections have been investigated since long time, mostly in growth chamber. By DNA hybridization and later by real-time PCR the fungal inoculum was detected in the soil. The highest fungal DNA concentrations have been detected in March-April, whilst the DNA was nearly undetectable in July and August and increased again in the period September-November. To investigate the actual persistence of the inoculum in the soil during summer a survey was carried out in southern Syracuse, the most important lemon area of Italy. Soil samples were collected on June-July 2019, in 10 orchards, under the canopy of 53 lemon trees or in the area where the dead trees were grubbed. Lemon trees of different cultivar/rootstock combinations and age were sampled. In each site four subsamples were collected, 232 in total, at 10-20 cm depth where the soil temperature was between 26-32 &#x000b0;C, assembled per tree or site and stored in a refrigerator (4 &#x000b0;C) until analyzed.

In fact, in a recent investigation, samples of fresh and dried tomatoes produced in the Apulia region (southern Italy) and sent to European markets proved to be contaminated by <italic>Alternaria</italic> spp. and related mycotoxins. These finding prompted the assessment of the contamination by mycotoxigenic fungi of tomatoes cultivated in a conducive (warm and humid) environment as the greenhouse, which is growing in popularity to counteract seasonality and extreme weather events.

</p><p id="Par408">Grapevine Pinot gris virus (GPGV; genus <italic>Trichovirus</italic>) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus infecting grapevine and associated with stunting, chlorotic mottling and leaf deformation. Symptomatic (S) and asymptomatic (A) plants are usually identified by visual approach in the field, while the virus detection is carried out by molecular test (RT-PCR). To detect out infected plants with an early and non-destructive analysis, the use of fluorescence analysis by a proximal sensor was tested. Monitoring was performed in a Vermentino vineyard (Olmedo, Sardinia, Italy) Guyot trained to characterize GPGV disease symptoms. In the summer 2021, 50 leaves by respective plants were tested by RT-PCR (Invitrogen) and classified in two groups: 20 plants A and 30 S. The same leaves were tested by a fluorometric proximal sensor, Multiplex 3.6 (FORCE-A, Orsay, France) using these indices: Sample Fluorescence Ratio (SFR_RG), linked to chlorophyll content; FLAV, linked to flavonols content; FER_RG, correlated to anthocyanins content devoid of chlorophyll. These indices were analysed in a statistical software (RStudio) by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical differences between the A and S plants were found using only the FER_RG index. It has been observed that this index is significantly higher in S plants, indicating a lower chlorophyll content than in the A plants. By performing the inverse of the FER_RG index (FER_RG^<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), the corresponding index relating to the content of chlorophyll was obtained, which identifies a higher index in asymptomatic plants than in symptomatic ones.</p><p id="Par409">

Most common agricultural practices associated to hazelnut orchards management are suckering and pruning, while shelling is required in post-harvest phase to process fruits. Results of these cultural practices consist in huge amount of lignocellulosic biomasses, whose only enhancement today is the energetic one. Many researchers have already highlighted how agroindustrial wastes can be exploited to obtain novel sustainable compounds. Due to their antimicrobial and antioxidants properties, as well as the possibility of acting as carriers for bioactive molecules, engineered organic nanomaterials could open new scenarios in defining innovative green strategies in crop diseases management. Among them lignocellulosic nanocarriers, such as cellulose nanocrystals and lignin nanoparticles, are some of the most promising in terms of potential utilization in sustainable plant protection strategies. The aim of our work was to investigate the possibility of extracting cellulose and lignin from hazelnut pruning residues and shells, in order to synthetize cellulose nanocrystals through chemical bleaching followed by acid hydrolysis, and lignin nanoparticles through ethanolic fractionaction followed by solvent exchange protocol. Obtained nanocarriers were morphologically characterized while, at the same time, their biocompatibility on hazelnut plants and their antimicrobial activity was <italic>in vitro</italic> assessed respect to the causal agent of the hazelnut bacterial blight of hazelnut, <italic>Xanthomonas arboricola</italic> pv. <italic>corylina</italic>.

</p><p id="Par416">The development of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has revolutionized the research on plant-associated pathogens. Several citrus virus and viroids have been fully sequenced by HTS, and many are still pending. Recently, two negative-stranded RNA, bipartite viruses, citrus concave gum-associated virus (CCGaV) and citrus virus A (CiVA) have been associated with citrus concave gum and citrus impietratura diseases, respectively, whilst other virus sequences similar to CCGaV and CiVA have been detected in citrus trees affected by cristacortis and impietratura. Each of these diseases induce typical symptoms on trunk and/or fruits and all of them induce leaf flecking and mosaic-like symptoms resembling psorosis, Hence, in the past all of them where considered member of the &#x0201c; psorosis group&#x0201d; diseases. Officially, EU legislation on regulated non quarantine pests (RNQP) indicates only citrus cristacortis and citrus impietratura should be absent in the mother trees of certified propagation material, while the &#x0201c;Qualit&#x000e0; Italia&#x0201d; certification program of citrus includes also concave gum. To investigate systematically on such group of diseases, we have surveyed old citrus orchards in eastern Sicily and collected several clones affected by clear symptoms of concave gum, blind pocket, psorosis, ringspot, impietratura and cristacortis. All of them have been propagated in a glasshouse repository to better correlate symptoms with bioassays and molecular testing. Testing of symptomatic accessions has revealed some samples are singly infected by citrus psorosis virus, citrus concave gum associated virus, or citrus virus A, and some carry mixed virus infections. The full sequencing could be useful to clarify the association with specific symptoms and/or their relationship (if any).</p><p id="Par417">

Among their secondary metabolites, peptaibols are helical, antimicrobial peptides structurally stable even under extreme pH and temperature conditions. The promise of peptaibols as agrochemicals is however hampered by poor water solubility, which inhibits efficient delivery for practical use in crop protection. Using a versatile synthetic strategy, based on green chemistry procedures, we produced water-soluble peptaibol analogs of the 11-mer lipopeptaibol trichogin GA IV, naturally produced by <italic>Trichoderma longibrachiatum</italic>.</p><p id="Par422">These newly synthesized peptides were tested against the important plant pathogens <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and <italic>Plasmopara viticola</italic>. Compared to native trichogin, which was inactive against the tested pathogens, some peptide analogs resulted particularly effective at low micromolar concentrations against both pathogens, while others were effective only against one of them.</p><p id="Par423">The most effective peptides significantly reduced disease symptoms by <italic>P. viticola</italic> on grapevine leaves and by <italic>B. cinerea</italic> on grapevine leaves, ripe grape berries and tomato leaves. Our results suggest that trichogin-derived peptides do not prime plant defenses but protect plant tissues by inhibiting spore germination on the host surface. An in-depth conformational analysis featuring a 3D-structure-activity relationship study indicated that the relative spatial position of cationic residues in the sequence is crucial for increasing peptide fungicidal activity. Besides, effective peptides maintain the right-handed helical structure even in the presence of the pathogen. Further studies will help clarify the mode of action of these antimicrobial peptides.</p><p id="Par424">

</p><p id="Par439">Recently novel strategies based on the use of RNA interference (RNAi) are rising up in the crop protection scenario. Spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS) is a potential strategy for plant disease management, whereby nucleotide sequence-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can be sprayed onto a crop and it could represent a potential alternative to conventional fungicides. SIGS could give rise to transient silencing without producing genetically modified organisms (GMO) neither requiring transformation method for plants. Nevertheless, the instability of naked dsRNA sprayed on plants is a major challenge towards its practical application. To overcome this limiting aspect, nanocarriers for dsRNA delivery can be used to extend its stability and durability.

</p><p id="Par444">Apple fruits are susceptible to postharvest rots caused by different fungal genera. Some emerging diseases, such as white haze and dry lenticel rot, result in reducing fruit quality and their epidemiology is poorly understood. In recent years, metabarcoding has been extensively used to characterize microbial complexity in apple fruit, based on cultivar, tissue and phenological phase. In this work, we sequenced the ITS2 and V4 regions for both epiphytic and endophytic samples of apple cultivars &#x02018;Opal&#x02019; and &#x02018;Ambrosia&#x02019; to investigate the composition of fungal and bacterial communities, at different developmental stages in the orchard, at storage and shelf-life. Bioinformatic analyses of sequencing data showed significant differences in alpha diversity in the endophytic and epiphytic fungal and bacterial communities in the two apple cultivars. The differences were particularly pronounced for the fungal community samples from similar tissues over the same time points. Compositional and disease incidence data indicate that <italic>Golubevia</italic> spp. is the main causal agent of white haze and its presence in fruit tissue became significant from September. <italic>Ramularia</italic> spp., the causal agent of dry lenticel rot, is shown to have a relatively high abundance early during fruit development as part of endophytic microbiota, suggesting the earlier presence in the fruit tissue. This finding provides interesting information about the epidemiology of some postharvest pathogens, which is important to develop adequate management strategies for apple fruit pathogens.</p><p id="Par445">

Spectrometric analysis led to the identification of seven polar metabolites belonging to different chemical groups, such as coumarines, prenol lipids, flavonoids, carotenoids, fatty acids and cyclic polyols. Results showed a significant difference in relative abundance of these metabolites among treatments. The AtB-42 application, alone or in combination with T22, induced the production of petroselinic acid, while T22, alone or in combination, induced the accumulation of xanthotoxol/bergaptol and its derivative xanthotoxin/bergapthen.

Then the leaves fall (&#x02026;). Within one or two years, the plant dries up and dies. There is no cure.&#x0201d; (The Guardian, 2020). These sentences well describe the syndrome: KVD is related to climate change, soil conditions and soil-borne diseases. Exceptional rainfall, high temperature for many days during the summer recorded in the last years was consider the main causes of KVD. Different pathogens were isolated since 2014 in many areas, but a common agent was not identified. Neither of these factors taken alone appears to be able to lead to KVD and their combination that must be studied. The control of predisposing factors, such as water excess with the adoption of raised-beds and the optimization of irrigation, help to reduce KVD but does not solve the problem over five years in field trials. The metagenomics approach was used to elucidate the differences in microbial community composition of the soil and the root, between affected and healthy orchards. This is one of the first example where the metagenomics approach was used in a broadwide field survey for a multifactorial diseases, in order to solve an &#x0201c;unclear&#x0201d; phenomenon that are destroying an important crop in one of the main production country.</p><p id="Par459">

</p><p id="Par462">The Lamon bean is an agricultural product with protected geographical indication (PGI), whose peculiarities are specifically linked to the area of production, located in Belluno province in the Veneto region (N.E. of Italy). In the last decade, the Lamon bean has been subjected to severe epidemics caused by destructive viruses that heavily compromised its profitability. The emergence of new viruses and novel viral strain(s) has always represented the major cause of viral epidemics, causing huge crop losses and threatening crop production. In this work, the full virome of seven Lamon bean plants showing different symptoms was obtained by an HTS approach based on MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies; ONT) and analyzed <italic>in silico</italic>. Sequencing data were validated through RT-PCR and ELISA in a large number of herbaceous plants, including diverse wild species that may represent virus reservoir. Results demonstrated the presence of bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and peanut stunt virus (PSV), often detected as mixed infection. It is the first time that the presence of PSV was reported in common bean in the Mediterranean basin. Moreover, the Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic studies revealed a wide intraspecific variability of virus species detected in the Lamon area. Nanopore sequencing technology appeared to be a powerful tool in revealing the composition of virus population in Lamon beans. This would allow the development of more efficient and accurate strategies for controlling virus diseases, maintaining the economic sustainability of the Lamon bean cultivation in a context of low environmental impact.</p><p id="Par463">

</p><p id="Par466">Sequence analysis of natural isolates suggested that the wide diversity in the severity of Grapevine Leaf Mottling and Deformation (GLMD) symptoms could be related with the sequence variation of the associated&#x000a0;member of the genus <italic>Trichovirus</italic>, grapevine Pinot gris virus (GPGV). In particular, the sequence of 3&#x02019;-end of the GPGV movement protein (MP) includes non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) that discriminate between isolates found in grapevines displaying different symptoms severity. Here, the 3&#x02019;-terminus of the MP of the virulent infectious clone (pRI::GPGV<sub>VIR</sub>) derived from a grapevine showing severe symptoms, was substituted with a 356-bp synthetic fragment having a sequence resembling that an infectious clone (pRI::GPGV<sub>LAT</sub>), obtained from an asymptomatic grapevine. The resulting construct (pRI::GPGV<sub>CHIMERA</sub>) was root-inoculated in virus-free grapevines along with the parent clones. Significant differences in symptom expression, virus titre, accumulation of GPGV-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and alterations in the gene expression of boron transporters were recorded on plants inoculated with either one of the three constructs. The chimeric clone behavior was indistinguishable from that of the donor of the synthetic fragment (pRI::GPGV<sub>LAT</sub>) and significantly different from the other (pRI::GPGV<sub>VIR</sub>), confirming the critical role of the MP C-terminus in determining the fate of the GPGV infection and the GLMD-d severity. Furthermore, quantification of GPGV-derived siRNAs via RT-qPCR at the 6635-MP and 6992-CP loci, predicted as hotspots for siRNAs production, showed that the biogenesis of siRNA was more abundant at the 6635-MP locus. Therefore, this locus, which is within the MP 3&#x02019;-end fragment examined, contribute to antiviral RNA silencing to a large extent. The connections of specific siRNA biogenesis with symptoms severity deserve further investigations.</p><p id="Par467">

A set of experiments was carried out to estimate the potential risk of this pathogen to spread from food to clinical settings.

Moreover, the genomes of two representative strains of <italic>F. musae</italic> were sequenced using a using both short and long reads. Mitochondrial genome analysis confirmed the txonomic identity (100% identity at the protein level) of the strains with different host origin. The susceptibility to eight widely used agricultural azole fungicides (prochloraz, tebuconazole, epoxiconazole, difenoconazole, propiconazole, tetraconazole, flusilazole, and fenbuconazole) was furthermore investigated. The strains of human origin, in most of the cases, showed comparable ability to those of plant origin to cause rot symptoms on banana fruits and similar susceptibility to azoles.

In recent years, phytosanitary problems emerged in the above-mentioned cultivation area, making it necessary to understand the causes and find the related solution. For this reason, bulbils coming from six farms were divided into four portions (tunic, reserve tissue, root, shoot) and, for each of them, symptom observations and fungal isolations were performed. The obtained isolates were molecularly identified and, for a representative isolate of each identified species, pathogenicity was tested.

It produces several mycotoxins, in particular nivalenol (NIV). In FHB epidemiology, infection timing is important for kernel development, symptom appearance and mycotoxin accumulation. For these reasons, this study aimed to explore, both in controlled environment and in a 2-year field plot experiment in central Italy, the influence of five different bread wheat infection timings (from early anthesis to medium milk growth stage) on FP colonization and mycotoxin accumulation in the grain. FHB symptoms on heads and kernels were visually evaluated. Grain yield were determined, as was FP biomass accumulation in the grain and the chaff (by qPCR). Finally, FP secondary metabolites in the grain were analyzed by LC&#x02013;MS/MS. The climate chamber experiment showed that early infection timings (beginning to full anthesis) favoured FP colonization and mycotoxin accumulation (in particular NIV) in the grain. On the contrary, later infection timings (watery ripe kernel and medium milk growth stages) reduced FP development and mycotoxin accumulation. Differences were detected in symptom exoression in kernels as a consequence of infection timing. At each infection timing, FP biomass was higher in the chaff than in the grain. Field experiments confirmed these results. However, the time window of host susceptibility in the field was shorter than that observed in controlled conditions.</p><p id="Par479"><bold>Exploitation of the resistance/susceptibility mechanism of</bold>

However, almost a third of all food crops could be annually lost because of fungal pathogens. Furthermore, the increase in resistance phenomena in fungi pushed the search of new molecules for controlling infections and related mycotoxins. Some of the newly proposed small molecules target fungal proteins with transporter ability. However, most of mycotoxin-producing fungi, as patulin-producer <italic>Penicillium expansum</italic>, have few proteins with a solved structure to be used for identifying new inhibitors. Computational approaches for protein function analyses might help in overcoming the problem, by building 3D homology models to be used in virtual screening of chemical libraries. In the present investigation, on the basis of generated 3D comparative models, it was possible to highlight approved drugs/natural compounds/chemicals able to inhibit GMC oxidoreductase and organic acid mitochondrial transporters to control <italic>P. expansum</italic> growth and patulin production.

</p><p id="Par492">Plants reaction to abiotic and biotic stresses is often related to the production of several molecules including secondary metabolites (SMs), natural products with a significant role in plant defence mechanism against pest and pathogens. Aim of this work is to study the metabolism alterations of tobacco plants infected with alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), through a metabolomic approach based on LC&#x02013;MS-QTOF. Two AMV French isolates (subgroup II), differing for symptoms severity on host range (e.g. CarE16 necrotic on tomato, To80 causing only mosaic) were used. Two full expanded leaves were inoculated with the two AMV strains separately and subjected to SMs extraction at different days post inoculation. ELISA was used to determine the viral titre. Pronounced symptoms were observed on non-inoculated leaves as the infection progressed, in agreement with ELISA results. LC&#x02013;MS data were used for PCA analysis and showed the presence of three clusters (non-inoculated, CarE16-inoculated, To80-inoculated). Fourteen molecules (alkaloids, terpenes or phenols) were identified by comparison of mass spectra with an in-house database and showed different expression levels in inoculated plants vs controls or in CarE16-inoculated vs To80-inoculated plants. Up-regulation of metabolites related to defence (i.e. nicotine, isoraimonol, 2-ketoepimanool, 3beta,8alfa-dihydroxy-13E-labden-15-oic acid) was evident in plants infected with CarE16, that has shown to be more aggressive than To80, as expected. This approach, although preliminary, has proved to be a valid tool in improving the understanding of the complex mechanisms of viruses-plants interaction. Further investigations are underway to validate this approach in the study of the interactions of other plant-virus pathosystems.</p><p id="Par493">

Some phytopathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> and fungi such as <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> and <italic>Neonectria</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> were detected. On the other hand, this area presents a high level of beneficial microbes known for their ability to suppress pests and pathogens and to degrade chemicals (including pesticides). In particular, <italic>Clonostachys rosea</italic> (nematicidal activity), beneficial species of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Pseudaminobacter</italic> (plant protection against fungi and PPNs), <italic>Variovorax boronicumulans</italic> (plant growth promotion) and other rhizobacteria have been isolated. Preliminary <italic>in vitro</italic> bioassays indicate that <italic>C. rosea</italic> isolated in this work produces metabolites with a strong nematicidal activity. In conclusion, these data show that soil biodiversity is important in preserving soil quality and to control pests and/or pathogens on vineyard production.</p><p id="Par498">

</p><p id="Par502">During the last decade the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing methods have been revolutionizing the way to conduct genomic experiments, with significant reflections on plant pathogens identification and studies. The possibility to sequence single molecules in real time and obtain reads much longer than the common short Illumina reads, drastically increases the chance to reconstruct the complete circular chromosomal genome in one single step. This is also crucial when reconstructing the accessory plasmids, since the complete molecule could be already sequenced in one single long read, leading to straightforward assemblies. We tested the efficacy of this method on two pathogenic Pseudomonads with a relatively small genome size (around 6.5&#x000a0;Mb). First, the genome of a peculiar levan positive strain of <italic>Pseudomonas savastanoi</italic> pv. <italic>savastanoi</italic> (PVFi1) isolated in the 90&#x02019;s in central Italy was sequenced with both ONT and Illumina. Among other features, it was possible to identify within the assembled genome a functional levansucrase gene very similar to the one possessed by levan positive Pseudomonads, as well as a copy of a non-functional levansucrase gene, analogous instead to the one commonly present in the levan negative <italic>Pseudomonas savastanoi</italic>. Also, a comparative genomic analysis between <italic>Pseudomonas avellanae</italic> strains having different geographical origin and host plant was performed, aiming to identify traits specific to population clusters and give insights into the pathogen, host and environment interaction. These achievements provide evidence of the value of ONT approach in obtaining accurately reconstructed genomes, consequently depicting specific features of the pathogens and their population structure.</p><p id="Par503">

</p><p id="Par512">In 2009, the FAO suggested in a report that by 2050 agricultural production will have to increase to 70% to meet projected demand. Plant diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi represent the main worldwide threats to food security. <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> (<italic>Z. tritici</italic>) is the main causal agent of the wheat foliar disease <italic>Septoria tritici</italic> blotch, characterised by a symptomless biotrophic phase lasting 7&#x02013;11&#x000a0;days, followed by a necrotrophic period with development of fungal asexual sporulation structures called pycnidia throughout the leaf surface. However, several aspects of the first latent phase, including epidermal cell responses, and the spatiotemporal perception of the hyphae at the sub-cellular scale at the stomatal complex, remain still uncharacterised. Herein, we are testing the hypothesis that the wheat immune response galvanizes mechanisms of defence in the initial contact with <italic>Z. tritici</italic> prior to the host penetration via sub-stomata cavities. To address our biological question, we propose a model of host-microbe interaction using bio-imaging approaches based on live-cell imaging and fluorescent proteins labelling plant organelles to investigate early sub-cellular responses occurring in wheat during the early contact with <italic>Z. tritici</italic>. We used high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and automated quantitative bio-imaging approaches for object recognition to determine the presence of wheat focal immunity in response to <italic>Z. tritici</italic> invading hyphae in pre-penetration resistance. Subcellular responses in wheat epidermal cells in response to fungal pathogens occur at the stomatal complex via cell wall reinforcement and organelle re-distribution at the site of microbe interaction, with subsidiary cells playing a role in fungal detection.</p><p id="Par513"><bold><italic>Geosmithia</italic></bold>

</p><p id="Par516"><italic>Liparthrum colchicum</italic> Semenov (Coleoptera Curculionidae Scolytinae) is a relatively unknown monophagous insect species primarily associated with thin dried twigs (about 0.5-1&#x000a0;cm in diameter) of laurel (<italic>Laurus nobilis</italic>). Several recent records reported from different locations of Tuscany and Latium showed that the distribution of this beetle could be much wider than previously expected. In Autumn 2019, terminal twigs of bay trees with evident and widespread symptoms of <italic>L. colchicum</italic> attacks and fungal infections were observed in the park of Villa Salviati (Pisa), Tuscany. Samples of plant material were then collected in order to investigate possible association of this scolytid with phytopathogenic fungi. Adults of the scolytid obtained from the wood galleries were kept in Petri dishes for about 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium; dishes were afterwards incubated for 7&#x000a0;days at 24&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. After this period, fungal colonies were observed. Two different colonies of <italic>Geosmithia</italic> genus were identified according to macro-and micro-morphological criteria. For molecular identification, the DNA of two monosporic isolates (CREADC-F2469, CREADC-F2470) was extracted and the rDNA ITS region was amplified by conventional PCR using the primers ITS5 and ITS4. Morphological identification of the two isolates was confirmed by molecular sequence comparison with 100% identity with <italic>Geosmithia pallida</italic> (GenBank accession No. KF808305) and 99% identity with <italic>Geosmithia langdonii</italic> (KF808297), respectively.

Therefore, Directive 2009/128/EC establishes a sustainable use of pesticides by promoting the integrated pest management and alternative approaches such as the development of PPPs from plant extracts or microorganisms. In this context, the phytotoxic effects of the water leaf extract and powdered leaves of ginger (<italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> Roscoe) were assessed against weeds, both monocotyledonous (<italic>Echinochloa oryzoides</italic> (Ard.) Fritsch and <italic>Lolium multiflorum</italic> Lam.) and dicotyledonous (<italic>Sinapis alba</italic> L. and <italic>Trifolium incarnatum</italic> L.) species, as well as rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L.). Different concentrations of the extract and powder were assayed in pre- and post-emergence, in Petri dishes and pots, respectively. Inhibition of germination and emergence, root and shoot length and weight of seedlings, and phytotoxicity rating scale were recorded up to 7&#x000a0;days. In general, both extract and powder significantly inhibited the germination of all the weeds, showing a higher activity on <italic>L. multiflorum</italic>. In post-emergence, the extract exhibited a significant phytotoxicity on all the weeds except for <italic>L. multiflorum</italic>. Noteworthy, rice seedlings did not show any appreciable lesion after treatment. Further studies are in progress to characterize the chemical constituents of the extract and powder as well as to investigate the mechanisms involved in the observed herbicidal activity and its selectivity. Ginger leaves are production waste that could be developed as a bioherbicide to reduce the PPP input in agriculture and the risk of selecting weed populations resistant to conventional herbicides.</p><p id="Par522">

</p><p id="Par525">Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) has great impact on agronomic production worldwide. The genome consists of three single-stranded RNAs, all necessary for infectivity, the coat protein (CP) gene being present in the genomic RNA3 and subgenomic RNA4. CMV is transmitted by aphids, but seed transmission has been reported in legumes, pepper and Arabidopsis. The functions that control virulence, and hence the effect of infection on progeny production, are important for CMV seed transmission, and RNA1 is considered able to affect its efficiency.</p><p id="Par526">Three viral forms [CMV-Fny strain (F); pseudorecombinant CMV-Fny/S (FS); chimeric CMV previously obtained (CS)], produced from the same RNA1, 2 components of CMV-Fny, were propagated in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> cv. Xanthi plants. Seed-growth tests on filter paper revealed the seed-borne infection only at embryo, but not integument level. RT-PCR and Immuno Dot Blot analyses on seedlings obtained from seed-growth tests in pots showed the presence, for all considered viruses, which were then purified, of replicase gene and CP (CMV polyclonal antiserum), with infection rate from 4 to 16%. Electron microscopy revealed absence (CS) or viral particles (F and FS) without the typical central hole; structural characteristics of purified CMV particles, assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, showed anomalous spectra of nucleic acids rather than nucleoproteins. Our results suggest that during the first stages of germination and seedling development some tobacco seed factors may target, for example, viral CP N-terminal region, rich in basic amino acids and responsible for protein-RNA interactions, so interfering with the correct virion formation, self-assembling and architecture stability.</p><p id="Par527"><bold>Searching for mycoviruses in two collections of</bold>
