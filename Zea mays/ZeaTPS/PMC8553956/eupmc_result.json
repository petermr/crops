But evidence of natural variation in VOC emissions and their contributing factors is still limited, especially for non-cultivated species. Here we explored the natural volatile emissions of Dracophyllum subulatum Hook.f., an endemic shrub to the North Island Central Plateau of New Zealand, and determined some environmental factors driving the plant\u2019s emissions. Volatile emissions of D. subulatum were measured on four separate occasions from December 2017 to September 2018 using the \u201cpush-pull\u201d headspace sampling technique and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). D. subulatum was classified based on the volatiles measured on each sampling occasion using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). On each sampling occasion, we also recorded and compared ambient air temperature, herbivory damage, total soil nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and soil moisture content. The relationship between environmental variables that differed significantly between sampling occasions and volatile emissions were estimated using generalized linear models (GLMs). Based on VOCs measured on each sampling occasion, we were able to distinguish different chemical profiles.

The GLMs reveal that differences in environmental factors between the four sampling occasions are highly associated with changing emissions.
