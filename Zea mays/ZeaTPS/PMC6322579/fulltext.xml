Contact initiated by conditions such as wind, rain, or nearby organisms is one of the most common stimuli experienced by plants (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">Moran &#x00026; Cipollini, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Anten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Plants have evolved very sensitive mechanisms that allow them to perceive touch and launch appropriate responses that include alterations in gene expression (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Jaffe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Telewski, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Chehab <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). It has been shown that alteration in gene expression in plants like Arabidopsis can also rapidly occur within minutes after touch (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Some of the genes up-regulated after touch includes those that have been implicated in disease resistance and defense responses against insect herbivores (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Chehab <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Activation of defense-related genes is followed by the emission of a large variety of signaling substances not present in the profiles of untouched plants (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Braam, 2005</xref>). Recent studies have shown changes in volatiles released by touched plants (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Chehab <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Markovic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), but the precise timing of volatile emission upon the onset of mechanical stress is still unknown.</p><p>The ecological context of plant defense responses in receivers after exposure to volatiles emitted by infested or damaged plants has been examined and shown to have clear adaptive significance (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Dicke &#x00026; Bruin, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Engelberth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Kessler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Heil &#x00026; Karban, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Ramadan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Recently, it has become apparent that chemical interactions between undamaged plants may also carry important information that can affect trophic interactions (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Ninkovic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Plants&#x02019; ability to eavesdrop on the status of their neighbors may facilitate adaptive responses (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Ninkovic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). However, it is unknown how volatiles released from a plant that has simply been touched can influence responses in its conspecific neighbors. Furthermore, would the response of a receiving plant mimic the defensive response of the emitting plant? A plant that comes into contact with a non-self-stimulus might be predicted to have a response to this foreign body, as it represents a potential threat or future competitor. Therefore, would a plant that is receiving contact stimuli elicit a response that could affect a neighbor, and would this information carry with it the severity of this threat causing a corresponding response in the neighbor? To date, potential ecological consequences of touch-induced volatiles in direct chemical interaction between plants as mechanisms contributing to suppression of pests have not been elucidated. Due to their particularly close interaction with plants, aphids are an excellent herbivore model for detecting changes in plant status following chemical interactions among plants (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Pettersson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Aphids make considerable use of chemical information in host plant selection or avoidance (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Birkett <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Eigenbrode <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Pettersson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our study was conducted to gain further insight into the temporal response of plants to touch and the associated ecological implications. For this purpose, we evaluated (i) changes in gene expression and volatile emission, (ii) whether volatiles released by touched plants carrying long-range information prime activation of the same stress-related genes in neighboring plants, and (iii) whether induced responses in nearby plants may be detected by herbivorous insects.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Plant material</title><p>As a model plant, we used maize <italic>Zea mays</italic> L. cultivar Delprim obtained from Delley Seeds and Plants Ltd (Switzerland). Prior to sowing, seeds were sterilized in 70% ethanol for 3 min and rinsed two times in deionized water; then seeds spent 15 min in a 1:1 solution of chlorine and water, and were rinsed again four times in deionized water. Plants were grown in plastic pots (9 &#x000d7; 9&#x000d7;7 cm) in potting soil (Hasselfors Garden, Sweden) with one seed per pot in a glasshouse at 18&#x02013;22 &#x000b0;C, with a 16 h light&#x02013;8 h dark cycle, light intensity of 150 &#x000b5;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and relative humidity of 60 &#x000b1; 10%; they were watered via an automated water drip system delivering 22 ml daily at 08.00 h (2 h into the photoperiod). Natural light was supplemented by light from HQIE lamps. Six days after sowing at the early two-leaf stage, all plants were selected for uniformity in size and moved into clear Perspex cages.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Insects</title><p>Bird cherry-oat aphids, <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> L., were reared on barley, <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> L. cultivar Golf, in multi-clonal cultures in a glasshouse with the same conditions as for the plants. Aphids used in the experiments were wingless, mixed-instar individuals, collected from the cultures 30 min prior to bioassay.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Touching treatments</title><p>Plants were grown in clear Perspex cages divided into two separate chambers (each 10 &#x000d7; 10 &#x000d7; 40 cm), and connected by an opening (7 cm in diameter) in the dividing wall (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Ninkovic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), which prevented plants from interacting with each other in any way. Air entered the front chamber through an opening in the cage wall (7 cm in diameter) and was extracted from the rear chamber through a tube attached to a vacuum tank and vented outside the room by an electric fan. Airflow through the cages was 1.3 liters min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. On each test occasion, emitting plants were placed in the front chambers while receiving plants were placed in consecutive rear receiving chambers. Thus, the front chamber in each block contained either one touched or one untouched plant adjacent to a plant in a receiving chamber (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Cages within blocks were distributed spatially to compensate any small but potentially important variations in abiotic conditions. Each of the treatments was repeated 18 times and they were randomly distributed in different blocks.</p><p>To identify activation of stress-related genes that could further affect emission of volatiles, we applied contact treatments with a soft brush with 3.5 cm-long fibers and a surface area of 7 cm<sup>2</sup> at the point of contact. After 24 h of acclimation in the chambers, a maize leaf was carefully touched from the leaf base to the top, using previously described methods (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Anten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Markovic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). This treatment with a brush has been used to simulate the mechanical interactions between plants (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Elhakeem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Treated plants were touched in the morning for 1 min per day over a period of 6 d. Experiments were limited to 6 d of growth to avoid plants becoming too large and contacting the top of the chambers.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Volatile organic compound analysis by proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry</title><p>Volatile organic compound (VOC) measurements were performed using a commercial proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight (PTR-TOF) mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF 8000 model; Ionicon Analytik GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria) and were carried out both on young maize plants at the two-leaf stage, still untouched, and on plants previously subjected to touching treatment for 6 d. The PTR-TOF 8000 has been described in detail in several publications (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Jordan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), and therefore, in this paper, only a brief description will be provided. This tool is an analytical instrument with high sensitivity (&#x0003e;200 cps/ppbv) and high mass resolution (&#x0003c;8000 <italic>m</italic>/&#x00394;<italic>m</italic>), providing a chemical formula identification for each compound (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Lanza <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p>VOC measurements were performed using a system similar to that previously described (<xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Taiti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) with some modifications. Briefly, each plant was covered with a glass jar equipped with a small opening to allow contact treatments and two Teflon tubes located on the air inlet and outlet, respectively. The shoot headspace of touched and untouched plants was sampled directly from the glass jar through the outlet tube connected to the PTR-TOF-MS. The inlet tube was connected to a zero-air generator (Peak Scientific) to maintain a constant flow of hydrocarbon-free air into the jar during the headspace collection. Care was taken to maintain constant temperature and humidity during measurements as chemical reactions are very sensitive to such parameter changes (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Mancuso <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>).</p><p>VOC analysis of each plant was performed for a minimum of 10 min under control conditions, after which the contact treatment was applied for 1 min as described above. Each measurement lasted, in total, 150 min. VOC emission of control plants (untouched) was also recorded along the same time period. Moreover, VOCs in the headspace of an empty glass jar were analysed as a blank control. The time of sampling for each TOF acquisition channel was 0.1 ns, for a mass spectrum between <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 30 and 210. The instrument was set as follows: inlet flux to 50 sscm, drift pressure of 2.20 mbar, temperature of 50 &#x000b0;C, voltage of 600 V, extraction voltage at the end of tube (<italic>U</italic><sub>dx</sub>) of 35 V, which corresponds to an <italic>E</italic>/<italic>N</italic> value of 140 Td, which provides the necessary balance between excessive water cluster formation and ion fragmentation products (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Pang, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Internal calibration was performed off-line after dead time correction based on <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>=29.997 (NO), <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>=59.049 (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>=180.937 (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>C<sub>l3</sub>) to obtain high mass accuracy. Raw data were acquired with TofDaq software (Tofwerk AG, Switzerland), peak quantification data were corrected with the duty cycle, and the signals were normalized to the primary ion signal (count per second (cps) to normalized count per second (ncps)) (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Taiti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). For the identified signals, all of the <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> were tentatively assigned to the mass formulae reported, relying on high instrumental mass accuracy and resolution. Moreover, the tentative identifications through the integration of previous knowledge of the VOCs emitted by plants, where analyses were performed with PTR-MS instruments, improved (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Maleknia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Sample collection</title><p>Leaf tissue was collected from plants at either 6 min or 100 min after the first and last contact treatments.

Approximately 3 cm of leaf tissue was removed using sterile scissors. Tissue was collected from five plants from each treatment: touched plant, T; control untouched plant, C; neighbors exposed to volatiles from touched plant, ET; and neighbors exposed to volatiles from control untouched plants, EC (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>RNA preparation and quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Each frozen sample bag with an individual leaf inside was stored at &#x02013;70 &#x000b0;C before RNA extraction.

The manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol was modified and 8 M lithium chloride was used to remove genomic DNA contamination from the extracted RNA. Ten micrograms of the total RNA from each sample was then freeze-dried in GenTegra tubes (GenTegra, USA) for transport.

In addition, we also measured transcript abundance of defense genes whose products are known to affect insect performance directly, such as proteinase inhibitors and benzoxazinoids.

A plants can also prime its neighbors and recruit natural enemies of its insect pests through the production of VOCs such as terpenoids, green leafy volatiles, and indole through the gene products of terpene synthase 2 (<italic>TPS2</italic>), lipoxygenase 3 (<italic>LOX3</italic>), and indole glycerol phosphate lyase (<italic>IGL1</italic>), respectively. Therefore, we measured the transcript abundance of <italic>TPS2</italic>, <italic>LOX3</italic>, and <italic>IGL1</italic> in response to touch.

Surprisingly, the perception of induced VOCs from touched plants by neighboring plants can lead to the activation of defense genes. Taken together, our study demonstrates that genes activated in response to touch can contribute to induced resistance in the emitter itself and to primed/mirrored resistance in neighboring plants.</p><p>Plants touched for shorter periods of time as well as their neighbors showed a feeble defense response in gene expression at both time points (6 and 100 min). Besides searching for evidence in gene expression induced by touch, we aimed to identify active components in the volatile blend from touched plants that influenced up-regulation of defense-related genes in the volatile-exposed neighbors. After just 6 min of exposure, neighboring plants up-regulated direct defense-related gene <italic>MPI</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. 3B</xref>), and up-regulation of <italic>CPK11</italic> occurred after 100 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. 2B</xref>). The blend of touch-induced VOCs consisted of isoprene fragments, s4 aldehyde fragments, (<italic>E</italic>)-3-hexenal, and terpene fragments, which could be responsible for the observed receiver response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. 1A</xref>). This demonstrates a fascinating ability of plants to rapidly detect, process, and respond to touch-induced changes in the volatile profile of their nearby neighbors. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of these VOCs in plant&#x02013;plant communication as single components or together as a blend. However, sustained touching for 1 min d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 6 d had a significant effect on gene expression in touched plants, and exposure to their induced VOCs, a blend of methanol, isoprene fragments, isoprene, alkyl fragments, and terpene fragments (Fig. 1B), activated the same genes in their neighbors.</p><p>Notably, the trend of such gene expression was mirrored between touched plants and their neighbors. For example, after 6 d of touching, <italic>CPK11</italic>, <italic>IGL1</italic>, <italic>MKK1</italic>, and <italic>TPS2</italic> transcripts were higher in both touched plants and plants receiving VOCs from these plants, compared with untouched plants or plants receiving VOCs from untouched plants, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Figs 5B, C, 7A, C</xref>). This signifies two things. First, plants have a threshold at which they keep their induction of defense in response to touching to lower levels after 1 min of touching compared with sustained touching for 1 min d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 6 d. Such a trend can be seen in the expression pattern of <italic>LOX3</italic> where there was a suppression of the transcript at 100 min compared with untouched plants on day 1, suggesting the presence of a possible checkpoint of one-time touch before activation of downstream volatile production to prime its neighbor to the imminent threat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Second, gene expression between touched plants and plants that receive VOCs from these touched plants can mirror their level of defense-related gene expression. This strongly suggests that the perception of specific VOCs emitted from touched plants can rapidly elevate defense levels in neighbors to mimic/copy the potentially adaptive transcripts of touched plants. This transcriptional mirroring response between touched plants and their neighbors for specific genes indicates that induced VOCs from perturbed plants can serve as messages to close conspecific neighbors. These results show plants&#x02019; capacity to sense and discriminate rapidly with great accuracy changes in nearby plants&#x02019; volatile profiles induced by touch, and to copy the response of plants directly exposed to mechano-stress. It is interesting to notice that this transcriptional mirroring effect is observable for certain genes of the plant early defense (<italic>CPK11</italic> and <italic>MKK1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. 5B, C</xref>) and of the volatile production (<italic>IGL1</italic> and <italic>TPS2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. 7A, C</xref>), but not for the selected genes involved in direct chemical defense against herbivores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Fig. 6A, C</xref>).</p><p>Plants are known to constantly monitor chemical signals as these signals often serve as an important source of information (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Izaguirre <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">Novoplansky, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Kegge &#x00026; Pierik, 2010</xref>). Plants benefit only if they are able to detect and respond in an appropriate manner to info-chemical signals from their environment (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Broz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Ninkovic, 2010</xref>). Receivers in close proximity utilize volatile cues leading to interactions between plants (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">Baldwin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Ninkovic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is apparent that 6 d of direct exposure significantly impacts the receivers&#x02019; ability to discriminately respond only to touch-induced volatiles. Such a response indicates that plants have the capacity to respond appropriately to the cues pointing to specific stress changes in their neighbors. This allows the eavesdropping plant to prepare in a timely fashion for future events that may have a consequence for plant performance, as observed in the similar response of aphids to directly bothered plants and to those that received this information. The production of VOCs is complex and constantly altered by interactions of plants with biotic factors (<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">Pichersky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). VOCs present an indicator of the plant&#x02019;s current state and may include elicitors of defense responses in neighboring plants (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Karban <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Previous studies reported that genetic relatedness among sagebrush plants influences volatile herbivory-induced defense in receiving plants (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Heil &#x00026; Ton, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Karban &#x00026; Shiojiri, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Das <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Erb <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Exposure to volatiles from insect-damaged conspecific plants can induce expression of several defense-related genes in undamaged neighbors (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Arimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Our study demonstrates, for the first time, evidence that touch-induced volatiles from genetically identical plants can also play an important role in the induction of defense-related genes against herbivores in nearby neighbors.</p><p>Changes in volatile emission among the first and last touching treatments indicate that methanol, isoprene, and alkyl fragments might correlate with higher transcripts of <italic>CPK11</italic>, <italic>IGL1</italic>, <italic>MKK1</italic>, <italic>TPS2</italic>, and <italic>WIP1</italic> within exposed plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">C</xref>). The expression of genes <italic>CPK11</italic>, <italic>IGL1</italic>, <italic>WIP1</italic>, and <italic>MKK1</italic> was associated to induced plant defense responses and greater resistance to insects and pathogens (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000e9;sz&#x000e1;ros <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Ku&#x0015b;nierczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Szczegielniak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Ding <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Gravino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The expression of <italic>TPS2</italic> was significantly induced by corn leaf aphid feeding (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Tzin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), enabling the production of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, including linalool and (<italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Richter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Recent studies showed that sesquiterpenes such as (<italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol can increase emissions of plants exposed to volatiles from neighboring undamaged plants, which have strong repelling effects on the aphids (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Ninkovic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Dahlin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). The complex series of coordinated defense responses expressed in plants exposed to touch-induced volatiles reduced aphid settling, making these plants a less suitable host for aphids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). It is obvious that up-regulation of certain tested genes, usually related to plant-induced defense, can be also activated after exposure to volatiles from competing neighbors, indicating that these genes may have a physiological role in plant adaptation to growing environments. The ecological importance of touch-induced volatiles in induction of plants defenses is reflected in the fact that induction takes place even before actual herbivore attack occurs, making the exposed plants ready for a quick and more aggressive response.</p><p>We propose that brief and light contact events can be effective stimuli in the activation of transcripts of several defense-related genes that are also involved in the emission of specific volatiles that activate the same genes in exposed plants. This study presents evidence of induced volatiles as long-distance cues that play important roles in the chemical interactions among plants of the same genotype. The presented findings should be considered in further studies as potentially important factors and valuable mechanisms in plant&#x02013;plant communication and in plant community interactions. Furthermore, the ecological costs, benefits, and constraints of such signaling are in need of further evaluation in this and additional contexts to fully understand if such signaling is adaptive for either the receiver or the emitter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s15"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p>Fig. S1.
