Introduction</title><p>Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat and other cereal crops worldwide. During infection, <italic>Fusarium</italic> species, such as <italic>Fusarium graminearum,</italic> produce an array of secondary metabolites, including mycotoxins, that can pose serious risks to plant, animal, and human health [<xref rid="B1-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Trichothecenes are among the most problematic <italic>Fusarium</italic> mycotoxins because they frequently contaminate small-grain cereals, which raises food safety concerns and requires regulation [<xref rid="B2-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Trichothecenes are sesquiterpenoid metabolites. Biosynthesis is initiated when farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), the common precursor of all sesquiterpenes, is converted by the terpene synthase Tri5 into the hydrocarbon volatile trichodiene. Trichodiene then undergoes a series of enzyme-catalyzed modifications to form trichothecenes such as nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON) and its acetylated derivatives 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), diacetoxyscirpenol, T-2 toxin, and NX-2 [<xref rid="B1-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B4-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> predominantly contaminates grain with type B trichothecenes including DON and NIV, or the type A trichothecene NX-3. The acetylated trichothecenes produced by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> in culture, e.g., 3-ADON, 15-ADON, 4-ANIV, 4,15-diANIV, and NX-2, are mostly converted to their deacetylated forms, DON, NIV, and NX-3, in planta. Evidence of the phytotoxicity of these structural analogs has been described in numerous studies [<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. DON, in particular, is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis and serves as a virulence factor, enabling <italic>Fusarium</italic> to overcome natural plant defences and spread throughout the wheat spike [<xref rid="B8-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Considerable research has been devoted to understanding the role of trichothecenes in host colonization and pathogen aggressiveness; however, relatively little is known about the potential synergistic interactions with other <italic>Fusarium</italic> secondary metabolites [<xref rid="B10-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Culmorin (CUL) is a tricyclic sesquiterpene diol derived from activity of the terpene synthase Clm1, which converts FPP into longiborneol [<xref rid="B13-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and the cytochrome P450 Clm2, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of longiborneol to CUL [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Naturally contaminated grain samples have relatively high concentrations of CUL, and levels are typically positively correlated with the amount of DON [<xref rid="B2-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B15-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, CUL is considered to be an &#x0201c;emerging mycotoxin&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B2-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B16-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While CUL does not appear to affect insects or animals by itself, the co-occurrence of CUL and DON can have a synergistic effect on toxicity [<xref rid="B17-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recent findings indicate that CUL can supress the activity of uridine diphosphate glucosyltransferases (UGTs) that catalyze the glycosylation of DON into the less toxic DON 3-O-glucose (D3G) [<xref rid="B19-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. UGT enzymes are found in all living organisms, and inhibitors of such enzymes may function across a broad taxonomic range as CUL has been demonstrated to inhibit UGTs from humans and rice [<xref rid="B19-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (and unpublished work referenced therein).</p><p>Metabolism of DON to D3G has been identified in most cereal crops, including <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> (wheat), <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> (barley), and <italic>Zea mays</italic> (maize/corn) [<xref rid="B2-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B20-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In wheat, FHB resistance to the spread of disease along the spike (also known as type II resistance) is closely correlated with the metabolism of DON into D3G [<xref rid="B23-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. UGTs capable of detoxifying DON via glycosylation have been identified in barley, rice, and wheat [<xref rid="B22-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B26-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Overexpression of these UGTs in heterologous systems have demonstrated functionality in disease resistance. For example, overexpression of a barley UGT in wheat resulted in enhanced FHB resistance [<xref rid="B30-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similarly, expression of a wheat UGT (Traes_2BS_14CA35D5D) in <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> increased FHB resistance and root tolerance to DON [<xref rid="B26-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The role of CUL in <italic>Fusarium</italic> infection of plants is not well characterized. In contrast to insects and animals, wheat coleoptile tissues have been reported to be sensitive to CUL [<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Comparisons between disease progression of CUL-producing <italic>F. graminearum</italic> strains and CUL non-producing mutant strains disrupted in CUL biosynthesis have yielded conflicting and inconclusive results. Gardiner et al. [<xref rid="B31-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported that disruption of <italic>CLM1</italic> (FGSG_10397) or <italic>CLM2</italic> (FGSG_00007, also known as FGSG_17598) resulted in increased <italic>TRI5</italic> transcription, DON production, and aggressiveness in wheat. In contrast, Bahadoor et al. [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that the disruption of <italic>CLM2</italic> did not affect the transcription of trichothecene biosynthetic genes, and mutant strains had reduced virulence on wheat in comparison to the wild-type or add-back strains. However, the control transformant strain also displayed a reduction in virulence and, thus, only one of the two <italic>CLM2</italic> mutants evaluated was significantly less virulent than the transformed control [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similarly, inconsistent results between independent <italic>CLM1</italic> mutant strains and transformant controls were observed by Alexander and Vaughan (unpublished). Additionally, the disruption of <italic>CLM2</italic> led to the production of five novel metabolites: 3-hydroxylongiborneol, 5-hydroxylongiborneol, 12-hydroxylongiborneol, 15-hydroxylongiborneol, and 11-epi-acetylculmorin [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A drawback to assessing virulence phenotypes of mutant strains in which a secondary metabolite pathway has been blocked is that such mutations can be pleiotropic, as biosynthetic pathways other than the target pathway can be affected. These unintended changes in the metabolically engineered <italic>Fusarium</italic> strains likely confounded disease assay results and made it difficult to determine the role of CUL in host infection and colonization. Similar challenges to manipulating terpenoid biosynthetic pathways and understanding the regulatory complexity involved have previously been reviewed [<xref rid="B32-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>As the basis for this study, we hypothesized that the co-ocurrence of CUL and trichothecenes has synergistic phytotoxic effects. To overcome the challenges posed by the pleotropic effects of CUL-nonproducing mutants, we evaluated the direct phytotoxic effects of purified CUL by itself and in mixtures with trichothecenes. The phytotoxicity of the metabolites was initially assessed using the unicellular plant model system <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> [<xref rid="B7-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, since plant roots are also sensitive to DON [<xref rid="B26-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B33-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we further assessed the effect of CUL by itself and CUL-trichothecene mixtures on root growth in wheat, barley and corn. Since mixtures consisting of higher levels of CUL than DON resulted in increased phytotoxicity, we further hypothesized that FHB severity would be positively correlated with the ratio of CUL/DON produced by the pathogen. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between the CUL/DON ratio and FHB progression in wheat and compared the expression of CUL and DON biosynthetic genes during early stages of infection. Given the potential fitness benefits associated with co-production of DON and CUL, we conducted a genomic analysis of selected species of <italic>Fusarium</italic> to determine if there was an evolutionary association between the biosynthetic pathways of trichothecenes and CUL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-toxins-11-00555"><title>2.

Effects of CUL and Trichothecenes on C. reinhardtii Growth</title><p>To assess the phytotoxicity of CUL and CUL-trichothecene mixtures, the growth of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cultures treated with the purified mycotoxins was evaluated over time. Treatment with 40 &#x003bc;M DON significantly reduced <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> growth to approximately a fourth of the control, and this concentration was chosen for further experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Treatment with 40, 120, or 240 &#x003bc;M CUL did not significantly affect the growth of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, and equimolar amounts (40 &#x003bc;M) of CUL and DON did not significantly alter <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> growth in comparison to cultures treated with only DON. Mixtures of DON with three or six times more CUL further reduced <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> growth in relation to the DON only treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f001">Figure 1</xref>). However, this reduction was statistically significant only in the treatment with CUL at six times the amount of DON, in which <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> growth was reduced to 68% of the DON only treatment (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02).</p><p>To determine if CUL had a similar synergistic effect with other trichothecene analogs produced by <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (i.e., 15-ADON and 3-ADON), growth in the presence of each analog by itself and in mixtures with CUL was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> growth was significantly inhibited by 40 &#x003bc;M 15-ADON or 3-ADON in comparison to controls and treatment with 240 &#x003bc;M CUL (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Growth was inhibited further when the cultures were treated with mixtures of 240 &#x003bc;M CUL and 3-ADON or 15-ADON. In comparison to corresponding treatments with ADON compounds, a mixture of 40 &#x003bc;M 15-ADON and 240 &#x003bc;M CUL reduced growth by 71% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008), and a mixture of 40 &#x003bc;M 3-ADON and 240 &#x003bc;M CUL reduced growth by 35% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03).</p><p>Because the CUL derivative hydroxy-culmorin (OH-CUL) is frequently found as a co-contaminate with CUL in grain, we also evaluated whether OH-CUL had a similar negative effect with DON on growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). However, the repeated measures analysis of variance indicated that the growth of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cultures treated with a mixture of 40 &#x003bc;M DON and 240 &#x003bc;M OH-CUL did not significantly differ from those treated with just 40 &#x003bc;M DON.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-toxins-11-00555"><title>2.2. Effects of CUL and Trichothecenes on the Growth of Wheat Roots</title><p>The phytotoxicity of CUL and CUL-trichothecene mixtures on wheat was evaluated by assessing seedling root elongation after 5 days of growth on water agar containing the mycotoxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Preliminary experiments determined that wheat roots were much more sensitive to DON than was <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. Approximately, 10-fold less DON, 3.4 &#x000b5;M (1 ppm), was sufficient to significantly reduce wheat (variety &#x02018;Norm&#x02019;) root growth by approximately 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f004">Figure 4</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Consistent with the results from <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> assays, treatment with CUL alone did not have any significant phototoxic effect on wheat root elongation. Nevertheless, the relative amount of CUL needed to result in a phytotoxic effect when combined with other trichothecenes was less in the wheat root assay as compared to the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>reinhardtii</italic> assay. Concentrations of 4.2 &#x000b5;M CUL (1 ppm; 1.2-fold in excess to DON) or 8.4 &#x000b5;M (2 ppm; 2.5-fold in excess to DON) with 3.4 &#x000b5;M DON (1 ppm) resulted in a significant synergistic inhibitory effect on wheat root elongation in comparison to treatment with 1 ppm DON alone (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Roots grown on media containing 2 ppm CUL and 1 ppm DON were about 50% shorter than roots grown on media with just 1 ppm DON, and were 80% shorter than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f004">Figure 4</xref>). For further experiments, the concentrations of 2 ppm and 1 ppm were chosen for CUL and other sesquiterpenoids, respectively.</p><p>The phytotoxicity of CUL with 15-ADON, 3-ADON, NX-3 or NIV was also evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Independently, 1 ppm 15-ADON, 3-ADON, or NX-3 significantly reduced root elongation in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f005">Figure 5</xref>a&#x02013;c). In combination with 2 ppm CUL, 15-ADON, 3-ADON, or NX-3 reduced root growth even further, resulting in 45%, 40%, and 32% reduction, respectively, in root length in comparison to the respective single trichothecene (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>In contrast, neither 1 ppm NIV nor 1 ppm NIV with 2 ppm CUL significantly reduced root elongation on water agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f005">Figure 5</xref>d). However, during these initial experiments, many roots were observed lifting from the agar, presumably to avoid direct contact with the mycotoxins. Since this avoidance behavior could have skewed the results, we conducted additional root growth experiments using hydroponic assays, where the root tissues could only grow in direct contact with liquid media containing the mycotoxins. The resulting inhibition of hydroponically grown roots treated with 1 ppm DON and 2 ppm CUL was similar to that observed in the water agar assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f006">Figure 6</xref>a). Additionally, in the hydroponic assay, 1 ppm NIV reduced root elongation by 23% in comparison to controls, but the combined treatment of 1 ppm NIV with 2 ppm CUL did not result in synergistic phytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f006">Figure 6</xref>b,c). Additionally, in the hydroponic assay, 1 ppm NIV reduced root elongation by 23% in comparison to controls, but the combined treatment of 1 ppm NIV with 2 ppm CUL did not result in statistically significant phytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f006">Figure 6</xref>b,c), suggesting that CUL helped to protect the roots from the phytotoxic effects of NIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f006">Figure 6</xref>c).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-toxins-11-00555"><title>2.3. Synergistic Phytotoxicity of CUL and DON on Multiple Varieties of Wheat, Barley and Corn</title><p>To determine if the synergistic phytotoxicity of CUL with DON was host-specific with regard to variety and/or species, water agar root growth assays were conducted with the moderately resistant spring wheat variety &#x02018;Alsen&#x02019; and two varieties of barley and corn of variable resistance levels. When grown on water agar containing 2 ppm CUL and 1 ppm DON, &#x02018;Norm&#x02019; and &#x02018;Alsen&#x02019; seedlings had on average 56% and 38% shorter roots, respectively, in comparison to corresponding roots grown on water agar containing only 1 ppm DON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f007">Figure 7</xref>a; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). However, a full factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) determined that wheat variety was not a significant factor contributing to differences between treatment means. Likewise, no significant differences were observed between the two barley varieties, &#x02018;Robust&#x02019; and &#x02018;95SR316A&#x02019;, that were evaluated. Barley roots were more tolerant of DON, and their root length was not significantly inhibited by 1 ppm DON in comparison to controls.

Among these were the four wheat heads with the highest AUDPC values, and their CUL/DON values ranged from 0.15 to 0.6, indicating that heads with the highest AUDPC values had more DON than CUL contamination.</p><p>Nevertheless, AUDPC was positively correlated with the concentration of CUL (y = 0.0286x + 0.2555; <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.77) and DON (y = 0.01x + 0.9612; <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.85) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f008">Figure 8</xref>b,c).

Interestingly, among the four spikes with the highest AUDPC values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f008">Figure 8</xref>), two spikes (indicated in red) have approximately half the amount of DON in comparison to the other two spikes (indicated in blue), and yet they caused similar amounts of disease.

Transcriptional Analysis of CUL and Trichothecene Biosynthetic Genes</title><p>Since mycotoxin quantification was conducted at the endpoint of the disease progression analysis (day 21), the potential for differences in the timing of CUL and DON production was evaluated by comparing the expression of biosynthetic genes during the first week post inoculation. This early timeframe was chosen for gene expression analyses because previous studies have shown that the expression of most <italic>TRI</italic> genes can be observed by two days and peaks at three to four days after inoculation [<xref rid="B34-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

However, significant differences could be observed as early as two days post inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f009">Figure 9</xref>).

Distribution of CUL and Trichothecene Biosynthetic Genes in Selected Species of Fusarium</title><p>Since trichothecene-producing fusaria likely benefit from the production of CUL and DON, we hypothesized that genes from the two biosynthetic pathways would frequently co-occur.

These complexes are multi-species lineages of <italic>Fusarium</italic> that have trichothecene biosynthetic genes, and trichothecene production has been confirmed in many of the species [<xref rid="B35-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. <italic>CLM1</italic> and <italic>CLM2</italic> occurred widely among members of the Sambucinum complex, which includes <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Among the members of the Sambucinum complex that were examined, the genes occurred uniformly among species more closely related to <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, and sporadically among species more distantly related to <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f010">Figure 10</xref>). Among the genomes for the 11 species of the Incarnatum complex that were examined, homologs of both <italic>CLM1</italic> and <italic>CLM2</italic> occurred in only one species, the phylogenetically defined species FIESC 23.

Discussion</title><p>In this study, purified compounds were used to demonstrate that CUL and DON have a synergistic phytotoxic effect on the economically important plants wheat, barley, and corn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The phytotoxicity was most apparent when the concentration of CUL exceeded that of DON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that CUL inhibits the glycosylation of DON by serving as a competing alternate substrate for UDP-glucosyltransferases [<xref rid="B19-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>CUL also had a synergistic phytotoxic affect in combination with 15-ADON, 3-ADON and NX-3, but not with NIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f005">Figure 5</xref>d and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f006">Figure 6</xref>c). Contrary to expectations, the presence of CUL negated the modest but significant phytotoxicity of NIV observed in hydroponic assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f006">Figure 6</xref>c). The key structural difference between the other trichothecene compounds tested and NIV is that NIV has a C4 hydroxyl-group. Interestingly, the size of the functional group at the C4 position was the limiting factor in the ability of the rice UGT to glycosylate C4-acetylated compounds, such as T-2 toxin. Plant UGTs typically have broad substrate specificity but maintain stringent regioselectivity. Although relatively few UGTs capable of glycosylating DON have been characterized in cereals [<xref rid="B22-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B26-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], UGTs accepting both DON and NIV as substrate have been identified in barley and rice [<xref rid="B30-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B38-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and glycosylated NIV has been reported in wheat [<xref rid="B39-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, it is unlikely that the results herein are due to a lack of NIV glycosylation in wheat or a NIV-specific UGT that is not inhibited by CUL. If the mechanism of the synergistic phytotoxicity is based on the inhibition of glucosylation, our findings suggest that UGTs may display preferential binding for particular substrates. It is possible that NIV was preferentially detoxified in the presence of CUL, even when CUL was at more than two-fold the concentration of NIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f006">Figure 6</xref>c). This contradicts the competing alternate substrate hypothesis [<xref rid="B19-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The use of phytotoxicity assays that allowed for controlled application of known amounts of individual and combined mycotoxins enabled us to visualize the direct effects of each treatment in the absence of the pathogen and any unintended changes to other metabolites. Both the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and plant root growth inhibition assays have previously been used to evaluate the direct phytotoxic effects of trichothecenes [<xref rid="B7-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B26-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B33-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and have similarly demonstrated that DON and other structural analogs are capable of inhibiting plant growth. In contrast to our results, Wang and Miller [<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] observed a direct phytotoxic effect of CUL on wheat coleoptile tissues. However, the phytotoxic effect was predominantly observed on tissues treated at 1000 &#x000b5;M CUL, which was approximately 100-fold greater than what was used in the present study (8.4 &#x000b5;M). In the previous study [<xref rid="B5-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], only the most FHB-susceptible wheat variety &#x02018;Concorde&#x02019; exhibited a significant inhibition in coleoptile tissue growth when exposed to CUL at a concentration (10 &#x000b5;M) that was comparable to that used in the current study. Additionally, in contrast to mycotoxin phytotoxicity results obtained from coleoptile tissue growth assays, the root elongation assays did not distinguish between FHB-susceptible and moderately resistant wheat varieties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f007">Figure 7</xref>a). It is possible that the observed differences between studies are due to variability among wheat varieties or the fact that excised coleoptile tissues are more sensitive to CUL and DON than root tissues.</p><p>Although increased phytotoxicity should theoretically favor the aggressiveness of a hemibiotrophic pathogen that derives nutrients from dead or dying plant cells for the latter part of its lifecycle, it has been challenging to conclusively demonstrate that the production of CUL is directly associated with increased pathogen virulence in planta. As an alternative to metabolically engineered <italic>Fusarium</italic> strains, which were reportedly altered in production of other metabolites [<xref rid="B14-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B31-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] making it difficult to assess the role of CUL in host infection, we attempted to assess the role of CUL in pathogen virulence by evaluating the relationship between the ratio of CUL/DON and the AUDPC from 15 independent isolates of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Although the synergistic phytotoxic effects were most apparent when CUL was present at a higher concentration than DON, the CUL/DON ratio and AUDPC were only modestly correlated, and the relationship was negative, indicating that strains that produced more CUL than DON tended to cause less disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f008">Figure 8</xref>a). The CUL/DON ratios reported herein are comparable to those reported in previous publications [<xref rid="B27-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B30-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B41-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is possible that the ratio of total CUL + CUL glucoside / DON + D3G would be more closely correlated with disease. However, it is unlikely that the direction of the relationship would change.</p><p>Nevertheless, the amount of CUL was positively correlated with disease (AUDPC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f008">Figure 8</xref>b), as was the amount of DON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f008">Figure 8</xref>c). However, the sum of both CUL and DON was most closely correlated with disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f008">Figure 8</xref>d), suggesting that the production of both these metabolites contributes to disease.</p><p>It is important to also consider DON as the direct source of the phytotoxicity. If CUL contributes to inhibition of DON detoxification, its effect on phytotoxicity is indirect. Of the four spikes with the highest AUDPC values, two had approximately 1000 &#x000b5;g/g of DON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f008">Figure 8</xref> blue points), while the other two spikes only had half the amount of DON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f008">Figure 8</xref> red points), and yet they had similarly high AUDPC values. The spikes with half the amount of DON had CUL/DON ratios of 0.6 and 0.5, while the spikes with high amounts of DON had CUL/DON ratios of 0.2 and 0.14. When the amount of CUL did not exceed that of DON, the production of CUL still appears to benefit disease development. <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens may utilize two different strategies to achieve phytotoxicity during disease development: (1) produce large amounts of DON or (2) produce both CUL and DON.</p><p>Since CUL and DON are both derived from the same sesquiterpenoid precursor FPP, it is possible that there are trade-offs during biosynthesis. For example, the production of too much CUL could limit DON production. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f008">Figure 8</xref>, several wheat spikes were contaminated with primarily CUL, and only minimal amounts of DON. Additionally, these mycotoxin concentrations were quantified at the end of the disease progression assay (21 days post inoculation). During the first 7 days post inoculation, differences in expression of CUL and DON biosynthetic genes suggest that CUL production may be greater than DON production during the first week of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the synergistic phytotoxic effect between CUL and DON in planta relies on the coordinated amount of production of each metabolite at the appropriate time. In light of this, and the involvement of CUL in increasing the phytotoxicity, new control strategies of FHB may include disrupting the coordinated regulation of CUL and DON biosynthesis.</p><p>Consistent with the synergistic function of CUL with trichothecenes in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, the biosynthetic pathways of both metabolites appear to be conserved among members of the Sambucinum complex that are more closely related to <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. CUL production has been confirmed in other DON-producing species, such as <italic>F. boothii,</italic> but also in predominantly NIV-producing species, such as <italic>F. cerealis</italic> and <italic>F. dactylidis</italic> [<xref rid="B42-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. More distantly related members of the Sambucinum complex, <italic>F. sambucinum, F. poae, F. langsethiae, F. sporotrichioides</italic> and <italic>F. longipes,</italic> which typically produce neosolaniol, NIV and diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), T-2, T-2, and DAS, respectively, lacked one or both CUL biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="toxins-11-00555-f010">Figure 10</xref>). Interestingly, the trichothecenes produced by species lacking one or both CUL genes have either a hydroxyl or acetyl group at the C4 position, which may limit the synergistic function of CUL. In this situation, there may be less selective pressure to maintain the CUL biosynthetic pathway. However, homologs of the CUL biosynthetic genes were not restricted to trichothecene-producing fusaria. They were also found in species of the Tricinctum and Burgessii complexes. Additional research is needed to verify if these genes are indeed involved in the biosynthesis of CUL. Mycotoxin analyses of various <italic>F. avenaceum</italic> stains grown on rice for 7 days did not identify any CUL production [<xref rid="B43-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], but some longiborneol was detected, suggesting conserved functionality of <italic>CLM1</italic> [<xref rid="B44-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

The coefficient of determination (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>) was used to assess the degree of the correlation, and the slope of the trendline indicated the direction of the relationship.</p><p>In an effort to account for variability in CUL and DON production during disease development, 15 different <italic>F. graminearum</italic> strains were used: 38746, 38762, 38811, 38986, 47571, 52005, 52512, 52955, 06-219, 06-225, 06-270, 13MN1-6, F333, F342, and F344 [<xref rid="B47-toxins-11-00555" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. &#x02018;Alsen&#x02019; plants were grown to anthesis and point inoculated by injecting 10 &#x000b5;L of a single <italic>F. graminearum</italic> strain at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> spores/ mL into the third floret from the top counting along one side. The inoculated heads were covered with plastic bags for three days to ensure high relative humidity during initial infection. Three independent heads were inoculated per strain. Thus, a total of 45 heads were evaluated. The number of diseased florets was recorded on days 7, 10, 14, 17 and 21 post inculcation and used to calculate the area under the disease progression curve (AUDPC). At 21 days post inoculation, each head was individually collected, lyophilized, and ground for mycotoxin analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot5-toxins-11-00555"><title>4.5. Mycotoxin Extraction and Quantification</title><p>Ground material (0.3&#x02013;0.5 g) was extracted with 10 mL of extraction solvent (acetonitrile-water, 86:14 <italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) in a 50 mL polypropylene screw cap tube with shaking for 15 min. After centrifugation, 5 mL of extract was purified through a MycoSep 225 Trich cartridge (Romer Labs, Union, MO, USA). A 2 mL aliquot of the purified extract was transferred to a 1-dram vial and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives were prepared by adding 100 &#x000b5;L of a 100:1 freshly prepared mixture of N-trimethylsilylimadazole/trimethylchlorosilane (TMSI/TMCS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to the dried extract. After 30 min, 900 &#x000b5;L isooctane was added to the reaction mixture followed by 1 mL water. The mixture was agitated gently until the organic (top) layer became translucent. The organic layer was then transferred to 2 mL autosampler vials for gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (GC-MS; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA)) analysis. TMS derivatives of purified DON (0.3125&#x02013;80 &#x000b5;g) and culmorin (0.3125&#x02013;80 &#x000b5;g) were similarly prepared with TMSI/TMCS and used to construct standard curves for quantitation.</p><p>GC-MS analyses were performed on an Agilent 7890 (Santa Clara, CA, USA) gas chromatograph fitted with an HP-5MS column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 &#x000b5;m) and a 5977 mass detector. The injection temperature was kept at 250 &#x000b0;C, and the column flow rate was 1 mL/min. A temperature program was used with initial column temperature of 150 &#x000b0;C for 1 min, and then increased to 280 &#x000b0;C at 30 &#x000b0;C min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and held for 3.5 min. Selective ion monitoring (SIM) was applied to detect the characteristic ions of diTMS-culmorin with a fragment ion (<italic>m/z</italic> value) of 157.1 as the target ion and 183.1, 245.1, 277.1, 292.1 and 367.1 as reference ions, and triTMS-DON with a fragment ion of 235.1 as the target ion and 259.1, 295.1, 392.2, 422.2, and 512.2 as reference ions.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot6-toxins-11-00555"><title>4.6.
