Despite large-scale commercial maize production, little is known about the defensive responses of field-grown commercial maize to O.\u00a0furnacalis herbivory, and how these responses result in direct and indirect defence against this pest. To elucidate the maize transcriptome response to O.\u00a0furnacalis feeding, leaves of maize hybrid Jingke968 were infested with O.\u00a0furnacalis for 0, 2, 4, 12 and 24\u00a0h. Ostrinia furnacalis feeding elicited stronger and more rapid changes in the defence-related gene expression (i.e. after 2\u00a0h), and more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated than down-regulated at all times post-induction (i.e. 2, 4, 12 and 24\u00a0h) in the O.\u00a0furnacalis pre-infested maize plants. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that the DEGs in the O.\u00a0furnacalis pre-infested maize are involved in benzoxazinoids, phytohormones, volatiles, and other metabolic pathways related to maize resistance to herbivores. In addition, the maize leaves previously infested by O.\u00a0furnacalis for 24\u00a0h showed an obvious inhibition of the subsequent O.\u00a0furnacalis performance, and maize volatiles induced by O.\u00a0furnacalis feeding for 24 and 48\u00a0h attracted the parasitic wasp, Macrocentrus cingulum Brischke. The increased direct and indirect defences induced by O.\u00a0furnacalis feeding were correlated with O.\u00a0furnacalis-induced phytohormones, benzoxazinoids, and volatiles.
