Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanism of the production of these compounds is necessary to create new breeds with high volatile production. In this study, two <i>bHLH</i> transcription factors (<i>CpMYC2</i> and <i>CpbHLH13</i>) of Wintersweet H29 were functionally characterized to illustrate their possible role in the production of volatile compounds. The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of <i>CpMYC2</i> and <i>CpbHLH13</i> increased from the flower budding to full bloom stage, indicating that these two genes may play an essential role in blooming and aroma production in wintersweet. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis revealed that the overexpression of <i>CpMYC2</i> in arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtMYC2-2</i> mutant (Salk_083483) and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabaccum</i>) genotype Petit Havana SR1 significantly increased floral volatile monoterpene, especially linalool, while the overexpression of <i>CpbHLH13</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) and tobacco genotype SR1 increased floral sesquiterpene \u03b2-caryophyllene production in both types of transgenic plants respectively. High expression of terpene synthase (TPS) genes in transgenic <i>A. thaliana</i> along with high expression of <i>CpMYC2</i> and <i>CpbHLH13</i> in transgenic plants was also observed. The application of a combination of methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) showed an increment in linalool production in <i>CpMYC2</i>-overexpressing arabidopsis plants, and the high transcript level of TPS genes also suggested the involvement of <i>CpMYC2</i> in the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway. These results indicate that both the <i>CpMYC2 and CpbHLH13</i> transcription factors of wintersweet are possibly involved in the positive regulation and biosynthesis of monoterpene (linalool) and sesquiterpene (\u03b2-caryophyllene) in transgenic plants.
