Chemical defense involves the synthesis' pathways of specialized toxic, repellent, or anti-nutritive metabolites to herbivores. Molecular evolutionary studies have revealed the origin of new genes, acquisition and functional diversification along time in different plant lineages.<h4>Methods</h4>Using bioinformatic tools we analyze gene divergence of tropane alkaloids (TAs) and terpene synthases (TPSs) in <i>Datura stramonium</i> and other species of Solanaceae; compared gene and amino acids sequence of TAs and TPSs on genomes, cDNA and proteins sequences of Viridiplantae. We analyzed two recently assembled genomes of <i>D. stramonium</i> (Ticum\u00e1n and Teotihuac\u00e1n), transcriptomes of <i>Datura metel</i> and genomes of other Solanaceae. Hence, we analyzed variation of TAs and TPSs to infer genes involved in plant defense and plant responses before stress. We analyzed protein modeling and molecular docking to predict interactions between H6H and ligand; we translated the sequences (Teo19488, Tic8550 and Tic8549) obtained from the two genomes of <i>D. stramonium</i> by using Swiss-Model and Ramachandran plot and MolProbity structure validation of Teo19488 protein model.<h4>Results</h4>For TAs, we detected an expansion event in the tropinone reductase II (TRII) and the ratio synonymous/non-synonymous substitutions indicate positive selection. In contrast, a contraction event and negative selection was detected in tropinone reductase I (TRI). In Hy-oscyamine 6 b-hydroxylase (H6H), enzyme involved in the production of tropane alkaloids atropine and scopolamine, the synonymous/non-synonymous substitution ratio in its dominion indicates positive selection. For terpenes (TPS), we found 18 DsTPS in <i>D. stramomiun</i> and seven in <i>D. metel</i>; evolutionary analyses detected positive selection in TPS10.1 and TPS10.2 of <i>D. stramonium</i> and <i>D. metel</i>. Comparison of copies of TPSs in <i>D. stramonium</i> detected variation among them in the binding site. Duplication events and differentiation of TAs and TPSs of <i>D. stramonium</i>, as compared to other Solanaceae, suggest their possible involvement on adaptive evolution of defense to herbivores.

The assembled genome size of D. chrysotoxum was 1.37\u2009Gb, with a contig N50 value of 1.54\u2009Mb. Of the sequences, 95.75% were anchored to 19 pseudochromosomes. There were 30,044 genes predicted in the D. chrysotoxum genome. Two whole-genome polyploidization events occurred in D. chrysotoxum. In terms of the second event, whole-genome duplication (WGD) was also found to have occurred in other Orchidaceae members, which diverged mainly via gene loss immediately after the WGD event occurred; the first duplication was found to have occurred in most monocots (tau event). We identified sugar transporter (SWEET) gene family expansion, which might be related to the abundant medicinal compounds and fleshy stems of D. chrysotoxum. MADS-box genes were identified in D. chrysotoxum, as well as members of TPS and Hsp90 gene families, which are associated with resistance, which may contribute to the adaptive evolution of orchids. We also investigated the interplay among carotenoid, ABA, and ethylene biosynthesis in D. chrysotoxum to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of the short flowering period of orchids with yellow flowers.

The assembled genome size of D. chrysotoxum was 1.37\u2009Gb, with a contig N50 value of 1.54\u2009Mb. Of the sequences, 95.75% were anchored to 19 pseudochromosomes. There were 30,044 genes predicted in the D. chrysotoxum genome. Two whole-genome polyploidization events occurred in D. chrysotoxum. In terms of the second event, whole-genome duplication (WGD) was also found to have occurred in other Orchidaceae members, which diverged mainly via gene loss immediately after the WGD event occurred; the first duplication was found to have occurred in most monocots (tau event). We identified sugar transporter (SWEET) gene family expansion, which might be related to the abundant medicinal compounds and fleshy stems of D. chrysotoxum. MADS-box genes were identified in D. chrysotoxum, as well as members of TPS and Hsp90 gene families, which are associated with resistance, which may contribute to the adaptive evolution of orchids. We also investigated the interplay among carotenoid, ABA, and ethylene biosynthesis in D. chrysotoxum to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of the short flowering period of orchids with yellow flowers. The reference D. chrysotoxum genome will provide important insights for further research on medicinal active ingredients and breeding and enhances the understanding of orchid evolution.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8408244?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Horticulture research", "authorinfo": ["Zhang Y", "Zhang GQ", "Zhang D", "Liu XD", "Xu XY", "Sun WH", "Yu X", "Zhu X", "Wang ZW", "Zhao X", "Zhong WY", "Chen H", "Yin WL", "Huang T", "Niu SC", "Liu ZJ"], "title": "Chromosome-scale assembly of the Dendrobium chrysotoxum genome enhances the understanding of orchid evolution."}, "PMC7284416": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "32357450", "source": "MED", "pmid": "32357450", "pmcid": "PMC7284416", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7284416"}, "doi": "10.3390/plants9050552", "title": "The Product Specificities of Maize Terpene Synthases TPS4 and TPS10 Are Determined both by Active Site Amino Acids and Residues Adjacent to the Active Site.", "authorString": "K\u00f6llner TG, Degenhardt J, Gershenzon J.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "K\u00f6llner TG", "firstName": "Tobias G", "lastName": "K\u00f6llner", "initials": "TG", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7037-904X"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Hans-Kn\u00f6ll-Strasse 8, D-07745 Jena, Germany."}}}, {"fullName": "Degenhardt J", "firstName": "J\u00f6rg", "lastName": "Degenhardt", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute for Pharmacy, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Hoher Weg 8, D-06120 Halle/Saale, Germany."}}}, {"fullName": "Gershenzon J", "firstName": "Jonathan", "lastName": "Gershenzon", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Hans-Kn\u00f6ll-Strasse 8, D-07745 Jena, Germany."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7037-904X"}}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "5", "volume": "9", "journalIssueId": "2948246", "dateOfPublication": "2020 Apr", "monthOfPublication": "4", "yearOfPublication": "2020", "printPublicationDate": "2020-04-01", "journal": {"title": "Plants (Basel, Switzerland)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Plants (Basel)", "medlineAbbreviation": "Plants (Basel)", "NLMid": "101596181", "ISSN": "2223-7747", "ESSN": "2223-7747"}}, "pubYear": "2020", "abstractText": "Terpene synthases make up a large family of enzymes that convert prenyl diphosphates into an enormous variety of terpene skeletons.

Here we investigated genetic variability in induced responses to stemborer egg-laying in maize Zea mays (L.) (Poaceae). We conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) of 146 maize genotypes comprising of landraces, inbred lines and commercial hybrids. Plants were phenotyped in bioassays measuring parasitic wasp Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) attraction to volatiles collected from plants exposed to stemborer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) eggs. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to generate maize germplasm SNP data for GWAS. The egg-induced parasitoid attraction trait was more common in landraces than in improved inbred lines and hybrids. GWAS identified 101 marker-trait associations (MTAs), some of which were adjacent to genes involved in the JA-defence pathway (opr7, aos1, 2, 3), terpene biosynthesis (fps3, tps2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10), benzoxazinone synthesis (bx7, 9) and known resistance genes (e.g. maize insect resistance 1, mir1). Intriguingly, there was also association with a transmembrane protein kinase that may function as a receptor for the egg elicitor and other genes implicated in early plant defence signalling.

Here we investigated genetic variability in induced responses to stemborer egg-laying in maize Zea mays (L.) (Poaceae). We conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) of 146 maize genotypes comprising of landraces, inbred lines and commercial hybrids. Plants were phenotyped in bioassays measuring parasitic wasp Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) attraction to volatiles collected from plants exposed to stemborer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) eggs. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to generate maize germplasm SNP data for GWAS. The egg-induced parasitoid attraction trait was more common in landraces than in improved inbred lines and hybrids. GWAS identified 101 marker-trait associations (MTAs), some of which were adjacent to genes involved in the JA-defence pathway (opr7, aos1, 2, 3), terpene biosynthesis (fps3, tps2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10), benzoxazinone synthesis (bx7, 9) and known resistance genes (e.g. maize insect resistance 1, mir1). Intriguingly, there was also association with a transmembrane protein kinase that may function as a receptor for the egg elicitor and other genes implicated in early plant defence signalling.

This is the first reported instance of FOH and CoQ<sub>10</sub> co-production in R. sphaeroides using a metabolic engineering strategy.", "Keywords": ["RNAi", "Farnesol", "CoQ10", "Psy", "Carbon\u00a0flux"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6544981?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Microbial cell factories", "authorinfo": ["Chen X", "Jiang X", "Xu M", "Zhang M", "Huang R", "Huang J", "Qi F"], "title": "Co-production of farnesol and coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> from metabolically engineered Rhodobacter sphaeroides."}, "PMC7830437": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "33467778", "source": "MED", "pmid": "33467778", "pmcid": "PMC7830437", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7830437"}, "doi": "10.3390/ijms22020848", "title": "Characterization and Function of the 1-Deoxy-D-xylose-5-Phosphate Synthase (DXS) Gene Related to Terpenoid Synthesis in <i>Pinus massoniana</i>.", "authorString": "Li R, Chen P, Zhu L, Wu F, Chen Y, Zhu P, Ji K.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Li R", "firstName": "Rong", "lastName": "Li", "initials": "R", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-4954-7926"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Genetics & Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Chen P", "firstName": "Peizhen", "lastName": "Chen", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Genetics & Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Zhu L", "firstName": "Lingzhi", "lastName": "Zhu", "initials": "L", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Genetics & Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Wu F", "firstName": "Fan", "lastName": "Wu", "initials": "F", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6319-6675"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Genetics & Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Chen Y", "firstName": "Yu", "lastName": "Chen", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Genetics & Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Zhu P", "firstName": "Peihuang", "lastName": "Zhu", "initials": "P", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Genetics & Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China."}}}, {"fullName": "Ji K", "firstName": "Kongshu", "lastName": "Ji", "initials": "K", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-9250-8036"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Forest Genetics & Biotechnology of Ministry of Education, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing 210037, China."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-9250-8036"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-4954-7926"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-6319-6675"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": "supporting_data"}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "2", "volume": "22", "journalIssueId": "3087762", "dateOfPublication": "2021 Jan", "monthOfPublication": "1", "yearOfPublication": "2021", "printPublicationDate": "2021-01-01", "journal": {"title": "International journal of molecular sciences", "ISOAbbreviation": "Int J Mol Sci", "medlineAbbreviation": "Int J Mol Sci", "NLMid": "101092791", "ISSN": "1422-0067", "ESSN": "1422-0067"}}, "pubYear": "2021", "abstractText": "In the methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, 1-deoxy-D-xylose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) is considered the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of terpenoids.

Although some terpene synthases have been characterized, terpenoids and their biosynthesis in wheat (<i>Triticum</i> <i>aestivum</i> L.) still remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the identification of a terpene synthase gene in wheat. It encodes a sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes \u03b2-patchoulene formation with <i>E,E</i>-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrate, thus named as TaPS. TaPS exhibits inducible expression in wheat in response to various elicitations. Particularly, alamethicin treatment strongly induces <i>TaPS</i> gene expression and \u03b2-patchoulene accumulation in wheat. Overexpression of <i>TaPS</i> in Arabidopsis successfully produces \u03b2-patchoulene, verifying the biochemical function of TaPS in planta. Furthermore, these transgenic Arabidopsis plants exhibit resistance against herbivory by repelling beet armyworm larvae feeding, thereby indicating anti-herbivory activity of \u03b2-patchoulene. The catalytic mechanism of TaPS is also explored by homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis.

Although some terpene synthases have been characterized, terpenoids and their biosynthesis in wheat (<i>Triticum</i> <i>aestivum</i> L.) still remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the identification of a terpene synthase gene in wheat. It encodes a sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes \u03b2-patchoulene formation with <i>E,E</i>-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrate, thus named as TaPS. TaPS exhibits inducible expression in wheat in response to various elicitations. Particularly, alamethicin treatment strongly induces <i>TaPS</i> gene expression and \u03b2-patchoulene accumulation in wheat. Overexpression of <i>TaPS</i> in Arabidopsis successfully produces \u03b2-patchoulene, verifying the biochemical function of TaPS in planta. Furthermore, these transgenic Arabidopsis plants exhibit resistance against herbivory by repelling beet armyworm larvae feeding, thereby indicating anti-herbivory activity of \u03b2-patchoulene. The catalytic mechanism of TaPS is also explored by homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. Two key amino acids are identified to act in protonation and stability of intermediates and product formation. Taken together, one wheat sesquiterpene synthase is identified as \u03b2-patchoulene synthase.

Their putative TPS proteins were phylogenetically positioned in a sole clade with the TPSs of other Camellia species. The obtained Tps genes, one of which was designated ChTps1 (ChTps1a), were introduced into mevalonate-pathway-engineered Escherichia coli, which carried the genes for utilizing acetoacetate as a substrate, and cultured in a medium including lithium acetoacetate. Volatile products generated in the E. coli cells transformed with ChTps1 were purified from the cell suspension culture, and analyzed by NMR. Consequently, the predominant product with ChTPS1 was identified as valerianol, indicating that the ChTps1 gene codes for valerianol synthase.

of urban greening and the pleasant aroma emitted from its flowers. The floral scent is determined by several monoterpenoid volatiles, such as linalool and its oxides, which are a few of the most common volatiles and the main components of the essential oils in most sweet osmanthus cultivars. In addition, the relative contents of <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-linalool oxide (furan) may affect the aromas and quality of the essential oils. MYB proteins represent the largest family of transcription factors in plants and participate in regulating secondary metabolites. Several <i>cis</i>-elements, especially AC-rich regions, are known to be bound by 2R-MYBs and could be found in the promoter of the enzyme genes in the terpenoid metabolic pathway. However, there has to date been no investigation into the 2R-MYB family genes involved in regulating terpenoid biosynthesis in <i>O. fragrans</i>. Here, 243 non-redundant 2R-MYB proteins were grouped into 33 clusters based on the phylogeny and exon-intron distribution. These genes were unevenly distributed on 23 chromosomes. Ka/Ks analysis showed that the major mode of 2R-MYB gene evolution was purifying selection. Expression analysis indicated that 2R-MYB genes in <i>O. fragrans</i> exhibited varied expression patterns.

These two herbs are not only morphologically distinguishable, but their secondary metabolites - especially the essential oils present in flowers are also different, especially the terpenoids. The aim of this project was to preliminarily identify regulatory mechanisms in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathways that differ between German and Roman chamomile by performing comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. RESULTS:We determined the content of essential oils in disk florets and ray florets in these two chamomile species, and found that the terpenoid content in flowers of German chamomile is greater than that of Roman chamomile. In addition, a comparative RNA-seq analysis of German and Roman chamomile showed that 54% of genes shared >\u200975% sequence identity between the two species. In particular, more highly expressed DEGs (differentially expressed genes) and TF (transcription factor) genes, different regulation of CYPs (cytochrome P450 enzymes), and rapid evolution of downstream genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway of German chamomile could be the main reasons to explain the differences in the types and levels of terpenoid compounds in these two species.

These two herbs are not only morphologically distinguishable, but their secondary metabolites - especially the essential oils present in flowers are also different, especially the terpenoids. The aim of this project was to preliminarily identify regulatory mechanisms in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathways that differ between German and Roman chamomile by performing comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. RESULTS:We determined the content of essential oils in disk florets and ray florets in these two chamomile species, and found that the terpenoid content in flowers of German chamomile is greater than that of Roman chamomile. In addition, a comparative RNA-seq analysis of German and Roman chamomile showed that 54% of genes shared >\u200975% sequence identity between the two species. In particular, more highly expressed DEGs (differentially expressed genes) and TF (transcription factor) genes, different regulation of CYPs (cytochrome P450 enzymes), and rapid evolution of downstream genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway of German chamomile could be the main reasons to explain the differences in the types and levels of terpenoid compounds in these two species. In addition, a phylogenetic tree constructed from single copy genes showed that German chamomile and Roman chamomile are closely related to Chrysanthemum nankingense.

The high oleoresin content of loblolly pine is associated with resistance to bark beetles and other economic benefits. In this study, we conducted transcriptome analyses of loblolly pine secondary xylem to gain insight into the genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. A total of 372 unigenes were identified as being critical for oleoresin production, including genes for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, the cytochrome P450 (CYP) protein family, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis enzymes. Six key genes involved in terpenoid biosynthetic pathways were selected for multiple sequence alignment, conserved motif prediction, and phylogenetic and expression profile analyses. The protein sequences of all six genes exhibited a higher degree of sequence conservation, and upstream genes were relatively more conserved than downstream genes in terpenoid biosynthetic pathways. The N-terminal regions of these sequences were less conserved than the C-terminal ends, as the N-terminals were quite diverse in both length and composition.

The high oleoresin content of loblolly pine is associated with resistance to bark beetles and other economic benefits. In this study, we conducted transcriptome analyses of loblolly pine secondary xylem to gain insight into the genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. A total of 372 unigenes were identified as being critical for oleoresin production, including genes for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, the cytochrome P450 (CYP) protein family, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis enzymes. Six key genes involved in terpenoid biosynthetic pathways were selected for multiple sequence alignment, conserved motif prediction, and phylogenetic and expression profile analyses. The protein sequences of all six genes exhibited a higher degree of sequence conservation, and upstream genes were relatively more conserved than downstream genes in terpenoid biosynthetic pathways. The N-terminal regions of these sequences were less conserved than the C-terminal ends, as the N-terminals were quite diverse in both length and composition. The phylogenetic analyses revealed that most genes originated from gene duplication after species divergence, and partial genes exhibited incomplete lineage sorting.

Constitutive isoprene emissions were strongly upregulated by ozone and combined ozone and wounding treatments and remained high through recovery phase, but wounding applied alone reduced isoprene emission. All stress treatments enhanced emissions of lipoxygenase pathway volatiles (LOX), mono- and sesquiterpenes, saturated aldehydes (C7-C10), benzenoids, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) pathway volatiles. Once elicited, GGDP volatile, saturated aldehyde and benzenoid emissions remained high through the recovery period. In contrast, LOX emissions, and total mono- and sesquiterpene emissions decreased through recovery period. However, secondary rises in total sesquiterpene emissions at 75 h and in total monoterpenes at 25-50 h were observed. Overall, acute ozone and wounding treatments synergistically altered gas exchange characteristics and stress volatile emissions. Through the treatments and recovery period, stomatal ozone uptake rate and volatile emission rates were poorly correlated, reflecting possible ozone-scavenging effect of volatiles and thus, reduction of effective ozone dose and elicitation of induced defense by the acute ozone concentrations applied. These results underscore the important role of interactive stresses on both constitutive and induced volatile emission responses.", "affiliation": "Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Kreutzwaldi 1, Tartu 51014, Estonia.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"agency": "European Regional Development Fund (Center of Excellence EcolChange)", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "322603", "agency": "European Commission through the European Research Council", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "Estonian Ministry of Science and Education (institutional grant IUT-8-3)", "orderIn": "0"}, {"grantId": "322603", "agency": "European Research Council", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Synergistic effects", "Isoprene Emission", "Stress Interaction", "Stomatal Ozone Uptake", "Monoterpene Emission", "Lox Products", "Acute Ozone Stress", "Benzenoid Emission", "Sesquiterpene Emission"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.10.012"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6020072"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6020072?pdf=render"}, {"availability": "Free", "availabilityCode": "F", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.10.012"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "N", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "13", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "authMan": "Y", "epmcAuthMan": "Y", "nihAuthMan": "N", "manuscriptId": "EMS78273", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2018-07-05", "firstIndexDate": "2018-07-05", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2020-10-22", "dateOfRevision": "2019-11-20", "firstPublicationDate": "2018-01-01", "embargoDate": "2018-07-01"}, "abstract": "Both ozone and wounding constitute two key abiotic stress factors, but their interactive effects on plant constitutive and stress-elicited volatile (VOC) emissions are poorly understood.

Therefore, in the present study, RNA interference (Ri) and overexpression (Oe) rice lines were generated to investigate the potential function of TPS46 in <i>Oryza sativa</i> sp. <i>japonica</i>. Interestingly, the rice plants become more susceptible to <i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> when expression of <i>tps</i>46 was silenced compared with Wt in greenhouse conditions. Artificial infestation bioassays further confirmed that Ri rice lines were susceptible to <i>R. padi</i>, whereas Oe rice lines were repellent to <i>R. padi</i>. Based on GC-MS and ToF-MS analysis, a total of eight volatile products catalyzed by TPS46 in rice were identified. Among them, only limonene and E\u03b2f could be detected in all the Ri, Oe, and Wt lines, whereas other six volatiles were only found in the blend of volatiles from Oe lines. Moreover, the amount of constitutive limonene and E\u03b2f in the Ri lines was significantly lower than in Wt lines, while the amounts of these two volatiles in the Oe line were obviously higher than in control rice. Our data suggested that the constitutive emissions of E\u03b2f and limonene regulated by the constitutive expression of <i>tps</i>46 may play a crucial role in rice defense against <i>R. padi.</i> Consequently, <i>tps</i>46 could be a potential target gene to be employed for improving the resistance of plants to aphids.", "Keywords": ["Rhopalosiphum padi", "Insect\u2013plant Interactions", "(E)-\u03b2-farnesene", "Tps46", "Terpene Syntheses"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5289981?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Frontiers in plant science", "authorinfo": ["Sun Y", "Huang X", "Ning Y", "Jing W", "Bruce TJ", "Qi F", "Xu Q", "Wu K", "Zhang Y", "Guo Y"], "title": "TPS46, a Rice Terpene Synthase Conferring Natural Resistance to Bird Cherry-Oat Aphid, <i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> (Linnaeus)."}, "PMC6890757": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31796833", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31796833", "pmcid": "PMC6890757", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6890757"}, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-54815-6", "title": "Draft genome of Tanacetum cinerariifolium, the natural source of mosquito coil.", "authorString": "Yamashiro T, Shiraishi A, Satake H, Nakayama K.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Yamashiro T", "firstName": "Takanori", "lastName": "Yamashiro", "initials": "T", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Dainihon Jochugiku Co., Ltd., 1-1-11 Daikoku-cho, Toyonaka, Osaka, 561-0827, Japan."}}}, {"fullName": "Shiraishi A", "firstName": "Akira", "lastName": "Shiraishi", "initials": "A", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-3456-3074"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Bioorganic Research Institute, Suntory Foundation for Life Sciences, Kyoto, 619-0284, Japan."}}}, {"fullName": "Satake H", "firstName": "Honoo", "lastName": "Satake", "initials": "H", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-1165-3624"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Bioorganic Research Institute, Suntory Foundation for Life Sciences, Kyoto, 619-0284, Japan. satake@sunbor.or.jp."}}}, {"fullName": "Nakayama K", "firstName": "Koji", "lastName": "Nakayama", "initials": "K", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Dainihon Jochugiku Co., Ltd., 1-1-11 Daikoku-cho, Toyonaka, Osaka, 561-0827, Japan. k.nakayama@kincho.co.jp."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-1165-3624"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-3456-3074"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["related_data", "supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "9", "journalIssueId": "2887502", "dateOfPublication": "2019 Dec", "monthOfPublication": "12", "yearOfPublication": "2019", "printPublicationDate": "2019-12-01", "journal": {"title": "Scientific reports", "ISOAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "medlineAbbreviation": "Sci Rep", "NLMid": "101563288", "ISSN": "2045-2322", "ESSN": "2045-2322"}}, "pubYear": "2019", "pageInfo": "18249", "abstractText": "Pyrethrum (Tanacetum cinerariifolium), which is a perennial Asteraceae plant with white daisy-like flowers, is the original source of mosquito coils and is known for the biosynthesis of the pyrethrin class of natural insecticides.

Growth and physiological parameters were adversely affected under both the treatments with varying magnitude. The observation of leaf surfaces showed increase in stomatal and trichome densities suggesting the adaptive resilience of the plants against UV-B. Besides, biosynthesis of wedelolactone, a major medicinal compound of <i>E. alba</i> was observed to be stimulated under UV-B exposure. The essential oil content was reduced under IT while increased under CT. A total of 114 compounds were identified from oil extract of <i>E. alba</i>. <i>n</i>-Pentadecane (25.79%), <i>n</i>-Octadecane (12.98%), \u03b2-Farnesene (9.43%), \u03b1-Humulene (4.95%) (E)-Caryophyllene (4.87%), Phytol (4.25%), \u03b1-Copaene (2.26%), Humulene epoxide (1.46%), \u03b2-Pinene (1.07) and \u03b2-Caryophyllene oxide (1.06%) were identified as major components of oil. CT induced the synthesis of some medicinally important compounds such as \u03b1-terpineol, \u03b4-cadinene, linolenic acid, methyl linoleate and myristic acid amide. Hence, the study revealed that continuous UV-B exposure of low intensity could be helpful for commercial exploitation of essential oil in <i>E. alba</i>.", "Keywords": ["Growth", "Physiology",

Herein, we evaluated the phytotoxic effects of purified CUL and CUL-trichothecene mixtures using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii growth and Triticum aestivum (wheat) root elongation assays.

As C234 is efficiently metabolized by CYP71BE79, plants of cotton lineage have evolved a highly active enzyme to prevent the phytotoxic intermediate accumulation during gossypol pathway evolution.

However, little is known about the molecular and genetic resources of this long-lived conifer. Herein, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four organs of <i>P. chienii</i> using the PacBio Isoform Sequencing and Illumina RNA Sequencing platforms. Based on the PacBio Iso-Seq data, we obtained 44,896, 58,082, 50,485, and 67,638 full-length unigenes from the root, stem, leaf, and strobilus, respectively, with a mean length of 2692 bp, and a mean N50 length of 3010.75 bp. We then comprehensively annotated these unigenes. The number of organ-specific expressed unigenes ranged from 4393 in leaf to 9124 in strobilus, suggesting their special roles in physiological processes, organ development, and adaptability in the different four organs. A total of 16,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the four organs and clustered into six subclusters. The gene families related to biotic/abiotic factors, including the TPS, CYP450, and HSP families, were characterized. The expression levels of most DEGs in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and plant-pathogen interactions were higher in the root than in the three other organs, suggesting that root constitutes the main organ of defensive compound synthesis and accumulation and has a stronger ability to respond to stress. The sequences were analyzed to predict transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, and alternative splicing events. The expression levels of most DEGs of C2H2, C3H, bHLH, and bZIP families in the root and stem were higher than those in the leaf and strobilus, indicating that these TFs may play a crucial role in the survival of the root and stem. These results comprise the first comprehensive gene expression profiles obtained for different organs of <i>P. chienii</i>.

chienii</i>, a rare tertiary relict species with economic and ecological value, is a representative of the monotypic genus <i>Pseudotaxus</i> that is endemic to China. <i>P. chienii</i> can adapt well to habitat isolation and ecological heterogeneity under a variety of climate and soil conditions, and is able to survive in harsh environments. However, little is known about the molecular and genetic resources of this long-lived conifer. Herein, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four organs of <i>P. chienii</i> using the PacBio Isoform Sequencing and Illumina RNA Sequencing platforms. Based on the PacBio Iso-Seq data, we obtained 44,896, 58,082, 50,485, and 67,638 full-length unigenes from the root, stem, leaf, and strobilus, respectively, with a mean length of 2692 bp, and a mean N50 length of 3010.75 bp. We then comprehensively annotated these unigenes. The number of organ-specific expressed unigenes ranged from 4393 in leaf to 9124 in strobilus, suggesting their special roles in physiological processes, organ development, and adaptability in the different four organs. A total of 16,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the four organs and clustered into six subclusters. The gene families related to biotic/abiotic factors, including the TPS, CYP450, and HSP families, were characterized. The expression levels of most DEGs in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and plant-pathogen interactions were higher in the root than in the three other organs, suggesting that root constitutes the main organ of defensive compound synthesis and accumulation and has a stronger ability to respond to stress. The sequences were analyzed to predict transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, and alternative splicing events. The expression levels of most DEGs of C2H2, C3H, bHLH, and bZIP families in the root and stem were higher than those in the leaf and strobilus, indicating that these TFs may play a crucial role in the survival of the root and stem. These results comprise the first comprehensive gene expression profiles obtained for different organs of <i>P. chienii</i>. Our findings will facilitate further studies on the functional genomics, adaptive evolution, and phylogeny of <i>P. chienii</i>, and lay the foundation for the development of conservation strategies for this endangered conifer.", "Keywords": ["Pseudotaxus chienii", "Transcriptome", "Multiple Organs", "Plant\u2013pathogen Interactions", "Pacbio Iso-seq", "Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis Pathway"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7352595?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "International journal of molecular sciences", "authorinfo": ["Liu L", "Wang Z", "Su Y", "Wang T"], "title": "Characterization and Analysis of the Full-Length Transcriptomes of Multiple Organs in <i>Pseudotaxus chienii</i> (W.C.Cheng) W.C.Cheng."}, "PMC4197230": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "25303804", "source": "MED", "pmid": "25303804", "pmcid": "PMC4197230", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC4197230"}, "doi": "10.1186/s12870-014-0270-y", "title": "Terpene synthases and their contribution to herbivore-induced volatile emission in western balsam poplar (Populus trichocarpa).", "authorString": "Irmisch S, Jiang Y, Chen F, Gershenzon J, K\u00f6llner TG.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Irmisch S", "firstName": "Sandra", "lastName": "Irmisch", "initials": "S", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1821-4934"}}, {"fullName": "Jiang Y", "firstName": "Yifan", "lastName": "Jiang", "initials": "Y"}, {"fullName": "Chen F", "firstName": "Feng", "lastName": "Chen", "initials": "F"}, {"fullName": "Gershenzon J", "firstName": "Jonathan", "lastName": "Gershenzon", "initials": "J"}, {"fullName": "K\u00f6llner TG", "firstName": "Tobias G", "lastName": "K\u00f6llner", "initials": "TG", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7037-904X"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Hans-Kn\u00f6ll-Strasse 8, Jena, Germany. koellner@ice.mpg.de."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-1821-4934"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7037-904X"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["related_data", "supporting_data"]}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "14", "journalIssueId": "2481294", "dateOfPublication": "2014 Oct", "monthOfPublication": "10", "yearOfPublication": "2014", "printPublicationDate": "2014-10-01", "journal": {"title": "BMC plant biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "BMC Plant Biol", "medlineAbbreviation": "BMC Plant Biol", "NLMid": "100967807", "ISSN": "1471-2229", "ESSN": "1471-2229"}}, "pubYear": "2014", "pageInfo": "270", "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>As a response to caterpillar feeding, poplar releases a complex mixture of volatiles which comprises several classes of compounds.

potent anti-herbivore defense metabolites known as 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides (HGL-DTGs) whose glycosylation and malonylation biosynthetic steps are regulated by jasmonate

To characterize the biosynthetic pathway of HGL-DTGs, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases (UGTs) and identified 107 family-1 UGT members. The transcript levels of three UGTs were highly correlated with the transcript levels two key HGL-DTG biosynthetic genes: geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (NaGGPPS) and geranyllinalool synthase (NaGLS). NaGLS's role in HGL-DTG biosynthesis was confirmed by virus-induced gene silencing. Silencing the Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-rhamnosyltransferase gene UGT91T1 demonstrated its role in the rhamnosylation of HGL-DTGs. In vitro enzyme assays revealed that UGT74P3 and UGT74P4 use UDP-glucose for the glucosylation of 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool (17-HGL) to lyciumoside I. Plants with stable silencing of UGT74P3 and UGT74P5 were severely developmentally deformed, pointing to a phytotoxic effect of the aglycone. The application of synthetic 17-HGL and silencing of the UGTs in HGL-DTG-free plants confirmed this phytotoxic effect. Feeding assays with tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) larvae revealed the defensive functions of the glucosylation and rhamnosylation steps in HGL-DTG biosynthesis. Glucosylation of 17-HGL is therefore a critical step that contributes to the resulting metabolites' defensive function and solves the autotoxicity problem of this potent chemical defense.",

In vitro enzyme assays revealed that UGT74P3 and UGT74P4 use UDP-glucose for the glucosylation of 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool (17-HGL) to lyciumoside I. Plants with stable silencing of UGT74P3 and UGT74P5 were severely developmentally deformed, pointing to a phytotoxic effect of the aglycone. The application of synthetic 17-HGL and silencing of the UGTs in HGL-DTG-free plants confirmed this phytotoxic effect. Feeding assays with tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) larvae revealed the defensive functions of the glucosylation and rhamnosylation steps in HGL-DTG biosynthesis. Glucosylation of 17-HGL is therefore a critical step that contributes to the resulting metabolites' defensive function and solves the autotoxicity problem of this potent chemical defense.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8254506?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "The Plant cell", "authorinfo": ["Heiling S", "Llorca LC", "Li J", "Gase K", "Schmidt A", "Sch\u00e4fer M", "Schneider B", "Halitschke R", "Gaquerel E", "Baldwin IT"], "title": "Specific decorations of 17-hydroxygeranyllinalool diterpene glycosides solve the autotoxicity problem of chemical defense in Nicotiana attenuata."}, "PMC3570303": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "23363415", "source": "MED", "pmid": "23363415", "pmcid": "PMC3570303", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC3570303"}, "doi": "10.1186/1471-2229-13-15", "title": "Localization of sesquiterpene formation and emission in maize leaves after herbivore damage.", "authorString": "K\u00f6llner TG, Lenk C, Schnee C, K\u00f6pke S, Lindemann P, Gershenzon J, Degenhardt J.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "K\u00f6llner TG", "firstName": "Tobias G", "lastName": "K\u00f6llner", "initials": "TG", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7037-904X"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany. koellner@ice.mpg.de"}}}, {"fullName": "Lenk C", "firstName": "Claudia", "lastName": "Lenk", "initials": "C"}, {"fullName": "Schnee C", "firstName": "Christiane", "lastName": "Schnee", "initials": "C"}, {"fullName": "K\u00f6pke S", "firstName": "Sabrina", "lastName": "K\u00f6pke", "initials": "S"}, {"fullName": "Lindemann P", "firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "Lindemann", "initials": "P", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5368-7510"}}, {"fullName": "Gershenzon J", "firstName": "Jonathan", "lastName": "Gershenzon", "initials": "J"}, {"fullName": "Degenhardt J", "firstName": "J\u00f6rg", "lastName": "Degenhardt", "initials": "J"}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5368-7510"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-7037-904X"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "13", "journalIssueId": "2768193", "dateOfPublication": "2013 Jan", "monthOfPublication": "1", "yearOfPublication": "2013", "printPublicationDate": "2013-01-01", "journal": {"title": "BMC plant biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "BMC Plant Biol", "medlineAbbreviation": "BMC Plant Biol", "NLMid": "100967807", "ISSN": "1471-2229", "ESSN": "1471-2229"}}, "pubYear": "2013", "pageInfo": "15", "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Maize (Zea mays L.) leaves damaged by lepidopteran herbivores emit a complex volatile blend that can attract natural enemies of the herbivores and may also have roles in direct defense and inter- or intra-plant signaling.

Floral scents are a key factor in plant-insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to \u03b2-thujene, sabinene, \u03b2-pinene, and \u03b1-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate.

Floral scents are a key factor in plant-insect interactions and are vital for successful pollination. C. odorata var. fruticosa, or dwarf ylang ylang, is a variety of ylang ylang that is popularly grown in Southeast Asia as a small shrub with aromatic flowers. Here, we describe the combined use of bioinformatics and chemical analysis to discover genes for the VOC biosynthesis pathways and related genes. The scented flowers of C. odorata var. fruticosa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a total of 49 VOCs were identified at four different stages of flower development. The bulk of these VOCs were terpenes, mainly sesquiterpenes. To identify the various terpene synthases (TPSs) involved in the production of these essential oils, we performed RNA sequencing on mature flowers. From the RNA sequencing data, four full-length TPSs were functionally characterized. In vitro assays showed that two of these TPSs were mono-TPSs. CoTPS1 synthesized four products corresponding to \u03b2-thujene, sabinene, \u03b2-pinene, and \u03b1-terpinene from geranyl pyrophosphate and CoTPS4 produced geraniol from geranyl pyrophosphate. The other two TPSs were identified as sesqui-TPSs. CoTPS3 catalysed the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate to \u03b1-bergamotene, whereas CoTPS2 was found to be a multifunctional and novel TPS that could catalyse the synthesis of three sesquiterpenes, \u03b2-ylangene, \u03b2-copaene, and \u03b2-cubebene.

These hypotheses have often been tested by transforming plants with sesquiterpene synthases expressed behind the constitutively active 35S promoter, which may have physiological costs measured as inhibited growth and reduced reproduction or may require augmentation of substrate pools to achieve enhanced emission, complicating the interpretation of data from affected transgenic lines. Here, we expressed maize (Zea mays) terpene synthase10 (ZmTPS10), which produces (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, or a point mutant ZmTPS10M, which produces primarily (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, under control of the 35S promoter in the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata. Transgenic N. attenuata plants had specifically enhanced emission of target sesquiterpene(s) with no changes detected in their emission of any other volatiles. Treatment with herbivore or jasmonate elicitors induces emission of (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene in wild-type plants and also tended to increase emission of (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and (E)-\u03b2-farnesene in transgenics. However, transgenics did not differ from the wild type in defense signaling or chemistry and did not alter defense chemistry in neighboring wild-type plants.

These hypotheses have often been tested by transforming plants with sesquiterpene synthases expressed behind the constitutively active 35S promoter, which may have physiological costs measured as inhibited growth and reduced reproduction or may require augmentation of substrate pools to achieve enhanced emission, complicating the interpretation of data from affected transgenic lines. Here, we expressed maize (Zea mays) terpene synthase10 (ZmTPS10), which produces (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, or a point mutant ZmTPS10M, which produces primarily (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, under control of the 35S promoter in the ecological model plant Nicotiana attenuata. Transgenic N. attenuata plants had specifically enhanced emission of target sesquiterpene(s) with no changes detected in their emission of any other volatiles. Treatment with herbivore or jasmonate elicitors induces emission of (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene in wild-type plants and also tended to increase emission of (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and (E)-\u03b2-farnesene in transgenics. However, transgenics did not differ from the wild type in defense signaling or chemistry and did not alter defense chemistry in neighboring wild-type plants. These data are inconsistent with within-plant and between-plant signaling functions of (E)-\u03b2-farnesene and (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene in N. attenuata. Ectopic sesquiterpene emission was apparently not costly for transgenics, which were similar to wild-type plants in their growth and reproduction, even when forced to compete for common resources.

Isoprenoids are hydrocarbon-based compounds with different carbon chain lengths and diverse chemical structures, similar to petroleum. Thus, isoprenoid alcohols such as isopentenol (C<sub>5</sub>), geraniol (C<sub>10</sub>), and farnesol (C<sub>15</sub>) have been considered to be ideal biofuel candidates. NudB, a native phosphatase of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, is reported to dephosphorylate isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) into isopentenol. However, no attention has been paid to its promiscuous activity toward longer chain length (C<sub>10</sub>-C<sub>15</sub>) prenyl diphosphates.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, the promiscuous activity of NudB toward geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) was applied for the production of isoprenoid alcohol mixtures, including isopentenol, geraniol, and farnesol, and their derivatives. <i>E. coli</i> was engineered to produce a mixture of C<sub>5</sub> and C<sub>15</sub> alcohols by overexpressing NudB (dihydroneopterin triphosphate diphosphohydrolase) and IspA (FPP synthase) along with a heterologous MVA pathway, which resulted in a total of up to 1652\u00a0mg/L mixture of C<sub>5</sub> and C<sub>15</sub> alcohols and their derivatives. The production was further increased to 2027\u00a0mg/L by overexpression of another endogenous phosphatase, AphA, in addition to NudB. Production of DMAPP- and FPP-derived alcohols and their derivatives was significantly increased with an increase in the gene dosage of <i>idi</i>, encoding IPP isomerase (IDI), indicating a potential modulation of the composition of the alcohols mixture according to the expression level of IDI.

Isoprenoids are hydrocarbon-based compounds with different carbon chain lengths and diverse chemical structures, similar to petroleum. Thus, isoprenoid alcohols such as isopentenol (C<sub>5</sub>), geraniol (C<sub>10</sub>), and farnesol (C<sub>15</sub>) have been considered to be ideal biofuel candidates. NudB, a native phosphatase of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, is reported to dephosphorylate isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) into isopentenol. However, no attention has been paid to its promiscuous activity toward longer chain length (C<sub>10</sub>-C<sub>15</sub>) prenyl diphosphates.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, the promiscuous activity of NudB toward geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) was applied for the production of isoprenoid alcohol mixtures, including isopentenol, geraniol, and farnesol, and their derivatives. <i>E. coli</i> was engineered to produce a mixture of C<sub>5</sub> and C<sub>15</sub> alcohols by overexpressing NudB (dihydroneopterin triphosphate diphosphohydrolase) and IspA (FPP synthase) along with a heterologous MVA pathway, which resulted in a total of up to 1652\u00a0mg/L mixture of C<sub>5</sub> and C<sub>15</sub> alcohols and their derivatives. The production was further increased to 2027\u00a0mg/L by overexpression of another endogenous phosphatase, AphA, in addition to NudB. Production of DMAPP- and FPP-derived alcohols and their derivatives was significantly increased with an increase in the gene dosage of <i>idi</i>, encoding IPP isomerase (IDI), indicating a potential modulation of the composition of the alcohols mixture according to the expression level of IDI. When IspA was replaced with its mutant IspA*, generating GPP in the production strain, a total of 1418\u00a0mg/L of the isoprenoid mixture was obtained containing C<sub>10</sub> alcohols as a main component.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The promiscuous activity of NudB was newly identified and successfully used for production of isoprenoid-based alcohol mixtures, which are suitable as next-generation biofuels or commodity chemicals.

Receiving plants utilize these molecules to prime their defenses and respond faster and stronger when actually attacked. To further characterize the biological activity of these compounds we performed a microarray analysis of global gene expression. The focus of this project was to identify early transcriptional events elicited by Z-3-hexenol (Z-3-HOL) as our model GLV in maize (Zea mays) seedlings. The microarray results confirmed previous studies on Z-3-HOL -induced gene expression but also provided novel information about the complexity of Z-3-HOL -induced transcriptional networks. Besides identifying a distinct set of genes involved in direct and indirect defenses we also found significant expression of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, Ca(2+)-and lipid-related signaling, and cell wall reinforcement. By comparing these results with those obtained by treatment of maize seedlings with insect elicitors we found a high degree of correlation between the two expression profiles at this early time point, in particular for those genes related to defense. We further analyzed defense gene expression induced by other volatile defense signals and found Z-3-HOL to be significantly more active than methyl jasmonate, methyl salicylate, and ethylene.

defense signals. Receiving plants utilize these molecules to prime their defenses and respond faster and stronger when actually attacked. To further characterize the biological activity of these compounds we performed a microarray analysis of global gene expression. The focus of this project was to identify early transcriptional events elicited by Z-3-hexenol (Z-3-HOL) as our model GLV in maize (Zea mays) seedlings. The microarray results confirmed previous studies on Z-3-HOL -induced gene expression but also provided novel information about the complexity of Z-3-HOL -induced transcriptional networks. Besides identifying a distinct set of genes involved in direct and indirect defenses we also found significant expression of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, Ca(2+)-and lipid-related signaling, and cell wall reinforcement. By comparing these results with those obtained by treatment of maize seedlings with insect elicitors we found a high degree of correlation between the two expression profiles at this early time point, in particular for those genes related to defense. We further analyzed defense gene expression induced by other volatile defense signals and found Z-3-HOL to be significantly more active than methyl jasmonate, methyl salicylate, and ethylene. The data presented herein provides important information on early genetic networks that are activated by Z-3-HOL and demonstrates the effectiveness of this compound in the regulation of typical plant defenses against insect herbivores in maize.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3796489?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "PloS one", "authorinfo": ["Engelberth J", "Contreras CF", "Dalvi C", "Li T", "Engelberth M"], "title": "Early transcriptome analyses of Z-3-Hexenol-treated zea mays revealed distinct transcriptional networks and anti-herbivore defense potential of green leaf volatiles."}, "PMC4801258": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "26936952", "source": "MED", "pmid": "26936952", "pmcid": "PMC4801258", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC4801258"}, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1523468113", "title": "Novel family of terpene synthases evolved from trans-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases in a flea beetle.", "authorString": "Beran F, Rahfeld P, Luck K, Nagel R, Vogel H, Wielsch N, Irmisch S, Ramasamy S, Gershenzon J, Heckel DG, K\u00f6llner TG.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Beran F", "firstName": "Franziska", "lastName": "Beran", "initials": "F", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Research Group Sequestration and Detoxification in Insects, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, 07745 Jena, Germany;

GERANYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (PbGDPS) is the key enzyme for monoterpene biosynthesis, and shows concomitant expression with the emission of monoterpenes during flower development in <i>P. bellina</i>. Here, we identified a dual repeat <i>cis</i>-element in the <i>GDPS</i> promoter that is critical for monoterpene biosynthesis in <i>Phalaenopsis</i> orchids. A strong correlation between the dual repeat and the monoterpene production was revealed by examination of the <i>GDPS</i> promoter fragments over 12 <i>Phalaenopsis</i> species. Serial-deletion of the 2-kb <i>GDPS</i> promoter fragments demonstrated that the integrity of the dual repeat was crucial for its promoter activities. By screening the <i>Arabidopsis</i> transcription factors (TFs) cDNA library using yeast one-hybrid assay, AtbZIP18, a member of group I of bZIP TFs, was identified to be able to bind the dual repeat. We then identified <i>PbbZIP4</i> in the transcriptome of <i>P. bellina</i>, showing 83% identity in the DNA binding region with that of AtbZIP18, and the expression level of <i>PbbZIP4</i> was higher in the scented orchids.

GERANYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (PbGDPS) is the key enzyme for monoterpene biosynthesis, and shows concomitant expression with the emission of monoterpenes during flower development in <i>P. bellina</i>. Here, we identified a dual repeat <i>cis</i>-element in the <i>GDPS</i> promoter that is critical for monoterpene biosynthesis in <i>Phalaenopsis</i> orchids.

Serial-deletion of the 2-kb <i>GDPS</i> promoter fragments demonstrated that the integrity of the dual repeat was crucial for its promoter activities. By screening the <i>Arabidopsis</i> transcription factors (TFs) cDNA library using yeast one-hybrid assay, AtbZIP18, a member of group I of bZIP TFs, was identified to be able to bind the dual repeat. We then identified <i>PbbZIP4</i> in the transcriptome of <i>P. bellina</i>, showing 83% identity in the DNA binding region with that of AtbZIP18, and the expression level of <i>PbbZIP4</i> was higher in the scented orchids.

toxic compounds, proteinase inhibitors, oxidative enzymes, and behavior-modifying volatiles. Similar responses occur when the plant is exposed to methyl jasmonate (MeJA). To compare the defense responses between stalk borer feeding and exogenous MeJA on a transcriptional level, we employed deep transcriptome sequencing methods following Ostrinia furnacalis leaf feeding and MeJA leaf treatment. 39,636 genes were found to be differentially expressed with O. furnacalis feeding, MeJA application, and O. furnacalis feeding and MeJA application. Following Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the up- or down- regulated genes, many were implicated in metabolic processes, stimuli-responsive catalytic activity, and transfer activity.

fujikuroi species complex (FFC) cause a wide spectrum of often devastating diseases on diverse agricultural crops, including coffee, fig, mango, maize, rice, and sugarcane. Although species within the FFC are difficult to distinguish by morphology, and their genes often share 90% sequence similarity, they can differ in host plant specificity and life style. FFC species can also produce structurally diverse secondary metabolites (SMs), including the mycotoxins fumonisins, fusarins, fusaric acid, and beauvericin, and the phytohormones gibberellins, auxins, and cytokinins. The spectrum of SMs produced can differ among closely related species, suggesting that SMs might be determinants of host specificity. To date, genomes of only a limited number of FFC species have been sequenced. Here, we provide draft genome sequences of three more members of the FFC: a single isolate of F. mangiferae, the cause of mango malformation, and two isolates of F. proliferatum, one a pathogen of maize and the other an orchid endophyte. We compared these genomes to publicly available genome sequences of three other FFC species. The comparisons revealed species-specific and isolate-specific differences in the composition and expression (in vitro and in planta) of genes involved in SM production including those for phytohormome biosynthesis.

Salvia miltiorrhiza, belonging to the largest and most widely distributed genus in the mint family, is a model medicinal plant with great economic and medicinal value. Diterpenoid tanshinones are the major lipophilic bioactive components in S. miltiorrhiza. Systematic analysis of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis has not been reported to date. Searching the recently available working draft of the S. miltiorrhiza genome, 40 terpenoid biosynthesis-related genes were identified, of which 27 are novel. These genes are members of 19 families, which encode all of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the universal isoprene precursor isopentenyl diphosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate, and two enzymes associated with the biosynthesis of labdane-related diterpenoids. Through a systematic analysis, it was found that 20 of the 40 genes could be involved in tanshinone biosynthesis. Using a comprehensive approach, the intron/exon structures and expression patterns of all identified genes and their responses to methyl jasmonate treatment were analysed.

Salvia miltiorrhiza, belonging to the largest and most widely distributed genus in the mint family, is a model medicinal plant with great economic and medicinal value. Diterpenoid tanshinones are the major lipophilic bioactive components in S. miltiorrhiza. Systematic analysis of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis has not been reported to date. Searching the recently available working draft of the S. miltiorrhiza genome, 40 terpenoid biosynthesis-related genes were identified, of which 27 are novel. These genes are members of 19 families, which encode all of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the universal isoprene precursor isopentenyl diphosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate, and two enzymes associated with the biosynthesis of labdane-related diterpenoids. Through a systematic analysis, it was found that 20 of the 40 genes could be involved in tanshinone biosynthesis. Using a comprehensive approach, the intron/exon structures and expression patterns of all identified genes and their responses to methyl jasmonate treatment were analysed. The conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships among the deduced S. miltiorrhiza proteins and their homologues isolated from other plant species were revealed. It was discovered that some of the key enzymes, such as 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase, 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, are encoded by multiple gene members with different expression patterns and subcellular localizations, and both homomeric and heteromeric geranyl diphosphate synthases exist in S. miltiorrhiza.
