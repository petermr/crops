Introduction</title><p>Huanglongbing (HLB) is one of most destructive citrus diseases worldwide, which is caused by the phloem-restricted bacterium <italic>Candidatus</italic> Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) and is easily transmitted through the citrus psyllid (ACP) <italic>Diaphorina citri</italic> [<xref rid="B1-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. CLas infection usually induces yellow shoots, blotchy mottled leaves, root degradation and decay, and ultimately tree death [<xref rid="B2-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. HLB disease has the characteristics of rapid spread and is extremely difficult to be eradicated. Once symptomatic citrus trees sporadically occur in a citrus orchard, the disease will spread throughout the whole orchard within two to three years, causing the citrus trees to lose their productive capacity [<xref rid="B3-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In China, the disease has been reported for more than two centuries and can affect all commercial citrus varieties [<xref rid="B4-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Currently, the disease has spread to more than 11 citrus-growing regions especially in Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi and Jiangxi provinces [<xref rid="B5-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since 2012, just in Ganzhou, Jiangxi province, more than 45 million infected trees have been removed, and the direct economic loss is estimated to be more than 9 billion yuan [<xref rid="B6-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a sustainable solution to suppress the spread of HLB disease and enable the continued economic production of CLas-infected citrus trees.</p><p>The traditional control measures of HLB disease include spraying insecticides for vector control, directly injecting antibiotics into the trunks of citrus trees, thermotherapy and use of nursery stock free of CLas etc. [<xref rid="B7-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, excessive pesticides can cause environmental pollution, insecticides and antibiotics left on the citrus are harmful to human health and thermotherapy has high requirements on the heating device and orchard terrain, and it also requires a lot of labour costs. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a novel and economic treatment strategy of HLB. It is well-known that the CLas bacterium, psyllid vectors, citrus hosts and the environment constitute the HLB disease pyramid [<xref rid="B9-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and each factor is necessary for development and prevalence of HLB disease. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on controlling citrus HLB disease by eliminating CLas bacterium and psyllid vectors and rogueing HLB-infected trees; there are few studies on the role of citrus growing environment, especially soil conditions on the management of HLB disease. </p><p>Healthy soil is one of the important environmental factors that affects plant growth and stress resistance, because it not only provides the essential water and nutrients for plants, but also guarantees the establishment of a well-functioning soil ecosystem [<xref rid="B10-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, in the past 20 years, the soil pH of arable land in southern China has decreased significantly. Soil acidification is mainly due to the excessive application of chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizers [<xref rid="B12-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Many researchers reported that soil health is associated with limited disease outbreaks, and indeed, many plant diseases were more serious in acidified soils compared with healthy soils [<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Soil acidification leads to increased toxicities of metal cations (i.e., Al<sup>3+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>) to plants and accelerates phosphorus and base cation (i.e., Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>) erosion, which has negative effects on plant disease progress and nutrition absorption [<xref rid="B15-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Another consequence of soil acidification is destruction of the microecological balance and microbial community diversity, which leads to the loss of a stable and healthy soil environment and weakens the resistance of plants to pathogenic bacteria in acidic soil [<xref rid="B17-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although extensive research has shown that soil acidification positively affects the development of various plant diseases, there has been no detailed investigation of the correlation between the occurrence of HLB disease and soil pH values.</p><p>At present, there are still large numbers of citrus orchards with HLB disease in southern China, these HLB-endemic regions are at great risk for soil acidification and HLB spread. Due to the lack of effective control measures, infected citrus trees have a noticeably shortened profitable life and dramatically declined yield, and they have to be removed to prevent the spread of the disease [<xref rid="B18-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, on the premise of controlling the spread of HLB disease in highly endemic citrus-producing regions, the critical challenge in southern China is to restore and maintain the health and productivity of citrus trees in the presence of soil acidification and HLB disease. In our study, we added lime as a soil pH ameliorant in citrus orchards with acidic soils to slow the disease progress and reduce the spread of HLB disease. At the same time, the mechanisms of acid soil improvement on management of HLB disease were analysed by comparing the changes of citrus root tissue vigour and plant immune related resistance genes and identifying the differentially expressed proteins in midrib tissues before and after soil treatment. This study will provide a novel perspective on managing HLB disease using an eco-friendly approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-21-03614"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-21-03614"><title>2.1. Effect of Soil Ameliorators on pH Value of Acidic Soil in Citrus Orchard</title><p>A soil pH survey of the experimental field showed that there was a serious degree of soil acidification. Although soil pH values fluctuate slightly, most of the orchard measurement points selected in this experiment had pH values between 4.5 and 5.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). In the present study, the pH of the soil in the citrus orchard was restored to 6.0&#x02013;6.5 in five months after treatment by adding appropriate lime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), which is suitable for growth of citrus plants. Subsequent investigation results showed that the application of soil amendments in our study could maintain the stability of soil pH value for at least one year (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03614">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-21-03614"><title>2.2. Effect of Acid Soil Improvement on Management of HLB Disease in Southern China</title><sec id="sec2dot2dot1-ijms-21-03614"><title>2.2.1. HLB Infections Rate</title><p>The new infections rate of HLB disease in the FCK (control grove in the field trial) and FT (treatment grove in field trial) was investigated using PCR assay at the fifth month after application of soil ameliorants in the field. The results showed that the average natural incidence rate of CLas was 20.2% in the FT and 32.2% in the FCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). In the following year, we continued to monitor the infection rate in both groves. The rate of HLB infections in FT was about 61%, and most of the HLB-infected citrus trees presented mildly infected symptoms, whereas more than 95% of plants in FCK were infected, and most of the citrus trees presented seriously infected symptoms (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03614">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). At the same time, the proportion of CLas bacterium in new shoots of the HLB-infected citrus was determined. The proportion of detectable CLas pathogens in the FCK was over 93.0%, while it was about 60.0% in the FT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). These results indicate that regulation of soil acidification is beneficial for limiting the movement of CLas bacterium to new shoots in infected plants and inhibiting the spread of HLB disease to healthy plants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-ijms-21-03614"><title>2.2.2. Chlorophyll Content and Disease Index</title><p>We also evaluated the HLB disease index by calculating the yellowing rate of the canopy upon different soil pH conditions in the field. In the FT, the disease index of about 70% of HLB-infected citrus trees was level 1 or level 2. While in the FCK, the disease index of 80% of citrus trees was mostly estimated to be at level 3, level 4 or level 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). In the case of the greenhouse trial, many of the citrus leaves in the GCK (control group in greenhouse trial) showed obvious symptoms of spotted-yellowing at the fifth month after soil treatment, whereas typical symptoms did not appear on the leaves of GT (treatment group in greenhouse trial) (Figure 4A). Meanwhile, the relative chlorophyll content of the leaves was measured. The chlorophyll content in the FT was significantly increased (about 10%) than that in the FCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). The result of the greenhouse trial showed that the chlorophyll content of citrus leaf from soil with pH 6.5 conditions was also 15% higher than that from pH 4.5 soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The infected leaves in the GCK not only showed more obvious symptoms in appearance, but it was also found that the plugging of their sieve tubes was more exacerbated than that in the GT, using SEM observation (Figure 4). It was speculated that HLB-infected citrus plants grown in suitable soil pH conditions were more likely to delay disease progression than those grown in acidic soils.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot3-ijms-21-03614"><title>2.2.3. The titre of CLas bacterium</title><p>The titre of CLas in the leaf midribs were quantified monthly using q-PCR after treatment in the orchard. The titre of CLas showed a continuous downward trend in both groves, but the decreasing trend was more obvious in FT. Especially at the fifth month, the titre of CLas was about 3 times lower than that in the FCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). In the greenhouse trial, the titre of CLas increased slightly over time under acidic soil conditions (pH = 4.5), and it was about 3.5 folds decreased under amended soil conditions (pH = 6.5) compared with the control sample at the fifth month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). The above results suggest that regulation of soil acidification effectively inhibited the accumulation of the CLas in the infected plants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot4-ijms-21-03614"><title>2.2.4. Fruit Yield and Quality</title><p>Soil acidification accelerated the loss of production capacity and reduced the fruit quality of HLB-infected citrus trees. The average yield of the infected plants in the FT was 57.6 kg per tree, which was higher than in the FCK (52.0 kg per tree) at the first year after soil treatment by liming (<xref rid="ijms-21-03614-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The fruit yield survey in the following year found that the average yield of HLB-positive plants in the FT remained above 50 kg per tree, however, in the FCK, the yield of HLB-positive plants dropped sharply, with an average yield of 27.1 kg per tree, some of which lost their economic value because the yield was below 20 kg per tree (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03614">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Meanwhile, the diameter of the fruit in the FT increased by 8.42%, and the fruit drop rate markedly reduced by 50% compared with that in the FCK (<xref rid="ijms-21-03614-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It was observed that the CLas-infected fruits in the FCK were small, poorly coloured, misshapen, whereas the infected fruits in the FT presented more like healthy fruit in visual appearance (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03614">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The results of assays of fruit quality indexes showed that in the FT, three monosaccharides, such as glucose (2.5 g &#x000d7; 100 g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), sucrose (4.4 g &#x000d7; 100 g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), fructose (2.4 g &#x000d7; 100 g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), and the soluble solids content (&#x0003e;12%) of fruits (<xref rid="ijms-21-03614-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) basically reached the nutritional requirements of edible fruits for commercial use, while the diseased fruits in the FCK failed to meet the requirements according to the Green food-Citrus NY/T 426-2000 of Agricultural Standards of China. Based on the above results, it is inferred that providing suitable growth soil conditions for citrus trees infected with HLB disease is more likely to produce asymptomatic infected fruits and maintain the yield and quality of infected plants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-21-03614"><title>2.3. Effect of Soil pH on the Expression of the Ion Transport-Related Genes and Metabolic Activity in the HLB-Infected Roots</title><p>In the greenhouse trial, the activity of CLas-infected roots grown in the GT was determined using the TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) reduction method, which was significantly enhanced compared with that in the GCK (Figure 5A). The roots in the FT also possessed higher root viability than those in the FCK in the field trial (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03614">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The lateral roots of seedlings in the GCK showed sparse, short and stunted symptoms compared to those in the GT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Furthermore, the expression level of four genes, <italic>CsAmtB</italic> (ammonium transporter), <italic>CsVIT1</italic> (vacuolar iron transporter), <italic>CsZIP1</italic> (zinc transporter) and <italic>CsBOR1</italic> (boron transporter), associated with ion transporters in greenhouses were measured using q-PCR. In the GCK, the expression level of the four ion-transporting genes in root tissues of CLas-infected seedlings was respectively down-regulated by 4.76, 1.92, 1.63 and 2.85 times compared to that in the GT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). These results indicate that the regulation of soil acidification had a beneficial influence on the root metabolic activity and the nutrient uptake ability of the HLB-infected seedlings.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-21-03614"><title>2.4. Effect of Soil pH on the SA Content and Expression of the Resistance-Related Genes in the HLB-Infected Plants</title><p>In this study, the content of endogenous hormone SA and the expression of genes involved in host disease resistance were determined in the greenhouse trial. The results showed that the SA content in the roots and midribs in the GCK was 1.55 and 1.67 times lower than in the GT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f006">Figure 6</xref>B,D). Additionally, in the leaves and roots, the expression of resistance-related genes in the GT was up-regulated significantly more than that in the GCK. q-PCR analysis indicated that in infected roots, the pathogenesis-related proteins genes, <italic>CsPR1</italic> and <italic>CsPR5</italic>, were meaningfully higher in the GT than that in the GCK. In addition, the <italic>CsNPR1</italic> and <italic>CsALD1</italic> genes were involved in plant systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and were up-regulated 4.75-fold and 5.78-fold, respectively. Meanwhile, in leaf midribs, the expression levels of the <italic>CsPR1</italic>, <italic>CsPR5</italic>, <italic>CsNPR1</italic> and <italic>CsALD1</italic> genes of HLB-infected seedlings in the GT were up-regulated more than those in the GCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f006">Figure 6</xref>C). The expression levels of the other two WRKY transcription factors in leaves and roots were both remarkably increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f006">Figure 6</xref>A), which is related to the resistance in the biotic and abiotic stress pathway [<xref rid="B19-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The above results indicated that soil improvement had an affirmative effect on the expression of the resistance genes and the SA signalling hormone synthesis in HLB-infected citrus plants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-ijms-21-03614"><title>2.5. Proteome Characteristics of Midribs of HLB-Infected Plants Grown in Different Soil pH Conditions</title><p>TMT-labelled proteome analyses were applied to understand the metabolic process of midribs of HLB-infected citrus under differing soil pH conditions. We identified 119 differentially expressed proteins at a cutoff value of &#x0003e;|&#x000b1;1.5|-fold (<italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.005) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03614">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), including 55 up-regulated and 64 down-regulated proteins, in the midribs sample in liming-amended soils (pH = 6.5) compared with the midribs sample collected from untreated soils (pH = 4.5). Most significantly, most of the up-regulated proteins are involved in stress/defence responses and secondary metabolism. The stress/defence response-related proteins mainly include two pathogenesis-related proteins, five methyltransferases and a probable leucine-rich repeat receptors and the secondary metabolites biosynthesis pathway-related proteins, including three dirigent proteins, three serine-type carboxypeptidases, a terpene synthase, a 3-beta-hydroxy-delta5-steroid dehydrogenase and a UDP-glucosyltransferase (<xref rid="ijms-21-03614-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Most down-regulated proteins were annotated as unknown function or heat-shock proteins that can protect other proteins against heat-induced denaturation and aggregation. The details of the differentially expressed proteins are listed in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03614">Supplementary Table S2</xref>. Based on analysis of comparative proteomics data, it is speculated that defence response of infected plants may be more intensely activated in liming-amended soil than in heavily acidic soil.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-ijms-21-03614"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>The health of soil determines agricultural sustainability and environmental quality and greatly affects plant vigor, productivity and disease resistance [<xref rid="B20-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previous reports have showed that the occurrence of multiple plant diseases (fungal, bacterial, viral and oomycete) is closely related with poor soil conditions and is particularly influenced by both increases (liming) and decreases (not liming) in soil pH [<xref rid="B21-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It has been reported that soil acidification can cause the outbreak of bacterial wilt disease in southern China, and researchers have reduced the incidence of the disease by improving soil pH [<xref rid="B14-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Rapid soil acidification has become a serious global problem and is one of the manifestations of soil degradation. In southern China, there is a general trend of increasing soil acidification in the HLB-endemic citrus-producing regions. For example, the soil pH of over 1000 samples from 477 orchards in 18 counties of Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, where we conducted the field experiment, were seriously acidic, and the average soil pH value was 4.6 [<xref rid="B23-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Heavy soil acidification also exists in other major citrus growing areas such as Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan and Zhejiang provinces, where HLB disease is highly endemic [<xref rid="B24-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In contrast, there is no large-scale outbreak of HLB disease and soil acidification in the citrus growing area of Chongqing, where more than 80% of citrus orchards have a soil pH of approximately 6.5 [<xref rid="B29-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our study indicated that soil acidification occurred seriously in our experimental orchards, and it accelerated the spread of HLB disease in citrus orchards and promoted movement of CLas to new shoots of infected plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,C). These results indicated that soil acidification is related to the occurrence and movement of HLB disease. Further experiments showed that when the acidic soil was ameliorated, the cumulative amount of CLas in citrus leaves was significantly lower than that of the untreated control group, and the severity of HLB disease was relatively mild (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f003">Figure 3</xref>). According to these data, we can infer that soil acidification promotes the occurrence of HLB disease, but molecular understanding of the process remains unclear, and acid soil improvement is worth considering as a part of management strategy to control HLB disease.</p><p>The application of soil pH amendments is an effective way to improve acidic soils.

It can enhance nutrient cycling of the soil environment and decrease uptake of toxic heavy metals to benefit yields [<xref rid="B32-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], thereby reducing the impacts of soil acidification on the growth vigour of citrus plants. In this study, we found that the average pH of the orchard soil in the FT increased by 1&#x02013;1.5 units and maintained a stable status for a long period after reasonable application of lime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03614">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Meanwhile, our research results showed that the yield of infected plants was also improved by regulating the acidic soils. These results indicate that lime is an ideal agent to alleviate soil acidification in citrus orchards and is beneficial to the quality and yield of citrus in acidified soil.</p><p>Phloem-plugging and yellow shoots are the typical symptoms of HLB disease. Previous studies found that the sieve pore plugging of phloem was normally caused by ultrastructural deformation of phloem cells and accumulation of starch in the sieve elements [<xref rid="B2-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Concurrently, the passive feedback of excessive starch accumulation leads to the inhibition of photosynthesis in infected leaves [<xref rid="B33-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which might be one of the reasons for the mottled yellowing of infected leaves. Our results have demonstrated that the HLB-associated symptoms and disease severity of infected citrus plants were alleviated in liming-amended soils. The content of chlorophyll was greatly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B) and the plugging of sieve pores was moderately mitigated in CLas positive leaves under amended soil condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). The proportion of asymptomatic branches in the canopy of HLB-positive citrus plants grown in the FT is significantly higher than that in the FCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). These changes would be of advantage to promote photosynthesis and transportation of photosynthate in citrus plants and provide a stable and favourable physiological basis for the maintenance of yield. Taking the above results into account, we may reach the conclusion that although acid soil improvement cannot completely control HLB disease, it has the potential to delay the progression of HLB disease by applying lime to regulate soil acidification.</p><p>Preserving the health of roots is a key component in HLB disease management because plant root systems perform many essential functions. Previous study has proved that plants grown in low pH soil have weaker plant growth and are more susceptible to phytopathogens [<xref rid="B20-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. One main reason is that soil acidification immensely alters physical and chemical properties and decreases soil quality. Soil acidification can cause a deficiency of essential nutrients and decrease the cation exchange capacity, accompanied by increased toxicities of toxic metals [<xref rid="B16-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In acidic soils, the availability of soil N, P, Mg and K drops dramatically, thus reducing the efficiency with which plants make use of fertilizers. Another reason is that long-term growing in acidic soils directly impairs the micro- and macronutrients uptake ability of plant roots [<xref rid="B34-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As the soil pH drops to below 6.0, there is a deleterious effect on the morphological and physiological development of plant roots with the Al<sup>3+</sup> concentration increasing, which subsequently antagonizes water and essential nutrients uptake in the plant [<xref rid="B35-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the case of citrus plants heavily infected with HLB pathogens, the growth and development of the roots are also greatly inhibited [<xref rid="B4-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CLas infection disrupts the transportation of photosynthate to root tissue [<xref rid="B36-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and eventually causes substantial root dieback due to carbohydrate starvation and cationic toxicity in acid soils. In the greenhouse trial, the results showed that the roots of infected citrus in liming-amended soils (pH = 6.5) had better morphological development and significantly improved metabolic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f005">Figure 5</xref>A), and the expression of some genes related to nutrient uptake were up-regulated compared with that in acidic soil (pH = 4.5) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). These results suggest that raising the pH value of acidified soil can invigorate the absorption of nutrients and maintain the root health of HLB-infected citrus trees, thereby indirectly enhancing the endurance of citrus to HLB disease.</p><p>Plant innate immunity is the front line of defence against pathogen invasion [<xref rid="B37-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. CLas infections can cause nonself-recognition immune responses in citrus plants, including increased levels of salicylic acid and induction of the expression of immune response genes encoding PR genes, SA biosynthesis or degradation modulators and WRKY transcription factor, and so on [<xref rid="B1-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The small phenolic compound SA plays an central regulatory role in immune responses that confer plant resistances to a variety of pathogens and SA-mediated immune responses essential for the activation of SAR [<xref rid="B38-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Much research also showed that accumulation of SA in citrus could potentially lead to enhanced resistance to a range of pathogens [<xref rid="B39-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In our study, results showed that the SA content of leaf midribs and roots in the GT was relatively higher than that in the GCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f006">Figure 6</xref>B,D), and the expression of genes <italic>CsNPR1</italic> and <italic>CsALD1</italic> were significantly up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03614-f006">Figure 6</xref>A,C). The most well-established role of <italic>NPR1</italic> and <italic>ALD1</italic> genes are as positive regulators of SAR and SA accumulation [<xref rid="B38-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The expression of two <italic>WRKY</italic> genes, which are involved in the regulation of SAR, also were significantly increased in infected plants under liming-amended soils condition.</p><p>Studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have shown that the expression of pathogenesis-related genes PR-1 and PR-5 considered to be markers for SA-dependent SAR was highly induced in both roots and leaves of infected microorganisms [<xref rid="B41-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In accordance with the previous report, our studies have demonstrated that the expression of pathogenesis-related genes <italic>CsPR1</italic> and <italic>CsPR5</italic> at the transcriptional and translational level were higher in the roots and leaves of HLB-infected citrus in liming-amended soils. The results indicate that regulation of soil acidification can indeed arouse the infected citrus in amended soils to maintain stronger immune responses for resisting the infection of the CLas bacterium. This is consistent with previous research that acid soil improvement increased the resistance gene expression and reduced the occurrence of bacterial wilt [<xref rid="B14-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, we could tentatively attribute the observed defence regulation in our study to a &#x0201c;strengthened potential tolerance&#x0201d;, which improves SA-mediated immune responses against CLas by enhancing the citrus vitality and health.</p><p>Analysis of comparative proteomics data also indicated that the expression of proteins related to the synthesis of secondary metabolites, which contain antimicrobial properties or are associated with plant defence responses, were up-regulated in midribs of CLas-infected trees in liming-amended soils (<xref rid="ijms-21-03614-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), such as the dirigent-like protein family, methyltransferase family (MTase), terpene synthase (TPS), serine carboxypeptidase (SCP) and UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT). The dirigent-like protein family contains a number of proteins involved in lignification which are induced during disease response in plants [<xref rid="B42-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In particular, the up-regulated methyltransferase family proteins A0A067FUD3 and A0A067DZ96 are involved in the biosynthesis of methylsalicylate (MeSA) in response to stresses. The volatile compound MeSA is hypothesized to act as an airborne signal that triggers defence responses in uninfected plants [<xref rid="B43-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. TPS, SCP and UGT are also closely related to plant resistance. For example, TPS is a crucial enzyme in the synthesis of terpene plant metabolites, which act as defensive compounds against pathogens and herbivores [<xref rid="B44-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The overexpression of the TPS gene, OsTPS19, in rice plants enhanced resistance against plant pathogen, while OsTPS19 RNAi lines were more susceptible to the pathogenic bacterium [<xref rid="B45-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. SCP-like protein SCPL1 (SAD7) in oat is required for the synthesis of antimicrobial compounds and for disease resistance [<xref rid="B46-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. UGT is involved in Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat [<xref rid="B47-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Generally, when citrus was infected by the HLB pathogen, a series of metabolic changes and resistance responses were stimulated to resist the infection [<xref rid="B2-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B48-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, soil acidification may weaken the immune defence capabilities of citrus and inhibit the synthesis of antibacterial secondary metabolites. Combined with the findings of this study, we can conclude that soil improvement in acidified orchards contributes to exerting optimal resistance of infected citrus against HLB pathogen and their ability to sustain plant growth after infection.</p><p>The diversity and stability of the bacterial community present in the rhizosphere heavily influences plant growth and immunity [<xref rid="B49-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that soil pH was a predominant factor mediating the soil microbial community [<xref rid="B50-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. CLas infection was accompanied by a notable increase in the proportion of <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> in citrus rhizosphere [<xref rid="B51-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. According to our simultaneous analysis of bacterial communities in rhizosphere soil of HLB-infected citrus (unpublished data), the relative abundance of <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> on the phylum level was significantly reduced in cloned libraries from lime-amended soils (16.56%) compared with cloned libraries from acidic soils (23.71%) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-03614">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The present study raises the conjecture that soil acidification probably provides a favourable external environment for citrus pathogenic microbes, and altering soil pH by liming will profoundly reshape the rhizosphere microbiome structure. Further investigations are needed to reveal the role of soil environment for native and beneficial microbiota in protecting citrus from CLas and other microbial pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-21-03614"><title>4.

All amplification was performed in an ABI7500 Real-Time PCR system with SYBR Fast qPCR Mix. The standard amplification protocol was 95 &#x000b0;C for 5 min. Then, the following cycle was repeated 40 times: 95 &#x000b0;C for 15 s, 60 &#x000b0;C for 15 s, and 72 &#x000b0;C for 15 s. The housekeeping gene of citrus encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) was used as an internal reference to normalize the amount of RNA in the different reactions. The relative mRNA quantities were calculated using the <sup>&#x00394;&#x00394;</sup>Ct method [<xref rid="B60-ijms-21-03614" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].

Protein Extraction</title><p>Six citrus leaf midrib samples were selected (three biological replicate samples from the GCK and the others from the GT) in October 2017. The sample was ground in a mortar in the presence of liquid nitrogen, and 10 mL of lysis buffer (8 M urea, 2% SDS, 1&#x000d7; Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Ltd.

Proteomic TMT and Data Analysis</title><p>For the TMT experiments, the procedure was based on the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocols (Abmart Ltd., Shanghai, China). The MS/MS spectra were analysed using the MASCOT engine (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.5.1). This search engine was set up to search the UniProt <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> database assuming digestion with trypsin. The MASCOT search was conducted with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.020 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 5.0 ppm. Scaffold Q+ (version Scaffold_4.6.2, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA) was used to quantitate TMT Label Based Quantitation peptide and protein identifications. Normalization was performed iteratively (across samples and spectra) on intensities, as described in Statistical Analysis of Relative Labeled Mass Spectrometry Data from Complex Samples Using ANOVA. Medians were used for averaging. Spectra data were log-transformed, pruned of those matched to multiple proteins and weighted using an adaptive intensity weighting algorithm.

Conclusions</title><p>The critical challenge of HLB disease management in southern China, where citrus orchards have severe soil acidification and HLB disease prevalence, is to maintain the sustainable economic production of CLas-infected citrus. In addition to traditional methods for the control of HLB disease, we should pay more attention to the role of environmental factors, which are one of the important components of the HLB disease triangle in mitigating the destructive impact on citrus production. Liming is a manageable and effective approach to ameliorate acidic soil, which is conducive to preserve root activity and strengthen immune defence against CLas bacterium. In this study, we found that the incidence of HLB was reduced and the progression was postponed after acid soil improvement in field experiments, resulting in increased yield and fruit quality of citrus in liming-amended soils. However, the generalisability of these results is subject to certain limitations because the intricate nature of the HLB pathosystem makes it difficult to completely control the disease through single aspect management. Therefore, we hope that the point of view presented herein will motivate more investigation to establish an integrated control strategy involving soil environment optimization against CLas infection.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-ijms-21-03614"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>Supplementary materials can be found at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/10/3614/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/10/3614/s1</uri>.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ijms-21-03614-s001"><media xlink:href="ijms-21-03614-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>B.L. analysed all data and wrote the draft manuscript.
