(Hassk) (False daisy) was assessed under intermittent (IT) and continuous (CT) doses of elevated ultraviolet-B (eUV-B). <i>Eclipta alba</i> is rich in medicinally important phytochemical constituents, used against several diseases. The hypothesis of this study is that alterations in UV-B dose may modify the quantity and quality of medicinally valuable components with changes in the morphological and physiological parameters of test plant. To fulfill our hypothesis IT and CT of eUV-B (ambient\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2\u00a0kJ\u00a0m<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0day<sup>-2</sup>) was given for 130 and 240\u00a0h respectively to assess the impact of UV-B stress. Growth and physiological parameters were adversely affected under both the treatments with varying magnitude. The observation of leaf surfaces showed increase in stomatal and trichome densities suggesting the adaptive resilience of the plants against UV-B. Besides, biosynthesis of wedelolactone, a major medicinal compound of <i>E. alba</i> was observed to be stimulated under UV-B exposure.
