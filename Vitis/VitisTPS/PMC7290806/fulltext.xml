Introduction</title><p>Aroma is one of the important indicators of grape and wine quality, which directly affects consumers&#x02019; acceptance. There are mainly six groups of aroma compounds in <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L. wine grapes, namely, terpenoids, norisoprenoids, aromatic compounds, aliphatic volatile compounds, methoxypyrazines, and organo-sulfur compounds. Among these compounds, grape-derived terpenoids have garnered interest because they have a low sensory threshold values and impart pleasant floral/fruity odor. Monoterpenoids are typical volatile compounds of white wines made from aromatic Muscat grape varieties, in which their concentration may exceed the threshold by 100-fold [<xref rid="B1-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This group of volatile compounds also detected at supra-threshold concentrations in aromatic non-Muscat varieties such as <italic>V. vinifera</italic> &#x0201c;Riesling&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Traminer&#x0201d;, but at sub-threshold concentrations in neutral varieties including <italic>V. vinifera</italic> &#x0201c;Cabernet Sauvignon&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Merlot&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Chardonnay&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Sauvignon Blanc&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B2-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Monoterpenoids exists free form of volatile compounds in grapes, but mainly be found in the glycosylated form, which is odorless and non-volatile (up to 95% of the total). However, glycosylated monoterpenoids can be hydrolyzed to release volatile aglycones through acid- and/or enzyme-catalyzed reactions during fermentation and storage of wine [<xref rid="B3-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. So, the glycoside pool can provide winemakers with tools to manipulate wine aroma because relative enzyme activity and substrate specificity vary among strains and fermentation conditions [<xref rid="B4-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Actually, the yeast suppliers also advertise yeast strains with glycosidase activity appropriate for a particular wine style. Moreover, even in finished wine, a latent pool of grape-derived aroma compounds still remains in the glycosylated form that can continue to transform under abiotic conditions [<xref rid="B5-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Accordingly, we think that grape-derived monoterpenyl glycosides are potential and important aroma precursors. </p><p>Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) are the main precursors of terpenoids (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-genes-11-00485">Figure S1</xref>) [<xref rid="B6-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In plants, IPP and DMAPP could be synthesized in two independent pathways: The mevalonic acid (MVA) pathways in cell cytoplast and 2-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate phosphate (MEP) in plastid [<xref rid="B7-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is commonly known that monoterpenoids made the greatest contribute to both Muscat and aromatic non-Muscat wines&#x02019; aroma, and they are generated from the plastidial MEP pathway. 1-Deoxy-<italic><sc>D</sc></italic>-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) is the starting enzyme of this pathway, catalyzing the condensation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate into 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP), followed by converting into geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP, C10) through a series of enzymatic reactions. Finally, the GPP is transformed successively into monoterpenoids and monoterpenol glycosides by terpene synthases (TPSs) and monoterpenol <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-D-glucosyltransferases (UGTs), respectively. Both TPSs and UGTs are large protein families. Glycosides are formed by the action of glycosyltransferases (GTs), which are a ubiquitous group of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a sugar moiety from an activated sugar donor. In plant secondary product, the UDP-Glc are typically used as sugar donor, these &#x003b2;-D-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) are belong to the GT1 family of the classification [<xref rid="B9-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is predicted that 69 putatively functional <italic>VviTPSs</italic> in <italic>V. vinifera</italic> genome, whereas 43 full-length <italic>VviTPS</italic>s have been functionally identified and each TPS corresponds to several terpenoid products [<xref rid="B11-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In contrast, only four monoterpenol <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-D-glucosyltransferases, VviGT7, VviGT14, VviGT15, and VviGT16, have been characterized biochemically [<xref rid="B2-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B15-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among them, VviGT7 is mainly responsible for the conversion of neryl and geranyl into their glycosidically bound forms [<xref rid="B2-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], whereas VviGT14 can glycosylate geraniol, <italic>R</italic>, <italic>S</italic>-citronellol, and nerol with similar efficiency and VviGT15 prefers geraniol over nerol [<xref rid="B15-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is also found that VviGT16, another uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase (UGT), was involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylate monoterpenols and some short-chained and aromatic alcohols with low efficiency [<xref rid="B2-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B14-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previously, we elucidated that glycosylated monoterpenoids fluctuates but generally increases along with grape berry ripening, and exceeds the concentration of free monoterpenoids in ripening grape berries [<xref rid="B16-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, we found that the accumulation of glycosylated monoterpenes in <italic>V. vinifera</italic> L. &#x0201c;Muscat blanc &#x000e0; Petit grain&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Gewurztraminer&#x0201d; varieties was consistent with the expression of <italic>VviGT7</italic> (XM_002276510.2) and <italic>VviGT14</italic> (XM_002285734.2); but <italic>VviGT7</italic> in &#x0201c;Muscat blanc &#x000e0;. Petit grain&#x0201d; grapes is enzymatically inactive because a nucleotide mutation of the enzyme active site occurs in one <italic>VviGT7</italic> allele and a nucleotide insertion appears in another <italic>VviGT7</italic> allele [<xref rid="B16-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Abundant <italic>VviGT14</italic> expression is closely positively correlated with the differential accumulation of monoterpenyl glycosides in <italic>V. vinifera</italic> &#x0201c;Muscat blanc &#x000e0; Petit grain&#x0201d; between the two wine-producing regions with distinct climates. In contrast, terpenoid products show a weak correlation with the expression of most <italic>VviTPS</italic> genes [<xref rid="B17-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These results demonstrate that understanding <italic>VviGT14</italic> transcription regulation is of importance to control the production of monoterpenyl glycosides in wine grape berries.</p><p>There are several studies on the environmental or viticulture effects on monoterpenoid accumulation and the relevant gene expression profile in grape berries [<xref rid="B16-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On transcriptional regulation, a limited number of transcription factors (TFs) that involved in the regulation of terpenoids biosynthesis have been identified in a wide range of plant species, such as <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>, <italic>Catharanthus roseus,</italic> and <italic>Actinidia</italic>. These identified TFs belong to the auxin responsive factor (ARF) [<xref rid="B21-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], MYB [<xref rid="B22-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], WRKY [<xref rid="B23-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], bHLH [<xref rid="B24-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and AP2/ERF families [<xref rid="B27-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, they primarily participate in the regulation of sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis. In recent years, a few TFs that regulate monoterpenoid biosynthesis have also been identified in some species, such as AaNAC1/2/3/4 and AcEIL1/2/3/4a in <italic>Actinidia</italic>. The two TFs are demonstrated to positively regulate the expression of <italic>AaTPS1</italic> [<xref rid="B28-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and consequently increase the accumulation of monoterpenes (myrcene, limonene, and terpinolene). Additionally, MsYABBY5 is verified to negatively regulate the limonene biosynthesis in <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> spearmint [<xref rid="B29-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>PbbHLH4</italic> could increase the accumulation of free monoterpenes in <italic>Phalaenopsis</italic> [<xref rid="B30-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In grapevine, VviERF6, VviERF3L, VviGATA5L, and VviGT-2L are predicted via gene co-expression network analysis to possibly participate in the regulation of monoterpenoid biosynthesis in <italic>V. vinifera</italic> &#x0201c;Cabernet Sauvignon&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Muscat blanc &#x000e0; Petit grain&#x0201d; berries [<xref rid="B17-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B31-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the TFs regulating the biosynthesis of glycosylated monoterpenoids have not been identified functionally in grapes, and even in other plants. </p><p>In our previous study, we demonstrated that <italic>VviGT14</italic> expression is a critical rate-limiting factor affecting the accumulation of glycosylated monoterpenoids [<xref rid="B17-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, we screened and identified the functional TFs that regulate the expression of <italic>VviGT14</italic>, the purpose of which is to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of glycosylated monoterpenoid biosynthesis in grape berry. </p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2-genes-11-00485"><title>2.

Validation of VviWRKY40 Interaction with the VviGT14 Promoter</title><p>Using the pGADT7-VviWRKY40 vector as an effector and using the pAbAi vector carrying three-repeat w-box sequence as a reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f005">Figure 5</xref>A), the Y1HGold yeast co-transformed with proGT14-AbAi and pGADT7-VviWRKY40 could grow normally on the SD medium containing 400 ng/mL AbA, whereas the yeast carrying proGT14-AbAi and pGADT7 could not grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f005">Figure 5</xref>B), which proved that VviWRKY40 can definitely bind with the repeated w-box sequence of the <italic>VviGT14</italic> promoter. The interaction of VviWRKY40 with the <italic>VviGT14</italic> promoter fragment was further tested using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). In this method, only one w-box was contained in the reporter fragment, which was the same as the <italic>VviGT14</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). Binding of the VviWRKY40 protein to the <italic>VviGT14</italic> promoter fragment was observed when the unlabeled competitive probe (cold probe) was not added or added no more than 50-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). The result also supported that VviWRKY40 can bind to the w-box-containing recognition site in the VviGT14 promoter.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-genes-11-00485"><title>3.4. VviWRKY40 Localizing in the Cell Nucleus and Lacking Transcriptional Activation Function </title><p>To understand the subcellular localization of VviWRKY40, the <italic>VviWRKY40&#x02013;eGFP</italic> and <italic>AtFBI1-mCherry</italic> fusion constructs were co-transfected into <italic>A. thaliana</italic> protoplasts. AtFBI1-mCherry is a known nucleus-localized protein, and it can emit red fluorescence. As expected, it was observed that both green fluorescence and red fluorescence appeared in the nucleus, which indicated that VviWRKY40 functions in the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f006">Figure 6</xref>A).</p><p>To determine whether VviWRKY40 possesses the transcriptional activation function, the <italic>VviWRKY40</italic> gene was fused into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (pBD-VviWRKY40) and the luciferase (<italic>LUC</italic>) gene was linked to the GAL4 activation domain (pLUC). Transactivation of the <italic>LUC</italic> gene was examined relative to the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (<italic>REN</italic>) gene under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (<italic>CaMV35S</italic>) promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). These constructs were co-expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplast, and the luciferase activity was quantified. The results indicated that, comparing with the negative control (pBD), the luciferase activity was almost unchanged in the pBD-VviWRKY40 construct; alternatively, the positive control (pB-VP16) showed an approximately 175-fold induction of relative <italic>LUC/REN</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f006">Figure 6</xref>C). These data revealed that VviWRKY40 lacked the transcriptional activation function, and it may act as a transcription repressor.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-genes-11-00485"><title>3.5. Negative Regulation of VviWRKY40 on VviGT14 </title><p>In the dual luciferase assay, the <italic>proVviGT14</italic>-driven luciferase reporter and CaMV35S-driven <italic>VviWRKY40</italic> effector were separately constructed and then co-transferred into the protoplasts or cell suspension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). VviWRKY40 was found to suppress the activity of the <italic>VviGT14</italic> promoter with a LUC/REN ratio of less than 0.6 fold in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts, indicating that VviWRKY40 is a suppression effector of <italic>VviGT14</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). </p><p>To eliminate the interference of hetero-cellular environment on the regulatory effect of VviWRKY40, the dual-luciferase reporter assay was also performed in homologous grapevine cell suspension system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f007">Figure 7</xref>C). We found that VviWRKY40 significantly declined the activity of the <italic>VviGT14</italic> promoter with a LUC/REN ratio of 0.4 fold. In comparison, the anthocyanin biosynthesis specific transcription factor VviMYBA2 (BAD18978), which was used as negative control, did not cause any change of the <italic>VviGT14</italic> promoter activity. VviWRKY40 was demonstrated capable of binding to the promoter of <italic>VviGT14</italic> and to downregulate the transcriptional activity. </p><p>Second, to illustrate the homologous regulation of VviWRKY40 on the <italic>VviGT14</italic> gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>VviWRKY40</italic> was transiently overexpressed in tobacco leaves mainly because it is difficult to obtain a stable transformation system in grapevine. The <italic>NbGT</italic> nucleotide sequence shares approximately 68.0% identity with the <italic>VviGT14</italic> sequence of grapevine. As expected, VviWRKY40 was overexpressed by more than 400-fold in the overexpression tobacco leaves; correspondingly, the expression of <italic>NbGT</italic> was strongly repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f007">Figure 7</xref>D). In addition, free-form and glycosylated linalool was measured in the transient overexpression and control tobacco leaves. The concentration of free-form linalool in the OE-VviWRKY40 leaves tended to be slightly higher than that in the control. On the contrary, both the concentration of glycosylated linalool and the ratio of glycosylated to total linalool were lower in the OE-VviWRKY40 leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f004">Figure 4</xref>E). This demonstrates that VviWRKY40 can downregulate the expression of <italic>NbGT</italic> and suppresses the production of glycosylated linalool.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-genes-11-00485"><title>3.6. Negative Correlation between VviWRKY40 Expression and VviGT14 Expression during Grape Berry Ripening</title><p>To test whether VviWRKY40 similarly downregulates the expression of <italic>VviGT14</italic> in developing grape berries, we analyzed the expression pattern of the two genes during maturation of &#x0201c;Muscat blanc &#x000e0; Petit grain&#x0201d; berries. As discussed previously [<xref rid="B17-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B48-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the concentration of glycosidically bound monoterpene precursors was considerably higher than that free-type monoterpenoids; moreover, the concentrations of free and glycosylated monoterpenes were low at the early developmental stage (42 and 56 days after flowering), and then suddenly peaked at the <italic>v&#x000e9;raison</italic> (70 days after flowering) and slightly declined in the following ripening period. Rose oxide, geraniol, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-myrcene, citronellol, linalool, and nerol were six monoterpenoid components with the highest concentrations in mature berries of &#x0201c;Muscat blanc &#x000e0; Petit grain&#x0201d;. Among them, linalool, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-myrcene, geraniol, and nerol gradually accumulated with berry maturation, whereas rose oxide and citronellol slightly reduced after <italic>v&#x000e9;raison</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f008">Figure 8</xref>A). As we observed previously [<xref rid="B16-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the <italic>VviGT14</italic> expression was greatly promoted at 70 days after flowering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f008">Figure 8</xref>B), and the <italic>VviWRKY40</italic> expression was declined correspondingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f008">Figure 8</xref>C), which showed a potentially negative correlation between the two genes. Meanwhile, the upregulation of <italic>VviGT14</italic> expression was in good agreement with the rapid accumulation of total glycosylated monoterpenoids, particularly the ratio of total glycosidically bound monoterpenes to free monoterpenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f008">Figure 8</xref>D). Based on the above evidence from in vitro and in vivo experiments, we can reasonably conclude that VviWRKY40 negatively regulates the expression of <italic>VviGT14</italic> by binding with the gene promoter in grape berry.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot7-genes-11-00485"><title>3.7. ABA Downregulates VviWRKY40 and Upregulates VviGT14 in Grapevine Cell Suspension</title><p>ABA is a commonly known hormone, and its concentration rapidly increased at the <italic>v&#x000e9;raison</italic> stage (E-L 35), and then decreased along ripening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f009">Figure 9</xref>A), which showed similar trend with the expression of <italic>VviGT14</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f008">Figure 8</xref>B). To understand whether ABA associates with the transcriptional regulation of VviWRKY40 on <italic>VviGT14</italic>, we treated grapevine cell suspension with a gradient concentration of ABA. The results showed that ABA application led to more than two-fold increase in <italic>VviGT14</italic> expression and a visible reduction in <italic>VviWRKY40</italic> expression, whereas the expression of <italic>VviNCED1,</italic> which is required for ABA biosynthesis, was greatly promoted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="genes-11-00485-f009">Figure 9</xref>B).

Discussion </title><p>This study elucidates for the first time the involvement of VviWRKY40 in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>VviGT14</italic>, a key gene relating to the accumulation of glycosylated monoterpenoids in Muscat-type grape berries, using in vitro and in vivo transient expression systems. Although there are other six WRKY TFs screened out in the H1Y assay, only VviWRKY40 is confirmed to have the targeted regulatory effect on <italic>VviGT14</italic>. It is known that the WRKY family TFs are distributed into seven subfamilies, Ib, IIa, IIb, IIc, IId, IIIa, and IaNTWD in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="B49-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. VviWRKY40 is close to the AtWRKY40 in the phylogeny tree. VviWRKY40, AtWRKY18, AtWRKY40, and AtWRKY60 all belong to the WRKY IIa subfamily, AtWRKY18, AtWRKY40, and AtWRKY60 have been characterized functionally. Among these three AtWRKYs, AtWRKY18 and AtWRKY60 are transcriptional activators of ABA signaling, whereas AtWRKY40 is identified as a transcriptional repressor [<xref rid="B50-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our study also revealed that VviWRKY40 lacks the transcription activation function, and it represses the expression of <italic>VviGT14</italic>.</p><p>There have been a few studies regarding the regulation of the WRKY family TFs in grapevine. Till now, 59 WRKY proteins in grapevine have been identified [<xref rid="B51-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Nevertheless, their functional research is majorly concerned about the responses to environmental stresses. For example, it has been reported that the overexpressed VviWRKY30 can enhance plant resistance to salt stress by promoting reactive oxygen species-scavenging ability and osmoticum [<xref rid="B53-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. VviWRKY8 can interact with VviMYB14, which results in the decline of resveratrol biosynthesis by downregulating the expression of <italic>VviSTS15/21</italic> [<xref rid="B54-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Except these, there are no reports regarding the transcriptional regulation of VviWRKYs on the genes of the monoterpenoid biosynthetic pathway. Recently, in cotton plants, GaWRKY1 is demonstrated to activate the promoter of the sesquiterpene phytoalexin synthesis gene <italic>CAD1-A</italic> from transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="B55-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Our present study proves that VviWRKY40 is involved in regulating glycosylated monoterpenes biosynthesis. The W-box motif is generally an important binding domain of the WRKY family TFs [<xref rid="B56-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. VviWRKY40 is identified to function as a transcription repressor by binding to the w-box element in the <italic>VviGT14</italic> promoter region.</p><p>Abscisic acid is widely known as one of the five classic phytohormones, and it is involved in various aspects of plant growth and development. Considerable studies demonstrate that ABA is a &#x0201c;stress hormone&#x0201d; that modulates plant response to various environmental factors, including both abiotic and biotic challenges. A common phenomenon regarding the considerable accumulation of ABA is present at <italic>v&#x000e9;raison</italic> of grape berry development [<xref rid="B57-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Meanwhile, a small amount of ethylene is synthesized as well, which could induce the expression of <italic>VviNCED</italic>, and finally result in an increased accumulation of ABA [<xref rid="B36-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although many volatile compounds in grape berry are synthesized starting from the onset of ripening, the regulation of ABA on the gene expression of volatile compound biosynthetic pathway is still poorly understood. Many researches are concerned about the influence of ABA on flavonoid [<xref rid="B58-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and norisoprenoids pathway [<xref rid="B59-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In past several years, there has been increasing evidence that plant WRKY TFs are involved in plant ABA signaling and abiotic stress responses [<xref rid="B50-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B60-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The AtWRKY18 and AtWRKY60, together with AtWRKY40, could down regulate the expression of <italic>AtABI5</italic> and/or <italic>AtABI4</italic> genes in the ABA signaling [<xref rid="B60-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The WRKY transcription factors operate at multiple levels in the ABA-signaling network was reported [<xref rid="B61-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. During seed germination and post-germination growth, ABA is perceived by both PYR/PYL/RCAR and ABA receptor (ABAR). AtWRKY40 could interact with ABAR, ABA perception by ABAR results in movement of the repressor protein AtWRKY40 out of the nucleus. This leads to de-repression of ABI5 at the transcriptional level. The produced ABI5 is activated following phosphorylation as a result of ABA perception by PYR/PYL/RCAR. Activation of ABI5 leads to transcription of the AtWRKY63 gene, and AtWRKY63 then activates further downstream target genes such RD29A, ABF2, and COR47. In grape berries, it has been found that among the 59 <italic>VviWRKY</italic>s in grapevine, 31 <italic>VviWRKY</italic> genes are downregulated to different extent by exogenous ABA application, whereas 14 <italic>VviWRKY</italic> genes are upregulated [<xref rid="B51-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. A similar effect is also observed in this study, that is, exogenous ABA application significantly reduces the <italic>VviWRKY40</italic> expression and elevates the <italic>VviGT14</italic> expression in grapevine cell suspension. It appears that the transcriptional regulation of VviWRKY40 on the <italic>VviGT14</italic> occurs at the downstream of ABA signaling. This also explains our observations that <italic>VviGT14</italic> is largely expressed and glycosylated monoterpenoids are considerably accumulated in the <italic>v&#x000e9;raison</italic> stage in &#x0201c;Muscat blanc &#x000e0; Petit grain&#x0201d; grape berries. Certainly, the promoter region of <italic>VviGT14</italic> contains some ABA-responsive elements, so it is to be further determined whether the upregulation of <italic>VviGT14</italic> expression is as a direct consequence of ABA-downregulated <italic>VviWRKY40</italic> expression. </p><p>Due to the difficulty in stable transformation in perennial plants, transient expression systems have been often used alternately to identify the function of TFs in fruit tree materials, such as apple skin [<xref rid="B62-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], orange leaves [<xref rid="B63-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], persimmon leaves [<xref rid="B64-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and papaya leaves [<xref rid="B65-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In this study, we adopted grapevine cell suspension to build a dual luciferase reporter system. The effectiveness of this system has been confirmed in previous researches [<xref rid="B40-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The scientists have found that the MYB family TFs can specifically activate the promoters of stilbene synthase genes in Chardonnay grapevine suspension cell cultures and a dual luciferase reporter system, and the activation effect can be reappeared in the ectopic expression of TF in grapevine hairy roots [<xref rid="B40-genes-11-00485" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In our study, the transient gene reporter system provides a grapevine cell environment for the interaction of VviWRKY40 and the promoter of <italic>VviGT14</italic>, and this kind of cell environment possesses various factors that may interfere the binding. In such a grapevine suspension cell system, the suppression of VviWRKY40 on the VviGT14 promoter activity should be regarded as an actual function of the TF in grapevine. Certainly, a stable grapevine genetic transformation system should be built in future research. In addition, the concentration of glycosylated monoterpenoids is too low in the grapevine suspension cells. An accurate measurement method should be established. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-genes-11-00485"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, this study for the first time reports that VviWRKY40 negatively regulates the expression of <italic>VviGT14</italic> in ripening grape berries. This TF is involved in the regulation of glycosylated monoterpenoid biosynthesis as VviGT14 has been previously demonstrated to be a key enzyme determining the production of glycosylated monoterpenoids. Additionally, this study revealed that <italic>VviWRKY40</italic> expression is significantly reduced and simultaneously <italic>VviGT14</italic> is increased at <italic>v&#x000e9;raison</italic> when glycosylated monoterpenoids rapidly accumulate. Furthermore, ABA downregulates the <italic>VviWRKY40</italic> expression and upregulates the <italic>VviGT14</italic> expression. It can be concluded that ABA promotes the <italic>VviGT14</italic> expression and glycosylated monoterpenoid accumulation as a result of suppressed <italic>VviWRKY40</italic> expression in ripening grape berries.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Thomas Rausch and Jochen Bogs provide the grape suspension cells for this research.
