Flavors derived from terpenoid and fatty acid metabolism develop at the very end of this ripening stage.

Detailed analysis of the interaction of the skin and pulp with &#x000b0;Brix revealed that there were statistically significantly higher abundances of transcripts changing with &#x000b0;Brix in the skin that were involved in ethylene signaling, isoprenoid and fatty acid metabolism. Many transcripts were peaking around known optimal fruit stages for flavor production. The transcript abundance of approximately two-thirds of the AP2/ERF superfamily of transcription factors changed during these developmental stages. The transcript abundance of a unique clade of ERF6-type transcription factors had the largest changes in the skin and clustered with genes involved in ethylene, senescence, and fruit flavor production including ACC oxidase, terpene synthases, and lipoxygenases.

Ethylene transcription factors known to play a role in leaf senescence also appear to play a role in fruit senescence.

In stage 1, berry size increases sigmoidally. Stage 2 is known as a lag phase where there is no increase in berry size. Stage 3 is considered the ripening stage. Veraison is at the beginning of the ripening stage and is characterized by the initiation of color development, softening of the berry and rapid accumulation of the hexoses, glucose and fructose. Berry growth is sigmoidal in Stage 3 and the berries double in size. Many of the flavor compounds and volatile aromas are derived from the skin and synthesized at the end of this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Many grape flavor compounds are produced as glycosylated, cysteinylated and glutathionylated precursors (e.g. terpenoids and C<sub>13</sub>-norisoprenoids) and phenolics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and many of the precursors of the flavor compounds are converted to various flavors by yeast during the fermentation process of wine. Nevertheless, there are distinct fruit flavors and aromas that are produced and can be tasted in the fruit, many of which are derived from terpenoids, fatty acids and amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Terpenes are important compounds for distinguishing important cultivar fruit characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There are 69 putatively functional, 20 partial and 63 partial pseudogenes in the terpene synthase family that have been identified in the Pinot Noir reference genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Terpene synthases are multi-functional enzymes using multiple substrates and producing multiple products. More than half of the putatively functional terpene synthases in the Pinot Noir reference genome have been functionally annotated experimentally and distinct differences have been found in some of these enzymes amongst three grape varieties: Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon and Gew&#x000fc;rztraminer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Other aromatic compounds also contribute significant cultivar characteristics. C<sub>13</sub>-norisoprenoids are flavor compounds derived from carotenoids by the action of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase enzymes (CCDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Franc are characterized by specific volatile thiols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and methoxypyrazines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Enzymes involved in the production of these aromas have been recently characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Phenolic compounds play a central role in the physical mouthfeel properties of red wine; recent work relates quality with tannin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While the grape genotype has a tremendous impact on tannin content, the environment also plays a very large role in grape composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The pathway for phenolic biosynthesis is well known, but the mechanisms of environmental influence are poorly understood.</p><p>Ultimately, there is an interaction between molecular genetics and the environment. Flavor is influenced by climate, topography and viticultural practices (i.e. irrigation, canopy management, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For example, water deficit alters gene expression of enzymes involved in aroma biosynthesis in grapes, which is genotype dependent, and may lead to increased levels of compounds, such as terpenes and hexyl acetate, that contribute to fruity volatile aromas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The grapevine berry can be subdivided into the skin, pulp and seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The skin includes the outer epidermis (single cell layer) and inner hypodermis (from 1 to 17 cell layers). A thick waxy cuticle covers the epidermis. The hypodermal cells contain chloroplasts, which lose their chlorophyll at veraison and become modified plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; they are the sites of terpenoid biosynthesis and carotenoid catabolism. Anthocyanins and tannins accumulate in the vacuoles of hypodermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pulp cells are the main contributors to the sugar and organic acid content of the berries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pulp cells also have a much higher set of transcripts involved in carbohydrate metabolism, but a lower set of transcripts involved in lipid, amino acid, vitamin, nitrogen and sulfur metabolism than in the skins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Hormones can influence berry development and ripening. Concentrations of auxin, cytokinins and gibberellins tend to increase in early fruit development of the first stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At veraison, these hormone concentrations have declined concomitant with a peak in abscisic acid concentration just before veraison. Auxin prolongs the Stage 2 lag phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and inhibits anthocyanin biosynthesis and color development in Stage 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Grapevine, a nonclimacteric fruit, is not very sensitive to ethylene; however, ethylene appears to be necessary for normal fruit ripening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Ethylene concentration is highest at anthesis, but declines to low levels upon fruit set; ethylene concentrations rise slightly thereafter and peak just before veraison then decline to low levels by maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Ethylene also plays a role in the ripening of another nonclimacteric fruit, strawberry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. ABA also appears to be important in grape berry ripening during veraison when ABA concentrations increase resulting in increased expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and anthocyanin accumulation in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. ABA induces ABF2, a transcription factor (TF) that affects berry ripening by stimulating berry softening and phenylpropanoid accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In addition, ABA affects sugar accumulation in ripening berries by stimulating acid invertase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and the induction of sugar transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It is not clear whether ABA directly affects flavor volatiles (C<sub>13</sub>-norisoprenoids), but there could be indirect effects due to competition for common precursors in the carotenoid pathway.</p><p>Many grape berry ripening studies have focused on targeted sampling over a broad range of berry development stages, but generally with an emphasis around veraison, when berry ripening is considered to begin. In this study, a narrower focus is taken on the late ripening stages where many berry flavors are known to develop in the skin. We show that that the abundance of transcripts involved in ethylene signaling is increased along with those associated with terpenoid and fatty acid metabolism, particularly in the skin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The transcript abundance of a large number of genes was statistically significantly changed across &#x000b0;Brix levels and berry tissues</title><p>Cabernet Sauvignon clusters were harvested in 2008 from a commercial vineyard in Paso Robles, California at various times after veraison with a focus on targeting &#x000b0;Brix levels near maturity. Dates and metabolic details that establish the developmental state of the berries at each harvest are presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Berries advanced by harvest date with the typical developmental changes for Cabernet Sauvignon: decreases in titratable acidity and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) concentrations and increases in sugar (&#x000b0;Brix) and color (anthocyanins).</p><p>Transcriptomic analysis focused on four harvest dates having average cluster &#x000b0;Brix levels of 22.6, 23.2, 25.0 and 36.7. Wines made in an earlier study from grapes harvested at comparable levels of sugars or total soluble solids to those in the present study showed clear sensory differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Six biological replicates, comprising two clusters each, were separated into skins and pulp in preparation for RNA extraction and transcriptomic analysis using the NimbleGen Grape Whole-Genome Microarray. Thus, a 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial (&#x000b0;Brix x Tissue) experimental design was established. After standard microarray processing and data normalization, two-way ANOVA indicated that the transcript abundance of 16,280 transcripts statistically significantly changed across the &#x000b0;Brix levels below the adjusted p-value (upon a correction for the false discovery rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]) of 0.05 (herein referred to as &#x0201c;significant&#x0201d; throughout this paper), the transcript abundance of 10,581 transcripts changed significantly across Tissue types, and the abundance of 2053 transcripts changed significantly with respect to the &#x000b0;Brix x Tissue interaction term (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>, to view these transcripts, sort from lowest to highest in the appropriate adjusted (adj) p-value column: adjBrix, adjTissue or adjTissue*Brix).</p><p>A note of caution must be added here. There are high similarities amongst members in certain <italic>Vitis</italic> gene families (e.g. ERF TFs, stilbene and terpene synthases), making it very likely that cross-hybridization can occur with probes on the microarray with high similarity to other genes. We estimate approximately 13,000 genes have the potential for cross-hybridization, with at least one probe of a set of four unique probes for that gene on the microarray potentially cross-hybridizing with probes for another gene on the microarray. Genes with the potential for cross-hybridization have been identified and are highlighted in light red in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. The rationale to include them is that although individual genes can not be uniquely separated, the probe sets can identify a gene and its highly similar gene family members, thus, providing some useful information about the biological responses of the plant. An additional approach was taken, removing cross-hybridizing probes before quantitative data analysis (data not shown). Many of the significant genes were unaffected by this processing, but 3600 genes (e.g. many terpene synthases and stilbene synthases) were completely removed from the analysis. Thus, it was felt that valuable information was lost using such a stringent approach. The less stringent approach allowing for analysis of genes with potential cross-hybridization was used here in the rest of the analyses.</p><p>To assess the main processes affected by these treatments, the gene ontologies (GO) of significantly affected transcripts were analyzed for statistical significance (overrepresentation relative to the whole genome) using BinGO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Based on transcripts that had significant changes in abundance with &#x000b0;Brix level, 230 biological processes were significantly overrepresented in this group (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The three top overrepresented processes were response to abiotic stress, biosynthetic process, and response to chemical stimulus, a rather generic set of categories. Tissue differences were more revealing at the stage when flavors peak; 4865 transcripts that were significantly higher in skins compared to pulp at 23.2 &#x000b0;Brix (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) were tested for overrepresented GO functional categories (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Some of the top GO categories included photosynthesis, isoprenoid biosynthesis, and pigment biosynthesis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Some of the transcripts with the largest differences between skin and pulp at 23.2 &#x000b0;Brix are &#x003b2;-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (fatty acid biosynthesis), taxane 10-&#x003b2;-hydroxylase (diterpenoid biosynthesis), wax synthase, a lipase, an ABC transporter, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; phenylpropanoid biosynthesis) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Some of the transcripts with the largest differences in abundance with pulp greater than skin at 23.2 &#x000b0;Brix were polygalacturonase (cell wall pectin degradation), flavonol synthase, stachyose synthase, an amino acid transporter, a potassium channel (KCO1), and HRE2 (hypoxia responsive ERF transcription factor) (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

Other flavor-centric categories of the 57 categories overrepresented include aromatic compound biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism and alcohol catabolism.</p><p>This transcript set was further analyzed by dividing into 10 clusters using k-means clustering (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Clusters 1, 8, 9 and 10 had a large number of overrepresented categories. Many GO categories within a cluster are subsets of others in that cluster and were grouped together. For example, cluster 4 had four overrepresented GO categories, oxygen transport, gas transport, heat acclimation and response to heat.

A group of VviERF6 transcription factor (TF) paralogs represented 6 of the top 10 transcripts increasing in transcript abundance from 22.6 to 23.2 &#x000b0;Brix in the skin, but not in the pulp (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>; to view, sort column O, bx23.2Skin-bx22.6Skin, from highest to lowest; this column is the ratio of values at &#x000b0;Brix 23.2 in the skin divided by the values &#x000b0;Brix 22.6 in the skin; since the values are log 2, subtracting the value in one column from the value in another column represents the ratio of the two). These VviERF6 TFs were also found in Cluster 8 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

All of these TFs in this clade are orthologs of AtERF6.</p><p>VviERF6L1 [UniProt: F6I2N8; VIT_16s0013g00900] had one of the most interesting profiles of the 12 members of this clade because its transcript abundance peaked at 23.2 &#x000b0;Brix (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Using k-means clustering, VviERF6L1 fell within Cluster 8 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) with 369 transcripts, including five additional VviERF6 paralogs. The top GO categories associated with Cluster 8 were genes associated with terpenoid metabolism and pigment biosynthesis (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Other interesting flavor associated categories included fatty acid and alcohol metabolism (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Representative transcripts from Cluster 8 that were correlated with the transcript abundance profile of VviERF6L1 can be seen in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. These are ACC oxidase, which is involved in ethylene biosynthesis; a lipoxygenase, part of a fatty acid degradation pathway giving rise to flavor alcohols such as hexenol; &#x003b1;-expansin 1, a cell wall loosening enzyme involved in fruit softening, and two terpene synthases, which produce important terpenes that contribute to Cabernet Sauvignon flavor and aroma. The high similarity of these transcript profiles indicates that ethylene biosynthesis and signaling may be involved in the production of grape aroma. Supporting this argument, two recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] have shown that a tomato ERF TF (Sl-ERF.B3), falling in the same ERF IX subfamily, has a strong effect on ethylene signaling and fruit ripening.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>

The transcript abundance of 129 members from the berries was determined to be above background noise levels on the microarray (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). The expression profiles of the 92 significantly affected AP2/ERF superfamily members were separated into six distinct clusters by hierarchical clustering and indicated that this superfamily had a complex response during berry ripening (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>).

Cluster 2 with 14 members, including 8 members of the VviERF6 clade, had much higher transcript abundance in the skin with a sharp peak at 23.2 &#x000b0;Brix. Cluster 3 (10 members) had similar profiles in both the skin and pulp with a peak abundance at 25&#x000b0; Brix.

Three different ethylene receptors, VviETR1, VviETR2, and VviEIN4 decreased with &#x000b0;Brix level in the skin, however there was very little or no change in the pulp. Likewise, VviCTR1, another negative regulator of ethylene signaling that interacts with the ethylene receptors, decreased between 22.6 and 23.2 &#x000b0;Brix in both the skin and the pulp. The transcript abundance of the positive regulator, VviEIN2, peaked at 25 &#x000b0;Brix in both the skin and the pulp. AtEIN2 is negatively regulated by AtCTR1 and when it is released from repression, turns on AtEIN3 (a TF) and the ethylene signaling pathway downstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The transcript abundance of VviEIN3 increased with &#x000b0;Brix level, peaking at 25 &#x000b0;Brix in the skin, and was much higher than in the pulp.

Several genes were proposed as good candidates for markers of ripeness and these were also examined in Cabernet Sauvignon berries using qPCR. Several of these candidate genes are consistent with our results in the present study. They include CCD4a (F6HJ14), a late embryogenesis abundant protein (F6HKF4), a dirigent-like protein (F6GUG1), and an S-adenosyl-L-methionine:salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (SAMT; F6GWU1). Of these, the transcript expression of SAMT was found to be temperature insensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>].</p><p>Like the previous study, the present study focused on very close stages in the mature berry when fruit flavors are known to develop. In contrast to the previous study on Chardonnay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], there were massive changes in the transcript abundance in hundreds of GO categories over this narrow window of ripening. This may in part be due to using six biological replicates rather than the standard three, which probably improved the detection of significantly changing transcripts. In addition, we used a different threshold level for statistical signficance and an improved microarray platform, which was able to detect double the number of transcripts.</p><p>In the present study, many differences were found between the skin and the pulp, &#x000b0;Brix levels and the interaction of tissue and &#x000b0;Brix. Important fruit ripening processes were affected including ethylene signaling, senescence, volatile aroma production, lipid metabolism and cell wall softening. These data indicate that fruit ripening in the late stages of maturity is a very dynamic and active process.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Importance of ethylene in fruit ripening and senescence: climacteric and nonclimacteric fruit</title><p>Ethylene is involved in climacteric fruit ripening with a CO<sub>2</sub> burst preceding the rise in ethylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In tomato, this occurs at the time the seeds become mature in the mature green fruit stage. At this stage, tomato fruits become sensitive to ethyene and can continue through the ripening stage. Prior to the mature breaker stage, ethylene cannot promote tomato ripening to full ripeness.</p><p>In nonclimacteric fruit, there is no respiratory burst of CO<sub>2</sub> and the ripening of most nonclimacteric fruits was thought not to respond significantly to an extra application of ethylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. However, recently some nonclimacteric fruit such as strawberry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], bell pepper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] and grape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] have been found to produce a small amount of ethylene and appear to have responses to ethylene at certain stages. In the study of grapes, this peak was observed just before the start of veraison, followed by decreases in ethylene concentrations for several weeks afterwards; the late mature stages of ripening were not examined.</p><p>Ethylene action is dependent upon ethylene concentration and ethylene sensitivity or signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. In this study, there were clear and signficant changes in transcript abundance of genes involved in ethylene signaling and biosynthesis in the late stages of berry ripening. Seeds become fully mature at this time (based upon our observations that green seeds turn brown at this stage). Perhaps there is a signal from the seeds when they become mature that allows the fruit to ripen and senesce? Perhaps small amounts of ethylene are produced or there is a change in sensitivity to ethylene?</p><p>Seymour et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] suggested the response of EIN3 might be a common signaling mechanism for both climacteric and nonclimacteric fruit. The responses of VviEIN3 in this study and in a pepper fruit ripening study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] are consistent with this hypothesis. In addition, the transcript abundance of VviEIN3 in grape is very responsive to ethylene and the ethylene inhibitor, MCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>].</p><p>There are many other factors other than fruit development that can influence ethylene signaling. Could chilling of the fruit or other aspects of the processing of the grapes influence these responses? Could there be some influence of other abiotic or biotic stresses? These are questions that can only be addressed in future studies with additional experiments that are designed to answer these questions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, there are dynamic metabolic changes in the late stages of berry ripening including large changes in abundance of transcripts involved in ethylene signaling, fruit softening, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Many of these changes can have important effects that may result in the production of volatile aromas that influence berry flavor. A unique clade of the subfamily IX ERF transcription factors was highly expressed in the skin during this ripening phase. The important implications of this research is that ethylene may play a bigger role in this nonclimacteric fruit than previously thought, particularly in the late stages of ripening when flavors are produced.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plant material and experimental conditions</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Commercial vineyard and row randomization plan</title><p>A vineyard from a commercial winery in Paso Robles CA, planted with <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L. cv.

If one of the six replicates was more than 1.35 standard deviations away from the mean across the six replicates, this indicated a very high probability (87%) that the remaining five measures were very similar, and that this replicate was an outlier.
