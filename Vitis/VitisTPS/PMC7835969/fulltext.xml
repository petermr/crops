It has been previously shown that volatiles belonging to the isoprenoid family can confer protection against abiotic stresses. In this work, two <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> cv. &#x02018;Chardonnay&#x02019; clones (SMA130 and INRA809) differing due to a mutation (S272P) of the DXS gene encoding for 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (the first dedicated enzyme of the 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway) and involved in the regulation of isoprenoids biosynthesis were investigated in field trials and laboratory experiments. Leaf monoterpene emission, chlorophyll fluorescence and gas-exchange measurements were assessed over three seasons at different phenological stages and either carried out in in vivo or controlled conditions under contrasting temperatures. A significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) increase in leaf monoterpene emission was observed in INRA809 when plants were experiencing high temperatures and over two experiments, while no differences were recorded for SMA130. Significant variation was observed for the rate of leaf CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation under heat stress, with INRA809 maintaining higher photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance values than SMA130 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) when leaf temperature increased above 30 &#x000b0;C. At the same time, the maximum photochemical quantum yield of PSII (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>) was affected by heat stress in the non-emitting clone (SMA130), while the INRA809 showed a significant resilience of PSII under elevated temperature conditions. Consistent data were recorded between field seasons and temperature treatments in controlled environment conditions, suggesting a strong influence of monoterpene emission on heat tolerance under high temperatures.

Introduction</title><p>High-temperature stress (heat stress, HS) is one of the main environmental conditions affecting crop physiology and productivity [<xref rid="B1-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, further increases in annual temperatures are expected in the next future [<xref rid="B3-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the Mediterranean viticulture, temperature above optimum has been linked to yield reduction and to a decrease in grape and wine quality [<xref rid="B4-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], owing to impaired physiological performances and phenological hastening [<xref rid="B5-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is generally accepted that HS in grapevine occurs when leaf heat dissipation capacity is smaller than the total absorbed solar energy and, under limited water availability, following reduced leaf transpiration and accumulation of latent heat [<xref rid="B6-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, the degree of heat stress damage in grapevine depends on both maximum diurnal temperature and the duration of daily HS, with significant physiological downregulation in days with prolonged HS hence bringing further complexity in the assessment of the genotypic heat tolerance [<xref rid="B4-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>High temperatures can have direct harmful effects associated with physical damage to tissues or indirect effects linked with changes in plant metabolism [<xref rid="B1-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One of the main consequences of HS often coupled with the presence of intense solar radiation is the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to oxidative stress [<xref rid="B7-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. ROS accumulation significantly reduces photosynthetic capacity in grapevine with carbon metabolism of the stroma and photochemical reactions in thylakoid membranes considered as the primary sites of injury at high temperatures [<xref rid="B8-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Early work suggested that HS reduces or even interrupts the activity of photosystem II (PSII), leading to significant reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and leaf source capacity [<xref rid="B9-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Many traits have been associated with increased HS tolerance in grapevine such as elevated transpiration rate per unit of leaf area, cellular turgidity maintenance through osmotic adjustment and modification in the antioxidant system to restore the cellular redox balance and homeostasis [<xref rid="B1-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B11-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, the synthesis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has often been related with increased HS tolerance in several species [<xref rid="B12-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In particular, terpenes are the main VOCs produced by plants under HS, and high temperature has been shown to be the major driver of terpene biosynthesis [<xref rid="B13-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The photoprotection role of terpenes has been extensively reported, and a tight link between HS tolerance and terpene emission has been often observed [<xref rid="B15-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, most available literature focuses on the role of isoprene, i.e., the most emitted plant hydrocarbon into the atmosphere [<xref rid="B17-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Grapevine is not an isoprene-emitting species, although some varieties are known to produce high levels of volatile monoterpenes [<xref rid="B18-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While numerous studies have indicated that monoterpenes may play an important regulatory role under plant stress [<xref rid="B13-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], their biological functions in grapevine are still poorly understood [<xref rid="B19-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Indeed, the emission capacity of monoterpenes from vine leaves in aromatic varieties and their potential role on heat stress tolerance has never been extensively explored. Therefore, in this work, two field-grown Chardonnay clones with contrasting monoterpene emission rates were monitored over three consecutive years. This study aims: (i) to evaluate the effects of HS on key grapevine leaf physiological traits such as chlorophyll fluorescence and gas-exchange; (ii) to assess the variation in emission of volatile monoterpenes from leaves of two cv. Chardonnay clones (SMA130 and INRA809) differing for a mutation of the DXS gene involved in the regulation of isoprenoids biosynthesis and under different degrees of HS; (iii) to determine a potential relationship between tolerance to HS and monoterpene emission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-10-00181"><title>2.

The results of our work, however, suggest a generalized and significant negative effect of HS on physiological performances of grapevine.</p><p>Although with different degrees between the pair of Chardonnay clones, HS-induced monoterpenes emission in both 2017 and 2018. The temperature dependence of monoterpene emission in plants has been previously shown [<xref rid="B12-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B21-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and several enzymes appear to be involved in monoterpene biosynthesis under stress [<xref rid="B22-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Monoterpene emission has been often linked to thermotolerance in several species [<xref rid="B12-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B23-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], either by improving membrane heat resistance [<xref rid="B23-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or indirectly by acting as antioxidants and quenching free-radicals [<xref rid="B24-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our work suggests that the HS experienced at the time of analyses triggered defensive mechanisms likely due to a marked oxidative stress.</p><p>Previous work reported F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> as an excellent indicator of HS tolerance in grapevine [<xref rid="B9-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], thus, validating the approach used in our study. Higher susceptibility of <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> varieties to HS was previously observed when compared to wild grape and hybrids [<xref rid="B9-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and the acceptor side of the PSII was less damaged by heat than the donor side or the reaction center in grape leaves. Indeed, over three independent seasons characterized by different degrees of HS and growing conditions (pot and field), a significant reduction in the maximum quantum yield of PSII was evident for both the clones tested accompanied by detrimental effects on water status (diurnal reduction in LWP during the hottest part of the day) and slow recovery. The reduction in F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> under heat stress may be associated with several processes such as (1) modification in the PSII super-complex hampering energy transfer from antenna complexes to the PSII reaction center [<xref rid="B25-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; (2) alteration in the oxygen-evolving complex activity [<xref rid="B26-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; (3) increased photo-protective regulatory mechanisms [<xref rid="B27-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; (4) inhibition of the photosynthetic electron transport chain [<xref rid="B28-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These mechanisms may act jointly and can be affected by the intensity and length of HS: further work is, therefore, required to dissect the mechanisms underlying F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> reduction in grapevine under heat stress.</p><p>Similarly, rapid increase in leaf temperature led to a reduction in <italic>A</italic> that was significant at 35 &#x000b0;C and 40 &#x000b0;C. In other species acclimated to Mediterranean environments, similar thermal sensitivity thresholds of <italic>A</italic> were found [<xref rid="B29-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], although genotypic variation was previously recorded [<xref rid="B30-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our data suggest that either a reduction in photochemistry (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>) or an increase in photorespiration (increase in ETR/<italic>A</italic> ratio) are induced under HS in grapevine, although impairment in Rubisco activity and mesophyll diffusion cannot be excluded [<xref rid="B31-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Under high temperatures, an increase in <italic>g<sub>s</sub></italic> and transpiration has been often observed for several species [<xref rid="B32-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

In our work and consistent with previous findings in other species, the monoterpene emitter INRA809 steadily maintained high F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> after HS in several experiments followed by fast post-stress recovery. In addition, non-photochemical energy dissipation was often higher in SMA130 than INRA809, consistent with other reports where isoprenoid-emitting ecotypes were compared [<xref rid="B37-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Differences in NPQ have been often related to changes in carotenoids with a severe increase in antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin and a consequently higher oxidation of xanthophylls under stress conditions [<xref rid="B37-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Similarly, native non-isoprenoid-emitting species are also characterized by higher levels of zeaxanthin and NPQ [<xref rid="B38-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], suggesting that isoprenoid emission (in this case monoterpene) can protect photosynthesis at least under the stress conditions applied in this work. Similar results were reported by [<xref rid="B15-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], comparing a wild-type and isoprene-emitting tobacco mutants, showing that isoprene emission maintains PSII stability at high temperatures by providing a homogeneous distribution of the light-absorbing centers and a stable thylakoid membrane stiffness. This is in line with the higher <italic>A</italic> found in INRA809 at higher leaf temperature and compared to SMA130 accompanied by a lower ETR/<italic>A</italic> ratio at 40 &#x000b0;C. However, ETR/<italic>A</italic> ratio increased in both clones under HS suggesting that the rate of reducing power in excess of that used for photosynthesis was partitioned to other sinks, with INRA809 likely to partition excessive electrons to the monoterpenes biosynthetic pathway. In addition, a higher ETR/<italic>A</italic> ratio for SMA130 at 40 &#x000b0;C under stress suggests an increase in distribution of electrons to alternative sinks at high temperatures that may indicate greater photorespiratory losses [<xref rid="B39-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>A more negative slope in the regression of leaf temperature to F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> was observed for SMA130 compared to INRA809, suggesting that increasing leaf temperature led to a more rapid reduction in photochemical efficiency. The fact that the monoterpene emitter INRA809 maintained higher F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> for a similar leaf temperature to SMA130 may further confirm an induced thermotolerance of the emitter clone. Consistent with this work, F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> declined much less in isoprene-emitting tobacco plants subjected to environmental stress [<xref rid="B15-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B40-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, data collected on the 23 July 2019 highlighted a much higher increase in leaf temperature for identical environmental conditions in SMA130 than INRA809. This increase in leaf temperature can be mainly attributed to a reduced leaf evaporative cooling in SMA130 following restricted transpiration rates at high temperature and hence VPD levels. Gas-exchange data confirm that <italic>g<sub>s</sub></italic> was higher in INRA809 than SMA130, but only at a leaf temperature of around 30 &#x000b0;C, thus indicating a higher stomatal sensitivity of SMA130 when leaf temperature reached above 40 &#x000b0;C. Developing water stress cannot be the cause of the differences in transpiration rates as TDR analysis carried out in 2019 showed a field volumetric water content between 40 and 45% at 30cm soil depth (data not shown). VOC emissions have been previously shown to be partially involved in <italic>g<sub>s</sub></italic> responses to environmental stimuli [<xref rid="B16-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For instance, isoprene-emitting capacity can induce fast stomatal closure and elevated stomatal sensitivity to soil water stress, mainly to avoid tissue dehydration [<xref rid="B41-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The conservative behavior of isoprene-emitter <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in [<xref rid="B16-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was associated with a strategy to increase the internal isoprene concentration (due to its high volatility) under stress conditions and to enhance its potential beneficial effect, which is minimized under low concentrations [<xref rid="B42-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Conversely, monoterpene-emitting species are more common in xeric habitats than isoprene-emitter species, and a non-conservative strategy is advantageous for maximizing nutrient capture and for successful colonization of habitats with significant fluctuations in resource availability [<xref rid="B43-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, it is not surprising that indications of a lower stomatal sensitivity to HS (and high VPD) are present in the monoterpene emitter INRA809 compared to SMA130, as already shown in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref rid="B16-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The generally significant HS tolerance coupled with a higher transpiration rate under severe HS conditions and high VPD in INRA809 might be considered a combination of preferable traits to overcome severe heat waves, at least in situations where irrigation is available. Further work is needed, however, to (1) test our hypothesis on water and heat stress interaction tolerance for INRA809 and to (2) dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in the higher HS tolerance displayed by the monoterpene emitter clone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-10-00181"><title>4.

It is characterized by a good level of productivity, a good level of organic acids and sugars, and the absence of terpenic compounds in the bunch and the must. Compared to other clones of Chardonnay, the Muscat character of INRA 809 has been attributed to a mutation (S272P) in 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase 1 (VvDXS1), a key enzyme of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway for isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis in grapevine [<xref rid="B45-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-plants-10-00181" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>For the field experiments (2017 and 2019), the two clones were grown in the vineyard located at the agricultural site of the Fondazione Edmund Mach at San Michele all&#x02019;Adige (46&#x000b0;11&#x02032;28&#x02032;&#x02032;N, 11&#x000b0;8&#x02032;11&#x02032;&#x02032;E, 232 m of altitude).

While monoterpene emission can be considered a preferable trait under HS, additional desirable traits were detected in INRA809 (e.g., higher evaporative cooling under developing HS).
