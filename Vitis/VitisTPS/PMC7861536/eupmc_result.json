SNPs of target carotenoid metabolic genes in 13 founders of the Japanese citrus breeding population were explored using the SureSelect target enrichment method. An independent allele was determined based on the presence or absence of reliable SNPs, using trio analysis to confirm inheritability between parent and offspring. Among the 13 founders, there were 7 PSY alleles, 7 HYb alleles, 11 ZEP alleles, 5 NCED alleles, and 4 alleles for the eQTL that control the transcription levels of PDS and ZDS among the ancestral species, indicating that some founders acquired those alleles from them. The carotenoid composition data of 263 breeding pedigrees in juice sac tissues revealed that the phenotypic variance of carotenoid composition was similar to that in the 13 founders, whereas the mean of total carotenoid content increased. This increase in total carotenoid content correlated with the increase in either or both \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin in juice sac tissues. Bayesian statistical analysis between allelic composition of target genes and carotenoid composition in 263 breeding pedigrees indicated that PSY-a and ZEP-e alleles at PSY and ZEP loci had strong positive effects on increasing the total carotenoid content, including \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and violaxanthin, in juice sac tissues. Moreover, the pyramiding of these alleles also increased the \u03b2-cryptoxanthin content. Interestingly, the offset interaction between the alleles with increasing and decreasing effects on carotenoid content and the epistatic interaction among carotenoid metabolic genes were observed and these interactions complexed carotenoid profiles in breeding population. These results revealed that allele composition would highly influence the carotenoid composition in citrus fruits.
