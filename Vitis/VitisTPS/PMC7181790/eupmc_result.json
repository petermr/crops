Here, de novo transcriptome analysis of inflorescence of three development stages from initial flower bud to flowering stage 50% from two lavender cultivars with contrasting EO production revealed the dynamics of 100,177 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) in various stages of spike development within and across the cultivars.

The upregulated genes were mainly concentrated in the MEP pathway, while\u00a0most genes in the MVA pathway were downregulated during flower development, and cultivars with a higher EO content presented higher expression of genes in the MEP pathway, indicating that EOs were chiefly produced through the MEP pathway.
