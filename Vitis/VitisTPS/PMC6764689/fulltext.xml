Downy mildew caused by the oomycete <italic>Plasmopara viticola</italic> is the major pathogen in viticulture worldwide and responsible for up to 60% of pesticide treatments. Alternatives to reduce fungicides are thus utterly needed to ensure sustainable vineyard-ecosystems, consumer health and public acceptance. Essential oils (EOs) are amongst the most promising natural plant protection alternatives and have shown their antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties on several agricultural crops. However, the efficiency of EOs highly depends on timing, application method and the molecular interactions between the host, the pathogen and EO. Despite proven EO efficiency, the underlying processes are still not understood and remain a black box. The objectives of the present study were: a) to evaluate whether a continuous fumigation of a particular EO can control downy mildew in order to circumvent the drawbacks of direct application, b) to decipher molecular mechanisms that could be triggered in the host and the pathogen by EO application and c) to try to differentiate whether essential oils directly repress the oomycete or act as plant resistance primers. To achieve this a custom-made climatic chamber was constructed that enabled a continuous fumigation of potted vines with different EOs during long-term experiments. The grapevine (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>) cv Chasselas was chosen in reason of its high susceptibility to <italic>Plasmopara viticola</italic>. Grapevine cuttings were infected with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>viticola</italic> and subsequently exposed to continuous fumigation of different EOs at different concentrations, during 2 application time spans (24 hours and 10 days). Experiments were stopped when infection symptoms were clearly observed on the leaves of the control plants. Plant physiology (photosynthesis and growth rate parameters) were recorded and leaves were sampled at different time points for subsequent RNA extraction and transcriptomics analysis. Strikingly, the <italic>Oregano vulgare</italic> EO vapour treatment during 24h post-infection proved to be sufficient to reduce downy mildew development by 95%. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 24h and 10d treatments and used for whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). Sequenced reads were then mapped onto the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vinifera</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>viticola</italic> genomes. Less than 1% of reads could be mapped onto the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>viticola</italic> genome from treated samples, whereas up to 30% reads from the controls mapped onto the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>viticola</italic> genome, thereby confirming the visual observation of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>viticola</italic> absence in the treated plants. On average, 80% of reads could be mapped onto the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vinifera</italic> genome for differential expression analysis, which yielded 4800 modulated genes. Transcriptomic data clearly showed that the treatment triggered the plant&#x02019;s innate immune system with genes involved in salicylic, jasmonic acid and ethylene synthesis and signaling, activating Pathogenesis-Related-proteins as well as phytoalexin synthesis. These results elucidate EO-host-pathogen interactions for the first time and indicate that the antifungal efficiency of EO is mainly due to the triggering of resistance pathways inside the host plants. This is of major importance for the production and research on biopesticides, plant stimulation products and for resistance-breeding strategies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Healthfood programme HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland</institution></funding-source><award-id>73312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6302-6297</contrib-id><name><surname>Rienth</surname><given-names>Markuis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Healthfood programme of the HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland</institution></funding-source><award-id>73354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lefort</surname><given-names>Fran&#x000e7;ois</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by grants No 73312 (MR) and No 73354 (FL) within the Research thematic Healthfood programme of the HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland.

Responding to consumers&#x02019; increasing demands for a sustainable food production implies developing alternatives to conventional synthetic plant protection products. Long-term fungicide applications have consequently led to increased resistances of pathogens and detrimental impacts on ecosystems and humans [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], followed by a decreasing acceptance by consumers [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This is particularly true for grapevine (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L.), which is highly sensitive to fungal diseases such as downy mildew caused by the obligate biotrophic pathogenic oomycete <italic>Plasmopara viticola</italic> (Berk. &#x00026; M.A. Curtis) Berl. &#x00026; De Toni, (1888) which is natural to North America. This organism was accidentally introduced in Europe via infected cuttings at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and is one of the most devastating diseases of viticulture worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which explains that the application of relatively large amounts of pesticides in viticulture, when compared to other crops, is necessary to guarantee yield and quality of grape production.</p><p>The infection cycle of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>viticola</italic> starts with zoomeiospores, which are released by mature zoosporangia germinating from oospores which are the only source of primary inoculum. Encysted zoomeiospores germinate to form a germ tube, which will penetrate the leaf through a stoma. A substomatal vesicle then develops and gives rise to the intercellular mycelium with its many haustoria penetrating cell walls of the mesophyll. The incubation time until visible symptoms appear may last from 4 to approximately 18 days depending on temperature. After this time span, oil-spot lesions appear on the adaxial surface. If the leaf is subsequently incubated in conditions of high humidity, hyphal coils grow into the sub-stomatal cavity and give rise to sporangiophores emerging from the stoma. Incubated in the laboratory at 14&#x02013;28&#x000b0;C and high humidity (above 90%), the sporangiophores and zoosporangia develop overnight, before liberating zoospores [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>During the vegetative cycle, growers usually need to treat between 3 to 15 times against downy mildew with systemic or organic fungicides. This represents a fundamental problem regarding the sustainability of ecosystems, biodiversity, consumer health and acceptance as well as long term efficiency of systemic fungicides, along with an increased development of resistances [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222854.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>To reduce synthetic pesticides, organic production is one alternative to conventional farming but still highly dependent on copper (Cu), the oldest and still a very efficient treatment against downy mildew. It remains, however, a heavy metal accumulating in vineyard soils. When compared to the overall average Cu concentration of 16.85 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in soils, vineyards have the highest mean soil Cu concentration (49.26 mg kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) of all land categories, followed by olive groves and orchards [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222854.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cultivation of disease resistant varieties is certainly one of the most ecological solutions to reduce pesticides and, due to tremendous efforts of international public breeding programmes, a large choice of disease-resistant grape cultivars is nowadays available to growers [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the organoleptic quality is still often inferior to the one of traditional cultivars, making them less attractive to consumers and thus producers. For these last reasons, access of organic wines to the wine market is still difficult. Furthermore, the durability of resistance factors is often not stable, in particular in monogenetic cultivars [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Genetically modified organisms are not a solution either, since they are so far neither premised nor authorised in most producing countries. Alternative plant protection strategies are thus utterly needed to guarantee a sustainable viticulture that is both environment- and consumer-friendly.</p><p>It is now widely acknowledged that plants possess two forms of innate immune system responses against pathogens. Molecular expression patterns induced by microbial molecules, i.e. Pathogen, Microbial or Damage-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs, MAMPs or DAMPs) lead to pattern triggered immunity (PTI), which represents the first line of defense of plants against pathogens. PTI leads to a cascade, which is marked by common signaling events, such as ion fluxes, protein phosphorylation cascades, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction of defense genes and cell-wall reinforcement by callose deposition [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222854.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The second innate immune defense response is the effector-triggered immunity (ETI), where the plant&#x02019;s response is triggered by pathogen effectors. ETI results from the highly specific, direct or indirect interaction of pathogen effectors and the products of plant disease resistance (R) genes, which leads to a strong local defense response often associated with programmed cell death (PCD) as a part of hypersensitive response (HR) that stops pathogen growth [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Inducing resistance to pathogens by activating the plant&#x02019;s innate immunity through application of natural products which trigger PTI and/or ETI, could thus represent an alternative strategy to protect plants against diseases [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Plant phytochemicals have been investigated for decades, and it has been demonstrated that specific plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have antifungal, anti-bacterial, as well as repulsive effects on insect pests. It is however not known to what extent VOCs have direct effects on the pathogen or induce stimulation of the host plant&#x02019;s defense mechanisms.</p><p>During the last decade, several different resistance inducers have been tested for their ability to induce defense responses of the susceptible <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vinifera</italic> against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>viticola</italic>, such as beta-aminobutyric acid [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] chitosan [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], laminarin, sulfated laminarin [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222854.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Frutogard<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and other plant extracts [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222854.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>As natural products, EOs have shown antifungal properties against several pathogens such as <italic>P</italic>. <italic>viticola</italic>, <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> Pers. 1794 and <italic>Fusarium sp</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222854.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The chemical composition and activities of members of the EO-producing family <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> have been widely studied, and the antioxidant activity could mainly be attributed to carnosoic acid, carnosol, rosmarinic acid, and other phenolic compounds, whereas the fungicidal activity seems to be due to molecules such as carvacrol, thymol, and p-cymene [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The use of EOs to control plant pathogens has been evaluated on different species with different pathogens. In such studies, the timing of EO applications seems to be a crucial point to increase the efficiency of pathogen control. For instance, <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. EO had preventive effects against <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cinerea</italic> development on tomato leaves, with the highest efficiency when applied 24h post-infection. This suggested an effect on early fungal development such as spore germination, germ tube growth and/or appressorium formation, since light- and electron-scanning microscope observations revealed alterations of hyphal morphology when exposed to EOs [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222854.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Studies conducted on grapevines, infected with downy mildew and treated with sage (<italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L.) EO showed a 94% reduction in disease severity. However, due to the very low rainfastness and degradation of EOs, the efficiency in rainy years was much less important [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This is probably the reason why other field studies on the variety Merlot, using EOs of <italic>Corymbia citriodora</italic> (Hook.), <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (L.), <italic>O</italic>. <italic>vulgare</italic> and <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. did not show any efficiency in field trials against downy mildew, whereas thyme and oregano EOs were very efficient in inhibiting fungal growth in Petri dishes. This highlights that a major problem of EO efficiency against pathogens is due to degradation by light, heat, oxygen and humidity [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], application time and bad rainfastness.</p><p>Several studies indicate that the vapour phase of EO is more fungitoxic than the contact liquid phase, although this has only been shown for <italic>Botrytis</italic> in Petri dishes [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222854.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0222854.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, a continuous fumigation of plants with EO vapour could possibly circumvent these drawbacks. For a sustainable agricultural production, using EO vapour as a direct treatment with diffusers or in the form of co-plantations of EO-VOCs emitting plants could be considered in integrated systems, able to control fungal diseases.</p><p>The mechanisms underpinning the effect of antifungal EO-VOCs are not well understood so far. Some VOCs seem to have a direct effect on pathogens, while others seem to elicit the plant innate immune system with its complex mechanism. Several authors have found genes involved in the biosynthesis of phytoalexins, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and cell wall proteins when VOCs were applied. [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Understanding the mechanism involved in EO efficacy against fungi could thus provide very valuable information when developing natural fungicides, plant defense stimulation products, as well as providing genetic targets for the breeding of resistant varieties.</p><p>The aims of the present study were thus to investigate if the vapour phase, applied by a continuous fumigation of different EOs, could inhibit the development of downy mildew on grapevine leaves and, in case of proven efficiency, to study and reveal the induced transcriptomic changes by RNA-sequencing in an attempt to elucidate the underlaying molecular interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Experimental set up</title><p>Two customised vaporisation systems (control and treatment) were built to enable a continuous flow of EO vapour during several weeks.

For this second test, EO vapour treatments were maintained for only 24h after infection. Infected plants were then kept for 10d in the chamber to assess disease severity after induction of sporulation, as for the first experiments. Interestingly, the efficiency of the EO treatment against downy mildew was only slightly but not significantly lower, compared to the 10d treatment with a 95% decrease in disease severity in treated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222854.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Additionally, oregano EO showed a slightly higher efficiency than thyme EO, and for this reason only the oregano EO modality was used for transcriptomics.</p><p>This strongly suggests that the antifungal effect of EOs acts during the early stages of the infection cycle or even prior to infection. However, it remains unclear whether this is because of a direct lethal effect either on the zoospores before producing haustoria or on the haustoria growth before entering the stomata or else due to the inhibition of mycelium growth inside the leaf. An alternative hypothesis is that EO vapour stimulates innate plant immunity by activating PTI and/or ETI, which would impede entrance of the haustoria through the stomata and/or limit mycelium growth inside the leaf.</p><p>This ability of different EO against downy mildew has been highlighted for crops other than grapevine. For example in cucumber, castor and clove oils significantly reduced the severity of downy mildew [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Similarly, sage EO applied at a concentration of around 1% reduced disease severity of downy mildew on cucumber by almost 100% in greenhouses but only 70% in the field (40). This illustrates the problem of rainfastness and degradability of EO in field conditions, thereby justifying the vaporisation approach.</p><p>Several studies on grapevine have confirmed that EOs could be an efficient alternative treatment against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>viticola</italic>.

Antifungal properties are generally linked to cell membrane disruption, alteration and inhibition of cell wall formation, dysfunction of the fungal mitochondria, inhibition of efflux pumps and / or ROS production. More specifically, the antifungal activity of carvacrol and thymol have often been attributed to their cell membrane damaging effect, because of their interaction with membrane sterols, in particular with ergosterol. Carvacrol would be able to bind with the sterols of the fungal plasma membrane, which would result in damage to the membrane, conducing to the death of the fungus [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

Their upregulation in the present experiment have given an indication of their role within the regulation of the innate immune system upon exogenous elicitors and pointed out their important role within plant defense mechanism to biotic stresses. The set of target genes regulated by each ERF has not yet been completely elucidated, and the present gene expression data might contribute to the understanding of complex coregulations.

The biosynthesis of this secondary metabolite requires the presence of only one unique enzyme, <italic>stilbene synthase (STS)</italic>, which has thus become a feasible molecule for metabolic engineering. For example, heterologous expression of the grapevine <italic>STS</italic> gene <italic>VST1</italic> under control of its native promoter in tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) has led to pathogen-inducible biosynthesis of resveratrol, which correlated with enhanced disease resistance to <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cinerea</italic>. Upon <italic>O</italic>. <italic>vulgare</italic> treatment, 9 isogenes coding for <italic>STSs</italic> were upregulated to very high levels such as <italic>VIT_10s0042g00890</italic> and <italic>VIT_10s0042g00870</italic> with a respectively 42- and 32-fold induction.

A similar observation can be made regarding genes involved in PSI (Photosystem I reaction center subunit genes), and PSII genes linked to photosynthetic-chain phosphorylation and chlorophyll biosynthesis, that were systematically repressed after a 24h treatment but no longer after 10d.

EOs that were shown to possess antifungal properties in many previous studies, could potentially represent a natural strategy to replace or at least reduce the use of synthetic fungicides. However, their adhesiveness and stability on the plant is very bad, when applied in their liquid phase. The present study is, as far as we know, the first one to test and confirm that the vapour phase of EOs is <italic>in vivo</italic> highly efficient against the major pathogen <italic>P</italic>. <italic>viticola</italic>, the causing agent of downy mildew. This would offer new alternatives in the development of innovative plant protection strategies that would involve fumigation systems in greenhouses or dispensers in field-grown crops, using volatile organic compounds from plant EOs.</p><p>Even more significantly, the present study provides important information regarding the underlying mechanisms in the host-pathogen-EO interaction and shows clearly that the <italic>O</italic>. <italic>vulgare</italic> vapour triggered a multilayered immune system of the plants. Gene expression analysis revealed a complex activation of hormonal crosstalk involving JA, ET, and SA biosynthesis and their signaling cascades. This led to the activation of different immune mechanisms involving PR genes activation, flavonoids and stilbene synthesis, as well as transcriptional networks in relation to PCD and apoptosis. Not only does <italic>O</italic>. <italic>vulgare</italic> vapour, or one or several of its constituents, seem to act as PAMPs to trigger PTI, but also as an elicitor that transiently triggers ETI. This complex interaction is confirmed by numerous studies that have shown that ETI, basal defense and PTI use a common set of signaling components including multiple regulatory proteins, reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), as well as the phytohormones salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET) and jasmonic acid [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Starting from these results a next step would be to select between 5&#x02013;10 marker genes of the plant immune system, for which expression was enhanced, in order to allow for a quick and easier follow-up of EOs application experiments though qRT-PCR amplifcation of these genes.</p><p>To what extent the inhibitory effect of EO vapour on <italic>P</italic>. v<italic>iticola</italic> development was due to a direct toxicity of the EO vapour on the pathogens or to the stimulation of the innate immune system of vines, could not be clearly elucidated with the applied methodology.</p><p>The study, however, provides important molecular data, such as target genes, gene networks and metabolic pathways involved in the innate immune system of the plant and therefore important for future genetics studies and resistance-breeding programmes [<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0222854.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The long term objective is to understand better the effects of EOs and to identify, if possible, which of their terpene components, are the most effective and in the mean time to develop systems that would allow for EOs application to reduce the need of pesticide applications. Among the potential strategies to be tested, some sort of field dispensers similar to pheromone dispenser already used against the grape berry moth, and continuously dispersing effective EOs or EOs components could be tested in a quite close future, in fields or greenhouses. Though it is not expected that such systems completely inhibit infections, they probably could lower the disease pressure and help to reduce systemic fungicides. Testing EO emitting plants in co-plantation in greenhouses or in the fields, should also be explored, particularly in organic production systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0222854.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Picture of the custom-made climatic chamber and vaporisation system.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0222854.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0222854.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Cytoscape graph of affected transcripts within the phenylpropanoid synthesis pathway.</title><p>Blue: repressed, red: induced transcripts by 24h EO vapour treatment.
