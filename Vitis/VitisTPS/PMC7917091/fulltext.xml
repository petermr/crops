To better understand the genetic basis of the terpenoid diversity in lavender, we present a high-quality reference genome for the Chinese lavender cultivar &#x02018;Jingxun 2&#x02019; using PacBio and Hi-C technologies to anchor the 894.50&#x02009;Mb genome assembly into 27 pseudochromosomes. In addition to the &#x003b3; triplication event, lavender underwent two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) during the Eocene&#x02013;Oligocene (29.6 MYA) and Miocene&#x02013;Pliocene (6.9 MYA) transitions. As a result of tandem duplications and lineage-specific WGDs, gene families related to terpenoid biosynthesis in lavender are substantially expanded compared to those of five other species in Lamiaceae. Many terpenoid biosynthesis transcripts are abundant in glandular trichomes. We further integrated the contents of ecologically functional terpenoids and coexpressed terpenoid biosynthetic genes to construct terpenoid-gene networks. Typical gene clusters, including <italic>TPS-TPS</italic>, <italic>TPS-CYP450</italic>, and <italic>TPS-BAHD</italic>, linked with compounds that primarily function as attractants or repellents, were identified by their similar patterns of change during flower development or in response to methyl jasmonate.

Lavender grows spontaneously in the Mediterranean region, and &#x02018;Jingxun 2&#x02019; is a new lavender cultivar recently bred by Chinese researchers and is characterized by high levels of linalyl acetate and linalool and low amounts of camphor in its essential oil (EO), making it the most valued lavender oil additive to many over-the-counter complementary medicines and cosmetic products in China.</p><p id="Par5">Spatially restricted and structurally diverse specialized metabolites are generally used by plants as a chemical language for their interactions with the environment, such as in herbivore deterrence or pollinator attraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Insect pollinators play an important role in lavender reproduction as they carry out cross-pollination. Mono- and sesquiterpenoids are the main compounds in lavender essential oil (EO) and are primarily stored in an epidermal secretory structure, namely, the glandular trichome (GT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. As phytochemical diversity in the GT drives the diversity of the lavender-visiting insect community, intraspecific gene flow and chemical defense compound levels are elevated, giving rise to genetic diversity and adaptation to hostile environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Genetic and biochemical studies have highlighted that the locations of biosynthetic genes for specialized chemicals are not randomly scattered but adjacent to one another in the genome, that is, in metabolic gene clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Terpene synthases (TPSs) are crucial for terpenoid structural diversity and generate diverse scaffolds and various tailoring enzymes, including cytochrome P450 (CYP450), acyltransferases, 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, methyltransferases, and glycosyltransferases, which modify and further diversify scaffolds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Physical connections of these gene families are found in the biosynthesis of specialized terpenoids, which are often important as medicines, fragrances, and insecticides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Gene duplication and neofunctionalization appear to drive the evolution of plant gene clusters, resulting in the diversification of specialized terpenoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Duplicated genes are prevalent in plant genomes and have arisen primarily via whole-genome duplications (WGDs; polyploidy) and tandem duplications (TD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The expansion of the <italic>TPS</italic>, <italic>CYP450</italic>, and <italic>BAHD</italic> gene families in several plants often occurs via these two routes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These duplicates provide the available materials that contribute to the evolution of divergent functions, such as inducing resistance to pests, increasing tolerance to stress, and promoting plants to gain some adaptive advantages, thus leading to the enhancement of plant fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Clustering of terpenoid biosynthetic genes is likely to facilitate the coinheritance and coexpression of beneficial gene combinations, thus potentially reducing the possibility of the loss of single pathway genes following recombination events and incomplete cluster expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Based on transcriptome analysis, recent investigations have indicated that ancient polyploidization events have occurred in Lamiaceae. Moreover, frequent WGDs predicted within Nepetoideae may correlate with the species richness of this subclade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The expansion of terpenoid biosynthetic gene families is closely correlated with mono- and sesquiterpenoid diversity. For example, the expansion of the TPS-a subfamily is responsible for the synthesis of sesquiterpenes in patchouli, and the size of the TPS-b subfamily has a positive relationship with monoterpene diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">As a representative volatile renewable resource, <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> has the potential to be developed as a genomic model for studying terpenoid production. Although a draft genome of lavender has been generated from second-generation sequencing results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, the vast majority of the lavender metabolic gene clusters and the evolution of duplicated genes remain undiscovered. Here, we provide a chromosome-level genome of lavender. Furthermore, our work revealed that WGD and TD promoted diversification and terpenoid variation within the Lamiaceae, and the resulting expansive gene families were correlated with lavender adaption to the Mediterranean environment. Meanwhile, gene-terpenoid networks indicated the combinational function of physically linked and co-expressed gene clusters related to specific terpenoid biosynthesis.

Of these intragenomic syntenic blocks, 72.3% were found to be syntenic to more than one location in the genome, suggesting that more than one WGD occurred in the evolutionary history of lavender. To investigate lineage-specific WGDs in lavender, synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) were characterized in the <italic>Sbai</italic>, <italic>Sspl</italic>, <italic>Tgra</italic>, <italic>Vvin</italic>, and lavender genomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

Similarly, a study based on transcriptome data indicated that high levels of gene duplication events occurred in species-abundant Nepetoideae relative to the other subclades of Lamiaceae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Most large angiosperm families, such as Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Orchidaceae, have shown strong evidence of multiple polyploidization events in their evolutionary histories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, ancient polyploidy has potentially contributed to the species richness of this large subclade of Lamiaceae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">Lavender occurs naturally in the Mediterranean region. In addition to the &#x003b3; triplication event shared by all eudicots, lavender underwent two lineage-specific rounds of WGD during the Eocene&#x02013;Oligocene (~33.7 MYA) and Miocene&#x02013;Pliocene (~5.3 MYA) transition. The penultimate WGD predicted in lavender (29.6 MYA) was dated close to the early Oligocene (33.5 MYA), when the Grande Coupure occurred in Europe with an abrupt cooling of the climate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Moreover, the Mediterranean Sea became mostly desiccated owing to evaporation at approximately 5.6 MYA during the Messinian salinity crisis, which was close to the time of the latest WGD (6.9 MYA) in <italic>Lang</italic>. Previous reports of WGDs in various plant families have revealed the cooccurrence of polyploidy events and global climate changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Our results provide evidence supporting the global environmental selection of ancestral polyploids from different lineages. Organisms that underwent and survived WGD might gain some adaptive advantages, and the sudden gene increase may have enabled lavender to better cope with the dramatically changed environment. For instance, retentions following WGDs around the K-Pg (Cretaceous&#x02013;Paleocene) boundary were commonly enriched for genes involved in the responses to low temperature and darkness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In lavender, several expanded gene families were associated with terpenoid metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, and plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions via WGDs or tandem repeats. The high retention of <italic>Bet v1</italic>, <italic>SAUR</italic>, and terpenoid-related genes following duplication may deliver evolutionary advantages that allow lavender to survive under pathogen attack or abiotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">Previous studies have demonstrated that the patterns of gene retention following WGD are not random and become biased towards genes encoding proteins that play a role in gene networks and signaling cascades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. It has been reported that WGD probably contributes to specific trait innovations, particularly novelty in specialized metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Analyses of the whole genomes of <italic>Tripterygium wilfordii</italic> and <italic>Litsea</italic> suggest that duplicated gene families involved in terpenoid biosynthesis were associated with the production of their specific compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Terpenoid metabolism could be further affected and favored by polyploidization, perhaps as an adaptive response. The present analyses of the copies and expression profiles related to the genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, such as those encoding the key rate-limiting enzymes DXS and TPS-b, suggest that the duplications of these gene families contributed to the volume and diversity of volatile terpenoid production in the GTs of lavender. Moreover, we also identified some <italic>TPS</italic> groups that occurred as local gene duplications and <italic>TPS</italic>-<italic>BAHD</italic>/<italic>TPS</italic>-<italic>CYP450</italic> gene clusters, which were prepared for abundant materials for gene functional differentiation and gene regulation divergence and have been described as important drivers of terpenoid diversity in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. As most terpenoid production is controlled primarily at the level of transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, the gene-to-terpenoid networks uncovered in our study through the integration of genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data provide abundant promising candidates for terpenoid biosynthesis. Moreover, the genes that correlated with volatiles serving as major attractants and repellents were found to be distinctly separated, thus paving the way for future research regarding the interaction between insects and plant volatiles.</p><p id="Par28">This study presents compelling evidence revealing widespread ancient polyploidy in Lamiaceae. <italic>Lavandula</italic> is an ecologically, economically, and culturally important genus, representing an excellent system for evolution-based studies of terpenoid metabolism. We produced a chromosome-level lavender reference genome using the latest sequencing technologies and bioinformatic methods, investigated the duplicates resulting from the two last WGDs and tandem repeats, and identified the candidate genes closely correlated to the primary attractive and defensive compounds. The expansion of gene families related to terpenoid metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, and plant&#x02013;pathogen interactions seemed to account for the increased diversity of volatile terpenoids and enhanced resistance to pathogen attack or abiotic stress. In summary, our data provides a stronger understanding of the evolution and diversification of Lamiaceae. Genetic evidence from the lavender genome sheds new light on the contribution of gene duplication to lavender adaptation. Moreover, the identification of candidate genes involved in the production of volatiles will dramatically improve the efficiency of genome editing to improve economic traits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Genome and transcriptome sequencing</title><p id="Par29">The fresh leaves from which DNA was extracted for the genome sequencing of <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> &#x02018;Jingxun 2&#x02019; were obtained from a single plant maintained at the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Science.
