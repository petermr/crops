The high commercial demand of (+)-nootkatone is predominately met by chemical synthesis, which entails the use of environmentally harmful reagents. Efficient synthesis of (+)-nootkatone via biotechnological approaches is thus urgently needed to satisfy its industrial demand. However, there are only a limited number of studies that report the de novo synthesis of (+)-nootkatone from simple carbon sources in microbial cell factories, and with relatively low yield. RESULTS:As the direct precursor of (+)-nootkatone biosynthesis, (+)-valencene was first produced in large quantities in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by overexpressing (+)-valencene synthase CnVS of Callitropsis nootkatensis in combination with various mevalonate pathway (MVA) engineering strategies, including the expression of CnVS and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (ERG20) as a fused protein, overexpression of a truncated form of the rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (tHMG1), and downregulating the squalene synthase enzyme (ERG9). These approaches altogether brought the production of (+)-valencene to 217.95\u00a0mg/L. Secondly, we addressed the (+)-valencene oxidation by overexpressing the Hyoscyamus muticus premnaspirodiene oxygenase (HPO) variant (V482I/A484I) and cytochrome P450 reductase (ATR1) from Arabidopsis thaliana. However, (+)-valencene was predominantly oxidized to \u03b2-nootkatol and only minor amounts of (+)-nootkatone (9.66\u00a0mg/L) were produced. We further tackled the oxidation of \u03b2-nootkatol to (+)-nootkatone by screening various dehydrogenases. Our results showed that the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily dehydrogenases ZSD1 of Zingiber zerumbet and ABA2 of Citrus sinensis were capable of effectively catalyzing \u03b2-nootkatol oxidation to (+)-nootkatone. The yield of (+)-nootkatone increased to 59.78\u00a0mg/L and 53.48\u00a0mg/L by additional overexpression of ZSD1 and ABA2, respectively. CONCLUSION:We successfully constructed the (+)-nootaktone biosynthesis pathway in S. cerevisiae by overexpressing the (+)-valencene synthase CnVS, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase HPO, and SDR family dehydrogenases combined with the MVA pathway engineering, providing a solid basis for the whole-cell production of (+)-nootkatone.
