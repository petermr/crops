(Eucalyptus, Corymbia and Angophora; ~800 species). Corymbia is grown for timber, pulp and paper, and essential oils in Australia, South Africa, Asia, and Brazil, maintaining a high-growth rate under marginal conditions due to drought, poor-quality soil, and biotic stresses.

The monophagous beetle Agasicles hygrophila uses a volatile (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonanetriene (DMNT) to recognize its host plant Alternanthera philoxeroides. Alternanthera philoxeroides releases DMNT in response to A. hygrophila attack and nerolidol synthase (NES) is a key enzyme in DMNT biosynthesis; however, the effect of A. hygrophila on NES expression remains unclear. In this study, the A. philoxeroides transcriptome was sequenced and six putative NES genes belonging to the terpene synthase-g family were characterized. The expression of these NES genes was assayed at different times following A. hygrophila contact, feeding or mechanical wounding.

The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of <i>CpMYC2</i> and <i>CpbHLH13</i> increased from the flower budding to full bloom stage, indicating that these two genes may play an essential role in blooming and aroma production in wintersweet. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis revealed that the overexpression of <i>CpMYC2</i> in arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtMYC2-2</i> mutant (Salk_083483) and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabaccum</i>) genotype Petit Havana SR1 significantly increased floral volatile monoterpene, especially linalool, while the overexpression of <i>CpbHLH13</i> in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0) and tobacco genotype SR1 increased floral sesquiterpene \u03b2-caryophyllene production in both types of transgenic plants respectively. High expression of terpene synthase (TPS) genes in transgenic <i>A. thaliana</i> along with high expression of <i>CpMYC2</i> and <i>CpbHLH13</i> in transgenic plants was also observed. The application of a combination of methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) showed an increment in linalool production in <i>CpMYC2</i>-overexpressing arabidopsis plants, and the high transcript level of TPS genes also suggested the involvement of <i>CpMYC2</i> in the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway. These results indicate that both the <i>CpMYC2 and CpbHLH13</i> transcription factors of wintersweet are possibly involved in the positive regulation and biosynthesis of monoterpene (linalool) and sesquiterpene (\u03b2-caryophyllene) in transgenic plants.

Hence, we analyzed variation of TAs and TPSs to infer genes involved in plant defense and plant responses before stress. We analyzed protein modeling and molecular docking to predict interactions between H6H and ligand; we translated the sequences (Teo19488, Tic8550 and Tic8549) obtained from the two genomes of <i>D. stramonium</i> by using Swiss-Model and Ramachandran plot and MolProbity structure validation of Teo19488 protein model.<h4>Results</h4>For TAs, we detected an expansion event in the tropinone reductase II (TRII) and the ratio synonymous/non-synonymous substitutions indicate positive selection.

The genomes of A. ramifera and other orchids were compared to explore the genetic basis underlying orchid species richness. Genome-based population dynamics revealed a continuous decrease in population size over the last 100 000 years in all studied orchids, although the epiphytic orchids generally showed larger effective population size than the terrestrial orchids over most of that period. We also found more genes of the terpene synthase gene family, resistant gene family, and LOX1/LOX5 homologs in the epiphytic orchids.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides new insights into the adaptive evolution of orchids. The A. ramifera genome sequence reported here should be a helpful resource for future research on orchid biology.", "Keywords": ["Orchidaceae", "Comparative genomics", "Adaptive evolution", "Apostasia Ramifera"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8278605?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "BMC genomics", "authorinfo": ["Zhang W", "Zhang G", "Zeng P", "Zhang Y", "Hu H", "Liu Z", "Cai J"], "title": "Genome sequence of Apostasia ramifera provides insights into the adaptive evolution in orchids."}, "PMC8540104": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": false, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "PMC8540104", "source": "PMC", "pmcid": "PMC8540104", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC8540104"}, "title": "Advanced Chemophenetic Analysis of Essential Oil from Leaves of Piper gaudichaudianum Kunth (Piperaceae) Using a New Reduction-Oxidation Index to Explore Seasonal and Circadian Rhythms", "authorString": "Ramos Y, da Costa-Oliveira C, Candido-Fonseca I, de Queiroz G, Guimar\u00e3es E, Defaveri A, Sadgrove N, Moreira D.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Ramos Y", "firstName": "Ygor Jess\u00e9", "lastName": "Ramos", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "4 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz, Farmanguinhos, Manguinhos, Rio de Janeiro 21041-250, Brazil;   (C.d.C.-O.);   (I.C.-F.)"}}}, {"fullName": "da Costa-Oliveira C", "firstName": "Claudete", "lastName": "da Costa-Oliveira", "initials": "C", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "4 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz, Farmanguinhos, Manguinhos, Rio de Janeiro 21041-250, Brazil;   (C.d.C.-O.);   (I.C.-F.)"}}}, {"fullName": "Candido-Fonseca I", "firstName": "Irene", "lastName": "Candido-Fonseca", "initials": "I", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "4 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz, Farmanguinhos, Manguinhos, Rio de Janeiro 21041-250, Brazil;   (C.d.C.-O.);   (I.C.-F.)"}}}, {"fullName": "de Queiroz G", "firstName": "George Azevedo", "lastName": "de Queiroz", "initials": "G", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "3 Centro de Responsabilidade Socioambiental do Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Bot\u00e2nico do Rio de Janeiro, Jardim Bot\u00e2nico, Rio de Janeiro 22460-030, Brazil;   (G.A.d.Q.);   (A.C.A.e.D.)"}}}, {"fullName": "Guimar\u00e3es E", "firstName": "Elsie Franklin", "lastName": "Guimar\u00e3es", "initials": "E", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "2 Diretoria de Pesquisa do Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Bot\u00e2nico do Rio de Janeiro, Jardim Bot\u00e2nico, Rio de Janeiro 22460-030, Brazil;"}}}, {"fullName": "Defaveri A", "firstName": "Anna C.

However, there is a lack of systematic identification and study of TPS in <i>Mentha</i> plants. In this work, we genome-widely identified and analyzed the <i>TPS</i> gene family in <i>Mentha longifolia</i>, a model plant for functional genomic research in the genus <i>Mentha</i>. A total of 63 <i>TPS</i> genes were identified in the <i>M. longifolia</i> genome sequence assembly, which could be divided into six subfamilies. The <i>TPS-b</i> subfamily had the largest number of genes, which might be related to the abundant monoterpenoids in <i>Mentha</i> plants. The <i>TPS-e</i> subfamily had 18 members and showed a significant species-specific expansion compared with other sequenced Lamiaceae plant species. The 63 <i>TPS</i> genes could be mapped to nine scaffolds of the <i>M. longifolia</i> genome sequence assembly and the distribution of these genes is uneven. Tandem duplicates and fragment duplicates contributed greatly to the increase in the number of <i>TPS</i> genes in <i>M. longifolia</i>. The conserved motifs (RR(X)8W, NSE/DTE, RXR, and DDXXD) were analyzed in <i>M. longifolia</i> TPSs, and significant differentiation was found between different subfamilies. Adaptive evolution analysis showed that <i>M. longifolia TPSs</i> were subjected to purifying selection after the species-specific expansion, and some amino acid residues under positive selection were identified.

However, there is a lack of systematic identification and study of TPS in <i>Mentha</i> plants. In this work, we genome-widely identified and analyzed the <i>TPS</i> gene family in <i>Mentha longifolia</i>, a model plant for functional genomic research in the genus <i>Mentha</i>. A total of 63 <i>TPS</i> genes were identified in the <i>M. longifolia</i> genome sequence assembly, which could be divided into six subfamilies. The <i>TPS-b</i> subfamily had the largest number of genes, which might be related to the abundant monoterpenoids in <i>Mentha</i> plants. The <i>TPS-e</i> subfamily had 18 members and showed a significant species-specific expansion compared with other sequenced Lamiaceae plant species. The 63 <i>TPS</i> genes could be mapped to nine scaffolds of the <i>M. longifolia</i> genome sequence assembly and the distribution of these genes is uneven. Tandem duplicates and fragment duplicates contributed greatly to the increase in the number of <i>TPS</i> genes in <i>M. longifolia</i>. The conserved motifs (RR(X)8W, NSE/DTE, RXR, and DDXXD) were analyzed in <i>M. longifolia</i> TPSs, and significant differentiation was found between different subfamilies. Adaptive evolution analysis showed that <i>M. longifolia TPSs</i> were subjected to purifying selection after the species-specific expansion, and some amino acid residues under positive selection were identified. Furthermore, we also cloned and analyzed the catalytic activity of a single terpene synthase, <i>MlongTPS29</i>, which belongs to the <i>TPS-b</i> subfamily. <i>MlongTPS29</i> could encode a limonene synthase and catalyze the biosynthesis of limonene, an important precursor of essential oils from the genus <i>Mentha</i>.

These dynamic changes are dependent on environmental parameters such as temperature and relative humidity, as well as endogenous factors such as berry morphology and genotype, but the contribution of each variable is not well understood. Here, we compared berries subjected to natural or accelerated dehydration, the latter driven by forced air flow.

Fresh leaves of <i>Cinnamomum</i> trees, e.g., <i>C. burmannii</i> and <i>C. camphor</i>, are the main sources from which D-borneol is extracted by steam distillation, yet with low yields. Insufficient supply of D-borneol has hampered its clinical use and production of patent remedies for a long time. Biological synthesis of D-borneol offers an additional approach; however, mechanisms of D-borneol biosynthesis remain mostly unresolved. Hence, it is important and necessary to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of D-borneol.<h4>Results</h4>Comparative analysis on the gene expression patterns of different D-borneol production <i>C. burmannii</i> samples facilitates elucidation on the underlying biosynthetic pathway of D-borneol. Herein, we collected three different chemotypes of <i>C. burmannii</i>, which harbor different contents of D-borneol.A total of 100,218 unigenes with an N50 of 1,128 bp were assembled de novo using Trinity from a total of 21.21 Gb clean bases. We used BLASTx analysis against several public databases to annotate 45,485 unigenes (45.38%) to at least one database, among which 82 unigenes were assigned to terpenoid biosynthesis pathways by KEGG annotation. In addition, we defined 8,860 unigenes as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), among which 13 DEGs were associated with terpenoid biosynthesis pathways.

Finally, quantitative real-time PCR was conducted to detect the actual expression level of those candidate genes related to the D-borneol biosynthesis pathway, and the result showed that the expression patterns of the candidate genes related to D-borneol biosynthesis were basically consistent with those revealed by transcriptome analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We used transcriptome sequencing to analyze three different chemotypes of <i>C. burmannii</i>, identifying three candidate structural genes (one DXS, two monoterpene synthases) and seven potential transcription factor candidates (one WRKY, two BHLH, one AP2/ERF and three MYB) involved in D-borneol biosynthesis.

Finally, we elucidated the genetic basis underlying the biosynthesis of terpenoids and aristolochic acids in A. fimbriata.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8445822?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Nature plants", "authorinfo": ["Qin L", "Hu Y", "Wang J", "Wang X", "Zhao R", "Shan H", "Li K", "Xu P", "Wu H", "Yan X", "Liu L", "Yi X", "Wanke S", "Bowers JE", "Leebens-Mack JH", "dePamphilis CW", "Soltis PS", "Soltis DE", "Kong H", "Jiao Y"], "title": "Insights into angiosperm evolution, floral development and chemical biosynthesis from the Aristolochia fimbriata genome."}, "PMC7154873": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "32213996", "source": "MED", "pmid": "32213996", "pmcid": "PMC7154873", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC7154873"}, "doi": "10.3390/plants9030405", "title": "<i>De novo</i> Sequencing and Analysis of <i>Salvia hispanica</i> Tissue-Specific Transcriptome and Identification of Genes Involved in Terpenoid Biosynthesis.", "authorString": "Wimberley J, Cahill J, Atamian HS.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Wimberley J", "firstName": "James", "lastName": "Wimberley", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Computational and Data Sciences Program, Chapman University, Orange, CA 92866, USA."}, {"affiliation": "Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, CA 92866, USA."}]}}, {"fullName": "Cahill J", "firstName": "Joseph", "lastName": "Cahill", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Ventura Botanical Gardens, Ventura, CA 93001, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Atamian HS", "firstName": "Hagop S", "lastName": "Atamian", "initials": "HS", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Schmid College of Science and Technology, Chapman University, Orange, CA 92866, USA."}, {"affiliation": "Biological Sciences Program, Chapman University, Orange, CA 92866, USA."}]}}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "3", "volume": "9", "journalIssueId": "2918743", "dateOfPublication": "2020 Mar", "monthOfPublication": "3", "yearOfPublication": "2020", "printPublicationDate": "2020-03-01", "journal": {"title": "Plants (Basel, Switzerland)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Plants (Basel)", "medlineAbbreviation": "Plants (Basel)", "NLMid": "101596181", "ISSN": "2223-7747", "ESSN": "2223-7747"}}, "pubYear": "2020", "abstractText": "<i>Salvia hispanica</i> (commonly known as chia) is gaining popularity worldwide as a healthy food supplement due to its low saturated fatty acid and high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, in addition to being rich in protein, fiber, and antioxidants.

The structural diversity of terpenes found in nature is mainly determined by terpene synthases (TPS). TPS enzymes accept ubiquitous prenyl diphosphates as substrates and convert them into the various terpene skeletons by catalyzing a carbocation-driven reaction. Based on their sequence similarity, terpene synthases from land plants can be divided into different subfamilies, TPS-a to TPS-h. In this study, we aimed to understand the evolution and functional diversification of the TPS-a subfamily in the Poaceae (the grass family), a plant family that contains important crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum. Sequence comparisons showed that aside from one clade shared with other monocot plants, the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily consists of five well-defined clades I-V, the common ancestor of which probably originated very early in the evolution of the grasses. A survey of the TPS literature and the characterization of representative TPS enzymes from clades I-III revealed clade-specific substrate and product specificities. The enzymes in both clade I and II function as sesquiterpene synthases with clade I enzymes catalyzing initial C10-C1 or C11-C1 ring closures and clade II enzymes catalyzing C6-C1 closures. The enzymes of clade III mainly act as monoterpene synthases, forming cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes. The reconstruction and characterization of clade ancestors demonstrated that the differences among clades I-III were already present in their ancestors.

The structural diversity of terpenes found in nature is mainly determined by terpene synthases (TPS). TPS enzymes accept ubiquitous prenyl diphosphates as substrates and convert them into the various terpene skeletons by catalyzing a carbocation-driven reaction. Based on their sequence similarity, terpene synthases from land plants can be divided into different subfamilies, TPS-a to TPS-h. In this study, we aimed to understand the evolution and functional diversification of the TPS-a subfamily in the Poaceae (the grass family), a plant family that contains important crops such as maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum. Sequence comparisons showed that aside from one clade shared with other monocot plants, the Poaceae TPS-a subfamily consists of five well-defined clades I-V, the common ancestor of which probably originated very early in the evolution of the grasses. A survey of the TPS literature and the characterization of representative TPS enzymes from clades I-III revealed clade-specific substrate and product specificities. The enzymes in both clade I and II function as sesquiterpene synthases with clade I enzymes catalyzing initial C10-C1 or C11-C1 ring closures and clade II enzymes catalyzing C6-C1 closures. The enzymes of clade III mainly act as monoterpene synthases, forming cyclic and acyclic monoterpenes. The reconstruction and characterization of clade ancestors demonstrated that the differences among clades I-III were already present in their ancestors. However, the ancestors generally catalyzed simpler reactions with less double-bond isomerization and fewer cyclization steps. Overall, our data indicate an early origin of key enzymatic features of TPS-a enzymes in the Poaceae, and the development of more complex reactions over the course of evolution.", "Keywords": ["Evolution", "Maize", "Grasses", "Terpene synthase", "Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7417412?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Plant molecular biology", "authorinfo": ["Luck K", "Chen X", "Norris AM", "Chen F", "Gershenzon J", "K\u00f6llner TG"], "title": "The reconstruction and biochemical characterization of ancestral genes furnish insights into the evolution of terpene synthase function in the Poaceae."}, "PMC6720654": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31501661", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31501661", "pmcid": "PMC6720654", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6720654"}, "doi": "10.3762/bjoc.15.190", "title": "Analysis of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in grape berry exocarp (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.) using in vivo-labeling and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\u00d7GC-MS).", "authorString": "K\u00f6nen PP, W\u00fcst M.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "K\u00f6nen PP", "firstName": "Philipp P", "lastName": "K\u00f6nen", "initials": "PP", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-4847-7807"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Nutritional and Food Sciences, Chair of Food Chemistry, University of Bonn, Endenicher Allee 19C, 53115 Bonn, Germany."}}}, {"fullName": "W\u00fcst M", "firstName": "Matthias", "lastName": "W\u00fcst", "initials": "M", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-6808-5555"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Institute of Nutritional and Food Sciences, Chair of Food Chemistry, University of Bonn, Endenicher Allee 19C, 53115 Bonn, Germany."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-6808-5555"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-4847-7807"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"volume": "15", "journalIssueId": "2774147", "dateOfPublication": "2019", "monthOfPublication": "0", "yearOfPublication": "2019", "printPublicationDate": "2019-01-01", "journal": {"title": "Beilstein journal of organic chemistry", "ISOAbbreviation": "Beilstein J Org Chem", "medlineAbbreviation": "Beilstein J Org Chem", "NLMid": "101250746", "ISSN": "1860-5397", "ESSN": "1860-5397"}}, "pubYear": "2019", "pageInfo": "1945-1961", "abstractText": "Sesquiterpenes are structurally diverse, potent flavoring substances that significantly influence the aroma profile of grapes (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.) at the time of physiological ripening.

Biochemical analysis has now identified the catalytic activities of all enzymes encoded by the 34 TPS genes: one isoprene synthase, 10 exclusively or predominantly monoterpene synthases, 17 sesquiterpene synthases and six diterpene synthases. Among the monoterpene and sesquiterpene and diterpene synthases, some use trans-prenyl diphosphates, some use cis-prenyl diphosphates and some use both. The isoprene synthase is cytosolic; six monoterpene synthases are plastidic, and four are cytosolic; the sesquiterpene synthases are almost all cytosolic, with the exception of one found in the mitochondria; and three diterpene synthases are found in the plastids, one in the cytosol and two in the mitochondria.

Downy mildew caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola is the major pathogen in viticulture worldwide and responsible for up to 60% of pesticide treatments. Alternatives to reduce fungicides are thus utterly needed to ensure sustainable vineyard-ecosystems, consumer health and public acceptance. Essential oils (EOs) are amongst the most promising natural plant protection alternatives and have shown their antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties on several agricultural crops. However, the efficiency of EOs highly depends on timing, application method and the molecular interactions between the host, the pathogen and EO. Despite proven EO efficiency, the underlying processes are still not understood and remain a black box. The objectives of the present study were: a) to evaluate whether a continuous fumigation of a particular EO can control downy mildew in order to circumvent the drawbacks of direct application, b) to decipher molecular mechanisms that could be triggered in the host and the pathogen by EO application and c) to try to differentiate whether essential oils directly repress the oomycete or act as plant resistance primers. To achieve this a custom-made climatic chamber was constructed that enabled a continuous fumigation of potted vines with different EOs during long-term experiments. The grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cv Chasselas was chosen in reason of its high susceptibility to Plasmopara viticola. Grapevine cuttings were infected with P. viticola and subsequently exposed to continuous fumigation of different EOs at different concentrations, during 2 application time spans (24 hours and 10 days). Experiments were stopped when infection symptoms were clearly observed on the leaves of the control plants. Plant physiology (photosynthesis and growth rate parameters) were recorded and leaves were sampled at different time points for subsequent RNA extraction and transcriptomics analysis. Strikingly, the Oregano vulgare EO vapour treatment during 24h post-infection proved to be sufficient to reduce downy mildew development by 95%. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 24h and 10d treatments and used for whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). Sequenced reads were then mapped onto the V. vinifera and P. viticola genomes. Less than 1% of reads could be mapped onto the P. viticola genome from treated samples, whereas up to 30% reads from the controls mapped onto the P. viticola genome, thereby confirming the visual observation of P. viticola absence in the treated plants. On average, 80% of reads could be mapped onto the V. vinifera genome for differential expression analysis, which yielded 4800 modulated genes. Transcriptomic data clearly showed that the treatment triggered the plant's innate immune system with genes involved in salicylic, jasmonic acid and ethylene synthesis and signaling, activating Pathogenesis-Related-proteins as well as phytoalexin synthesis. These results elucidate EO-host-pathogen interactions for the first time and indicate that the antifungal efficiency of EO is mainly due to the triggering of resistance pathways inside the host plants. This is of major importance for the production and research on biopesticides, plant stimulation products and for resistance-breeding strategies.", "affiliation": "Changins, HES-SO University of

consumers' health. Downy mildew caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola is the major pathogen in viticulture worldwide and responsible for up to 60% of pesticide treatments. Alternatives to reduce fungicides are thus utterly needed to ensure sustainable vineyard-ecosystems, consumer health and public acceptance. Essential oils (EOs) are amongst the most promising natural plant protection alternatives and have shown their antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties on several agricultural crops. However, the efficiency of EOs highly depends on timing, application method and the molecular interactions between the host, the pathogen and EO. Despite proven EO efficiency, the underlying processes are still not understood and remain a black box. The objectives of the present study were: a) to evaluate whether a continuous fumigation of a particular EO can control downy mildew in order to circumvent the drawbacks of direct application, b) to decipher molecular mechanisms that could be triggered in the host and the pathogen by EO application and c) to try to differentiate whether essential oils directly repress the oomycete or act as plant resistance primers. To achieve this a custom-made climatic chamber was constructed that enabled a continuous fumigation of potted vines with different EOs during long-term experiments. The grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cv Chasselas was chosen in reason of its high susceptibility to Plasmopara viticola. Grapevine cuttings were infected with P. viticola and subsequently exposed to continuous fumigation of different EOs at different concentrations, during 2 application time spans (24 hours and 10 days). Experiments were stopped when infection symptoms were clearly observed on the leaves of the control plants. Plant physiology (photosynthesis and growth rate parameters) were recorded and leaves were sampled at different time points for subsequent RNA extraction and transcriptomics analysis. Strikingly, the Oregano vulgare EO vapour treatment during 24h post-infection proved to be sufficient to reduce downy mildew development by 95%. Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 24h and 10d treatments and used for whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). Sequenced reads were then mapped onto the V. vinifera and P. viticola genomes. Less than 1% of reads could be mapped onto the P. viticola genome from treated samples, whereas up to 30% reads from the controls mapped onto the P. viticola genome, thereby confirming the visual observation of P. viticola absence in the treated plants. On average, 80% of reads could be mapped onto the V. vinifera genome for differential expression analysis, which yielded 4800 modulated genes. Transcriptomic data clearly showed that the treatment triggered the plant's innate immune system with genes involved in salicylic, jasmonic acid and ethylene synthesis and signaling, activating Pathogenesis-Related-proteins as well as phytoalexin synthesis. These results elucidate EO-host-pathogen interactions for the first time and indicate that the antifungal efficiency of EO is mainly due to the triggering of resistance pathways inside the host plants. This is of major importance for the production and research on biopesticides, plant stimulation products and for resistance-breeding strategies.", "pdflinks":

We report the diversity of terpene profiles across samples bound for the Washington dispensary market. The remarkable degree of variation in terpene profiles ultimately results from action of a family of terpene synthase genes, only some of which have been described. Using a recently available genome assembly we describe 55 terpene synthases with genomic context, and tissue specific expression.

However, limited genetic data is available in this non-model plant, and little known about the molecular mechanism responsible for floral scent in this orchid. Transcriptome and expression profiling data are needed to identify genes and better understand the biological mechanisms of floral scents in this species. Present transcriptomic data provides basic information on the genes and enzymes related to and pathways involved in flower secondary metabolism in this plant.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, RNA sequencing analyses were performed to identify changes in gene expression and biological pathways related scent metabolism. Three cDNA libraries were obtained from three developmental floral stages: closed bud, half flowering stage and full flowering stage. Using Illumina technique 159,616,374 clean reads were obtained and were assembled into 85,868 final unigenes (average length 1194\u2009nt), 33.85% of which were annotated in the NCBI non redundant protein database. Among this unigenes 36,082 were assigned to gene ontology and 23,164 were combined with COG groups. Total 33,417 unigenes were assigned in 127 pathways according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database. According these transcriptomic data we identified number of candidates genes which differentially expressed in different developmental stages of flower related to fragrance biosynthesis. In q-RT-PCR most of the fragrance related genes highly expressed in half flowering stage.<h4>Conclusions</h4>RNA-seq and DEG data provided comprehensive gene expression information at the transcriptional level that could be facilitate the molecular mechanisms of floral biosynthesis pathways in three developmental phase's flowers in Cymbidium goeringii, moreover providing useful

Three cDNA libraries were obtained from three developmental floral stages: closed bud, half flowering stage and full flowering stage. Using Illumina technique 159,616,374 clean reads were obtained and were assembled into 85,868 final unigenes (average length 1194\u2009nt), 33.85% of which were annotated in the NCBI non redundant protein database. Among this unigenes 36,082 were assigned to gene ontology and 23,164 were combined with COG groups. Total 33,417 unigenes were assigned in 127 pathways according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database. According these transcriptomic data we identified number of candidates genes which differentially expressed in different developmental stages of flower related to fragrance biosynthesis. In q-RT-PCR most of the fragrance related genes highly expressed in half flowering stage.<h4>Conclusions</h4>RNA-seq and DEG data provided comprehensive gene expression information at the transcriptional level that could be facilitate the molecular mechanisms of floral biosynthesis pathways in three developmental phase's flowers in Cymbidium goeringii, moreover providing useful information for further analysis on C. goeringii, and other plants of genus Cymbidium.", "Keywords": ["Sesquiterpenes", "Transcriptome", "Cymbidium goeringii", "Rna-seq", "Floral Scent"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6679452?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "BMC plant biology", "authorinfo": ["Ramya M", "Park PH", "Chuang YC", "Kwon OK", "An HR", "Park PM", "Baek YS", "Kang BC", "Tsai WC", "Chen HH"], "title": "RNA sequencing analysis of Cymbidium goeringii identifies floral scent biosynthesis related genes."}, "PMC6986057": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "31992236", "source": "MED", "pmid": "31992236", "pmcid": "PMC6986057", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6986057"}, "doi": "10.1186/s12870-020-2251-7", "title": "A sense of place: transcriptomics identifies environmental signatures in Cabernet Sauvignon berry skins in the late stages of ripening.", "authorString": "Cramer GR, Cochetel N, Ghan R, Destrac-Irvine A, Delrot S.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Cramer GR", "firstName": "Grant R", "lastName": "Cramer", "initials": "GR", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2374-4091"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, 89557, USA. cramer@unr.edu."}}}, {"fullName": "Cochetel N", "firstName": "No\u00e9", "lastName": "Cochetel", "initials": "N", "authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-3395-9536"}, "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, 89557, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Ghan R", "firstName": "Ryan", "lastName": "Ghan", "initials": "R", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, 89557, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Destrac-Irvine A", "firstName": "Agn\u00e8s", "lastName": "Destrac-Irvine", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "UMR Ecophysiology and Grape Functional Genomics, Institut des Sciences de la Vigne et du Vin, University of Bordeaux, Villenave d'Ornon, France."}}}, {"fullName": "Delrot S", "firstName": "Serge", "lastName": "Delrot", "initials": "S", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "UMR Ecophysiology and Grape Functional Genomics, Institut des Sciences de la Vigne et du Vin, University of Bordeaux, Villenave d'Ornon, France."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": [{"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0002-2374-4091"}, {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0003-3395-9536"}]}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "20", "journalIssueId": "2897062", "dateOfPublication": "2020 Jan", "monthOfPublication": "1", "yearOfPublication": "2020", "printPublicationDate": "2020-01-01", "journal": {"title": "BMC plant biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "BMC Plant Biol", "medlineAbbreviation": "BMC Plant Biol", "NLMid": "100967807", "ISSN": "1471-2229", "ESSN": "1471-2229"}}, "pubYear": "2020", "pageInfo": "41", "abstractText": "BACKGROUND:Grape berry ripening is influenced by climate, the main component of the \"terroir\" of a place.

However, little is known about the role of terpenoids in response to various adverse environmental stresses as other plants do in the form of signals during plant-environment interactions.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, trace amounts of volatiles consisting of \u03b1-santalene, epi-\u03b2-santalene, \u03b2-santalene, \u03b1-santalol, \u03b2-santalol, (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene, (E)-\u03b2-farnesene and \u03b2-bisabolene were found in the leaves of mature S. album trees. We identified more than 40 candidate terpene synthase (TPS) unigenes by mining publicly-available RNA-seq data and characterized the enzymes encoded by three cDNAs: one mono-TPS catalyzes the formation of mostly \u03b1-terpineol, and two multifunctional sesqui-TPSs, one of which produces (E)-\u03b1-bergamotene and sesquisabinene as major products and another which catalyzes the formation of (E)-\u03b2-farnesene, (E)-nerolidol and (E,E)-farnesol as main products. Metabolite signatures and gene expression studies confirmed that santalol content is closely related with santalene synthase (SaSSY) transcripts in heartwood, which is key enzyme responsible for santalol biosynthesis. However, the expression of three new SaTPS genes differed significantly from SaSSY in the essential oil-producing heartwood. Increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, were detected in different tissues of S. album plants after applying 1 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and 1 mM salicylic acid (SA), or exposure to 4\u00b0C, 38\u00b0C and high light intensity. MeJA and SA dramatically induced the expression of SaTPS1 and SaTPS2 in leaves. SaTPS1 to 3 transcripts were differentially activated among different tissues under adverse temperature and light stresses. In contrast, almost all SaSSY transcripts decreased in response to these environmental stresses, unlike SaTPS1 to 3.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Multifunctional enzymes were biochemically characterized, including one chloroplastic mono-TPS and two cytosolic sesqui-TPSs in sandalwood.

The aroma, flavor and pharmaceutical value of Ocimum species is a significance of its essential oil, which contains most of the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. A large number of plants have been studied for characterization and identification of terpene synthase genes, involved in terpenoids biosynthesis. The goal of this study is to discover and identify the putative functional terpene synthase genes in O. sanctum. HMMER search was performed by using a set of 13 well sequenced and annotated plant genomes including the newly sequenced genome of O. sanctum with Pfam-A database locally, using HMMER 3.0 hmmsearch for the two Pfam domains (PF01397 and PF03936).

The aroma, flavor and pharmaceutical value of Ocimum species is a significance of its essential oil, which contains most of the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. A large number of plants have been studied for characterization and identification of terpene synthase genes, involved in terpenoids biosynthesis. The goal of this study is to discover and identify the putative functional terpene synthase genes in O. sanctum. HMMER search was performed by using a set of 13 well sequenced and annotated plant genomes including the newly sequenced genome of O. sanctum with Pfam-A database locally, using HMMER 3.0 hmmsearch for the two Pfam domains (PF01397 and PF03936).

In this study, we assemble a 3.26-Gb high-quality chromosome-scale genome for the 'Longjing 43' cultivar of Camellia sinensis var. sinensis. Genomic resequencing of 139 tea accessions from around the world is used to investigate the evolution and phylogenetic relationships of tea accessions.

The data obtained were subjected to uni- and multivariate statistical analysis.

Although many plants produce huge amounts of isoprene, it is very difficult to obtain isoprene directly from plants because of its high volatility and increasing environmental regulations. Over the last decade, microorganisms have emerged as a promising alternative host for efficient and sustainable bioisoprene production. Isoprene synthase (IspS) has received much attention for the conversion of isoprene from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Herein, we isolated a highly expressible novel IspS gene from Metrosideros polymorpha (MpIspS), which was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, using a plant cDNA library and characterized its molecular and biochemical properties.<h4>Results</h4>The signal sequence deleted MpIspS was cloned and expressed in E. coli as a 65-kDa monomer. The maximal activity of the purified MpIspS was observed at pH\u00a06.0 and 55\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence of 5\u00a0mM Mn<sup>2+</sup>. The K<sub>m</sub>, k<sub>cat</sub>, and k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> for DMAPP as a substrate were 8.11\u00a0mM, 21\u00a0min<sup>-\u20091</sup>, and 2.59\u00a0mM<sup>-\u20091</sup>\u00a0min<sup>-\u20091</sup>, respectively.

Although many plants produce huge amounts of isoprene, it is very difficult to obtain isoprene directly from plants because of its high volatility and increasing environmental regulations. Over the last decade, microorganisms have emerged as a promising alternative host for efficient and sustainable bioisoprene production. Isoprene synthase (IspS) has received much attention for the conversion of isoprene from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Herein, we isolated a highly expressible novel IspS gene from Metrosideros polymorpha (MpIspS), which was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, using a plant cDNA library and characterized its molecular and biochemical properties.<h4>Results</h4>The signal sequence deleted MpIspS was cloned and expressed in E. coli as a 65-kDa monomer. The maximal activity of the purified MpIspS was observed at pH\u00a06.0 and 55\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence of 5\u00a0mM Mn<sup>2+</sup>. The K<sub>m</sub>, k<sub>cat</sub>, and k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> for DMAPP as a substrate were 8.11\u00a0mM, 21\u00a0min<sup>-\u20091</sup>, and 2.59\u00a0mM<sup>-\u20091</sup>\u00a0min<sup>-\u20091</sup>, respectively. MpIspS was expressed along with the exogenous mevalonate pathway to produce isoprene in E. coli. The engineered cells produced isoprene concentrations of up to 23.3\u00a0mg/L using glycerol as the main carbon source.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MpIspS was expressed in large amounts in E. coli, which led to increased enzymatic activity and resulted in isoprene production in vivo.

Novel transcripts for biosynthesis of mono-terpenes, sesqui-terpenes, di-terpenes, lactones and furanones involved in flavor formation were identified. Large number of transcripts encoding cell wall modifying enzymes was found to be steady in their expression, while few were differentially regulated through these stages.

We analyzed the transcriptome of Alphonso mango through Illumina sequencing from seven stages of fruit development and ripening as well as flower. Total transcriptome data from these stages ranged between 65 and 143\u2009Mb. Importantly, 20,755 unique transcripts were annotated and 4,611 were assigned enzyme commission numbers, which encoded 142 biological pathways. These included ethylene and flavor related secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways, as well as those involved in metabolism of starch, sucrose, amino acids and fatty acids. Differential regulation (p-value\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) of thousands of transcripts was evident in various stages of fruit development and ripening. Novel transcripts for biosynthesis of mono-terpenes, sesqui-terpenes, di-terpenes, lactones and furanones involved in flavor formation were identified. Large number of transcripts encoding cell wall modifying enzymes was found to be steady in their expression, while few were differentially regulated through these stages. Novel 79 transcripts of inhibitors of cell wall modifying enzymes were simultaneously detected throughout Alphonso fruit development and ripening, suggesting controlled activity of these enzymes involved in fruit softening.", "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5562913?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Scientific reports", "authorinfo": ["Deshpande AB", "Anamika K", "Jha V", "Chidley

RESULTS:As the direct precursor of (+)-nootkatone biosynthesis, (+)-valencene was first produced in large quantities in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by overexpressing (+)-valencene synthase CnVS of Callitropsis nootkatensis in combination with various mevalonate pathway (MVA) engineering strategies, including the expression of CnVS and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (ERG20) as a fused protein, overexpression of a truncated form of the rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (tHMG1), and downregulating the squalene synthase enzyme (ERG9).

With the flower development and blossom in turn, the fluctuation of the volatile terpenoids displayed a regular change at each axis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of volatile terpenoids during the process of flowering is poorly understood in lavender. Here, we combine metabolite and RNA-Seq analyses of flowers of five developmental stages at first- and second-axis (FFDSFSA) and initial flower bud (FB0) to discover the active terpenoid biosynthesis as well as flowering-related genes.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 56 mono- and sesquiterpenoids were identified in the EOs of L. angustifolia 'JX-2'. FB0' EO consists of 55 compounds and the two highest compounds, \u03b2-trans-ocimene (20.57%) and (+)-R-limonene (17.00%), can get rid of 74.71 and 78.41% aphids in Y-tube olfactometer experiments, respectively. With sequential and successive blossoms, temporally regulated volatiles were linked to pollinator attraction in field and olfaction bioassays. In three characteristic compounds of FFDSFSA' EOs, linalyl acetate (72.73%) and lavandulyl acetate (72.09%) attracted more bees than linalool (45.35%). Many transcripts related to flowering time and volatile terpenoid metabolism expressed differently during the flower development. Similar metabolic and transcriptomic profiles were observed when florets from the two axes were maintained at the same maturity grade. Besides both compounds and differentially expressed genes were rich in FB0, most volatile compounds were significantly correlated with FB0-specific gene module. Most key regulators related to flowering and terpenoid metabolism were interconnected in the subnetwork of FB0-specific module, suggesting the cross-talk between the two biological processes to some degree.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Characteristic compounds and gene expression profile of FB0 exhibit ecological value in pest control. The precise control of each-axis flowering and regular emissions at transcriptional and metabolic level are important to pollinators attraction for lavender.

Here, we report the high-quality, chromosome-scale genomes of the tetraploid (Perilla frutescens) and the AA diploid progenitor (Perilla citriodora). Comparative analyses suggest post Neolithic allotetraploidization within 10,000 years, and nucleotide mutation in tetraploid is 10% more than in diploid, both of which are dominated by G:C\u2009\u2192\u2009A:T transitions.

Eugenol and chavicol are the major phenylpropenes produced by sweet basil varieties whose synthetic pathways are not fully elucidated. Eugenol is derived from coniferyl acetate by a reaction catalysed by eugenol synthase. An acyltransferase is proposed to convert coniferyl alcohol to coniferyl acetate which is the first committed step towards eugenol synthesis. Here, we perform a comparative next-generation transcriptome sequencing of different tissues of sweet basil, namely PGT, leaf, leaf stripped of PGTs (leaf-PGT), and roots, to identify differentially expressed transcripts specific to PGT. From these data, we identified a PGT-enriched BAHD acyltransferase gene ObCAAT1 and functionally characterized it. In vitro coupled reaction of ObCAAT1 with eugenol synthase in the presence of coniferyl alcohol resulted in eugenol production.

Eugenol and chavicol are the major phenylpropenes produced by sweet basil varieties whose synthetic pathways are not fully elucidated. Eugenol is derived from coniferyl acetate by a reaction catalysed by eugenol synthase. An acyltransferase is proposed to convert coniferyl alcohol to coniferyl acetate which is the first committed step towards eugenol synthesis. Here, we perform a comparative next-generation transcriptome sequencing of different tissues of sweet basil, namely PGT, leaf, leaf stripped of PGTs (leaf-PGT), and roots, to identify differentially expressed transcripts specific to PGT. From these data, we identified a PGT-enriched BAHD acyltransferase gene ObCAAT1 and functionally characterized it. In vitro coupled reaction of ObCAAT1 with eugenol synthase in the presence of coniferyl alcohol resulted in eugenol production. Analysis of ObCAAT1-RNAi transgenic lines showed decreased levels of eugenol and accumulation of coniferyl alcohol and its derivatives. Coniferyl alcohol acts as a common substrate for phenylpropene and lignin biosynthesis. No differences were found in total lignin content of PGTs and leaves of transgenic lines, indicating that phenylpropene biosynthesis is not coupled to lignification in sweet basil.", "Keywords": ["Lignin", "Eugenol", "Phenylpropene", "Coniferyl Alcohol", "Sweet Basil (Ocimum Basilicum)", "Bahd Acyltransferase"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7307857?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Journal of experimental botany", "authorinfo": ["Dhar N", "Sarangapani S", "Reddy VA", "Kumar N", "Panicker D", "Jin J", "Chua NH", "Sarojam R"], "title": "Characterization of a sweet basil acyltransferase involved in eugenol biosynthesis."}, "PMC5568196": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "28830354", "source": "MED", "pmid": "28830354", "pmcid": "PMC5568196", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC5568196"}, "doi": "10.1186/s12864-017-4043-5", "title": "Identification of QTLs controlling aroma volatiles using a 'Fortune' x 'Murcott' (Citrus reticulata) population.", "authorString": "Yu Y, Bai J, Chen C, Plotto A, Yu Q, Baldwin EA, Gmitter FG.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Yu Y", "firstName": "Yuan", "lastName": "Yu", "initials": "Y", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Citrus Research and Education Center, University of Florida, Lake Alfred, FL, 33850, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Bai J", "firstName": "Jinhe", "lastName": "Bai", "initials": "J", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Horticultural Research Laboratory, ARS, USDA, Fort Pierce, FL, 34945, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Chen C", "firstName": "Chunxian", "lastName": "Chen", "initials": "C", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Southeastern Fruit and Tree Nut Research Laboratory, ARS, USDA, Byron, GA, 31008, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Plotto A", "firstName": "Anne", "lastName": "Plotto", "initials": "A", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Horticultural Research Laboratory, ARS, USDA, Fort Pierce, FL, 34945, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Yu Q", "firstName": "Qibin", "lastName": "Yu", "initials": "Q", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Citrus Research and Education Center, University of Florida, Lake Alfred, FL, 33850, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Baldwin EA", "firstName": "Elizabeth A", "lastName": "Baldwin", "initials": "EA", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Horticultural Research Laboratory, ARS, USDA, Fort Pierce, FL, 34945, USA."}}}, {"fullName": "Gmitter FG Jr", "firstName": "Frederick G", "lastName": "Gmitter", "initials": "FG", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Citrus Research and Education Center, University of Florida, Lake Alfred, FL, 33850, USA. fgmitter@ufl.edu."}}}]}, "authorIdList": {"authorId": {"@type": "ORCID", "#text": "0000-0001-5453-2377"}}, "dataLinksTagsList": {"dataLinkstag": ["supporting_data", "altmetrics"]}, "journalInfo": {"issue": "1", "volume": "18", "journalIssueId": "2582314", "dateOfPublication": "2017 Aug", "monthOfPublication": "8", "yearOfPublication": "2017", "printPublicationDate": "2017-08-01", "journal": {"title": "BMC genomics", "ISOAbbreviation": "BMC Genomics", "medlineAbbreviation": "BMC Genomics", "NLMid": "100965258", "ISSN": "1471-2164", "ESSN": "1471-2164"}}, "pubYear": "2017", "pageInfo": "646", "abstractText": "<h4>Background</h4>Flavor is an important attribute of mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco), but flavor improvement via conventional breeding is very challenging largely due to the complexity of the flavor components and traits.

Champak floral scent is attributed to a complex mix of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These aromatic flowers are widely used in flavors and fragrances industry. Despite its commercial importance, the VOC biosynthesis pathways in these flowers are largely unknown. Here, we combine metabolite and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of fully opened champak flowers to discover the active VOC biosynthesis pathways as well as floral scent-related genes.<h4>Results</h4>Volatile collection by headspace method and analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified a total of 43 VOCs from fully opened champak flowers, of which 46.9% were terpenoids, 38.9% were volatile esters and 5.2% belonged to phenylpropanoids/benzenoids. Sequencing and de novo assembly of champak flower transcriptome yielded 47,688 non-redundant unigenes. Transcriptome assembly was validated using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based approach for randomly selected unigenes.

Champak floral scent is attributed to a complex mix of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These aromatic flowers are widely used in flavors and fragrances industry. Despite its commercial importance, the VOC biosynthesis pathways in these flowers are largely unknown. Here, we combine metabolite and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of fully opened champak flowers to discover the active VOC biosynthesis pathways as well as floral scent-related genes.<h4>Results</h4>Volatile collection by headspace method and analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified a total of 43 VOCs from fully opened champak flowers, of which 46.9% were terpenoids, 38.9% were volatile esters and 5.2% belonged to phenylpropanoids/benzenoids. Sequencing and de novo assembly of champak flower transcriptome yielded 47,688 non-redundant unigenes. Transcriptome assembly was validated using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based approach for randomly selected unigenes. The detailed profiles of VOCs led to the discovery of pathways\u00a0and genes involved in floral scent biosynthesis from RNA-seq data. Analysis of expression levels of many floral-scent biosynthesis-related unigenes in flowers and leaves showed that most of them were expressed higher in flowers than in leaf tissues. Moreover, our metabolite-guided transcriptomics, in vitro and in vivo enzyme assays and transgenic studies identified (R)-linalool synthase that is essential for the production of major VOCs of champak flowers, (R)-linalool and linalool oxides.<h4>Conclusion</h4>As our study is the first report on transcriptome analysis of Magnolia champaca, this transcriptome dataset that serves as an important public information for functional genomics will not only facilitate better understanding of ecological functions of champak floral VOCs, but also provide biotechnological targets for sustainable production of champak floral scent.", "Keywords": ["Compounds", "Transcriptome", "Terpene synthase", "metabolome", "Biosynthetic Pathways", "Volatile Esters", "(R)-linalool", "Floral Volatile Organic", "Magnolia Champaca"], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5471912?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "BMC genomics", "authorinfo": ["Dhandapani S", "Jin J", "Sridhar V", "Sarojam R", "Chua NH", "Jang IC"], "title": "Integrated metabolome and transcriptome analysis of Magnolia champaca identifies biosynthetic pathways for floral volatile organic compounds."}, "PMC6211603": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "30410642", "source": "MED", "pmid": "30410642", "pmcid": "PMC6211603", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC6211603"}, "doi": "10.1186/s40793-018-0327-x", "title": "Draft genome sequence of <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> subsp. <i>plantarum</i> strain Fito_F321, an endophyte microorganism from <i>Vitis vinifera</i> with biocontrol potential.", "authorString": "Pinto C, Sousa S, Froufe H, Egas C, Cl\u00e9ment C, Fontaine F, Gomes AC.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Pinto C", "firstName": "C\u00e1tia", "lastName": "Pinto", "initials": "C", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": [{"affiliation": "Biocant -

It has subsequently been found in black and white pepper and several other spices. Because of its potent aroma, the molecular basis for rotundone formation is of particular relevance to grape and wine scientists and industry. We have identified and functionally characterized in planta a sesquiterpene synthase, VvGuaS, from developing grape berries, and have demonstrated that it produces the precursor of rotundone, \u03b1-guaiene, as its main product. The VvGuaS enzyme is a novel allele of the sesquiterpene synthase gene, VvTPS24, which has previously been reported to encode VvPNSeInt, an enzyme that produces a variety of selinene-type sesquiterpenes. This newly discovered VvTPS24 allele encodes an enzyme 99.5% identical to VvPNSeInt, with the differences comprising just 6 out of the 561 amino acid residues. Molecular modelling of the enzymes revealed that two of these residues, T414 and V530, are located in the active site of VvGuaS within 4 \u00c5 of the binding-site of the substrate, farnesyl pyrophosphate. Mutation of these two residues of VvGuaS into the corresponding polymorphisms in VvPNSeInt results in a complete functional conversion of one enzyme into the other, while mutation of each residue individually produces an intermediate change in the product profile. We have therefore demonstrated that VvGuaS, an enzyme responsible for production of the rotundone precursor, \u03b1-guaiene, is encoded by a novel allele of the previously characterized grapevine gene VvTPS24 and that two specific polymorphisms are responsible for functional differences between VvTPS24 alleles.", "affiliation": "Plant Biochemistry Laboratory, Copenhagen Plant Science Centre,

It has subsequently been found in black and white pepper and several other spices. Because of its potent aroma, the molecular basis for rotundone formation is of particular relevance to grape and wine scientists and industry. We have identified and functionally characterized in planta a sesquiterpene synthase, VvGuaS, from developing grape berries, and have demonstrated that it produces the precursor of rotundone, \u03b1-guaiene, as its main product. The VvGuaS enzyme is a novel allele of the sesquiterpene synthase gene, VvTPS24, which has previously been reported to encode VvPNSeInt, an enzyme that produces a variety of selinene-type sesquiterpenes. This newly discovered VvTPS24 allele encodes an enzyme 99.5% identical to VvPNSeInt, with the differences comprising just 6 out of the 561 amino acid residues. Molecular modelling of the enzymes revealed that two of these residues, T414 and V530, are located in the active site of VvGuaS within 4 \u00c5 of the binding-site of the substrate, farnesyl pyrophosphate. Mutation of these two residues of VvGuaS into the corresponding polymorphisms in VvPNSeInt results in a complete functional conversion of one enzyme into the other, while mutation of each residue individually produces an intermediate change in the product profile. We have therefore demonstrated that VvGuaS, an enzyme responsible for production of the rotundone precursor, \u03b1-guaiene, is encoded by a novel allele of the previously characterized grapevine gene VvTPS24 and that two specific polymorphisms are responsible for functional differences between VvTPS24 alleles.", "Keywords": ["Sesquiterpenoids", "Pinot Noir", "Shiraz", "Sesquiterpene Synthase", "Rotundone", "Wine Aroma."], "pdflinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4737073?pdf=render", "journaltitle": "Journal of experimental botany", "authorinfo": ["Drew DP", "Andersen TB", "Sweetman C", "M\u00f8ller BL", "Ford C", "Simonsen HT"], "title": "Two key polymorphisms in a newly discovered allele of the Vitis vinifera TPS24 gene are responsible for the production of the rotundone precursor \u03b1-guaiene."}, "PMC5234130": {"downloaded": true, "pdfdownloaded": true, "jsondownloaded": true, "csvmade": false, "htmlmade": false, "full": {"id": "28086783", "source": "MED", "pmid": "28086783", "pmcid": "PMC5234130", "fullTextIdList": {"fullTextId": "PMC5234130"}, "doi": "10.1186/s12864-016-3437-0", "title": "De novo transcriptome analysis of rose-scented geranium provides insights into the metabolic specificity of terpene and tartaric acid biosynthesis.", "authorString": "Narnoliya LK, Kaushal G, Singh SP, Sangwan RS.", "authorList": {"author": [{"fullName": "Narnoliya LK", "firstName": "Lokesh K", "lastName": "Narnoliya", "initials": "LK", "authorAffiliationDetailsList": {"authorAffiliation": {"affiliation": "Center of Innovative and Applied Bioprocessing (A National Institute under the Department of Biotechnology, Govt. of India), S.A.S.

Even for the same variety, terpene profile can be substantially different for grapevine growing environments. Recently a series of genes required for terpene biosynthesis were biochemically characterized in grape berries. However, the genes that dominate the differential terpene accumulation of grape berries between regions have yet to be identified.<h4>Methods</h4>Free and glycosidically-bound terpenes were identified and quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. The transcription expression profiling of the genes was obtained by RNA sequencing and part of the results were verified by quantitative real time PCR (QPCR). The gene co-expression networks were constructed with the Cytoscape software v 2.8.2 ( www.cytoscape.org).<h4>Results</h4>'Muscat Blanc a Petits Grains' berries were collected from two wine-producing regions with strikingly different climates, Gaotai (GT) in Gansu Province and Changli (CL) in Hebei Province in China, at four developmental stages for two consecutive years. GC-MS analysis demonstrated that both free and glycosidically bound terpenes accumulated primarily after veraison and that mature grape berries from CL contained significantly higher concentrations of free and glycosidically bound terpenes than berries from GT. Transcriptome analysis revealed that some key genes involved in terpene biosynthesis were markedly up-regulated in the CL region. Particularly in the MEP pathway, the expression of VviHDR (1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase) paralleled with the accumulation of terpenes, which can promote the flow of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) into the terpene synthetic pathway. The glycosidically bound monoterpenes accumulated differentially along with maturation in both regions, which is synchronous with the expression of a monoterpene glucosyltransferase gene (VviUGT85A2L4 (VviGT14)). Other genes were also found to be related to the differential accumulation of terpenes and monoterpene glycosides in the grapes between regions. Transcription factors that could regulate terpene synthesis were predicted through gene co-expression network analysis. Additionally, the genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene signal responses were expressed at high levels earlier in GT grapes than in CL grapes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Differential production of free and glycosidically-bound terpenes in grape berries across GT and CL regions should be related at least to the expression of both VviHDR and VviUGT85A2L4 (VviGT14).

VvSTO2 was expressed at a higher level in the Syrah grape exocarp (skin) in accord with the localization of (-)-rotundone accumulation in grape berries. \u03b1-Guaiene was also detected in the Syrah grape exocarp at an extremely high concentration. These findings suggest that (-)-rotundone accumulation is regulated by the VvSTO2 expression along with the availability of \u03b1-guaiene as a precursor. VvSTO2 expression during grape maturation was considerably higher in Syrah grape exocarp compared to Merlot grape exocarp, consistent with the patterns of \u03b1-guaiene and (-)-rotundone accumulation.

Despite a long history of cultivation, the genetics and molecular biology of S. oblata are poorly understood. Transcriptome and expression profiling data are needed to identify genes and to better understand the biological mechanisms of floral pigments and scents in this species. Nine cDNA libraries were obtained from three replicates of three developmental stages: inflorescence with enlarged flower buds not protruded, inflorescence with corolla lobes not displayed, and inflorescence with flowers fully opened and emitting strong fragrance. Using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique, 319,425,972 clean reads were obtained and were assembled into 104,691 final unigenes (average length of 853 bp), 41.75% of which were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Among the annotated unigenes, 36,967 were assigned to gene ontology categories and 19,956 were assigned to eukaryoticorthologous groups.

Despite a long history of cultivation, the genetics and molecular biology of S. oblata are poorly understood. Transcriptome and expression profiling data are needed to identify genes and to better understand the biological mechanisms of floral pigments and scents in this species. Nine cDNA libraries were obtained from three replicates of three developmental stages: inflorescence with enlarged flower buds not protruded, inflorescence with corolla lobes not displayed, and inflorescence with flowers fully opened and emitting strong fragrance. Using the Illumina RNA-Seq technique, 319,425,972 clean reads were obtained and were assembled into 104,691 final unigenes (average length of 853 bp), 41.75% of which were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Among the annotated unigenes, 36,967 were assigned to gene ontology categories and 19,956 were assigned to eukaryoticorthologous groups. Using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database, 12,388 unigenes were sorted into 286 pathways.
