RNA-Seq analysis identified 5528 differentially expressed genes between Bordeaux and Reno grape skins at 22&#x000b0;Brix. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis for all expressed transcripts for all four &#x000b0;Brix levels measured indicated that the majority (75%) of transcript expression differed significantly between the two locations. Top gene ontology categories for the common transcript sets were translation, photosynthesis, DNA metabolism and catabolism. Top gene ontology categories for the differentially expressed genes at 22&#x000b0;Brix involved response to stimulus, biosynthesis and response to stress. Some differentially expressed genes encoded terpene synthases, cell wall enzymes, kinases, transporters, transcription factors and photoreceptors. Most circadian clock genes had higher transcript abundance in Bordeaux. Bordeaux berries had higher transcript abundance with differentially expressed genes associated with seed dormancy, light, auxin, ethylene signaling, powdery mildew infection, phenylpropanoid, carotenoid and terpenoid metabolism, whereas Reno berries were enriched with differentially expressed genes involved in water deprivation, cold response, ABA signaling and iron homeostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Transcript abundance profiles in the berry skins at maturity were highly dynamic.

Grapevines are now grown throughout the world in many kinds of environments.</p><p id="Par91">Grape berry development is a complex process involving three developmental phases and multiple hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is in the latter ripening phase that many compounds involved in flavor and aromas are synthesized, conjugated or catabolized. Most of these compounds reside in the skin of the berry and seem to develop in the very last stages of berry development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par92">Aroma and flavor are important sensory components of wine. They are derived from multiple classes of compounds in grapes including important volatile compounds from the grape and from yeast metabolism during grape fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Each grape cultivar produces a unique set of volatile and flavor compounds at varying concentration that represents its wine typicity or typical cultivar characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Esters and terpenes are volatile compound chemical classes largely responsible for the fruity and floral aromas in wines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Esters are largely produced during yeast fermentation from grape-derived products such as aliphatic alcohols and aldehydes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Grape lipoxygenases are thought to provide the six carbon precursors from fatty acids for the synthesis of the fruity aroma, hexyl acetate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], in yeast during wine fermentation. Terpenes mostly originate from the grapes and are found in both the free and bound (glycosylated) forms. Both plant fatty acid and terpenoid metabolism pathways are very sensitive to the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par93">Climate has large effects on berry development and composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Besides grape genetics other factors may influence metabolite composition including the local grape berry microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the soil type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the rootstock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While there is evidence that rootstock can affect fruit composition and transcript abundance, this effect appears to be minor relative to other environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Many cultural practices used by the grape grower may directly or indirectly affect the environment sensed by the grapevine (row orientation, planting density, pruning, leaf removal, etc.). Temperature and light are major contributors to &#x0201c;terroir&#x0201d;. Terroir refers to the environmental effects on grapes and how it contributes distinctive characteristics to the typicity of a wine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The terroir term includes biotic and abiotic factors, soil environments as well as the viticultural practices. In the present work, we will use the term &#x0201c;place&#x0201d; to address all of the above except for the viticultural practices.</p><p id="Par94">Recently, a transcriptomic approach was used to elucidate the common gene subnetworks of the late stages of berry development when grapes are normally harvested at their peak maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One of the major subnetworks associated with ripening involved autophagy, catabolism, RNA splicing, proteolysis, chromosome organization and the circadian clock. An integrated model was constructed to link light sensing with the circadian clock highlighting the importance of the light environment on berry development. In this report, in order to get a better understanding of how much of the gene expression in Cabernet Sauvignon berry skin could be attributed to environmental influences, we tested the hypothesis that there would be significant differences in gene expression during the late stages of Cabernet Sauvignon berry ripening between two widely different locations: one in Reno, NV, USA (RNO) and the other in Bordeaux, France (BOD). The analysis revealed a core set of genes that did not depend on location, climate, vineyard management, grafting and soil properties. Also, the analysis revealed key genes that are differentially expressed between the two locations. Some of these differences were linked to the effects of temperature and other environmental factors known to affect aromatic and other quality-trait-associated pathways. Many gene families were differentially expressed and may provide useful levers for the vinegrower to adjust berry composition. Among others, these families encompassed genes involved in amino acid and phenylpropanoid metabolism, as well as aroma and flavor synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Background data for a &#x0201c;Sense of Place&#x0201d;</title><p id="Par95">To test the hypothesis that the transcript abundance of grape berries during the late stages of ripening differed in two locations with widely different environmental conditions, we compared the transcript abundance of grape berry skins in BOD and RNO. The vineyards were originally planted in RNO in 2004 and in BOD in 2009. The RNO vines were grown on their own roots, whereas the BOD vines were grafted on to SO4 rootstock. A vertical shoot positioning trellis design was used in both locations. There were a number environmental variables that differed between the two locations. BOD is located at a slightly more northern latitude than RNO. This resulted in slightly longer day lengths in BOD at the beginning of harvest and slightly shorter at the end of harvest (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). On the final harvest dates, the day length differed between RNO and BOD by about 30&#x02009;min.

Individual berry skins were separated immediately from the whole berry and the individual total soluble solids (&#x000b0;Brix) level of the berry, which is mostly composed of sugars, was determined. The Cabernet Sauvignon berry skins from BOD were harvested in a similar manner as the RNO berry skins. The berry skins in BOD were harvested from midway in September, 2013 until the first week of October (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The berry skins were separated and the &#x000b0;Brix analyzed in the same manner as that in RNO. Grapes were harvested at a lower &#x000b0;Brix range in BOD (19.5 to 22.5&#x000b0;Brix) than in RNO (20 to 26&#x000b0;Brix) because fruit maturity for making wine is typically reached in the BOD region at a lower sugar level.</p><p id="Par99">Transcript abundance of the RNA-Seq reads from both RNO and BOD was estimated using Salmon software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] with the assembly and gene model annotation of Cabernet Sauvignon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Principal component analysis of the transcriptomic data showed clear grouping of experimental replicates with the largest separation by location (principal component 1 (PC1)&#x02009;=&#x02009;51% variance) and then &#x000b0;Brix (principal component 2 (PC2)&#x02009;=&#x02009;22% variance) of the berry skin samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

One focused on expression at one similar sugar level in both locations. Another identified a common set of genes whose transcript abundance changed in both locations. And the third one was a more comprehensive network analysis using all of the sugar levels and the two locations.</p><p id="Par101">We chose two very similar sugar levels to determine the differential gene expression between the two locations, since sugar levels were not exactly the same at harvest. We identified 5528 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, at an FDR padj-value &#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) between the two locations in approach 1 at the sugar level closest to the 22&#x000b0;Brix level (21.5&#x000b0;Brix in BOD and 22&#x000b0;Brix in RNO) using DESeq2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). DEGs will refer to this set of differentially expressed genes throughout this manuscript. Gene set enrichment analysis using topGO determined the top gene ontology (GO) categories for biological processes for these 5528 genes (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Based on the number of genes identified, the top GO categories were cellular metabolic process (3126 genes, padj-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.3E-03), biosynthetic process (2371 genes, padj-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.7E-09), and response to stimulus (2324 genes, padj-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.21E-26). Other important and highly significant categories were response to stress (1514 genes, padj-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.69E-24) and developmental process (1280 genes, corrected <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;8.09E-12). There were 910 GO categories in total that were significantly enriched (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The relationship between the top 25 GO categories can be seen in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>. We use the term &#x0201c;significantly&#x0201d; throughout this text to mean statistically significant at or below a padj-value of 0.05. Amongst the top stimulus subcategories with the largest number of genes were response to abiotic stimulus (950 genes; padj-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.1E-29), response to endogenous stimulus (835 genes, padj-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.43E-21; 256 of which were related to response to abscisic acid), response to external stimulus (719 genes, padj-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.08E-24), and biotic stimulus (520 genes, padj-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.29E-22). Some other significant environmental stimuli GO categories included response to light stimulus (234 genes), response to osmotic stress (171 genes), and response to temperature stimulus (158 genes).</p><p id="Par102">In approach 2, we examined which gene expression was changing with &#x000b0;Brix level in both locations to identify a common set of genes differentially expressed during berry development with very different environmental conditions. The significant differences in transcript abundance in each location was determined with DESeq2 using the lowest &#x000b0;Brix sampling as the control. For example, the control sample in RNO was the lowest sugar sampling at 20 &#x000b0;Brix; the transcript abundance of the three higher &#x000b0;Brix samplings were compared to the transcript abundance of the control. The genes that had significantly different transcript abundance relative to control in at least one of the comparisons were identified in RNO and BOD. These gene lists were compared and the common gene set consisting of 1985 genes for both locations was determined (ap2 tab in Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Comparing this common gene list (ap2) to the DEGs from approach 1 identified 907 genes that were common to both sets, indicating that this subset was differentially expressed between the locations at 22&#x000b0;Brix. The other 1078 genes did not differ significantly between locations. This 1078 gene subset list can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> (ap2-ap1 tab). The GO categories most enriched in this gene set included response to inorganic substance, response to abiotic stimulus and drug metabolic process.</p><p id="Par103">In approach 3, using a more powerful approach to finely distinguish the expression data for all sugar levels, Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified gene sets common to (based upon correlation) and different gene expression profiles between BOD and RNO. All expressed genes for all &#x000b0;Brix levels (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) were used in this analysis. Additional details of the analysis are described in the Materials and Methods section. Twenty-one modules or gene subnetworks were defined (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>) and a heat map was generated displaying the module-trait relationships (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). The grey module is not a real module but a place to put all genes not fitting into a real module; thus, it was not counted as one of the twenty-one gene modules above. Eight modules had similar gene expression profiles for BOD and RNO (padj-value &#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05); these included cyan, midnightblue, pink, green yellow, salmon, blue, grey60, and royalblue. This gene set consisted of 8017 genes (see ap3 tab in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> for the gene list). Comparing this common gene set from the WGCNA with the DEGs from approach 1 revealed that 524 genes in common were found in both sets. This subset was removed from the WGCNA to produce a gene list of 7492 common to both locations and not differing in their transcript abundance at 22&#x000b0;Brix (ap2-ap1). This represents 25% of the total 29,929 genes in all of the modules. This gene set was compared with the ap2-ap1 gene set from approach 1 and 845 genes were found in common in both sets. The remainder from ap2-ap1 provided an additional 232 genes to the common set of genes from ap3-ap1 not affected by location giving a total number of 7724 genes, representing 25.8% of the genes expressed. This gene set is listed in ap2-ap1_union_ap3-ap1 tab in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>. The GO categories most enriched in this gene set included general categories such as organic substance biosynthetic process and organelle organization. There were 785 enriched GO categories in total.</p><p id="Par104">In approach 3, further analysis of the gene modules using gene set enrichment analysis was performed with genes that had a kME&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.80 for each module in the WGCNA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>).

This study is limited in that only two locations in one season were investigated. As more locations are compared in the future, these gene sets will likely be reduced in size even further. The processes involved in these gene sets or modules included the increase of catabolism and the decline of translation and photosynthesis.

ABA concentrations may be higher in the BOD berry skins based upon the higher transcript abundance of important ABA signaling and biosynthesis genes encoding ABF2, SnRK2 kinases and NCED6.

The higher expression of other seed development and dormancy genes (e.g. <italic>RVE1</italic>, <italic>ARF2</italic>, <italic>ARF10</italic>, etc.) in the berry skins support the argument that BOD berries (and seeds) matured at a lower sugar level than the RNO berries.</p><p id="Par141">The ABA concentrations in the berry skins are a function of biosynthesis, catabolism, conjugation and transport.

(2015) could be for a variety of reasons such as different cultivar responses, berry versus skin samples, or different environmental conditions that affect terpenoid production.</p><p id="Par153">Terpenoid metabolism is influenced by the microclimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>] and is involved in plant defense responses to pathogens and insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Light exposure to Sauvignon Blanc grapes (a white grape cultivar) was manipulated by removing adjacent leaves without any detectable differences in berry temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Increased light exposure increased specific carotenoid and terpene concentrations in the berry. The responses of carotenoid and terpenoid production to temperature are less clear. Some effect of temperature was associated with carotenoid and terpenoid production, but to a lesser extent than light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Higher concentrations of rotundone, a sesquiterpene, have been associated with cooler temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Water deficit can also alter carotenoid and terpenoid metabolism in grapes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Terpenes can act as signals for insect attacks and attract insect predators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Thus, terpenoid metabolism is highly sensitive to the environment and influenced by many factors.</p><p id="Par154">In contrast to these studies, excess light and heat can affect transcript abundance and damage berry quality. In addition to a higher rate of malate catabolism, anthocyanin concentrations and some of the transcript abundances associated with them are decreased as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Temperature effects on berry maturity and total soluble solids</title><p id="Par155">BOD berries reached maturity at a lower &#x000b0;Brix level than RNO berries; the cause is likely to be the warmer days and cooler nights in RNO. Higher day temperature may increase photosynthesis and sugar transport and cooler night temperatures may reduce fruit respiration. &#x000b0;Brix or TSS approximates the % sugar in a berry and is a reliable marker of berry maturity in any given location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]; however, TSS is an unreliable marker of berry maturity when comparing grapes from very different climates. The differences in TSS between BOD and RNO are consistent with other studies on the temperature effects on berry development. Indirect studies have associated gradual warming over the last century to accelerated phenology and increased sugar concentrations in the grape berries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Increasing temperature can accelerate metabolism, including sugar biosynthesis and transport, but the increase in metabolism is not uniform. For example, the increase in anthocyanin concentration during the ripening phase is not affected as much as the increase in sugar concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. These responses vary with the cultivar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], complicating this kind of analysis even further.</p><p id="Par156">Direct studies of temperature effects on Cabernet Sauvignon berry composition also are consistent with our data. In one study, the composition of Cabernet Sauvignon berries was altered substantially for vines grown in phytotrons at 20 or 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C temperatures (temperatures that are very similar to the BOD and RNO temperatures occurring in the present study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Cooler temperatures promoted anthocyanin development and malate concentrations (inhibited malate catabolism) and higher temperatures promoted TSS (&#x000b0;Brix) and proline concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. In a second study, vines were grown at 20 or 30&#x02009;&#x000b0;C&#x02009;day temperatures with night temperatures 5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C cooler than the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. In this study, higher temperatures increased berry volume and veraison started earlier by about 3 to 4&#x02009;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. The authors concluded that warmer temperatures hastened berry development. In a third study, Cabernet Sauvignon berry composition was affected in a similar manner by soil temperatures that differed by 13&#x02009;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>].</p><p id="Par157">TSS concentrations are also affected by light and the vine water status. Light is generally not a factor because there is usually a large enough leaf area and sufficient light levels to saturate this source to sink relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. Sun-exposed Cabernet Sauvignon berries in the vineyard had higher TSS than shaded berries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. This sunlight effect was attributed largely to an increase in berry temperature rather than an increase in the fluence rate per se. A higher grapevine water status results in larger berry size and lower sugar concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>] and water deficit is known to increase sugar concentrations in Cabernet Sauvignon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, temperature is thought to have the largest effect on sugar concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par158">Other transcriptomic data in the present study indicated that BOD berries were more mature at a lower sugar level than RNO berries. These included the transcript abundance profiles of genes involved in autophagy, auxin and ABA signaling, iron homeostasis and seed development. Many of these DEGs had an accelerated rate of change in BOD berries. While these transcripts are in the skins, they may be influenced by signals coming from the seed. In addition, there was a higher transcript abundance for most genes involved with the circadian clock in BOD berries. PHYB can regulate the circadian clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and PHYB activity is very sensitive to night temperatures (BOD had higher night temperatures); PHYB reversion is accelerated to the inactive form at warmer temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The inactivity of phytochrome promotes the expression of RVE1, which promotes auxin concentrations and seed dormancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Thus, all things considered, it is likely that temperature and/or the temperature differentials between day and night significantly contributed to the differences in the rate of berry development and sugar accumulation in the two locations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Are there reliable markers to harvest berries at maturity?</title><p id="Par159">Determining maturity of grapes is a difficult and error prone process. Reliable markers could aid in the decision of when to harvest the grapes. &#x0201c;Optimum&#x0201d; maturity is a judgement call and will ultimately depend on the winemaker&#x02019;s or grower&#x02019;s specific goals or preferences. A combination of empirical factors can be utilized including &#x000b0;Brix, total acidity, berry tasting in the mouth for aroma and tannins, seed color, etc. &#x000b0;Brix or total soluble solids by itself may not be the best marker for berry ripening as it appears to be uncoupled from berry maturity by temperature. Phenylpropanoid metabolism, including anthocyanin metabolism, is also highly sensitive to both abiotic and biotic stresses and may not be a good indicator of full maturity. Thus, color may not be a good indicator either. Specific developmental signals from the seed or embryo, such as those involved with auxin and ABA signaling, may provide more reliable markers for berry ripening in diverse environments, but will not be useful in seedless grapes. Aromatic compounds may also be reliable markers but they will need to be generic, developmental markers that are not influenced by the environment. This study revealed many genes that are not reliable markers because they were expressed differently in different environments. One candidate marker that is noteworthy is ATG18G (g071260). Its transcript abundance increased and was relatively linear with increasing &#x000b0;Brix and these trends were offset at the two locations relative to their level of putative fruit maturity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). ATG18G is required for the autophagy process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>] and maybe important during the fruit ripening phase. It was found to be a hub gene in a gene subnetwork associated with fruit ripening and chloroplast degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Further testing will be required to know if it is essential for fruit ripening and whether its transcript abundance is influenced by abiotic and biotic stresses in grape berry skins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par160">The ultimate function of a fruit is to produce fully mature seeds in order to reproduce another generation of plants. The ripe berry exhibits multiple traits that signal to other organisms when the fruit is ready for consumption and seed dispersal. In this study, we show that there were large differences in transcript abundance in grape skins in two different locations with different environments, confirming our original hypothesis. We also identified a set of DEGs with common profiles in the two locations. The observations made in this study provide lists of such genes and generated a large number of hypotheses to be tested in the future. WGCNA was particularly powerful and enhanced our analyses. The transcript abundance during the late stages of berry ripening was very dynamic and may respond to many of the environmental and developmental factors identified in this study. Functional analysis of the genes and GO enrichment analysis were very useful tools to elucidate these factors. Some of the factors identified were temperature, moisture, light and biotic stress. The results of this study indicated that berries still have a &#x0201c;sense of place&#x0201d; during the late stages of berry ripening. Future studies are required to follow up on these observations. It appears that fruit ripening is very malleable. Manipulation of the canopy (time and intensity of leaf removal at different locations on the plant) may offer a powerful lever to adjust gene expression and berry composition, since these parameters are strongly affected by light and temperature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec35"><title>Plant materials</title><p id="Par161">Research approval was obtained by Grant R.
