Drought is probably the most important of them and determines crop distribution around the world. Grapevine is considered to be a drought-resilient species, traditionally covering semiarid areas. Moreover, in the case of grapevine, moderate water deficit is known to improve the quality traits of grape berries and subsequently wine composition. However, against the backdrop of climate change, vines are expected to experience sustained water deficits which could be detrimental to both grape quality and yield. The influence of water deficit on two Greek <i>Vitis vinifera</i> L. cultivars, 'Agiorgitiko' and 'Assyrtiko', was investigated during the 2019 and 2020 vintages. Vine physiology measurements in irrigated and non-irrigated plants were performed at three time-points throughout berry development (green berry, veraison and harvest). Berry growth and composition were examined during ripening. According to the results, water deficit resulted in reduced berry size and increased levels of soluble sugars, total phenols and anthocyanins. The expression profile of specific genes, known to control grape color, aroma and flavor was altered by water availability during maturation in a cultivar-specific manner. In agreement with the increased concentration of phenolic compounds due to water deficit, genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway in the red-skinned Agiorgitiko exhibited higher expression levels and earlier up-regulation than in the white Assyrtiko. The expression profile of the other genes during maturation or in response to water deficit was depended on the vintage.", "affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Department of Biotechnology, Agricultural University of Athens, 75 Iera Odos, 11855 Athens, Greece.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Phenols", "Anthocyanins", "Drought stress", "Grapes", "Agiorgitiko", "Assyrtiko", "Phenylpropanoid And Terpenoid Pathway"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/plants10091947"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8470430"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8470430?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "N", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2021-09-28", "firstIndexDate": "2021-09-29", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2021-09-28", "dateOfRevision": "2021-10-01", "electronicPublicationDate": "2021-09-18", "firstPublicationDate": "2021-09-18"}, "htmllinks": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC8470430", "abstract": "Plants are exposed to numerous abiotic stresses.
