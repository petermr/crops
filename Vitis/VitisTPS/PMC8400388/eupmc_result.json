In the present study, we showed that the bacterial strain Bvel1 is phylogenetically affiliated to <i>Bacillus velezensis</i> species. The strain Bvel1 and its secreted metabolites exerted an antifungal activity, under in vitro conditions, against <i>B. cinerea</i>. UHPLC-HRMS chemical analysis revealed that iturin A2, surfactin-C13 and -C15, oxydifficidin, bacillibactin, L-dihydroanticapsin, and azelaic acid were among the metabolites secreted by Bvel1. Treatment of wounded grape berries with <i>Bacillus</i> sp. Bvel1 cell culture was effective for controlling grey mold ingress and expansion in vivo. The effectiveness of this biological control agent was a function of the cell culture concentration of the antagonist applied, while preventive treatment proved to be more effective compared to curative. The strain Bvel1 exhibited an adequate colonization efficiency in wounded grapes. The whole-genome phylogeny, combined with ANI and dDDH analyses, provided compelling evidence that the strain Bvel1 should be taxonomically classified as <i>Bacillus velezensis</i>. Genome mining approaches showed that the strain Bvel1 harbors 13 antimicrobial biosynthetic gene clusters, including iturin A, fengycin, surfactin, bacilysin, difficidin, bacillaene, and bacillibactin.
