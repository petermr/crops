"Plant-derived terpenes are effective in treating chronic dysentery, rheumatism, hepatitis, and hyperlipemia. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of terpene biosynthesis in some terpene-abundant Chinese medicinal plants is of great importance. Abundant in mono- and sesqui-terpenes, <i>Rhodomyrtus tomentosa</i> (Ait.) Hassk, an evergreen shrub belonging to the family Myrtaceae, is widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, (+)-\u03b1-pinene and \u03b2-caryophyllene were detected to be the two major components in the leaves of <i>R. tomentosa</i>, in which (+)-\u03b1-pinene is higher in the young leaves than in the mature leaves, whereas the distribution of \u03b2-caryophyllene is opposite. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of leaves identified 138 unigenes potentially involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. By integrating known biosynthetic pathways for terpenoids, 7 candidate genes encoding terpene synthase (RtTPS1-7) that potentially catalyze the last step in pinene and caryophyllene biosynthesis were further characterized. Sequence alignment analysis showed that RtTPS1, RtTPS3 and RtTPS4 do not contain typical N-terminal transit peptides (62-64aa), thus probably producing multiple isomers and enantiomers by terpenoid isomerization. Further enzyme activity <i>in vitro</i> confirmed that RtTPS1-4 mainly produce (+)-\u03b1-pinene and (+)-\u03b2-pinene, as well as small amounts of (-)-\u03b1-pinene and (-)-\u03b2-pinene with GPP, while RtTPS1 and RtTPS3 are also active with FPP, producing \u03b2-caryophyllene, along with a smaller amount of \u03b1-humulene.
