However, the responses of flavor compounds to the hormones are inadequately understood. In this study, ABA and synthetic auxin &#x003b1;-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) were sprayed on Cabernet Sauvignon berries before v&#x000e9;raison, and comparative transcriptomic and metabolic analysis were conducted to investigate the influence on berry quality-related metabolites. The 1000 mg/L ABA (ABA1000) and 200 mg/L NAA (NAA200) treated grapes exhibited shorter and longer phenological intervals compared to the control, respectively. The transcriptomic comparison between pre-v&#x000e9;raison and v&#x000e9;raison revealed that the varied ripening initiation and duration significantly affected the expression of genes related to specific metabolism, particularly in the biosynthetic metabolism of anthocyanin and volatile compounds. The up-regulated <italic>VviF3&#x02019;H</italic> in both ABA1000-treated and NAA200-treated berries increased the proportion of 3&#x02032;-substituted anthocyanins, and the 3&#x02032;5&#x02032;-substituted anthocyanins were largely reduced in the NAA200-treated berries. Concurrently, <italic>VviCCD4a</italic> and <italic>VviCCD4b</italic> were up-regulated, and the norisoprenoids were correspondingly elevated in the NAA200-treated berries.

Introduction</title><p>Timing and rate of ripening are key factors in grape berries for winemaking. The composition and concentration of flavor compounds in both grapes and wine are closely associated with the ripening process and harvest maturity [<xref rid="B1-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Immature grape berries generally contain high concentrations of organic acids, volatile C6 compounds, and methoxypyrazines, which are undesirable [<xref rid="B4-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the ripening rate appears to affect the accumulation of flavor compounds. In warm regions with the rapid accumulation of soluble solids, harvested grape berries fail to develop adequate and desirable flavors, even with the optimum sugar/acidity ratios [<xref rid="B5-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the contrary, grape berries in cooler regions need longer times to achieve industrial maturity, possibly due to the lack of adequate sunlight [<xref rid="B7-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The ripening process can thus be influenced by many factors such as variety, light, water status, temperature, and hormones [<xref rid="B8-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the knowledge about the relationship between hormones and flavor compounds, especially volatile aroma compounds, is limited.</p><p>Endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) in grape berries begins to increase at around v&#x000e9;raison, followed by a decrease when full ripening approaches [<xref rid="B9-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In contrast, the concentration peak of endogenous auxin appears during the flowering period, and then dramatically declines at v&#x000e9;raison [<xref rid="B12-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Endogenous ABA and auxins act as the inducer and repressor of ripening inception, respectively. The application of ABA at pre-v&#x000e9;raison can advance the accumulation of sugar and the berry ripening process [<xref rid="B11-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], whereas spraying with auxin-like compounds (such as &#x003b1;-naphthaleneacetic acid; NAA) has the opposite effect [<xref rid="B9-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B13-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The integrated analyses of the transcriptome and metabolome indicate that the dramatic changes in the transcription rate of a large number of genes and the production of flavor metabolites do occur in the grape berries treated with ABA or auxin-like substances [<xref rid="B15-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Exogenous ABA can stimulate the biosynthesis of anthocyanins, elevating their concentration [<xref rid="B15-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], whereas NAA treatments cause the opposite effects [<xref rid="B13-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, in published research, the data comparison between hormone treatments and control groups, to our knowledge, is based on a specific date after treatment at which the berries actually possess different soluble solid contents. For example, Koyama et al. found that ABA treatment stimulates the rapid production of anthocyanins and flavonols in comparison with controls at 14, 28, and 37 days after v&#x000e9;raison [<xref rid="B15-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previous studies of exogenous ABA have concentrated on flavonoids and their biosynthetic-related genes. Few reports have shown that there is a significant difference between the volatile compounds in the wines produced from NAA-treated and control berries [<xref rid="B13-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B18-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Volatile compounds, such as terpenes, are major contributors to the floral/fruity attributes of grape berries, and their levels have been considered indicators for distinguishing muscat, non-muscat, and neutral varieties [<xref rid="B19-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Norisoprenoids are also important volatile compounds with very low sensory thresholds, which allows their flavor notes to be easily incorporated into the overall aroma of grapes [<xref rid="B20-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Knowledge of the responses of these volatile compounds to exogenous ABA or NAA can help us understand berry ripening and contribute to grape and wine quality improvement.</p><p>V&#x000e9;raison, the shift from berry growth to berry ripening, is of considerable scientific interest as it is a period of dramatic physical and chemical changes. These changes are triggered by a complex interplay between hormones and accompanied by the regulation and accumulation of flavor compounds [<xref rid="B22-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The objective of the study was to evaluate the responses of the transcriptome and flavor metabolome to ABA and NAA during the transition from berry growth to ripening. The results indicate that ABA can promote the accumulation of 3&#x02032;-substituted anthocyanins, and NAA treatment can benefit the biosynthesis and accumulation of norisoprenoids. This finding provides a strategy for volatile aroma quality improvement for wine grape production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-09-00630"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-plants-09-00630"><title>2.1. Variation in Timing and Duration of Ripening by ABA and NAA Treatments</title><p>Spraying ABA1000 on berry clusters resulted in a sharp increase in the total soluble solid (TSS) content and a synchronous decline of the titratable acidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Ripening of the ABA1000-treated berries started nine weeks after flowering, about one week ahead of the controls. In contrast, NAA200 caused a slower accumulation of TSS and a decline in titratable acidity (TA). Correspondingly, the ripening initiation (E-L 35) of NAA-treated grape berries was delayed by about three weeks, and the interval between E-L 35 and E-L 36 stages was prolonged three weeks. Surprisingly, the ABA500-treated berries exhibited similar developmental progression with the control berries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The application of NAA led to a slightly lower TA at the E-L 36 stage in comparison with control berries.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-plants-09-00630"><title>2.2. Transcriptomic Analysis of Gene Expression Profiling</title><p>A total of 27,267 genes were annotated from the RNA-seq reads across all the samples. Four biological replicates were performed for the Control33, and three biological replicates were conducted for each of the other four groups for E-L 35 stage. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out using reads per kilobases per million reads (RPKM) of all detected genes to the genome-scale differences. The first two principal components (PCs) explained 45.62% of the total variance. The Control33 was separated from other groups by PC1 and PC2, and the NAA200 at the E-L 35 stage was also scattered by PC2 with a high negative score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This distribution pattern illustrated that a large alteration of transcriptomes occurred between the E-L 33 and E-L 35 stages. More importantly, at v&#x000e9;raison, the gene expression in the NAA-treated grape berries differed from those in the ABA-treated and control berries.</p><p>To illustrate the mechanisms underlying different ripening rates, four sets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including A1 (ABA1000 vs. Control33), A2 (ABA500 vs. Control33), C (Control35 vs. Control33), and N (NAA200 vs. Control33). There were 1,878, 1,060, 967 and 876 up-regulated genes and 864, 739, 590, and 579 down-regulated genes in the ABA1000, ABA500, Control35, and NAA200 berries, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The greatest number of DEGs was between ABA1000 and Control33, while the smallest number was between NAA200 and Control33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The comparison between Control35 and the three treated groups at E-L 35 showed that there were 728 and 243 genes up-regulated as well as 276 and 243 genes down-regulated with the ABA1000 and NAA200 treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). However, only five genes were up-regulated, and four genes were down-regulated in the ABA500-treatment, relative to Control35. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-plants-09-00630"><title>2.3. Genes Associated with Growth-To-Ripening Transition and Ripening Initiation</title><p>There were 597 common DEGs across the four sets of A1, A2, C, and N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). There were 380, 1,224, 152, and 139 genes that were only found in the sets of C, A1, A2, and N, respectively, and were named as C_only, A1_only, A2_only, and N_only. From the annotation of the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COG) database, the 597 commonly-expressed genes mainly belonged to the functional categories of &#x0201c;transcription&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;replication, recombination, and repair&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;carbohydrate transport and metabolism&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;amino acid transport and metabolism&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;signal transduction mechanisms&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f004">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that these processes were associated with the activation of grape berry ripening. Interestingly, the DEGs of A1_only exhibited a similar functional pattern with those commonly expressed genes, and most showed high expression levels. Whereas the DEGs of the N _only were related to the categories of &#x0201c;energy production and conversion&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones&#x0201d;. Small numbers of C_only and A2_only DEGs were annotated in various COG categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f004">Figure 4</xref>). </p><p>Berry softening, sugar accumulation, catabolism of acid, and increase in ABA content are important physiological changes during the inception of ripening. In the A1_only set, several genes encoding pectin esterase (PE) and polygalacturonase (PG), were significantly up-regulated (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00630">Table S1</xref>). In addition, beta-fructofuranosidase genes, reported to have a capacity for hydrolyzing sucrose [<xref rid="B25-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], were significantly up-regulated in ABA1000 grape berries. The ABA1000 grapes also exhibited an up-regulation of genes that were reported to encode for sugar transporters. While in the N_only, no known genes relating to berry softening and sugar transporters were found (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00630">Table S1</xref>). In the present study, one gene (VIT_203s0088g01190) in N_only, encoding for malate dehydrogenase (MDH), was up-regulated at the transcriptional level and may contribute to the significant decline of acidity in NAA200-treated berries at E-L 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, further comparisons of ABA1000 vs. Control35 and NAA200 vs. Control35 reflect the transcriptome differences at v&#x000e9;raison induced by ABA1000 and NAA200. The ABA1000-treated berries presented higher expression levels of some <italic>VviPE</italic>, <italic>VviPL</italic>, and beta-fructofuranosidase genes and VIT_218s0076g00250, encoding a sucrose transporter (SUC). In contrast, the expression of 3 <italic>VviPE</italic> (VIT_209s0002g00330, VIT_215s0048g00510, and VIT_217s0000g05960), 1 <italic>VviPG</italic> (VIT_208s0007g08330), and one gene encoding sucrose synthase (SUS) were down-regulated in the NAA200-treated berries, while 3 <italic>VviMDH</italic> exhibited higher expression levels. It was noticed that in the set of A1_only, most of the genes coding for these proteins showed significantly increased expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). By contrast, the gene for brassinosteroid-insensitive1 (BRI1) showed down-regulated expression. In the set of N_only, the genes encoding one auxin influx carrier protein (AUX1) and four auxin-responsive proteins (AUX/IAA) showed increased levels, and a few genes were found to be involved in hormone synthesis and signaling in A2_only and C_only. Hormonal regulation can also be found at the E-L 35 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). Besides the genes relating to the synthesis and signaling of ABA and SA, one gene of xyloglucan&#x02014;xyloglucosyl transferase (TCH4)&#x02014;also exhibited a very high transcript level in the ABA1000 grapes of E-L 35. By contrast, the genes relating to auxin signaling were markedly up-regulated by NAA200.</p><p>The present study indicates that even though grape berries all reached the v&#x000e9;raison stage with similar physiological phenotypes, the genes associated with each&#x02019;s ripening-related metabolism exhibited large differences in expression abundance between the treated and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-plants-09-00630"><title>2.4.

According to the VIP values of the variables (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00630">Table S2</xref>)&#x02014;the metabolites that had the greatest contribution to the model of discriminant development were the anthocyanins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f006">Figure 6</xref>A,B); for the model of ABA1000-specific discriminant they were hexanoic acid, vitispirane B, and linalool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f006">Figure 6</xref>C,D); for the model of ABA500-specific discriminant they were hexanoic acid, alpha-terpineol, and hexanal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f005">Figure 5</xref>E,F); for the model of the NAA200-specific discriminant they were (<italic>Z</italic>)-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-damascenone, total norisoprenpoids, TCH, and (<italic>E</italic>)-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-damascenone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f006">Figure 6</xref>G,H).

Similar to the results of OPLS-DA, all norisoprenoids exhibited a predominant treatment effect and were obviously increased in NAA200-treated berries (cluster 1). Terpenes and volatile C6/C9 compounds showed both developmental and treatment effects (cluster 2 and cluster 3); for example, the concentrations of 1-hexanol and (<italic>E</italic>)-3-hexen-1-ol in the berries of treatments and controls were increased from E-L 35 to E-L 36, and both of them showed lower levels in ABA1000-treated berries compared to the control at the E-L 36 stage. Similarly, terpenes such as nerol oxide, hotrienol, and linalool decreased during the ripening, and these terpenes were reduced by ABA1000 at the E-L 35 stage. All detected anthocyanins in cluster 4 were developmentally controlled.</p><p>An ANOVA analysis was to further highlight the impact of ABA and NAA on the accumulation of metabolites. A total of 15 anthocyanins were detected in the grapes, including nine 3&#x02032;5&#x02032;-substituted anthocyanins and six 3&#x02032;-substituted anthocyanins. There were similar concentrations of anthocyanins in all samples at E-L 35, whereas the NAA200-treated berries contained lower levels compared with t other groups at E-L 36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f008">Figure 8</xref>). There were 14 norisoprenoids, seven terpenes, and 13 volatile C6/C9 compounds detected in this study. The total norisoprenoid content was much higher in the NAA200 than the controls at both the E-L 35 and E-L 36 stages and was unchanged with ABA. Regarding volatile C6/C9 compounds, their production was significantly increased in ABA500-treated and NAA200-treated berries at E-L 35 stage, but no significant difference was found at E-L 36 stage. The total terpenes were significantly increased in the ABA1000 berries at E-L 36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f008">Figure 8</xref>).

We found, <italic>VviFLS</italic> in ABA1000 berries was significantly up-regulated to improve the conversion of dihydromyricetin into myricetin, which could, in turn, inhibit the production of the 3&#x02032;5&#x02032;-substituted anthocyanins. In the NAA200 grapes, the low concentration of anthocyanins should be related to the low abundance of <italic>VviUFGT</italic> transcripts. The majority of the genes involved in terpenoid metabolism showed high expression levels in ABA1000 and NAA200-treated berries, including the genes encoding 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) and terpene synthases (TPS) in clusters 1 and 3.

Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of ABA and NAA on Cabernet Sauvignon grape berries based on E-L stage with similar sugar levels, the purpose of which is to eliminate the possible influence of sugar or other developmental characteristics. Sugar can enhance anthocyanin accumulation and related gene expression in grape berries [<xref rid="B30-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and may impact the biosynthesis of other flavor compounds. We observed that the application of 500 mg/L ABA had insignificant effects on sugar increase and acid decline, and the ripening process of berries was similar to the control, suggesting that only very small amounts of exogenous ABA could penetrate into the berry due to the wax barrier on the peel and the rapid solution evaporation, and the amount may be not enough to modify the berry maturation progression. However, there are still a few differences in the concentration of individual compounds and the expression of some genes between ABA500 and the control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Similarly, Ferrara et al. observed that 400 mg/L ABA application has no effect on total soluble solids, pH, titratable acidity but can increase the anthocyanin concentration of the berry skin [<xref rid="B17-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The proportion of cyanidin-derived (3&#x02032;-substituted) anthocyanin metabolites was significantly increased in both ABA1000 and NAA200-treated grape berries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f009">Figure 9</xref>B). It appeared that the F3&#x02032;H branch, in contrast with the F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H branch, in the flavonoid metabolism, was more sensitive to exogenous ABA and NAA stimulation. The influence of the ABA1000 and NAA200 on the accumulation of anthocyanins in grape berries has been previously studied [<xref rid="B13-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B17-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B31-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but scarce attention was paid to the two branch pathways driven by F3&#x02032;H and F3&#x02032;5&#x02032;H. The final metabolites from these two pathway branches, 3&#x02032;-substituted and 3&#x02032;5&#x02032;-substituted anthocyanins possess different color expressions, and they jointly determine the overall color appearance of red grape berries and corresponding wine [<xref rid="B32-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The present results indicate that the skin color of grapes could shift from the purple-red to the red hue when the natural ripening speeds of grape berries are changed by exogenous ABA and NAA. Another important finding was that exogenous NAA markedly promoted the accumulation of norisoprenoids, with (<italic>Z</italic>)-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-damascenone and (<italic>E</italic>)-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-damascenone representing the major norisoprenoids. Although <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-damascenone was found to be significantly higher in wine made with NAA-treated berries [<xref rid="B18-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the reason has not been determined. In this study, we found that the NAA application markedly up-regulated the expression of <italic>VviCCD4a</italic> and <italic>VviCCD4b</italic> in cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f010">Figure 10</xref>), which are tightly associated with <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-damascenone and other C13-norisoprenoids accumulation [<xref rid="B29-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The upstream genes related to carotenoid and norisoprenoid biosynthesis such as <italic>VviDXS</italic>, <italic>VviGGPPS</italic>, <italic>VviLBCY</italic>, <italic>VviLECY,</italic> and <italic>VviZISO</italic> were also found to show a higher level in NAA-treated berries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f010">Figure 10</xref>). The up-regulated DEGs identified at E-L 35 in NAA-treated berries compared to Control35 were enriched in &#x0201c;photosynthesis&#x0201d; pathways (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00630">Table S4</xref>). The carotenoids, as the precursors of norisoprenoids, act as light-harvesting antenna pigments and play important roles in the photoprotection of the plant [<xref rid="B33-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It indicated that the NAA application might have a positive effect on photosynthesis and concurrently increase carotenoid levels. Therefore, the higher concentrations of norisoprenoids in NAA-treated berries could result from elevated substrate availability combined with the up-regulation of key genes (<italic>VviCCD4a</italic> and <italic>VviCCD4b</italic>). Although the concentrations of these quality-related compounds are shown to highly correlate with the expression of corresponding genes, this only partially explains that the increased compound concentration could result from the up-regulated expression of biosynthesis-related genes, because the levels of the compounds actually depend on both their synthesis and degradation. It is also important to assess the expression of genes in the degradation of metabolism. However, the knowledge about the genes involved in the degradation of anthocyanins and norisoprenoids is still very limited in grape berry, which needs more research to dissect the balance between the production and degradation of the flavor compounds induced by ABA and NAA in grape berry. Moreover, although gene expression analyses have offered insights into the mechanism underlying the responses of grape berries to ABA and NAA treatments, other regulations such as alternative splicing, protein levels, and enzyme activity also play roles in controlling the accumulation of metabolites. Therefore, a multi-omics integrated analysis in the future study, including transcriptome, proteome, and others, can help us understand the influences of ABA and NAA on quality-related metabolites in grape berry.</p><p>The genes responsible for varied growth-to-ripening transitions were found by transcriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00630">Table S1</xref>). The common genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00630-f003">Figure 3</xref>B should be physiologically involved in berry developmental transitions from E-L 33 to E-L 35, and the genes in the sets of C_only, A1_only, A2_only and N_only were speculated to determine the growth-to-ripening transition rate. Some of these genes have been reported to relate to ripening events like berry softening and sugar metabolism, but the roles of other genes that may trigger ripening were still uncovered. These DEG sets can be functionally verified in the future. Genes that were regulated by both ABA1000 and NAA200 at E-L 35 were identified (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00630">Table S5</xref>), for instance, 1 <italic>VviPG</italic> was up-regulated by ABA1000 while down-regulated by NAA200 and genes encoding ABA signaling protein PP2C, auxin-responsive protein, and auxin-induced protein were down-regulated by ABA1000 while up-regulated by NAA200. These genes seem to play vital roles in hormonal control and contribute to the various ripening timings. The different responses of the above-mentioned ABA and auxin signaling genes indicate that there is tight cross-talk between ABA and auxin in grape berry.</p><p>In this study, the authors only focused on the effects of ABA and NAA on the early ripening process of grape berries due to the importance of v&#x000e9;raison during berry development. However, the long-term effects of the two plant growth regulators on grape berries in combined transcriptomic and metabolic levels remain unclear, especially the volatile compounds when berries arrived at maturity (E-L 38). It has been reported that pre-v&#x000e9;raison ABA has a long-term effect (beyond 40 days after v&#x000e9;raison) on grape berries on the basis of the regulation of phenylpropanoid-related gene expression and metabolite content [<xref rid="B31-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

The methanol extract was evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream and re-dissolved in 10 mL of citrate-phosphate buffer solution (0.2 M, pH = 5.0) and added to 100 &#x000b5;L AR2000 (Rapidase, 100 g/L). Enzymatic hydrolysis was conducted in an incubator at 40 &#x000b0;C for 16 h. The released volatiles were extracted with HS-SPME. An Agilent 6890 gas chromatography coupled with an Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer were used to analyze the volatile compounds in the samples. An HP-INNOWAX capillary column (60 m &#x000d7; 0.25 mm &#x000d7; 0.25 &#x003bc;m, J&#x00026;W Scientific, Folsom, CA) were used. Volatile compounds in the samples were identified by comparing their retention time and mass spectrums with the available external standards. The volatiles, without reference standards were tentatively identified by comparing their retention indices and mass spectrums with the NIST11 database. Quantitation of these volatile compounds followed our previously published method [<xref rid="B49-plants-09-00630" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A synthetic matrix containing 200 g/L glucose and 7 g/L tartaric acid was adjusted to pH 3.3. The external standards were dissolved to the synthetic matrix in fifteen successive concentrations. The synthetic matrix was extracted using the same headspace solid-phase micro-extraction method and analyzed based on the same GC-MS conditions. The volatile compounds with available standards were quantified using their reference standards, whereas the volatiles without available standards were quantified using standards that had the same functional groups and similar numbers of carbon atoms.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot7-plants-09-00630"><title>4.7.
