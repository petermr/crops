In this study, ABA and synthetic auxin \u03b1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) were sprayed on Cabernet Sauvignon berries before v\u00e9raison, and comparative transcriptomic and metabolic analysis were conducted to investigate the influence on berry quality-related metabolites. The 1000 mg/L ABA (ABA1000) and 200 mg/L NAA (NAA200) treated grapes exhibited shorter and longer phenological intervals compared to the control, respectively. The transcriptomic comparison between pre-v\u00e9raison and v\u00e9raison revealed that the varied ripening initiation and duration significantly affected the expression of genes related to specific metabolism, particularly in the biosynthetic metabolism of anthocyanin and volatile compounds. The up-regulated VviF3'H in both ABA1000-treated and NAA200-treated berries increased the proportion of 3'-substituted anthocyanins, and the 3'5'-substituted anthocyanins were largely reduced in the NAA200-treated berries. Concurrently, VviCCD4a and VviCCD4b were up-regulated, and the norisoprenoids were correspondingly elevated in the NAA200-treated berries.
