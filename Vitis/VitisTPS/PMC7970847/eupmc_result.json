Previous studies have shown that hop yield and bitter acid content decline with increased temperatures and low-water stress. We looked at physiological traits and differential gene expression in leaf, stem, and root tissue from hop (Humulus lupulus) cv. USDA Cascade in plants exposed to high temperature stress, low-water stress, and a compound treatment of both high temperature and low-water stress for six weeks. The stress conditions imposed in these experiments caused substantial changes to the transcriptome, with significant reductions in the expression of numerous genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Of the genes involved in bitter acid production, the critical gene valerophenone synthase (VPS) experienced significant reductions in expression levels across stress treatments, suggesting stress-induced lability in this gene and/or its regulatory elements may be at least partially responsible for previously reported declines in bitter acid content. We also identified a number of transcripts with homology to genes shown to affect abiotic stress tolerance in other plants that may be useful as markers for breeding improved abiotic stress tolerance in hop.
