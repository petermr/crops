# Mining crop literature for genes and enzyme products (terpenes)

**1. This repository contain different folders named basing on crop name and so each of them contain excel file with TPS genes with information such as uniprot ID, uniprotkb ac/ID, Organism name, synonyms and corresponding TPS protein function etc.**

**2. DST-KARYA interns have created wikipages in this repository and have also uploaded their crop specific dictionaries into respective folder. Citrus, Malus and Oryza  dictionaries are not created.**

**3. This repository also contains files such as 
binomial abbreviation (for abbreviation of scientific name) and 
TPS_EC (for TPS enzyme commission number) dictionaries**

**4. "metadata analysis" folder created by Shweata Hegde and it contains README and metadata_analysis.py files.**

**5. "outreach" folder created by Shweata Hegde and it contains InCOB and Wikidata Conference presentations**
