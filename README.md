# Mining crop literature for genes and enzyme products (terpenes)

# Introduction
Among volatile organic compounds, plant terpenes account for a larger proportion and these terpenes are mainly synthesized by methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and mevalonic acid (MVA) pathways. Terpene synthase **(TPS)** enzymes from these 2 pathways play a crucial role in modifying one terpene to another. Here, we attempt to collect and classify all TPS genes that are available from genomics studies. EC numbers and Wikidata IDs were also collected for them.

## What does "Crops" repository contain

**1. This "Crops" repository contain different folders named basing on crop name. Each of them contain README.md and excel file with TPS gene's information such as uniprot ID, uniprotkb ac/ID, Organism name, synonyms and corresponding TPS protein function etc.** 

**2. DST-KARYA interns have also uploaded their crop specific dictionaries into respective folder.**

**3. DST-KARYA interns have created wikipages in this repository https://github.com/petermr/crops/wiki.**

**4. "TPS" folder created by Sagar Jadhav and it contains README and work on TPS enzyme collection.**

**5. "dictionaries" folder created by Sagar Jadhav and it contains README and xml dictionaries from 2020-2021.**

**6. "metadata analysis" folder created by Shweata Hegde and it contains README and metadata_analysis.py files.**

**7. "outreach" folder created by Shweata Hegde and contains InCOB and Wikidata Conference presentations**
