# Mining crop literature for genes and enzyme products (terpenes)

**1. This repository contain different folders named basing on crop name and so each of them contain excel file with TPS genes with information such as uniprot ID, uniprotkb ac/ID, Organism name, synonyms and corresponding TPS protein function etc.**

**2. DST-KARYA interns have created wikipages in this repository and have also uploaded their crop specific dictionaries into respective folder. Citrus, Malus and Oryza  dictionaries are not created.**

**3. "dictionaries" folder created by Sagar Jadhav and it contains README and xml dictionaries from 2020-2021.**

**4. "metadata analysis" folder created by Shweata Hegde and it contains README and metadata_analysis.py files.**

**5. This repository also contains following csv files:**

A) Sagar Jadhav ran metadata_analysis.py file and generated **TPS_sentences_full_search_result.csv**. Please also refer https://github.com/petermr/CEVOpen/wiki/Scoping-through-TPS-Corpus 

B) **TPS_EC** (for TPS enzyme commission number) csv file contain TPS enzyme names and EC number.

C) **wiki_binomial_abbreviation** (for abbreviation of scientific name) csv file contain Scientific names of essential oil plants, their wikidata IDs and abbreviations.

**6. "outreach" folder created by Shweata Hegde and contains InCOB and Wikidata Conference presentations**
